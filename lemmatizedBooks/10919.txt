in a principal degree to produce the present happy condition of the united state they will best explain the nature of we duty and shed much light on the policy which ought to be pursue in future from the commencement of we revolution to the present day almost forty year have elapse and from the establishment of this constitution twenty-eight through this whole term the government have be what may emphatically be call self-government and what have be the effect to whatever object we turn we attention whether it relate to we foreign or domestic concern we find abundant cause to felicitate ourselves in the excellence of we institution during a period fraught with difficulty and mark by very extraordinary event the united state have nourish beyond example they citizen individually have be happy and the nation prosperous under this constitution we commerce have be wisely regulate with foreign nation and between the state new state have be admit into we union we territory have be enlarged by fair and honorable treaty and with great advantage to the original state the state respectively protect by the national government under a mild parental system against foreign danger and enjoy within they separate sphere by a wise partition of power a just proportion of the sovereignty have improve they police extend they settlement and attain a strength and maturity which be the best proof of wholesome law well administer and if we look to the condition of individual what a proud spectacle do it exhibit on whom have oppression fall in any quarter of we union who have be deprive of any right of person or property who restrain from offer he vow in the mode which he prefer to the divine author of he be it be well know that all these blessing have be enjoy in they fullest extent and i add with peculiar satisfaction that there have be no example of a capital punishment be inflict on anyone for the crime of high treason some who might admit the competency of we government to these beneficent duty might doubt it in trial which put to the test its strength and efficiency as a member of the great community of nation here too experience have afford we the most satisfactory proof in its favor just as this constitution be put into action several of the principal state of europe have become much agitate and some of they seriously convulse destructive war ensue which have of late only be terminate in the course of these conflict the united state receive great injury from several of the party it be they interest to stand aloof from the contest to demand justice from the party commit the injury and to cultivate by a fair and honorable conduct the friendship of all war become at length inevitable and the result have show that we government be equal to that the greatest of trial under the most unfavorable circumstance of the virtue of the people and of the heroic exploit of the army the navy and the militia i need not speak such then be the happy government under which we live -- a government adequate to every purpose for which the social compact be form a government elective in all its branch under which every citizen may by he merit obtain the highest trust recognize by the constitution which contain within it no cause of discord none to put at variance one portion of the community with another a government which protect every citizen in the full enjoyment of he rights and be able to protect the nation against injustice from foreign power other consideration of the highest importance admonish we to cherish we union and to cling to the government which support it fortunate as we be in we political institution we have not be less so in other circumstance on which we prosperity and happiness essentially depend situate within the temperate zone and extend through many degree of latitude along the atlantic the united state enjoy all the variety of climate and every production incident to that portion of the globe penetrate internally to the great lake and beyond the source of the great river which communicate through we whole interior no country be ever happier with respect to its domain bless too with a fertile soil we produce have always be very abundant leave even in year the least favorable a surplus for the want of we fellow-man in other country such be we peculiar felicity that there be not a part of we union that be not particularly interested in preserve it the great agricultural interest of the nation prosper under its protection local interest be not less foster by it we fellow-citizen of the north engage in navigation find great encouragement in be make the favored carrier of the vast production of the other portion of the united state while the inhabitant of these be amply recompense in they turn by the nursery for seaman and naval force thus form and rear up for the support of we common rights we manufacture find a generous encouragement by the policy which patronize domestic industry and the surplus of we produce a steady and profitable market by local want in less-favored part at home such then be the highly favor condition of we country it be the interest of every citizen to maintain it what be the danger which menace we if any exist they ought to be ascertain and guard against in explain my sentiment on this subject it may be ask what raise we to the present happy state how do we accomplish the revolution how remedy the defect of the first instrument of we union by infuse into the national government sufficient power for national purpose without impair the just rights of the state or affect those of individual how sustain and pass with glory through the late war the government have be in the hand of the people to the people therefore and to the faithful and able depositary of they trust be the credit due have the people of the united state be educate in different principle have they be less intelligent less independent or less virtuous can it be believe that we should have maintain the same steady and consistent career or be bless with the same success while then the constituent body retain its present sound and healthful state everything will be safe they will choose competent and faithful representative for every department it be only when the people become ignorant and corrupt when they degenerate into a populace that they be incapable of exercise the sovereignty usurpation be then a easy attainment and a usurper soon find the people themselves become the willing instrument of they own debasement and ruin let we then look to the great cause and endeavor to preserve it in full force let we by all wise and constitutional measure promote intelligence among the people as the best means of preserve we liberty danger from abroad be not less deserving of attention experience the fortune of other nation the united state may be again involve in war and it may in that event be the object of the adverse party to overset we government to break we union and demolish we as a nation we distance from europe and the just moderate and pacific policy of we government may form some security against these danger but they ought to be anticipate and guard against many of we citizen be engage in commerce and navigation and all of they be in a certain degree dependent on they prosperous state many be engage in the fishery these interest be expose to invasion in the war between other power and we should disregard the faithful admonition of experience if we do not expect it we must support we rights or lose we character and with it perhaps we liberty a people who fail to do it can scarcely be say to hold a place among independent nation national honor be national property of the highest value the sentiment in the mind of every citizen be national strength it ought therefore to be cherish to secure we against these danger we coast and inland frontier should be fortify we army and navy regulate upon just principle as to the force of each be keep in perfect order and we militia be place on the best practicable footing to put we extensive coast in such a state of defense as to secure we city and interior from invasion will be attend with expense but the work when finish will be permanent and it be fair to presume that a single campaign of invasion by a naval force superior to we own aid by a few thousand land troops would expose we to greater expense without take into the estimate the loss of property and distress of we citizen than would be sufficient for this great work we land and naval force should be moderate but adequate to the necessary purpose -- the former to garrison and preserve we fortification and to meet the first invasion of a foreign foe and while constitute the element of a greater force to preserve the science as well as all the necessary implement of war in a state to be bring into activity in the event of war the latter retain within the limit proper in a state of peace might aid in maintain the neutrality of the united state with dignity in the war of other power and in save the property of they citizen from spoliation in time of war with the enlargement of which the great naval resource of the country render it susceptible and which should be duly foster in time of peace it would contribute essentially both as a auxiliary of defense and as a powerful engine of annoyance to diminish the calamity of war and to bring the war to a speedy and honorable termination but it ought always to be hold prominently in view that the safety of these state and of everything dear to a free people must depend in a eminent degree on the militia invasion may be make too formidable to be resist by any land and naval force which it would comport either with the principle of we government or the circumstance of the united state to maintain in such case recourse must be have to the great body of the people and in a manner to produce the best effect it be of the highest importance therefore that they be so organize and train as to be prepare for any emergency the arrangement should be such as to put at the command of the government the ardent patriotism and youthful vigor of the country if form on equal and just principle it can not be oppressive it be the crisis which make the pressure and not the law which provide a remedy for it this arrangement should be form too in time of peace to be the better prepare for war with such a organization of such a people the united state have nothing to dread from foreign invasion at its approach a overwhelming force of gallant man might always be put in motion other interest of high importance will claim attention among which the improvement of we country by road and canal proceed always with a constitutional sanction hold a distinguished place by thus facilitate the intercourse between the state we shall add much to the convenience and comfort of we fellow-citizen much to the ornament of the country and what be of greater importance we shall shorten distance and by make each part more accessible to and dependent on the other we shall bind the union more closely together nature have do so much for we by intersect the country with so many great river bay and lake approach from distant point so near to each other that the inducement to complete the work seem to be peculiarly strong a more interesting spectacle be perhaps never see than be exhibit within the limit of the united state -- a territory so vast and advantageously situate contain object so grand so useful so happily connect in all they part we manufacture will likewise require the systematic and foster care of the government possess as we do all the raw material the fruit of we own soil and industry we ought not to depend in the degree we have do on supplies from other country while we be thus dependent the sudden event of war unsought and unexpected can not fail to plunge we into the most serious difficulty it be important too that the capital which nourish we manufacture should be domestic as its influence in that case instead of exhausting as it may do in foreign hand would be feel advantageously on agriculture and every other branch of industry equally important be it to provide at home a market for we raw material as by extend the competition it will enhance the price and protect the cultivator against the casualty incident to foreign market with the indian tribe it be we duty to cultivate friendly relation and to act with kindness and liberality in all we transaction equally proper be it to persevere in we effort to extend to they the advantage of civilization the great amount of we revenue and the flourishing state of the treasury be a full proof of the competency of the national resource for any emergency as they be of the willingness of we fellow citizen to bear the burden which the public necessity require the vast amount of vacant land the value of which daily augment form a additional resource of great extent and duration these resource besides accomplish every other necessary purpose put it completely in the power of the united state to discharge the national debt at a early period peace be the best time for improvement and preparation of every kind it be in peace that we commerce flourish most that tax be most easily pay and that the revenue be most productive the executive be charge officially in the department under it with the disbursement of the public money and be responsible for the faithful application of it to the purpose for which it be raise the legislature be the watchful guardian over the public purse it be its duty to see that the disbursement have be honestly make to meet the requisite responsibility every facility should be afford to the executive to enable it to bring the public agent intrust with the public money strictly and promptly to account nothing should be presume against they but if with the requisite facility the public money be suffer to lie long and uselessly in they hand they will not be the only defaulter nor will the demoralizing effect be confine to they it will evince a relaxation and want of tone in the administration which will be feel by the whole community i shall do all i can to secure economy and fidelity in this important branch of the administration and i doubt not that the legislature will perform its duty with equal zeal a thorough examination should be regularly make and i will promote it it be particularly gratifying to I to enter on the discharge of these duty at a time when the united state be bless with peace it be a state most consistent with they prosperity and happiness it will be my sincere desire to preserve it so far as depend on the executive on just principle with all nation claim nothing unreasonable of any and render to each what be its due equally gratifying be it to witness the increase harmony of opinion which pervade we union discord do not belong to we system union be recommend as well by the free and benign principle of we government extend its blessing to every individual as by the other eminent advantage attend it the american people have encounter together great danger and sustained severe trial with success they constitute one great family with a common interest experience have enlighten we on some question of essential importance to the country the progress have be slow dictate by a just reflection and a faithful regard to every interest connect with it to promote this harmony in accord with the principle of we republican government and in a manner to give they the most complete effect and to advance in all other respects the best interest of we union will be the object of my constant and zealous exertion never do a government commence under auspices so favorable nor ever be success so complete if we look to the history of other nation ancient or modern we find no example of a growth so rapid so gigantic of a people so prosperous and happy in contemplate what we have still to perform the heart of every citizen must expand with joy when he reflect how near we government have approach to perfection that in respect to it we have no essential improvement to make that the great object be to preserve it in the essential principle and feature which characterize it and that that be to be do by preserve the virtue and enlighten the mind of the people and as a security against foreign danger to adopt such arrangement as be indispensable to the support of we independence we rights and liberty if we persevere in the career in which we have advance so far and in the path already trace we can not fail under the favor of a gracious providence to attain the high destiny which seem to await we in the administration of the illustrious man who have precede I in this high station with some of whom i have be connect by the closest tie from early life example be present which will always be find highly instructive and useful to they successor from these i shall endeavor to derive all the advantage which they may afford of my immediate predecessor under whom so important a portion of this great and successful experiment have be make i shall be pardon for express my earnest wish that he may long enjoy in he retirement the affection of a grateful country the best reward of exalted talent and the most faithful and meritorious service rely on the aid to be derive from the other department of the government i enter on the trust to which i have be call by the suffrage of my fellow citizen with my fervent prayer to the almighty that he will be graciously pleased to continue to we that protection which he have already so conspicuously display in we favor march 4 1817 proclamation -lrb- from nile

numerous and highly important it be we duty to unite in grateful acknowledgment to that omnipotent be from whom they be derive and in unceasing prayer that he will endow we with virtue and strength to maintain and hand they down in they utmost purity to we latest posterity i have the satisfaction to inform you that a arrangement which have be commence by my predecessor with the british government for the reduction of the naval force by great britain and the united state on the lake have be conclude by which it be provide that neither party shall keep in service on lake champlain more than one vessel on lake ontario more than one and on lake erie and the upper lake more than two to be arm each with one cannon only and that all the other armed vessel of both party of which a exact list be

amicably discuss between the two government and it appear that the british government be unwilling to depart from its present regulation it remain for congress to decide whether they will make any other regulation in consequence thereof for the protection and improvement of we navigation the negotiation with spain for spoliation on we commerce and the settlement of boundary remain essentially in the state it hold by the communication that be make to congress by my predecessor it have be evidently the policy of the spanish government to keep the negotiation suspend and in this the unite state have acquiesce from a amicable disposition toward spain and in the expectation that she government would from a sense of justice finally accede to such a arrangement as would be equal between the party a disposition have be lately show by the spanish government to move in the negotiation which have be meet by this government and should the conciliatory and friendly policy which have invariably guide we council be reciprocate a just and satisfactory arrangement maybe expect it be proper however to remark that no proposition have yet be make from which such a result can be presume it be anticipate at a early stage that the contest between spain and the colony would become highly interesting to the united state it be natural that we citizen should sympathize in event which affect they neighbor it seem probable also that the prosecution of the conflict along we coast and in contiguous country would occasionally interrupt we commerce and otherwise affect the person and property of we citizen these anticipation have be realize such injury have be receive from person act under authority of both the party and for which redress have in most instance be withhold through every stage of the conflict the united state have maintain a impartial neutrality give aid to neither of the party in man money ship or munitions of war they have regard the contest not in the light of a ordinary insurrection or rebellion but as a civil war between party nearly equal have as to neutral power equal rights we port have be open to both and every article the fruit of we soil or of the industry of we citizen which either be permit to take have be equally free to the other should the colony establish they independence it be proper now to state that this government neither seek nor would accept from they any advantage in commerce or otherwise which will not be equally open to all other nation the colony will in that event become independent state free from any obligation to or connection with we which it may not then be they interest to form on the basis of a fair reciprocity in the summer of the present year a expedition be set on foot against east florida by person claim to act under the authority of some of the colony who take possession of amelium island at the mouth of the st mary river near the boundary of the state of georgium as this province lie eastward of the mississippus and be bound by the united state and the ocean on every side and have be a subject of negotiation with the government of spain as a indemnity for loss by spoliation or in exchange for territory of equal value westward of the mississippus a fact well know to the world it excite surprise that any countenance should be give to this measure by any of the colony as it would be difficult to reconcile it with the friendly relation exist between the united state and the colony a doubt be entertain whether it have be authorize by they or any of they this doubt have gain strength by the circumstance which have unfold themselves in the prosecution of the enterprise which have mark it as a mere private unauthorized adventure project and commence with a incompetent force reliance seem to have be place on what might be draw in defiance of we law from within we limit and of late as they resource have fail it have assume a more marked character of unfriendliness to we the island be make a channel for the illicit introduction of slave from africa into the united state a asylum for fugitive slave from the neighboring state and a port for smuggling of every kind a similar establishment be make at a earlier period by person of the same description in the gulf of mexico at a place call galvezton within the limit of the united state as we contend under the cession of louisiana this enterprise have be mark in a more signal manner by all the objectionable circumstance which characterize the other and more particularly by the equipment of privateer which have annoy we commerce and by smuggling these establishment if ever sanction by any authority whatever which be not believe have abuse they trust and forfeit all claim to consideration a just regard for the rights and interest of the united state require that they should be suppress and order have be accordingly issue to that effect the imperious consideration which produce this measure will be explain to the party whom it may in any degree concern to obtain correct information on every subject in which the united state be interested to inspire just sentiment in all person in authority on either side of we friendly disposition so far as it may comport with a impartial neutrality and to secure proper respect to we commerce in every port and from every flag it have be think proper to send a ship of war with three distinguish citizen along the southern coast with instruction to touch at such port as they may find most expedient for these purpose with the exist authority with those in the possession of and exercise the sovereignty must the communication be hold from they alone can redress for past injury commit by person act under they be obtain by they alone can the commission of the like in future be prevent we relation with the other power of europe have experience no essential change since the last session in we intercourse with each due attention continue to be pay to the protection of we commerce and to every other object in which the united state be interested a strong hope be entertain that by adhering to the maxim of a just a candid and friendly policy we may long preserve amicable relation with all the power of europe on condition advantageous and honorable to we country with the barbary state and the indian tribe we pacific relation have be preserve in call you attention to the internal concern of we country the view which they exhibit be peculiarly gratify the payment which have be make into the treasury show the very productive state of the public revenue after satisfy the appropriation make by law for the support of the civil government and of the military and naval establishment embrace suitable provision for fortification and for the gradual increase of the navy pay the interest of the public debt and extinguish more than eighteen million of the principal within the present year it be estimate that a balance of more than $ 6000000 will remain in the treasury on the 1st day of January applicable to the current service of the ensue year the payment into the treasury during the year 1818 on account of impost and tonnage result principally from duty which have accrue in the present year may be fairly estimate at $ 20000000 the internal revenue at $ 2500000 the public land at $ 1500000 bank dividend and incidental receipt at $ 500000 make in the whole $ 24500000 the annual permanent expenditure for the support of the civil government and of the army and navy as now establish by law amount to $ 11800000 and for the sink fund to $ 10000000 make in the whole $ 21800000 leave a annual excess of revenue beyond the expenditure of $ 2700000 exclusive of the balance estimate to be in the treasury on the 1st day of January 1818 in the present state of the treasury the whole of the louisiana debt maybe redeem in the year 1819 after which if the public debt continue as it now be above par there will be annually about five million of the sink fund unexpended until the year 1825 when the loan of 1812 and the stock create by fund treasury note will be redeemable it be also estimate that the mississippus stock will be discharge during the year 1819 from the proceeds of the public land assign to that object after which the receipt from those land will annually add to the public revenue the sum of one million and a half make the permanent annual revenue amount to $ 26000000 and leave a annual excess of revenue after the year 1819 beyond the permanent authorized expenditure of more than $ 4000000 by the last return to the department of war the militia force of the several state may be estimate at 800000 man -- infantry artillery and cavalry great part of this force be arm and measure be take to arm the whole a improvement in the organization and discipline of the militia be one of the great object which claim the unremitted attention of congress the regular force amount nearly to the number require by law and be station along the atlantic and inland frontier of the naval force it have be necessary to maintain strong squadron in the mediterranean and in the gulf of mexico from several of the indian tribe inhabit the country border on lake erie purchase have be make of land on condition very favorable to the united state and as it be presume not less so to the tribe themselves by these purchase the indian title with moderate reservation have be extinguish to the whole of the land within the limit of the state of ohio and to a part of that in the michigan territory and of the state of indiana from the cherokee tribe a tract have be purchase in the state of georgium and a arrangement make by which in exchange for land beyond the mississippus a great part if not the whole of the land belong to that tribe eastward of that river in the state of north carolina georgium and tennessee and in the alabama territory will soon be acquire by these acquisition and other that may reasonably be expect soon to follow we shall be enable to extend we settlement from the inhabit part of the state of ohio along lake erie into the michigan territory and to connect we settlement by degree through the state of indiana and the illinois territory to that of missourus a similar and equally advantageous effect will soon be produce to the south through the whole extent of the state and territory which border on the water empty into the mississippus and the mobile in this progress which the rights of nature demand and nothing can prevent mark a growth rapid and gigantic it be we duty to make new effort for the preservation improvement and civilization of the native inhabitant the hunter state can exist only in the vast uncultivated desert it yield to the more dense and compact form and greater force of civilized population and of right it ought to yield for the earth be give to mankind to support the greatest number of which it be capable and no tribe or people have a right to withhold from the want of other more than be necessary for they own support and comfort it be gratify to know that the reservation of land make by the treaty with the tribe on lake erie be make with a view to individual ownership among they and to the cultivation of the soil by all and that a annual stipend have be pledge to supply they other want it will merit the consideration of congress whether other provision not stipulate by treaty ought to be make for these tribe and for the advancement of the liberal and humane policy of the united state toward all the tribe within we limit and more particularly for they improvement in the art of civilized life among the advantage incident to these purchase and to those which have precede the security which may thereby be afford to we inland frontier be peculiarly important with a strong barrier consist of we own people thus plant on the lake the mississippus and the mobile with the protection to be derive from the regular force indian hostility if they do not altogether cease will henceforth lose they terror fortification in those quarter to any extent will not be necessary and the expense attend they may be save a people accustom to the use of firearm only as the indian tribe be will shun even moderate work which be defend by cannon great fortification will therefore be requisite only in future along the coast and at some point in the interior connect with it on these will the safety of we town and the commerce of we great river from the bay of fundy to the mississippus depend on these therefore should the utmost attention skill and labor be bestow a considerable and rapid augmentation in the value of all the public land proceed from these and other obvious cause may henceforward be expect the difficulty attend early emigration will be dissipate even in the most remote part several new state have be admit into we union to the west and south and territorial government happily organize establish over every other portion in which there be vacant land for sale in terminate indian hostility as must soon be do in a formidable shape at least the emigration which have heretofore be great will probably increase and the demand for land and the augmentation in its value be in like proportion the great increase of we population throughout the union will alone produce a important effect and in no quarter will it be so sensibly feel as in those in contemplation the public land be a public stock which ought to be dispose of to the best advantage for the nation the nation should therefore derive the profit proceeding from the continual rise in they value every encouragement should be give to the emigrant consistent with a fair competition between they but that competition should operate in the first sale to the advantage of the nation rather than of individual great capitalist will derive all the benefit incident to they superior wealth under any mode of sale which may be adopt but if look forward to the rise in the value of the public land they should have the opportunity of amass at a low price vast body in they hand the profit will accrue to they and not to the public they would also have the power in that degree to control the emigration and settlement in such a manner as they opinion of they respective interest might dictate i submit this subject to the consideration of congress that such further provision may be make in the sale of the public land with a view to the public interest should any be deem expedient as in they judgment may be best adapt to the object when we consider the vast extent of territory within the united state the great amount and value of its production the connection of its part and other circumstance on which they prosperity and happiness depend we can not fail to entertain a high sense of the advantage to be derive from the facility which may be afford in the intercourse between they by means of good road and canal never do a country of such vast extent offer equal inducement to improvement of this kind nor ever be consequence of such magnitude involve in they as this subject be act on by congress at the last session and there may be a disposition to revive it at the present i have bring it into view for the purpose of communicate my sentiment on a very important circumstance connect with it with that freedom and candor which a regard for the public interest and a proper respect for congress require a difference of opinion have exist from the first formation of we constitution to the present time among we most enlighten and virtuous citizen respect the right of congress to establish such a system of improvement take into view the trust with which i be now honor it would be improper after what have pass that this discussion should be revive with a uncertainty of my opinion respect the right disregard early impression i have bestow on the subject all the deliberation which its great importance and a just sense of my duty require and the result be a settle conviction in my mind that congress do not possess the right it be not contain in any of the specify power grant to congress nor can i consider it incidental to or a necessary means view on the most liberal scale for carry into effect any of the power which be specifically grant in communicate this result i can not resist the obligation which i feel to suggest to congress the propriety of recommend to the state the adoption of a amendment to the constitution which shall give to congress the right in question in case of doubtful construction especially of such vital interest it comport with the nature and origin of we institution and will contribute much to preserve they to apply to we constituent for a explicit grant of the power we may confidently rely that if it appear to they satisfaction that the power be necessary it will always be grant in this case i be happy to observe that experience have afford the most ample proof of its utility and that the benign spirit of conciliation and harmony which now manifest itself throughout we union promise to such a recommendation the most prompt and favorable result i think proper to suggest also in case this measure be adopt that it be recommend to the state to include in the amendment seek a right in congress to institute likewise seminary of learn for the all-important purpose of diffuse knowledge among we fellow-citizen throughout the united state we manufactory will require the continued attention of congress the capital employ in they be considerable and the knowledge acquire in the machinery and fabric of all the most useful manufacture be of great value they preservation which depend on due encouragement be connect with the high interest of the nation although the progress of the public building have be as favorable as circumstance have permit it be to be regret that the capitol be not yet in a state to receive you there be good cause to presume that the two wing the only part as yet commence will be prepare for that purpose at the next session the time seem now to have arrive when this subject may be deem worthy the attention of congress on a scale adequate to national purpose the completion of the middle building will be necessary to the convenient accommodation of congress of the committee and various office belong to it it be evident that the other public building be altogether insufficient for the accommodation of the several executive department some of whom be much crowded and even subject to the necessity of obtain it in private building at some distance from the head of the department and with inconvenience to the management of the public business most nation have take a interest and a pride in the improvement and ornament of they metropolis and none be more conspicuous in that respect than the ancient republic the policy which dictate the establishment of a permanent residence for the national government and the spirit in which it be commence and have be prosecute show that such improvement be think worthy the attention of this nation its central position between the northern and southern extreme of we union and its approach to the west at the head of a great navigable river which interlock with the western water prove the wisdom of the council which establish it nothing appear to be more reasonable and proper than that convenient accommodation should be provide on a well-digested plan for the head of the several department and for the attorney-general and it be believe that the public ground in the city apply to these object will be find amply sufficient i submit this subject to the consideration of congress that such further provision may be make in it as to they may seem proper in contemplate the happy situation of the united state we attention be draw with peculiar interest to the survive officer and soldier of we revolutionary army who so eminently contribute by they service to lay its foundation most of those very meritorious citizen have pay the debt of nature and go to repose it be believe that among the survivor there be some not provide for by exist law who be reduce to indigence and even to real distress these man have a claim on the gratitude of they country and it will do honor to they country to provide for they the lapse of a few year more and the opportunity will be forever lose indeed so long already have be the interval that the number to be benefit by any provision which may be make will not be great it appear in a satisfactory manner that the revenue arise from impost and tonnage and from the sale of the public land will be fully adequate to the support of the civil government of the present military and naval establishment include the annual augmentation of the latter to the extent provide for to the payment of the interest of the public debt and to the extinguishment of it at the time authorize without the aid of the internal tax i consider it my duty to recommend to congress they repeal to impose tax when the public exigency require they be a obligation of the most sacred character especially with a free people the faithful fulfillment of it be among the highest proof of they virtue and capacity for self-government to dispense with tax when it may be do with perfect safety be equally the duty of they representative in this instance we have the satisfaction to know that they be impose when the demand be imperious and have be sustain with exemplary fidelity i have to add that however gratify it may be to I regard the prosperous and happy condition of we country to recommend the repeal of these tax at this time i shall nevertheless be attentive to event and should any future emergency occur be not less prompt to suggest such measure and burden as may then be requisite and proper jame monroe December 2 1817 special message _ to the senate of the united state _ : i submit to the senate for they consideration

foreign power be to be change it must be do by the constitute authority who alone act on a high responsibility be competent to the purpose and until such change be thus make that we fellow-citizen

and little afterwards procure owe to the inadequacy of the appropriation it have become necessary to provide almost every article requisite for such a establishment whence the sum to be expend will be much greater than at any former period the furniture in its kind and extent be think to be a object not less deserving attention than the building for which it be intend both be national object each seem to have a equal claim to legislative sanction the disbursement of the public money too ought it be presume to be in like manner provide for by law the person who may happen to be place by the

of the article be of a durable nature may be hand down through a long series of service and being of great value such as plate ought not to be leave altogether and at all time to the care of servant

circumstance under which you will commence the duty of the present session will lighten the burden inseparable from the high trust commit to you the fruit of the earth have be unusually abundant commerce have flourish the revenue have exceed the most favorable anticipation and peace and amity be preserve with foreign nation on condition just and honorable to we country for these inestimable blessing we can not but be grateful to that providence which watch over the destiny of nation as the term limit for the operation of the commercial convention with great britain will expire early in the month of July next and it be deem important that there should be no interval during which that portion of we commerce which be provide for by that convention should not be regulate either by arrangement between the two government or by the authority of congress the minister of the united state at london be instruct early in the last summer to invite the attention of the british government to the subject with a view to that object he be instruct to propose also that the negotiation which it be wish to open might extend to the general commerce of the two country and to every other interest and unsettled difference between they particularly those relate to impressment the fishery and boundary in the hope that a arrangement might be make on principle of reciprocal advantage which might comprehend and provide in a satisfactory manner for all these high concern i have the satisfaction to state that the proposal be receive by the british government in the spirit which prompt it and that a negotiation have be open at london embrace all these object on full consideration of the great extent and magnitude of the trust it be think proper to commit it to not less than two of we distinguished citizen and in consequence the envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary of the united state at paris have be associate with we envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary at london to both of whom correspond instruction have be give and they be now engage in the discharge of its duty it be proper to add that to prevent any inconvenience result from the delay incident to a negotiation on so many important subject it be agree before enter on it that the exist convention should be continue for a term not less than eight year we relation with spain remain nearly in the state in which they be at the close of the last session the convention of 1802 provide for the adjustment of a certain portion of the claim of we citizen for injury sustain by spoliation and so long suspend by the spanish government have at length be ratify by it but no arrangement have yet be make for the payment of another portion of like claim not less extensive or well found or for other class of claim or for the settlement of boundary these subject have again be bring under consideration in both country but no agreement have be enter into respect they in the meantime event have occur which clearly prove the ill effect of the policy which that government have so long pursue on the friendly relation of the two country which it be presume be at least of as much importance to spain as to the united state to maintain a state of thing have exist in the florida the tendency of which have be obvious to all who have pay the slightest attention to the progress of affair in that quarter throughout the whole of those province to which the spanish title extend the government of spain have scarcely be feel its authority have be confine almost exclusively to the wall of pensacolum and st augustine within which only small garrison have be maintain adventurer from every country fugitive from justice and abscond slave have find a asylum there several tribe of indian strong in the number of they warrior remarkable for they ferocity and whose settlement extend to we limit inhabit those province these different horde of people connect together disregard on the one side the authority of spain and protect on the other by a imaginary line which separate florida from the united state have violate we law prohibit the introduction of slave have practice various fraud on we revenue and commit every kind of outrage on we peaceable citizen which they proximity to we enable they to perpetrate the invasion of amelium island last year by a small band of adventurer not exceed 150 in number who wrest it from the inconsiderable spanish force station there and hold it several month during which a single feeble effort only be make to recover it which fail clearly prove how completely extinct the spanish authority have become as the conduct of those adventurer while in possession of the island as distinctly show the pernicious purpose for which they combination have be form this country have in fact become the theater of every species of lawless adventure with little population of its own the spanish authority almost extinct and the colonial government in a state of revolution have no pretension to it and sufficiently employ in they own concern it be in a great measure derelict and the object of cupidity to every adventurer a system of buccaneer be rapidly organize over it which menace in its consequence the lawful commerce of every nation and particularly of the united state while it present a temptation to every people on whose seduction its success principally depend in regard to the united state the pernicious effect of this unlawful combination be not confine to the ocean the indian tribe have constitute the effective force in florida with these tribe these adventurer have form at a early period a connection with a view to avail themselves of that force to promote they own project of accumulation and aggrandizement it be to the interference of some of these adventurer in misrepresent the claim and title of the indian to land and in practice on they savage propensity that the seminole war be principally to be trace man who thus connect themselves with savage community and stimulate they to war which be always attend on they part with act of barbarity the most shocking deserve to be view in a worse light than the savage they would certainly have no claim to a immunity from the punishment which accord to the rule of warfare practice by the savage might justly be inflict on the savage themselves if the embarrassment of spain prevent she from make a indemnity to we citizen for so long a time from she treasury for they loss by spoliation and otherwise it be always in she power to have provide it by the cession of this territory of this she government have be repeatedly apprise and the cession be the more to have be anticipate as spain must have know that in cede it she would in effect cede what have become of little value to she and would likewise relieve herself from the important obligation secure by the treaty of 1795 and all other compromitment respect it if the united state from consideration of these embarrassment decline press they claim in a spirit of hostility the motive ought at least to have be duly appreciate by the government of spain it be well know to she government that other power have make to the united state a indemnity for like loss sustain by they citizen at the same epoch there be nevertheless a limit beyond which this spirit of amity and forbearance can in no instance be justify if it be proper to rely on amicable negotiation for a indemnity for loss it would not have be so to have permit the inability of spain to fulfill she engagement and to sustain she authority in the florida to be pervert by foreign adventurer and savage to purpose so destructive to the life of we fellow-citizen and the highest interest of the united state the right of self-defense never cease it be among the most sacred and alike necessary to nation and to individual and whether the attack be make by spain herself or by those who abuse she power its obligation be not the less strong the invader of amelium island have assume a popular and respected title under which they might approach and wind we as they object be distinctly see and the duty impose on the executive by a exist law be profoundly feel that mask be not permit to protect they it be think incumbent on the united state to suppress the establishment and it be accordingly do the combination in florida for the unlawful purpose state the act perpetrate by that combination and above all the incitement of the indian to massacre we fellow-citizen of every age and of both sex merit a like treatment and receive it in pursue these savage to a imaginary line in the wood it would have be the height of folly to have suffer that line to protect they have that be do the war could never cease even if the territory have be exclusively that of spain and she power complete over it we have a right by the law of nation to follow the enemy on it and to subdue he there but the territory belong in a certain sense at least to the savage enemy who inhabit it the power of spain have cease to exist over it and protection be seek under she title by those who have commit on we citizen hostility which she be bind by treaty to have prevent but have not the power to prevent to have stop at that line would have give new encouragement to these savage and new vigor to the whole combination exist there in the prosecution of all its pernicious purpose in suppress the establishment at amelia island no unfriendliness be manifest toward spain because the post be take from a force which have wrest it from she the measure it be true be not adopt in concert with the spanish government or those in authority under it because in transaction connect with the war in which spain and the colony be engage it be think proper in do justice to the united state to maintain a strict impartiality toward both the belligerent party without consult or act in concert with either it give I pleasure to state that the government of bueno ayre and venezuelum whose name be assume have explicitly disclaim all participation in those measure and even the knowledge of they until communicate by this government and have also express they satisfaction that a course of proceedings have be suppress which if justly imputable to they would dishonor they cause in authorize major-general jackson to enter florida in pursuit of the seminole care be take not to encroach on the rights of spain i regret to have to add that in execute this order fact be disclose respect the conduct of the officer of spain in authority there in encourage the war furnish munitions of war and other supplies to carry it on and in other act not less marked which evince they participation in the hostile purpose of that combination and justify the confidence with which it inspire the savage that by those officer they would be protect a conduct so incompatible with the friendly relation exist between the two country particularly with the positive obligation of the fifth article of the treaty of 1795 by which spain be bind to restrain even by force those savage from act of hostility against the united state could not fail to excite surprise the commanding general be convince that he should fail in he object that he should in effect accomplish nothing if he do not deprive those savage of the resource on which they have calculate and of the protection on which they have rely in make the war as all the document relate to this occurrence will be lay before congress it be not necessary to enter into further detail respect it although the reason which induce major-general jackson to take these post be duly appreciate there be nevertheless no hesitation in decide on the course which it become the government to pursue as there be reason to believe that the commander of these post have violate they instruction there be no disposition to impute to they government a conduct so unprovoked and hostile a order be in consequence issue to the general in command there to deliver the post -- pensacolum unconditionally to any person duly authorize to receive it and st mark which be in the heart of the indian country on the arrival of a competent force to defend it against those savage and they associate in enter florida to suppress this combination no idea be entertain of hostility to spain and however justifiable the commanding general be in consequence of the misconduct of the spanish officer in enter st mark and pensacolum to terminate it by prove to the savage and they associate that they should not be protect even there yet the amicable relation exist between the united state and spain could not be alter by that act alone by order the restitution of the post those relation be preserve to a change of they the power of the executive be deem incompetent it be vest in congress only by this measure so promptly take due respect be show to the government of spain the misconduct of she officer have not be imputed to she she be enable to review with candor she relation with the united state and she own situation particularly in respect to the territory in question with the danger inseparable from it and regard the loss we have sustain for which indemnity have be so long withhold and the injury we have suffer through that territory and she means of redress she be likewise enable to take with honor the course best calculate to do justice to the united state and to promote she own welfare copy of the instruction to the commanding general of he correspondence with the secretary of war explain he motive and justify he conduct with a copy of the proceedings of the courts-martial in the trial of arbuthnot and ambristie and of the correspondence between the secretary of state and the minister plenipotentiary of spain near this government and of the minister plenipotentiary of the united state at madrid with the government of spain will be lay before congress the civil war which have so long prevail between spain and the province in south america still continue without any prospect of its speedy termination the information respect the condition of those country which have be collect by the commissioner recently return from thence will be lay before congress in copy of they report with such other information as have be receive from other agent of the united state it appear from these communication that the government at bueno ayre declare itself independent in July 1816 have previously exercise the power of a independent government though in the name of the king of spain from the year 1810 that the banda oriental entre rio and paraguay with the city of santa fee all of which be also independent be unconnected with the present government of bueno ayre that chili have declare itself independent and be closely connect with bueno ayre that venezuelum have also declare itself independent and now maintain the conflict with various success and that the remain part of south america except monte video and such other portion of the eastern bank of the la plata as be hold by portugal be still in the possession of spain or in a certain degree under she influence by a circular note address by the minister of spain to the ally power with whom they be respectively accredit it appear that the ally have undertake to mediate between spain and the south american province and that the manner and extent of they interposition would be settle by a congress which be to have meet at aix-la-chapelle in September last from the general policy and course of proceeding observe by the ally power in regard to this contest it be infer that they will confine they interposition to the expression of they sentiment abstain from the application of force i state this impression that force will not be apply with the greater satisfaction because it be a course more consistent with justice and likewise authorize a hope that the calamity of the war will be confine to the party only and will be of shorter duration from the view take of this subject found on all the information that we have be able to obtain there be good cause to be satisfy with the course heretofore pursue by the united state in regard to this contest and to conclude that it be proper to adhere to it especially in the present state of affair i have great satisfaction in state that we relation with france russium and other power continue on the most friendly basis in we domestic concern we have ample cause of satisfaction the receipt into the treasury during the three first quarter of the year have exceed $ 17000000 after satisfy all the demand which have be make under exist appropriation include the final extinction of the old 6 per cent stock and the redemption of a moiety of the louisiana debt it be estimate that there will remain in the treasury on the 1st day of January next more than $ 2000000 it be ascertain that the gross revenue which have accrue from the custom during the same period amount to $ 21000000 and that the revenue of the whole year may be estimate at not less than $ 26000000 the sale of the public land during the year have also greatly exceed both in quantity and price that of any former year and there be just reason to expect a progressive improvement in that source of revenue it be gratify to know that although the annual expenditure have be increase by the act of the last session of congress provide for revolutionary pension to a amount about equal to the proceeds of the internal duty which be then repeal the revenue for the ensue year will be proportionally augmented and that whilst the public expenditure will probably remain stationary each successive year will add to the national resource by the ordinary increase of we population and by the gradual development of we latent source of national prosperity the strict execution of the revenue law result principally from the salutary provision of the act of the 20th of April last amend the several collection law have it be presume secure to domestic manufacture all the relief that can be derive from the duty which have be impose upon foreign merchandise for they protection under the influence of this relief several branch of this important national interest have assume greater activity and although it be hope that other will gradually revive and ultimately triumph over every obstacle yet the expediency of grant further protection be submit to you consideration the measure of defense authorize by exist law have be pursue with the zeal and activity due to so important a object and with all the dispatch practicable in so extensive and great a undertake the survey of we maritime and inland frontier have be continue and at the point where it be decide to erect fortification the work have be commence and in some instance considerable progress have be make in compliance with resolution of the last session the board of commissioner be direct to examine in a particular manner the part of the coast therein designate and to report they opinion of the most suitable site for two naval depot this work be in a train of execution the opinion of the board on this subject with a plan of all the work necessary to a general system of defense so far as it have be form will be lay before congress in a report from the proper department as soon as it can be prepare in conformity with the appropriation of the last session treaty have be form with the quapaw tribe of indian inhabit the country on the arkansaw and with the great and little osage north of the white river with the tribe in the state of indiana with the several tribe within the state of ohio and the michigan territory and with the chickasaw by which very extensive cession of territory have be make to the united state negotiation be now depend with the tribe in the illinois territory and with the choctaw by which it be expect that other extensive cession will be make i take great interest in state that the cession already make which be consider so important to the united state have be obtain on condition very satisfactory to the indian with a view to the security of we inland frontier it have be think expedient to establish strong post at the mouth of yellow stone river and at the mandan village on the missourus and at the mouth of st peter on the mississippus at no great distance from we northern boundary it can hardly be presume while such post be maintain in the rear of the indian tribe that they will venture to attack we peaceable inhabitant a strong hope be entertain that this measure will likewise be productive of much good to the tribe themselves especially in promote the great object of they civilization experience have clearly demonstrate that independent savage community can not long exist within the limit of a civilized population the progress of the latter have almost invariably terminate in the extinction of the former especially of the tribe belong to we portion of this hemisphere among whom loftiness of sentiment and gallantry in action have be conspicuous to civilize they and even to prevent they extinction it seem to be indispensable that they independence as community should cease and that the control of the united state over they should be complete and undispute the hunter state will then be more easily abandon and recourse will be have to the acquisition and culture of land and to other pursuit tend to dissolve the tie which connect they together as a savage community and to give a new character to every individual i present this subject to the consideration of congress on the presumption that it may be find expedient and practicable to adopt some benevolent provision have these object in view relative to the tribe within we settlement it have be necessary during the present year to maintain a strong naval force in the mediterranean and in the gulf of mexico and to send some public ship along the southern coast and to the pacific ocean by these means amicable relation with the barbary power have be preserve we commerce have be protect and we rights respect the augmentation of we navy be advance with a steady progress toward the limit contemplate by law i communicate with great satisfaction the accession of another state -lrb- illinoi -rrb- to we union because i perceive from the proof afford by the addition already make the regular progress and sure consummation of a policy of which history afford no example and of which the good effect can not be too highly estimate by extend we government on the principle of we constitution over the vast territory within we limit on the lake and the mississippus and its numerous stream new life and vigor be infuse into every part of we system by increase the number of the state the confidence of the state government in they own security be increase and they jealousy of the national government proportionally diminish the impracticability of one consolidated government for this great and grow nation will be more apparent and will be universally admit incapable of exercise local authority except for general purpose the general government will no longer be dread in those case of a local nature and for all the great purpose for which it be institute its authority will be cherish each government will acquire new force and a greater freedom of action within its proper sphere other inestimable advantage will follow we produce will be augmented to a incalculable amount in article of the greatest value for domestic use and foreign commerce we navigation will in like degree be increase and as the shipping of the atlantic state will be employ in the transportation of the vast produce of the western country even those part of the united state which be most remote from each other will be further bind together by the strongest tie which mutual interest can create the situation of this district it be think require the attention of congress by the constitution the power of legislation be exclusively vest in the congress of the united state in the exercise of this power in which the people have no participation congress legislate in all case directly on the local concern of the district as this be a departure for a special purpose from the general principle of we system it may merit consideration whether a arrangement better adapt to the

great weight urge the cession of this territory by spain it be surround by the territory of the united state on every side except on that of the ocean spain have lose she authority over it and fall into the hand of adventurer connect with the savage it be make the means of unceasing annoyance and injury to we union in many of its most essential interest by this cession then spain cede a territory in reality of no value to she and obtain concession of the highest importance by the settlement of long-standing difference with the united state affect they respective claim and limit and likewise relieved herself from the obligation of a treaty relate to it which she have fail to fulfill and also from the responsibility incident to the most flagrant and pernicious abuse of she rights where she could not support she authority it be know that the treaty be form under these circumstance not a doubt be entertain that he catholic majesty would have ratify it without delay i regret to have to state that this reasonable expectation have be disappoint that the treaty be not ratify within the time stipulate and have not since be ratify as it be important that the nature and character of this unexpected occurrence should be distinctly understand i think it my duty to communicate to you all the fact and circumstance in my possession relate to it anxious to prevent all future disagreement with spain by give the most prompt effect to the treaty which have be thus conclude and particularly by the establishment of a government in florida which should preserve order there the minister of the united state who have be recently appoint to he catholic majesty and to whom the ratification by he government have be commit to be exchange for that of spain be instruct to transmit the latter to the department of state as soon as obtain by a public ship subject to he order for the purpose unexpected delay occur in the ratification by spain he request to be inform of the cause it be state in reply that the great importance of the subject and a desire to obtain explanation on certain point which be not specify have produce the delay and that a envoy would be dispatch to the united state to obtain such explanation of this government the minister of the united state offer to give full explanation on any point on which it might be desire which proposal be decline have communicate this result to the department of state in August last he be instruct notwithstanding the disappointment and surprise which it produce to inform the government of spain that if the treaty should be ratify and transmit here at any time before the meeting of congress it would be receive and have the same effect as if it have be ratify in due time this order be execute the authorize communication be make to the government of spain and by its answer which have just be receive we be officially make acquaint for the first time with the cause which have prevent the ratification of the treaty by he catholic majesty it be allege by the minister of spain that this government have attempt to alter one of the principal article of the treaty by a declaration which the minister of the united state have be order to present when he should deliver the ratification by he government in exchange for that of spain and of which he give notice explanatory of the sense in which that article be understand it be further allege that this government have recently tolerate or protect a expedition from the united state against the province of texa these two imputed act be state as the reason which have induce he catholic majesty to withhold he ratification from the treaty to obtain explanation respect which it be repeat that a envoy would be forthwith dispatch to the united state how far these allegation will justify the conduct of the government of spain will appear on a view of the follow fact and the evidence which support they : it will be see by the document transmit herewith that the declaration mention relate to a clause in the eighth article concern certain grant of land recently make by he catholic majesty in florida which it be understand have convey all the land which till then have be ungranted it be the intention of the party to annul these latter grant and that clause be draw for that express purpose and for none other the date of these grant be unknown but it be understand to be posterior to that insert in the article indeed it must be obvious to all that if that provision in the treaty have not the effect of annul these grant it would be altogether nugatory immediately after the treaty be conclude and ratify by this government a intimation be receive that these grant be of anterior date to that fix on by the treaty and that they would not of course be affect by it the mere possibility of such a case so inconsistent with the intention of the party and the meaning of the article induce this government to demand a explanation on the subject which be immediately grant and which correspond with this statement with respect to the other act allege that this government have tolerate or protect a expedition against texa it be utterly without foundation every discountenance have invariably be give to any such attempt from within the limit of the united state as be fully evince by the act of the government and the proceedings of the court there be cause however to apprehend in the course of the last summer that some adventurer entertain view of the kind suggest the attention of the constitute authority in that quarter be immediately draw to they and it be know that the project whatever it might be have utterly fail these fact will it be presume satisfy every impartial mind that the government of spain have no justifiable cause for decline to ratify the treaty a treaty conclude in conformity with instruction be obligatory in good faith in all its stipulation accord to the true intent and meaning of the party each party be bind to ratify it if either could set it aside without the consent of the other there would be no longer any rule applicable to such transaction between nation by this proceed the government of spain have render to the united state a new and very serious injury it have be state that a minister would be send to ask certain explanation of this government but if such be desire why be they not ask within the time limited for the ratification be it contemplate to open a new negotiation respect any of the article or condition of the treaty if that be do to what consequence might it not lead at what time and in what manner would a new negotiation terminate by this proceeding spain have form a relation between the two country which will justify any measure on the part of the united state which a strong sense of injury and a proper regard for the rights and interest of the nation may dictate in the course to be pursue these object should be constantly hold in view and have they due weight we national honor must be maintain and a new and a distinguished proof be afford of that regard for justice and moderation which have invariably govern the council of this free people it must be obvious to all that if the united state have be desirous of make conquest or have be even willing to aggrandize themselves in that way they could have have no inducement to form this treaty they would have much cause for gratulation at the course which have be pursue by spain a ample field for ambition be open before they but such a career be not consistent with the principle of they government nor the interest of the nation from a full view of all circumstance it be submit to the consideration of congress whether it will not be proper for the united state to carry the condition of the treaty into effect in the same manner as if it have be ratify by spain claim on they part all its advantage and yield to spain those secure to she by pursue this course we shall rest on the sacred ground of right sanction in the most solemn manner by spain herself by a treaty which she be bind to ratify for refuse to do which she must incur the censure of other nation even those most friendly to she while by confine ourselves within that limit we can not fail to obtain they well-merited approbation we must have peace on a frontier where we have be so long disturbed we citizen must be indemnify for loss so long since sustained and for which indemnity have be so unjustly withhold from they accomplish these great object we obtain all that be desirable but he catholic majesty have twice declare he determination to send a minister to the united state to ask explanation on certain point and to give they respect he delay to ratify the treaty shall we act by take the cede territory and proceed to execute the other condition of the treaty before this minister arrive and be hear this be a case which form a strong appeal to the candor the magnanimity and the honor of this people much be due to courtesy between nation by a short delay we shall lose nothing for rest on the ground of immutable truth and justice we can not be divert from we purpose it ought to be presume that the explanation which may be give to the minister of spain will be satisfactory and produce the desire result in any event the delay for the purpose mention be a further manifestation of the sincere desire to terminate in the most friendly manner all difference with spain can not fail to be duly appreciate by he catholic majesty as well as by other power it be submit therefore whether it will not be proper to make the law propose for carry the condition of the treaty into effect should it be adopt contingent to suspend its operation upon the responsibility of the executive in such manner as to afford a opportunity for such friendly explanation as may be desire during the present session of congress i communicate to congress a copy of the treaty and of the instruction to the minister of the united state at madrid respect it of he correspondence with the minister of spain and of such other document as may be necessary to give a full view of the subject in the course which the spanish government have on this occasion think proper to pursue it be satisfactory to know that they have not be countenance by any other european power on the contrary the opinion and wish both of france and great britain have not be withhold either from the united state or from spain and have be unequivocal in favor of the ratification there be also reason to believe that the sentiment of the imperial government of russium have be the same and that they have also be make know to the cabinet of madrid in the civil war exist between spain and the spanish province in this hemisphere the greatest care have be take to enforce the law intend to preserve a impartial neutrality we port have continue to be equally open to both party and on the same condition and we citizen have be equally restrain from interfere in favor of either to the prejudice of the other the progress of the war however have operate manifestly in favor of the colony bueno ayre still maintain unshaken the independence which it declare in 1816 and have enjoy since 1810 like success have also lately attend chili and the province north of the la plata border on it and likewise venezuelum this contest have from its commencement be very interesting to other power and to none more so than to the united state a virtuous people may and will confine themselves within the limit of a strict neutrality but it be not in they power to behold a conflict so vitally important to they neighbor without the sensibility and sympathy which naturally belong to such a case it have be the steady purpose of this government to prevent that feeling lead to excess and it be very gratifying to have it in my power to state that so strong have be the sense throughout the whole community of what be due to the character and obligation of the nation that very few example of a contrary kind have occur the distance of the colony from the parent country and the great extent of they population and resource give they advantage which it be anticipate at a very early period would be difficult for spain to surmount the steadiness consistency and success with which they have pursue they object as evince more particularly by the undisturbed sovereignty which bueno ayre have so long enjoy evidently give they a strong claim to the favorable consideration of other nation these sentiment on the part of the united state have not be withhold from other power with whom it be desirable to act in concert should it become manifest to the world that the effort of spain to subdue these province will be fruitless it may be presume that the spanish government itself will give up the contest in produce such a determination it can not be doubt that the opinion of friendly power who have take no part in the controversy will have they merit influence it be of the highest importance to we national character and indispensable to the morality of we citizen that all violation of we neutrality should be prevent no door should be leave open for the evasion of we law no opportunity afford to any who may be dispose to take advantage of it to compromit the interest or the honor of the nation it be submit therefore to the consideration of congress whether it may not be advisable to revise the law with a view to this desirable result it be submit also whether it may not be proper to designate by law the several port or place along the coast at which only foreign ship of war and privateer may be admit the difficulty of sustain the regulation of we commerce and of other important interest from abuse without such designation furnish a strong motive for this measure at the time of the negotiation for the renewal of the commercial convention between the united state and great britain a hope have be entertain that a article might have be agree upon mutually satisfactory to both country regulate upon principle of justice and reciprocity the commercial intercourse between the united state and the british possession as well in the west indy as upon the continent of north america the plenipotentiary of the two government not have be able to come to a agreement on this important interest those of the united state reserve for the consideration of this government the proposal which have be present to they as the ultimate offer on the part of the british government and which they be not authorize to accept on they transmission here they be examine with due deliberation the result of which be a new effort to meet the view of the british government the minister of the united state be instruct to make a further proposal which have not be accept it be however decline in a amicable manner i recommend to the consideration of congress whether further prohibitory provision in the law relate to this intercourse may not be expedient it be see with interest that although it have not be practicable as yet to agree in any arrangement of this important branch of they commerce such be the disposition of the party that each will view any regulation which the other may make respect it in the most friendly light by the fifth article of the convention conclude on the 20th of October 1818 it be stipulate that the difference which have arise between the two government with regard to the true intent and meaning of the fifth article of the treaty of ghent in relation to the carry away by british officer of slave from the united state after the exchange of the ratification of the treaty of peace should be refer to the decision of some friendly sovereign or state to be name for that purpose the minister of the united state have be instruct to name to the british government a foreign sovereign the common friend to both party for the decision of this question the answer of that government to the proposal when receive will indicate the further measure to be pursue on the part of the united state although the pecuniary embarrassment which affect various part of the union during the latter part of the preceding year have during the present be considerably augmented and still continue to exist the receipt into the treasury to the 30th of September last have amount to $ 19000000 after defray the current expense of the government include the interest and reimbursement of the public debt payable to that period amount to $ 18200000 there remain in the treasury on that day more than $ 2500000 which with the sum receivable during the remainder of the year will exceed the current demand upon the treasury for the same period the cause which have tend to diminish the public receipt could not fail to have a corresponding effect upon the revenue which have accrue upon impost and tonnage during the three first quarter of the present year it be however ascertain that the duty which have be secure during that period exceed $ 18000000 and those of the whole year will probably amount to $ 23000000 for the probable receipt of the next year i refer you to the statement which will be transmit from the treasury which will enable you to judge whether further provision be necessary the great reduction in the price of the principal article of domestic growth which have occur during the present year and the consequent fall in the price of labor apparently so favorable to the success of domestic manufacture have not shield they against other cause adverse to they prosperity the pecuniary embarrassment which have so deeply affect the commercial interest of the nation have be no less adverse to we manufacturing establishment in several section of the union the great reduction of the currency which the bank have be constrain to make in order to continue specie payment and the vitiated character of it where such reduction have not be attempt instead of place within the reach of these establishment the pecuniary aid necessary to avail themselves of the advantage result from the reduction in the price of the raw material and of labor have compel the bank to withdraw from they a portion of the capital heretofore advance to they that aid which have be refuse by the bank have not be obtain from other source owe to the loss of individual confidence from the frequent failure which have recently occur in some of we principal commercial city a additional cause for the depression of these establishment may probably be find in the pecuniary embarrassment which have recently affect those country with which we commerce have be principally prosecute they manufacture for the want of a ready or profitable market at home have be ship by the manufacturer to the united state and in many instance sell at a price below they current value at the place of manufacture although this practice may from its nature be consider temporary or contingent it be not on that account less injurious in its effect uniformity in the demand and price of a article be highly desirable to the domestic manufacturer it be deem of great importance to give encouragement to we domestic manufacturer in what manner the evil which have be advert to may be remedy and how far it may be practicable in other respects to afford to they further encouragement pay due regard to the other great interest of the nation be submit to the wisdom of congress the survey of the coast for the establishment of fortification be now nearly complete and considerable progress have be make in the collection of material for the construction of fortification in the gulf of mexico and in the chesapeake bay the work on the eastern bank of the potomac below alexandrium and on the pea patch in the delaware be much advanced and it be expect that the fortification at the narrow in the harbor of new york will be complete the present year to derive all the advantage contemplate from these fortification it be necessary that they should be judiciously post and construct with a view to permanence the progress hitherto have therefore be slow but as the difficulty in part heretofore the least explore and know be surmount it will in future be more rapid as soon as the survey of the coast be complete which it be expect will be do early in the next spring the engineer employ in it will proceed to examine for like purpose the northern and northwestern frontier the troops intend to occupy a station at the mouth of the st peter on the mississippus have establish themselves there and those who be order to the mouth of the yellow stone on the missourus have ascend that river to the council bluff where they will remain until the next spring when they will proceed to the place of they destination i have the satisfaction to state that this measure have be execute in amity with the indian tribe and that it promise to produce in regard to they all the advantage which be contemplate by it much progress have likewise be make in the construction of ship of war and in the collection of timber and other material for shipbuilding it be not doubt that we navy will soon be augment to the number and place in all respects on the footing provide for by law the board consist of engineer and naval officer have not yet make they final report of site for two naval depot as instruct accord to the resolution of march 18 and April 20 1818 but they have examine the coast therein designate and they report be expect in the next month for the protection of we commerce in the mediterranean along the southern atlantic coast in the pacific and indian ocean it have be find necessary to maintain a strong naval force which it seem proper for the present to continue there be much reason to believe that if any portion of the squadron heretofore station in the mediterranean should be withdraw we intercourse with the power border on that sea would be much interrupted if not altogether destroy such too have be the growth of a spirit of piracy in the other quarter mention by adventurer from every country in abuse of the friendly flag which they have assume that not to protect we commerce there would be to abandon it as a prey to they rapacity due attention have likewise be pay to the suppression of the slave trade in compliance with a law of the last session order have be give to the commander of all we public ship to seize all vessel navigate under we flag engage in that trade and to bring they in to be proceed against in the manner prescribe by that law it be hope that these vigorous measure support by like act by other nation will soon terminate a commerce so disgraceful to the civilized world in the execution of the duty impose by these act and of a high trust connect with it it be with deep regret i have to state the loss which have be sustain by the death of commodore perry he gallantry in a brilliant exploit in the late war add to the renown of he country he death be deplore as a national misfortune jame monroe special message washington _ December 7 1819 _ _ to the senate of the united state _ : i transmit herewith to the senate a collection of the commercial regulation of the different foreign country with which the united state have commercial intercourse which have be compile in compliance with the resolution of the senate of 3d march 1817 jame monroe washington _ December 14 1819 _ _ to the house of representative of the united state _ : in conformity with the resolution of the house of representative of the 24th of February last i now transmit a report of the secretary of state with extract and copy of several letter touch the cause of the imprisonment of william white a american citizen at bueno ayre jame monroe washington _ December 17 1819 _ _ to the senate and house of representative of the united state _ : some doubt be entertain respect the true intent and meaning of the act of the last session entitle a act in addition to the act prohibit the slave trade as to the duty of the agent to be appoint on the coast of africa i think it proper to state the interpretation which have be give of the act and the measure adopt to carry it into effect that congress may should it be deem advisable amend the same before further proceeding be have under it the obligation to instruct the commander of all we armed vessel to seize and bring into port all ship or vessel of the united state wheresoever find have on board any negro mulatto or person of color in violation of former act for the suppression of the slave trade be imperative be execute without delay no seizure have yet be make but as they be contemplate by the law and might be presume it seem proper to make the necessary regulation applicable to such seizure for carry the several provision of the act into effect it be enjoin on the executive to cause all negro mulatto or person of color who may be take under the act to be remove to africa it be the obvious import of the law that none of the person thus take should remain within the united state and no place other than the coast of africa be designate they removal or delivery whether carry from the united state or land immediately from the vessel in which they be take be suppose to be confine to that coast no settlement or station be specify the whole coast be think to be leave open for the selection of a proper place at which the person thus take should be deliver the executive be authorize to appoint one or more agent reside there to receive such person and $ 100000 be appropriate for the general purpose of the law on due consideration of the several section of the act and of its humane policy it be suppose to be the intention of congress that all the person above describe who might be take under it and land in africa should be aid in they return to they former home or in they establishment at or near the place where land some shelter and food would be necessary for they there as soon as land let they subsequent disposition be what it might should they be land without such provision have be previously make they might perish it be suppose by the authority give to the executive to appoint agent reside on that coast that they should provide such shelter and food and perform the other beneficent and charitable office contemplate by the act the coast of africa have be little explore and no person reside there who possess the requisite qualification to entitle they to the trust be know to the executive to none such could it be commit it be believe that citizen only who would go hence well instruct in the view of they government and zealous to give they effect would be competent to these duty and that it be not the intention of the law to preclude they appointment it be obvious that the longer these person should be detain in the united state in the hand of the marshal the greater would be the expense and that for the same term would the main purpose of the law be suspend it seem therefore to be incumbent on I to make the necessary arrangement for carry this act into effect in africa in time to meet the delivery of any person who might be take by the public vessel and land there under it on this view of the policy and sanction of the law it have be decide to send a public ship to the coast of africa with two such agent who will take with they tool and other implement necessary for the purpose above mention to each of these agent a small salary have be allow -- $ 1500 to the principal and $ 1200 to the other all we public agent on the coast of africa receive salary for they service and it be understand that none of we citizen possess the requisite qualification would accept these trust by which they would be confine to part the least frequented and civilized without a reasonable compensation such allowance therefore seem to be indispensable to the execution of the act it be intend also to subject a portion of the sum appropriate to the order of the principal agent for the special object above state amounting in the whole include the salary of the agent for one year to rather less than one third of the appropriation special instruction will be give to these agent define in precise term they duty in regard to the person thus deliver to they the disbursement of the money by the principal agent and he accountability for the same they will also have power to select the most suitable place on the coast of africa at which all person who may be take under this act shall be deliver to they with a express injunction to exercise no power found on the principle of colonization or other power than that of perform the benevolent office above recite by the permission and sanction of the exist government under which they may establish themselves order will be give to the commander of the public ship in which they will sail to cruise along the coast to give the more complete effect to the

that we just object may be accomplish without the hazard of such a extremity on full consideration of all these circumstance i have think it my duty to submit to congress whether it will not be advisable to postpone a decision on the question now depend with spain until the next session the distress of that nation at this juncture afford a motive for this forbearance which can not fail to be duly appreciate under such circumstance the attention of the spanish government may be divert from its foreign concern and the arrival of a minister here be longer delay i be the more induce to suggest this course of proceed from a knowledge that while we shall thereby make a just return to the power whose good office have be acknowledge and increase by a new and signal proof of moderation we claim on spain we attitude in regard to she will not be less favorable at the next session than it be at the present jame monroe washington _ may 9 1820 _ _ to the senate and house of representative of the united state _ : i communicate to congress a correspondence which have take place between the secretary of state and the envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary of he catholic majesty since the message of the 27th march last respect the treaty which be conclude between the united state and spain on the 22d February 1819 after the failure of he catholic majesty for so long a time to ratify the treaty it be expect that this minister would have bring with he the ratification or that he would have be authorize to give a order for the delivery of the territory cede by it to the united state it appear however that the treaty be still unratified and that the minister have no authority to surrender the territory the object of he mission have be to make complaint and to demand explanation respect a imputed system of hostility on the part of citizen of the united state against the subject and dominion of spain and a unfriendly policy in they government and to obtain new stipulation against these allege injury as the condition on which the treaty should be ratify unexpected as such complaint and such a demand be under exist circumstance it be think proper without compromise the government as to the course to be pursue to meet they promptly and to give the explanation that be desire on every subject with the utmost candor the result have prove what be sufficiently well know before that the charge of a systematic hostility be adopt and pursue by citizen of the united state against the dominion and subject of spain be utterly destitute of foundation and that they government in all its branch have maintain with the utmost rigor that neutrality in the civil war between spain and the colony which they be the first to declare no force have be collect nor incursion make from within the united state against the dominion of spain nor have any naval equipment be permit in favor of either party against the other they citizen have be warn of the obligation incident to the neutral condition of they country they public officer have be instruct to see that the law be faithfully execute and severe example have be make of some who violate they in regard to the stipulation propose as the condition of the ratification of the treaty that the united state shall abandon the right to recognize the revolutionary colony in south america or to form other relation with they when in they judgment it may be just and expedient so to do it be manifestly so repugnant to the honor and even to the independence of the united state that it have be impossible to discuss it in make this proposal it be perceive that he catholic majesty have entirely misconceive the principle on which this government have act in be a party to a negotiation so long protracted for claim so well found and reasonable as he likewise have the sacrifice which the united state have make comparatively with spain in the treaty to which it be propose to annex so extraordinary and improper a condition have the minister of spain offer a unqualified pledge that the treaty should be ratify by he sovereign on be make acquaint with the explanation which have be give by this government there would have be a strong motive for accept and submit it to the senate for they advice and consent rather than to resort to other measure for redress however justifiable and proper but he give no such pledge oil the contrary he declare explicitly that the refusal of this government to relinquish the right of judge and act for itself hereafter accord to circumstance in regard to the spanish colony a right common to all nation have render it impossible for he under he instruction to make such engagement he think that he sovereign will be induce by he communication to ratify the treaty but still he leave he free either to adopt that measure or to decline it he admit that the other objection be essentially remove and will not in themselves prevent the ratification provide the difficulty on the third point be surmount the result therefore be that the treaty be declare to have no obligation whatever that its ratification be make to depend not on the consideration which lead to its adoption and the condition which it contain but on a new article unconnected with it respect which a new negotiation must be open of indefinite duration and doubtful issue under this view of the subject the course to be pursue would appear to be direct and obvious if the affair of spain have remain in the state in which they be when this minister sail but it be know that a important change have since take place in the government of that country which can not fail to be sensibly feel in its intercourse with other nation the minister of spain have essentially declare he inability to act in consequence of that change with he however under he present power nothing could be do the attitude of the united state must now be assume on full consideration of what be due to they rights they interest and honor without regard to the power or incident of the late mission we may at pleasure occupy the territory which be intend and provide by the late treaty as a indemnity for loss so long since sustain by we citizen but still nothing could be settle definitively without a treaty between the two nation be this the time to make the pressure if the united state be govern by view of ambition and aggrandizement many strong reason might be give in its favor but they have no object of that kind to accomplish none which be not found in justice and which can be injure by forbearance great hope be entertain that this change will promote the happiness of the spanish nation the good order moderation and humanity which have characterize the movement be the best guaranty of its success the united state would not be justify in they own estimation should they take any step to disturb its harmony when the spanish government be completely organize on the principle of this change as it be expect it soon will be there be just ground to presume that we difference with spain will be speedily and satisfactorily settle with these remark i submit it to the wisdom of congress whether it will not still be advisable to postpone any decision on this subject until the next session jame monroe washington _ may 11 1820 _ _ to the senate of the united state _ : i transmit

of climate every portion of which be engage in foreign commerce and liable to be affect in some degree by the change which occur in the condition and regulation of foreign country it would be strange if the produce of we soil and the industry and enterprise of we fellow-citizen receive at all time and in every quarter a uniform and equal encouragement this would be more than we would have a right to expect under circumstance the most favorable pressure on certain interest it be admit have be feel but allow to these they greatest extent they detract but little from the force of the remark already make in form a just estimate of we present situation it be proper to look at the whole in the outline as well as in the detail a free virtuous and enlighten people know well the great principle and cause on which they happiness depend and even those who suffer most occasionally in they transitory concern find great relief under they suffering from the blessing which they otherwise enjoy and in the consoling and animate hope which they administer from whence do these pressure come not from a government which be found by administer for and support by the people we trace they to the peculiar character of the epoch in which we live and to the extraordinary occurrence which have signalize it the convulsion with which several of the power of europe have be shake and the long and destructive war in which all be engage with they sudden transition to a state of peace presenting in the first instance unusual encouragement to we commerce and withdraw it in the second even within its wonted limit could not fail to be sensibly feel here the station too which we have to support through this long conflict compel as we be finally to become a party to it with a principal power and to make great exertion suffer heavy loss and to contract considerable debt disturb the ordinary course of affair by augment to a vast amount the circulate medium and thereby elevate at one time the price of every article above a just standard and depressing it at another below it have likewise its due effect it be manifest that the pressure of which we complain have proceed in a great measure from these cause when then we take into view the prosperous and happy condition of we country in all the great circumstance which constitute the felicity of a nation -- every individual in the full enjoyment of all he rights the union bless with plenty and rapidly rise to greatness under a national government which operate with complete effect in every part without be feel in any except by the

and permanent basis the commercial relation between the united state and the british colony in the west indy and on this continent have undergo no change the british government still prefer to leave that commerce under the restriction heretofore impose on it on each side it be satisfactory to recollect that the restraint resort to by the united state be defensive only intend to prevent a monopoly

infer consider all circumstance which must have weight in produce the result that a adjustment will finally take place on the basis propose by the colony to promote that result by friendly counsel with other power include spain herself have be the uniform policy of this government in look to the internal concern of we country you will i be persuade derive much satisfaction from a view of the

the union we navy have be considerably augmented and the ordnance munitions of war and store of the army and navy which be much exhaust during the war have be replenish by the discharge of so large a proportion of the public debt and the execution of such extensive and important operation in so short a time a just estimate may be form of the great extent of we national resource the demonstration be the more complete and gratifying when it be recollect that the direct tax and excise be repeal soon after the termination of the late war and that the revenue apply to these purpose have be derive almost wholly from other source the receipt into the treasury from every source to the 30th of September last have amount to $ 1679410766 whilst the public expenditure to the same period amount to $

the sale of public land $ 22996545 in bring this subject to view i consider it my duty to submit to congress whether it may not be advisable to extend to the purchaser of these land in consideration of the unfavorable change which have occur since the sale a reasonable indulgence it be know that the purchase be make when the price of every article have rise to its greatest height and that the installment be become due at a period of great depression it be presume that some plan may be devise by the wisdom of congress compatible with the public interest which would afford great relief to these purchaser considerable progress have be make during the present season in examine the coast and its various bay and other inlet in the collection of material and in the construction of fortification for the defense of the union at several of the position at which it have be decide to erect such work at mobile point and dauphin island and at the rigolet lead to lake pontchartrain

be examine as have likewise other part of the coast eastward of boston great exertion have be make to push forward these work with the utmost dispatch possible but when they extent be consider with the important purpose for which they be intend -- the defense of the whole coast and in consequence of the whole interior -- and that they be to last for age it will be manifest that a well-digested plan found on military principle connect the whole together combine security with economy could not be prepare without repeat examination of the most expose and difficult part and that it would also take considerable time to collect the material at the several point where they would be require from all the light that have be shed on this subject i be satisfied that every favorable anticipation which have be form of this great undertaking will be verify and that when complete it will afford very great if not complete protection to we atlantic frontier in the event of another war -- a protection sufficient to counterbalance in a single campaign with a enemy powerful at sea the expense of all these work without take into the estimate the saving of the life of so many of we citizen

the confidence of my fellow-citizen evince by my reelection to this high trust have excite in my bosom the approbation which it announce of my conduct in the precede term afford I a consolation which i shall profoundly feel through life the general accord with which it have be express add to the great and never-ceasing obligation which it impose to merit the continuance of this good opinion and to carry it with I into my retirement as the solace of advance year will be the object of my most zealous and unceasing effort have no pretension to the high and commanding claim of my predecessor whose name be so much more conspicuously identify with we revolution and who contribute so preeminently to promote its success i consider myself rather as the instrument than the cause of the union which have prevail in the late election in surmount in favor of my humble pretension the difficulty which so often produce division in like occurrence it be obvious that other powerful cause indicate the great strength and stability of we union have essentially contribute to draw you together that these powerful cause exist and that they be permanent be my fixed opinion that they may produce a like accord in all question touch however remotely the liberty prosperity and happiness of we country will always be the object of my most fervent prayer to the supreme author of all good in a government which be found by the people who possess exclusively the sovereignty it seem proper that the person who may be place by they suffrage in this high trust should declare on commence its duty the principle on which he intend to conduct the administration if the person thus elect have serve the precede term a opportunity be afford he to review its principal occurrence and to give such further explanation respect they as in he judgment may be useful to he constituent the event of one year have influence on those of another and in like manner of a precede on the succeed administration the movement of a great nation be connect in all they part if error have be commit they ought to be correct if the policy be sound it ought to be support it be by a thorough knowledge of the whole subject that we fellow-citizen be enable to judge correctly of the past and to give a proper direction to the future just before the commencement of the last term the united state have conclude a war with a very powerful nation on condition equal and honorable to both party the event of that war be too recent and too deeply impressed on the memory of all to require a development from I we commerce have be in a great measure drive from the sea we atlantic and inland frontier be invade in almost every part the waste of life along we coast and on some part of we inland frontier to the defense of which we gallant and patriotic citizen be call be immense in addition to which not less than $ 120000000 be add at its end to the public debt as soon as the war have terminate the nation admonish by its event resolve to place itself in a situation which should be better calculate to prevent the recurrence of a like evil and in case it should recur to mitigate its calamity with this view after reduce we land force to the basis of a peace establishment which have be further modify since provision be make for the construction of fortification at proper point through the whole extent of we coast and such a augmentation of we naval force as should be well adapt to both purpose the law make this provision be pass in 1815 and 1816 and it have be since the constant effort of the executive to carry they into effect the advantage of these fortification and of a augmented naval force in the extent contemplate in a point of economy have be fully illustrate by a report of the board of engineer and naval commissioner lately communicate to congress by which it appear that in a invasion by 20000 man with a correspondent naval force in a campaign of six month only the whole expense of the construction of the work would be defray by the difference in the sum necessary to maintain the force which would be adequate to we defense with the aid of those work and that which would be incur without they the reason of this difference be obvious if fortification be judiciously place on we great inlet as distant from we city as circumstance will permit they will form the only point of attack and the enemy will be detain there by a small regular force a sufficient time to enable we militia to collect and repair to that on which the attack be make a force adequate to the enemy collect at that single point with suitable preparation for such other as might be menace be all that would be requisite but if there be no fortification then the enemy might go where he please and change he position and sailing from place to place we force must be call out and spread in vast number along the whole coast and on both side of every bay and river as high up in each as it might be navigable for ship of war by these fortification support by we navy to which they would afford like support we should present to other power a armed front from st croix to the sabine which would protect in the event of war we whole coast and interior from invasion and even in the war of other power in which we be neutral they would be find eminently useful as by keep they public ship at a distance from we city peace and order in they would be preserve and the government be protect from insult it need scarcely be remark that these measure have not be resort to in a spirit of hostility to other power such a disposition do not exist toward any power peace and good will have be and will hereafter be cultivate with all and by the most faithful regard to justice they have be dictate by a love of peace of economy and a earnest desire to save the life of we fellow-citizen from that destruction and we country from that devastation which be inseparable from war when it find we unprepared for it it be believe and experience have show that such a preparation be the best expedient that can be resort to to prevent war i add with much pleasure that considerable progress have already be make in these measure of defense and that they will be complete in a few year consider the great extent and importance of the object if the plan be zealously and steadily persevere in the conduct of the government in what relate to foreign power be always a object of the highest importance to the nation its agriculture commerce manufacture fishery revenue in short its peace may all be affect by it attention be therefore due to this subject at the period advert to the power of europe after have be engage in long and destructive war with each other have conclude a peace which happily still exist we peace with the power with whom we have be engage have also be conclude the war between spain and the colony in south america which have commence many year before be then the only conflict that remain unsettled this be a contest between different part of the same community in which other power have not interfere be not affect by they accommodation this contest be consider at a early stage by my predecessor a civil war in which the party be entitle to equal rights in we port this decision the first make by any power be form on great consideration of the comparative strength and resource of the party the length of time and successful opposition make by the colony and of all other circumstance on which it ought to depend be in strict accord with the law of nation congress have invariably act on this principle have make no change in we relation with either party we attitude have therefore be that of neutrality between they which have be maintain by the government with the strictest impartiality no aid have be afford to either nor have any privilege be enjoy by the one which have not be equally open to the other party and every exertion have be make in its power to enforce the execution of the law prohibit illegal equipment with equal rigor against both by this equality between the party they public vessel have be receive in we port on the same footing they have enjoy a equal right to purchase and export arm munitions of war and every other supply the exportation of all article whatever be permit under law which be pass long before the commencement of the contest we citizen have trade equally with both and they commerce with each have be alike protect by the government respect the attitude which it may be proper for the united state to maintain hereafter between the party i have no hesitation in state it as my opinion that the neutrality heretofore observe should still be adhere to from the change in the government of spain and the negotiation now depend invite by the corte and accept by the colony it may be presume that they difference will be settle on the term propose by the colony should the war be continue the united state regard its occurrence will always have it in they power to adopt such measure respect it as they honor and interest may require shortly after the general peace a band of adventurer take advantage of this conflict and of the facility which it afford to establish a system of buccaneer in the neighbor sea to the great annoyance of the commerce of the united state and as be represent of that of other power of this spirit and of its injurious bearing on the united state strong proof be afford by the establishment at amelium island and the purpose to which it be make instrumental by this band in 1817 and by the occurrence which take place in other part of florida in 1818 the detail of which in both instance be too well know to require to be now recite i be satisfied have a less decisive course be adopt that the worst consequence would have result from it we have see that these check decisive as they be be not sufficient to crush that piratical spirit many culprit bring within we limit have be condemn to suffer death the punishment due to that atrocious crime the decision of upright and enlighten tribunal fall equally on all whose crime subject they by a fair interpretation of the law to its censure it belong to the executive not to suffer the execution under these decision to transcend the great purpose for which punishment be necessary the full benefit of example be secure policy as well as humanity equally forbid that they should be carry further i have act on this principle pardon those who appear to have be lead astray by ignorance of the criminality of the act they have commit and suffer the law to take effect on those only in whose favor no extenuate circumstance could be urge great confidence be entertain that the late treaty with spain which have be ratify by both the party and the ratification whereof have be exchange have place the relation of the two country on a basis of permanent friendship the provision make by it for such of we citizen as have claim on spain of the character describe will it be presume be very satisfactory to they and the boundary which be establish between the territory of the party westward of the mississippus heretofore in dispute have it be think be settle on condition just and advantageous to both but to the acquisition of florida too much importance can not be attach it secure to the united state a territory important in itself and whose importance be much increase by its bearing on many of the highest interest of the union it open to several of the neighboring state a free passage to the ocean through the province cede by several river have they source high up within they limit it secure we against all future annoyance from powerful indian tribe it give we several excellent harbor in the gulf of mexico for ship of war of the largest size it cover by its position in the gulf the mississippus and other great water within we extended limit and thereby enable the united state to afford complete protection to the vast and very valuable production of we whole western country which find a market through those stream by a treaty with the british government bearing date on the 20th of October 1818 the convention regulate the commerce between the united state and great britain conclude on the 3d of July 1815 which be about expire be revive and continue for the term of ten year from the time of its expiration by that treaty also the difference which have arise under the treaty of ghent respect the right claim by the united state for they citizen to take and cure fish on the coast of he britannic majesty 's dominion in america with other difference on important interest be adjust to the satisfaction of both party no agreement have yet be enter into respect the commerce between the united state and the british dominion in the west indy and on this continent the restraint impose on that commerce by great britain and reciprocate by the united state on a principle of defense continue still in force the negotiation with france for the regulation of the commercial relation between the two country which in the course of the last summer have be commence at paris have since be transfer to this city and will be pursue on the part of the united state in the spirit of conciliation and with a earnest desire that it may terminate in a arrangement satisfactory to both party we relation with the barbary power be preserve in the same state and by the same means that be employ when i come into this office as early as 1801 it be find necessary to send a squadron into the mediterranean for the protection of we commerce and no period have intervene a short term except when it be think advisable to withdraw it the great interest which the united state have in the pacific in commerce and in the fishery have also make it necessary to maintain a naval force there in dispose of this force in both instance the most effectual measure in we power have be take without interfere with its other duty for the suppression of the slave trade and of piracy in the neighbor sea the situation of the united state in regard to they resource the extent of they revenue and the facility with which it be raise afford a most gratifying spectacle the payment of nearly $ 67000000 of the public debt with the great progress make in measure of defense and in other improvement of various kind since the late war be conclusive proof of this extraordinary prosperity especially when it be recollect that these expenditure have be defray without a burthen on the people the direct tax and excise have be repeal soon after the conclusion of the late war and the revenue apply to these great object have be raise in a manner not to be feel we great resource therefore remain untouched for any purpose which may affect the vital interest of the nation for all such purpose they be inexhaustible they be more especially to be find in the virtue patriotism and intelligence of we fellow-citizen and in the devotion with which they would yield up by any just measure of taxation all they property in support of the rights and honor of they country under the present depression of price affect all the production of the country and every branch of industry proceeding from cause explain on a former occasion the revenue have considerably diminish the effect of which have be to compel congress either to abandon these great measure of defense or to resort to loan or internal tax to supply the deficiency on the presumption that this depression and the deficiency in the revenue arise from it would be temporary loan be authorize for the demand of the last and present year anxious to relieve my fellow-citizen in 1817 from every burthen which could be dispense with and the state of the treasury permit it i recommend the repeal of the internal tax know that such relief be then peculiarly necessary in consequence of the great exertion make in the late war i make that recommendation under a pledge that should the public exigency require a recurrence to they at any time while i remain in this trust i would with equal promptitude perform the duty which would then be alike incumbent on I by the experiment now make it will be see by the next session of congress whether the revenue shall have be so augmented as to be adequate to all these necessary purpose should the deficiency still continue and especially should it be probable that it would be permanent the course to be pursue appear to I to be obvious i be satisfied that under certain circumstance loan may be resort to with great advantage i be equally well satisfied as a general rule that the demand of the current year especially in time of peace should be provide for by the revenue of that year i have never dread nor have i ever shun in any situation in which i have be place make appeal to the virtue and patriotism of my fellow-citizen well know that they could never be make in vain especially in time of great emergency or for purpose of high national importance independently of the exigency of the case many consideration of great weight urge a policy have in view a provision of revenue to meet to a certain extent the demand of the nation without rely altogether on the precarious resource of foreign commerce i be satisfied that internal duty and excise with corresponding impost on foreign article of the same kind would without impose any serious burden on the people enhance the price of produce promote we manufacture and augment the revenue at the same time that they make it more secure and permanent the care of the indian tribe within we limit have long be a essential part of we system but unfortunately it have not be execute in a manner to accomplish all the object intend by it we have treat they as independent nation without they have any substantial pretension to that rank the distinction have flatter they pride retard they improvement and in many instance pave the way to they destruction the progress of we settlement westward support as they be by a dense population have constantly drive they back with almost the total sacrifice of the land which they have be compel to abandon they have claim on the magnanimity and i may add on the justice of this nation which we must all feel we should become they real benefactor we should perform the office of they great father the endearing title which they emphatically give to the chief magistrate of we union they sovereignty over vast territory should cease in lieu of which the right of soil should be secure to each individual and he posterity in competent portion and for the territory thus cede by each tribe some reasonable equivalent should be grant to be vest in permanent fund for the support of civil government over they and for the education of they child for they instruction in the art of husbandry and to provide sustenance for they until they could provide it for themselves my earnest hope be that congress will digest some plan found on these principle with such improvement as they wisdom may suggest and carry it into effect as soon as it may be practicable europe be again unsettled and the prospect of war increase should the flame light up in any quarter how far it may extend it be impossible to foresee it be we peculiar felicity to be altogether unconnected with the cause which produce this menacing aspect elsewhere with every power we be in perfect amity and it be we interest to remain so if it be practicable on just condition i see no reasonable cause to apprehend variance with any power unless it proceed from a violation of we maritime rights in these contest should they occur and to whatever extent they may be carry we shall be neutral but as a neutral power we have rights which it be we duty to maintain for like injury it will be incumbent on we to seek redress in a spirit of amity in full confidence that injure none none would knowingly injure we for more imminent danger we should be prepare and it should always be recollect that such preparation adapt to the circumstance and sanction by the judgment and wish of we constituent can not fail to have a good effect in avert danger of every kind we should recollect also that the season of peace be best adapt to these preparation if we turn we attention fellow-citizen more immediately to the internal concern of we country and more especially to those on which its future welfare depend we have every reason to anticipate the happiest result it be now rather more than forty-four year since we declare we independence and thirty-seven since it be acknowledge the talent and virtue which be display in that great struggle be a sure presage of all that have since follow a people who be able to surmount in they infant state such great peril would be more competent as they rise into manhood to repel any which they might meet in they progress they physical strength would be more adequate to foreign danger and the practice of self-government aid by the light of experience could not fail to produce a effect equally salutary on all those question connect with the internal organization these favorable anticipation have be realize in we whole system national and state we have shun all the defect which unceasingly prey on the vitals and destroy the ancient republic in they there be distinct order a nobility and a people or the people govern in one assembly thus in the one instance there be a perpetual conflict between the order in society for the ascendency in which the victory of either terminate in the overthrow of the government and the ruin of the state in the other in which the people govern in a body and whose dominion seldom exceed the dimension of a county in one of we state a tumultuous and disorderly movement permit only a transitory existence in this great nation there be but one order that of the people whose power by a peculiarly happy improvement of the representative principle be transfer from they without impair in the slightest degree they sovereignty to body of they own creation and to person elect by

department derive he authority from and be responsible to they for he conduct we career have correspond with this great outline perfection in we organization could not have be expect in the outset either in the national or state government or in trace the line between they respective power but no serious conflict have arise nor any contest but such as be manage by argument and by a fair appeal to the good sense of the people and many of the defect which experience have clearly demonstrate in both government have be remedy by steadily pursue this course in this spirit there be every reason to believe that we system will soon attain the highest degree of perfection of which human institution be capable and that the movement in all its branch will exhibit such a degree of order and harmony as to command the admiration and respect of the civilized world we physical attainment have not be less eminent twenty-five year ago the river mississippus be shut up and we western brethren

message washington _ December 3 1821 _ _ fellow-citizen of the senate and of the house of representative _ : the progress of we affair since the last session have be such as may justly be claim and expect under a government derive all its power from a enlighten people and under law form by they representative on great consideration for the sole purpose of promote the welfare and happiness of they constituent in the execution of those law and of the power vest by the constitution in the executive unremitted attention have be pay to the great object to which they extend in the concern which be exclusively internal there be good cause to be satisfy with the result the law have have they due operation and effect in those relate to foreign power i be happy to state that peace and amity be preserve with all by a strict observance on both side of the rights of each in matter touch we commercial intercourse where a difference of opinion have exist as to the condition on which it should be place each party have pursue its own policy without give just cause of offense to the other in this annual communication especially when it be address to a new congress the whole scope of we political concern naturally come into view that error if such have be commit may be correct that defect which have become manifest may be remedy and on the other hand that measure which be adopt on due deliberation and which experience have shew be just in themselves and essential to the public welfare should be persevere in and support in perform this necessary and very important duty i shall endeavor to place before you on its merit every subject that be think to be entitle to you particular attention in as distinct and clear a light as i may be able by a act of the 3d of march 1815 so much of the several act as impose higher duty on the tonnage of foreign vessel and on the manufacture and production of foreign nation when import into the united state in foreign vessel than when import in vessel of the united state be repeal so far as respect the manufacture and production of the nation to which such vessel belong on the condition that the repeal should take effect only in favor of any foreign nation when the executive should be satisfy that such discriminate duty to the disadvantage of the united state have likewise be repeal by such nation by this act a proposition be make to all nation to place we commerce with each on a basis which it be presume would be acceptable to all every nation be allow to bring its manufacture and production into we port and to take the manufacture and production of the united state back to they port in they own vessel on the same condition that they might be transport in vessel of the united state and in return it be require that a like accommodation should be grant to the vessel of the united state in the port of other power the article to be admit or prohibit on either side form no part of the propose arrangement each party would retain the right to admit or prohibit such article from the other as it think proper and on its own condition when the nature of the commerce between the united state and every other country be take into view it be think that this proposition would be consider fair and even liberal by every power the export of the united state consist generally of article of the first necessity and of rude material in demand for foreign manufactory of great bulk require for they transportation many vessel the return for which in the manufacture and production of any foreign country even when dispose of there to advantage may be bring in a single vessel this observation be the more especially applicable to those country from which manufacture alone be import but it apply in a great extent to the european dominion of every european power and in a certain extent to all the colony of those power by place then the navigation precisely on the same ground in the transportation of export and import between the united state and other country it be presume that all be offer which could be desire it seem to be the only proposition which could be devise which would retain even the semblance of equality in we favor many consideration of great weight give we a right to expect that this commerce should be extend to the colony as well as to the european dominion of other power with the latter especially with country exclusively manufacture the advantage be manifestly on they side a indemnity for that loss be expect from a trade with the colony and with the greater reason as it be know that the supplies which the colony derive from we be of the highest importance to they they labor be bestow with so much greater profit in the culture of other article and because likewise the article of which those supplies consist form so large a proportion of the export of the united state be never admit into any of the port of europe except in case of great emergency to avert a serious calamity when no article be admit which be not require to supply the want of the party admit it and admit then not in favor of any particular country to the disadvantage of other but on condition equally applicable to all it seem just that the article thus admit and invite should be carry thither in the vessel of the country afford such supply and that the reciprocity should be find in a corresponding accommodation on the other side by allow each party to participate in the transportation of such supplies on the payment of equal tonnage a strong proof be afford of a accommodate spirit to abandon to it the transportation of the whole would be a sacrifice which ought not to be expect the demand in the present instance would be the more unreasonable in consideration of the great inequality exist in the trade with the parent country such be the basis of we system as establish by the act of 1815 and such its true character in the year in which this act be pass a treaty be conclude with great britain in strict conformity with its principle in regard to she european dominion to she colony however in the west indy and on this continent it be not extend the british government claim the exclusive supply of those colony and from we own port and of the production of the colony in return in she own vessel to this claim the united state could not assent and in consequence each party suspend the intercourse in the vessel of the other by a prohibition which still exist the same condition be offer to france but not accept she government have demand other condition more favorable to she navigation and which should also give extraordinary encouragement to she manufacture and production in port of the united state to these it be think improper to accede and in consequence the restrictive regulation which have be adopt on she part be countervail on the part of the united state the direct commerce between the two country in the vessel of each party have be in a great measure suspend it be much to be regret that although a negotiation have be long pend such be the diversity of view entertain on the various point which have be bring into discussion that there do not appear to be any reasonable prospect of its early conclusion it be my duty to state as a cause of very great regret that very serious difference have occur in this negotiation respect the construction of the eighth article of the treaty of 1803 by which louisiana be cede to the united state and likewise respect the seizure of the _ apollo _ in 1820 for a violation of we revenue law the claim of the government of france have excite not less surprise than concern because there do not appear to be a just foundation for it in either instance by the eighth article of the treaty refer to it be stipulate that after the expiration of twelve year during which time it be provide by the seventh or preceding article that the vessel of france and spain should be admit into the port of the cede territory without pay higher duty on merchandise or tonnage on the vessel than such as be pay by citizen of the united state the ship of france should forever afterwards be place on the footing of the most favored nation by the obvious construction of this article it be presume that it be intend that no favor should be grant to any power in those port to which france should not be forthwith entitle nor should any accommodation be allow to another power on condition to which she would not also be entitle on the same condition under this construction no favor or accommodation could be grant to any power to the prejudice of france by allow the equivalent allow by those power she would always stand in those port on the footing of the most favored nation but if this article should be so construe as that france should enjoy of right and without pay the equivalent all the advantage of such condition as might be allow to other power in return for important concession make by they then the whole character of the stipulation would be change she would not be place on the footing of the most favored nation but on a footing hold by no other nation she would enjoy all advantage allow to they in consideration of like advantage allow to we free from every and any condition whatever as little cause have the government of france to complain of the seizure of the _ apollo _ and the removal of other vessel from the water of the st mary it will not be deny that every nation have a right to regulate its commercial system as it think fit and to enforce the collection of its revenue provide it be do without a invasion of the rights of other power the violation of its revenue law be a offense which all nation punish the punishment of which give no just cause of complaint to the power to which the offender belong provide it be extend to all equally in this case every circumstance which occur indicate a fix purpose to violate we revenue law have the party intend to have pursue a fair trade he would have enter we port and pay the duty or have he intend to carry on a legitimate circuitous commerce with the united state he would have enter the port of some other power land he goods at the custom-house accord to law and re-shipped and send they in the vessel of such power or of some other power which might lawfully bring they free from such duty to a port of the united state but the conduct of the party in this case be altogether different he enter the river st mary the boundary line between the united state and florida and take he position on the spanish side on which in the whole extent of the river there be no town no port or custom-house and scarcely any settlement he purpose therefore be not to sell he goods to the inhabitant of florida but to citizen of the united state in exchange for they production which could not be do without a direct and palpable breach of we law it be know that a regular systematic plan have be form by certain person for the violation of we revenue system which make it the more necessary to check the proceeding in its commencement that the unsettled bank of a river so remote from the spanish garrison and population could give no protection to any party in such a practice be believe to be in strict accord with the law of nation it would not have comport with a friendly policy in spain herself to have establish a custom-house there since it could have subserve no other purpose than to elude we revenue law but the government of spain do not adopt that measure on the contrary it be understand that the captain-general of cuba to whom a application to that effect be make by these adventurer have not accede to it the condition of those province for many year before they be cede to the united state need not now be dwell on inhabit by different tribe of indian and a inroad for every kind of adventurer the jurisdiction of spain may be say to have be almost exclusively confine to she garrison it certainly could not extend to place where she have no authority the rule therefore applicable to settled country govern by law could not be deem so to the desert of florida and to the occurrence there it merit attention also that the territory have then be cede to the united state by a treaty the ratification of which have not be refuse and which have since be perform under any circumstance therefore spain become less responsible for such act commit there and the united state more at liberty to exercise authority to prevent so great a mischief the conduct of this government have in every instance be conciliatory and friendly to france the construction of we revenue law in its application to the case which have form the ground of such serious complaint on she part and the order to the collector of st mary in accord with it be give two year before these case occur and in reference to a breach which be attempt by the subject of another power the application therefore to the case in question be inevitable as soon as the treaty by which these province be cede to the united state be ratify and all danger of further breach of we revenue law cease a order be give for the release of the vessel which have be seize and for the dismission of the libel which have be institute against she the principle of this system of reciprocity found on the law of the 3d of march 1815 have be since carry into effect with the kingdom of the netherland sweden prussium and with hamburg breman lubeck and oldenburg with a provision make by subsequent law in regard to the netherland prussium hamburg and breman that such produce and manufacture as could only be or most usually be first ship from the port of those country the same be import in vessel wholly belong to they subject should be consider and admit as they own manufacture and production the government of norway have by a ordinance open the port of that part of the dominion of the king of sweden to the vessel of the united state upon the payment of no other or higher duty than be pay by norwegian vessel from whatever place arrive and with whatever article laden they have request the reciprocal allowance for the vessel of norway in the port of the united state as this privilege be not within the scope of the act of the 3d of march 1815 and can only be grant by congress and as it may involve the commercial relation of the united state with other nation the subject be submit to the wisdom of congress i have present thus fully to you view we commercial relation with other power that see they in detail with each power and know the basis on which they rest congress may in its wisdom decide whether any change ought to be make and if any in what respect if this basis be unjust or unreasonable surely it ought to be abandon but if it be just and reasonable and any change in it will make concession subversive of equality and tend in its consequence to sap the foundation of we prosperity then the reason be equally strong for adhering to the ground already take and support it by such further regulation as may appear to be proper should any additional support be find necessary the question concern the construction of the first article of the treaty of ghent have be by a joint act of the representative of the united state and of great britain at the court of st petersburg submit to the decision of he imperial majesty the emperor of russium the result of that submission have not yet be receive the commissioner under the fifth article of that treaty not have be able to agree upon they decision they report to the two government accord to the provision of the treaty may be expect at a early day with spain the treaty of February 22 1819 have be partly carry into execution possession of east and west florida have be give to the united state but the officer charge with that service by a order from he catholic majesty deliver by he minister to the secretary of state and transmit by a special agent to the captain-general of cuba to whom it be direct and in whom the government of those province be vest have not only omit in contravention of the order of they sovereign the performance of the express stipulation to deliver over the archive and document relate to the property and sovereignty of those province all of which it be expect would have be deliver either before or when the troops be withdraw but defeat since every effort of the united state to obtain they especially those of the greatest importance this omission have give rise to several incident of a painful nature the character of which will be fully disclose by the document which will be hereafter communicate in every other circumstance the law of the 3d of march last for carry into effect that treaty have be duly attend to for the execution of that part which preserve in force for the government of the inhabitant for the term specify all the civil military and judicial power exercise by the exist government of those province a adequate number of officer as be presume be appoint and order to they respective station both province be form into one territory and a governor appoint for it but in consideration of the pre-existing division and of the distance and difficulty of communication between pensacolum the residence of the governor of west florida and st augustine that of the governor of east florida at which place the inconsiderable population of each province be principally collect two secretary be appoint the one to reside at pensacolum and the other at st augustine due attention be likewise pay to the execution of the law of the united state relate to the revenue and the slave trade which be extend to these province the whole territory be divide into three collection district that part lie between the river st mary and cape florida form one that from the cape to the apalachicolum another and that from the apalachicolum to the perdido the third to these district the usual number of revenue officer be appoint and to secure the due operation of these law one judge and a district attorney be appoint to reside at pensacolum and likewise one judge and a district attorney to reside at st augustine with a specify boundary between they and one marshal for the whole with authority to appoint a deputy in carry this law into effect and especially that part relate to the power of the exist government of those province it be think important in consideration of the short term for which it be to operate and the radical change which would be make at the approach session of congress to avoid expense to make no appointment which should not be absolutely necessary to give effect to those power to withdraw none of we citizen from they pursuit whereby to subject the government to claim which could not be gratify and the party to loss which it would be painful to witness it have be see with much concern that in the performance of these duty a collision arise between the governor of the territory and the judge appoint for the western district it be presume that the law under which this transitory government be organize and the commission which be grant to the officer who be appoint to execute each branch of the system and to which the commission be adapt would have be understand in the same sense by they in which they be understand by the executive much allowance be due to officer employ in each branch of this system and the more so as there be good cause to believe that each act under the conviction that he possess the power which he undertake to exercise of the officer hold the principal station i think it proper to observe that he accept it with reluctance in compliance with the invitation give he and from a high sense of duty to he country be willing to contribute to the consummation of a event which would insure complete protection to a important part of we union which have suffer much from incursion and invasion and to the defense of which he very gallant and patriotic service have be so signally and usefully devote from the intrinsic difficulty of execute law derive they origin from different source and so essentially different in many important circumstance the advantage and indeed the necessity of establish as soon as may be practicable a well-organized government over that territory on the principle of we system be apparent this subject be therefore recommend to the early consideration of congress in compliance with a injunction of the law of the 3d of march last three commissioner have also be appoint and a board organize for carry into effect the eleventh article of the treaty above recite make provision for the payment of such of we citizen as have well-founded claim on spain of the character specify by that treaty this board have enter on its duty and make some progress therein the commissioner and surveyor of he catholic majesty provide for by the fourth article of the treaty have not yet arrive in the united state but be soon expect as soon as they do arrive corresponding appointment will be make and every facility be afford for the due execution of this service the government of he most faithful majesty since the termination of the last session of congress have be remove from rio de janeiro to lisbon where a revolution similar to that which have occur in the neighbor kingdom of spain have in like manner be sanction by the accept and pledge faith of the reign monarch the diplomatic intercourse between the united state and the portuguese dominion interrupt by this important event have not yet be resume but the change of internal administration have already materially affect the commercial intercourse of the united state with the portuguese dominion the renewal of the public mission between the two country appear to be desirable at a early day it be understand that the colony in south america have have great success during the present year in the struggle for ' they independence the new government of colombium have extend its territory and considerably augment its strength and at bueno ayre where civil dissension have for some time before prevail greater harmony and better order appear to have be establish equal success have attend they effort in the province on the pacific it have long be manifest that it would be impossible for spain to reduce these colony by force and equally so that no condition short of they independence would be satisfactory to they it may therefore be presume and it be earnestly hope that the government of spain guide by enlighten and liberal council will find it to comport with its interest and due to its magnanimity to terminate this exhausting controversy on that basis to promote this result by friendly counsel with the government of spain will be the object of the government of the united state in conduct the fiscal operation of the year it have be find necessary to carry into full effect the act of the last session of congress authorize a loan of $ 5000000 this sum have be raise at a average premium of $ 559 per centum upon stock bear a interest at the rate of 5 per cent per annum redeemable at the option of the government after the 1st day of January 1835 there have be issue under the provision of this act $ 473529630 of 5 per cent stock and there have be or will be redeem during the year $ 319703071 of louisiana 6 per cent defer stock and mississippus stock there have therefore be a actual increase of the public debt contract during the year of $ 153826669 the receipt into the treasury from the 1st of January to the 30th of September last have amount to $ 1621919770 which with the balance of $ 119846121 in the treasury on the former day make the aggregate sum of $ 1741765891 the payment from the treasury during the same period have amount to $ 1565528847 leave in the treasury on the last-mentioned day the sum of $ 176237044 it be estimate that the receipt of the fourth quarter of the year will exceed the demand which will be make on the treasury during the same period and that the amount in the treasury on the 30th of September last will be increase on the 1st day of January next at the close of the last session it be anticipate that the progressive diminution of the public revenue in 1819 and 1820 which have be the result of the languid state of we foreign commerce in those year have in the latter year reach its extreme point of depression it have however be ascertain that that point be reach only at the termination of the first quarter of the present year from that time until the 30th of September last the duty secure have exceed those of the corresponding quarter of the last year $ 1172000 whilst the amount of debenture issue during the three first quarter of this year be $ 952000 less than that of the same quarter of the last year there be just grounds to believe that the improvement which have occur in the revenue during the last-mentioned period will not only be maintain but that it will progressively increase through the next and several succeed year so as to realize the result which be present upon that subject by the official report of the treasury at the commencement of the last session of congress under the influence of the most unfavorable circumstance the revenue for the next and subsequent year to the year 1825 will exceed the demand at present authorize by law it may fairly be presume that under the protection give to domestic manufacture by the exist law we shall become at no distant period a manufacturing country on a extensive scale possess as we do the raw material in such vast amount with a capacity to augment they to a indefinite extent raise within the country aliment of every kind to a amount far exceed the demand for home consumption even in the most unfavorable year and to be obtain always at a very moderate price skilled also as we people be in the mechanic art and in every improvement calculate to lessen the demand for and the price of labor it be manifest that they success in every branch of domestic industry may and will be carry under the encouragement give by the present duty to a extent to meet any demand which under a fair competition may be make upon it a considerable increase of domestic manufacture by diminish the importation of foreign will probably tend to lessen the amount of the public revenue as however a large proportion of the revenue which be derive from duty be raise from other article than manufacture the demand for which will increase with we population it be believe that a fund will still be raise from that source adequate to the greater part of the public expenditure especially as those expenditure should we continue to be bless with peace will be diminish by the completion of the fortification dockyard and other public work by the augmentation of the navy to the point to which it be propose to carry it and by the payment of the public debt include pension for military service it can not be doubt that the more complete we internal resource and the less dependent we be on foreign power for every national as well as domestic purpose the greater and more stable will be the public felicity by the increase of domestic manufacture will the demand for the rude material at home be increase and thus will the dependence of the several part of we union on each other and the strength of the union itself be proportionably augmented in this process which be very desirable and inevitable under the exist duty the resource which obviously present themselves to supply a deficiency in the revenue should it occur be the interest which may derive the principal benefit from the change if domestic manufacture be raise by duty on foreign the deficiency in the fund necessary for public purpose should be supply by duty on the former at the last session it seem doubtful whether the revenue derive from the present source would be adequate to all the great purpose of we union include the construction of we fortification the augmentation of the navy and the protection of we commerce against the danger to which it be expose have the deficiency be such as to subject we to the necessity either to abandon those measure of defense or to resort to other means for adequate fund the course present to the adoption of a virtuous and enlighten people appear to be a plain one it must be gratify to all to know that this necessity do not exist nothing however in contemplation of such important object which can be easily provide for should be leave to hazard it be think that the revenue may receive a augmentation from the exist source and in a manner to aid we manufacture without hasten prematurely the result which have be suggest it be believe that a moderate additional duty on certain article would have that effect without be liable to any serious objection the examination of the whole coast for the construction of permanent fortification from st croix to the sabine with the exception of part of the territory lately acquire will be complete in the present year as will be the survey of the mississippus under the resolution of the house of representative

and duty may require the revolutionary movement in the spanish province in this hemisphere attract the attention and excite the sympathy of we fellow-citizen from its commencement this feeling be natural and honorable to they from cause which need not be communicate to you it have be gratify to all to see the general acquiescence which have be manifest in the policy which the constitute authority have deem it proper to pursue in regard to this contest as soon as the movement assume such a steady and consistent form as to make the success of the province probable the rights to which they be entitle by the law of nation as equal party to a civil war be extend to they each party be permit to enter we port with its public and private ship and to take from they every article which be the subject of commerce with other nation we citizen also have carry on commerce with both party and the government have protect it with each in article not contraband of war through the whole of this contest the united state have remain neutral and have fulfil with the utmost impartiality all the obligation incident to that character this contest have now reach such a stage and be attend with such decisive success on the part of the province that it merit the most profound consideration whether they right to the rank of independent nation with all the advantage incident to it in they intercourse with the united state be not complete bueno ayre assume that rank by a formal declaration in 1816 and have enjoy it since 1810 free from invasion by the parent country the province compose the republic of colombium after have separately declare they independence be unite by a fundamental law of the 17th of December 1819 a strong spanish force occupy at that time certain part of the territory within they limit and wage a destructive war that force have since be repeatedly defeat and the whole of it either make prisoner or destroy or expel from the country with the exception of a inconsiderable portion only which be blockade in two fortress the province on the pacific have likewise be very successful chili declare independence in 1818 and have since enjoy it undisturbed and of late by the assistance of chili and bueno ayre the revolution have extend to peru of the movement in mexico we information be less authentic but it be nevertheless distinctly understand that the new government have declare its independence and that there be now no opposition to it there nor a force to make any for the last three year the government of spain have not send a single corps of troops to any part of that country nor be there any reason to believe it will send any in future thus it be manifest that all those province be not only in the full enjoyment of they independence but consider the state of the war and other circumstance that there be not the most remote prospect of they be deprive of it when the result of such a contest be manifestly settle the new government have a claim to recognition by other power which ought not to be resist civil war too often excite feeling which the party can not control the opinion entertain by other power as to the result may assuage those feeling and promote a accommodation between they useful and honorable to both the delay which have be observe in make a decision on this important subject will it be presume have afford a unequivocal proof to spain as it must have do to other power of the high respect entertain by the united state for she rights and of they determination not to interfere with they the province belong to this hemisphere be we neighbor and have successively as each portion of the country acquire its independence press they recognition by a appeal to fact not to be contest and which they think give they a just title to it to motive of interest this government have invariably disclaim all pretension be resolve to take no part in the controversy or other measure in regard to it which should not merit the sanction of the civilized world to other claim a just sensibility have be always feel and frankly acknowledge but they in themselves could never become a adequate cause of action it be incumbent on this government to look to every important fact and circumstance on which a sound opinion could be form which have be do when we regard then the great length of time which this war have be prosecute the complete success which have attend it in favor of the province the present condition of the party and the utter inability of spain to produce any change in it we be compel to conclude that its fate be settle and that the province which have declare they independence and be in the enjoyment of it ought to be recognize of the view of the spanish government on this subject no particular information have be recently receive it may be presume that the successful progress of the revolution through such a long series of year gain strength and extend annually in every direction and embrace by the late important event with little exception all the dominion of spain south of the united state on this continent place thereby the complete sovereignty over the whole in the hand of the people will reconcile the parent country to a accommodation with they on the basis of they unqualified independence nor have any authentic information be recently receive of the disposition of other power respect it a sincere desire have be cherish to act in concert with they in the propose recognition of which several be some time past duly apprise but it be understand that they be not prepare for it the immense space between those power even those which border on the atlantic and these province make the movement a affair of less interest and excitement to they than to we it be probable therefore that they have be less attentive to its progress than we have be it may be presume however that the late event will dispel all doubt of the result in propose this measure it be not contemplate to change thereby in the slightest manner we friendly relation with either of the party but to observe in all respects as heretofore should the war be continue the most perfect neutrality between they of this friendly disposition a assurance will be give to the government of spain to whom it be presume it will be as it ought to be satisfactory the measure be propose under a thorough conviction that it be in strict accord with the law of nation that it be just and right as to the party and that the united state owe it to they station and character in the world as well as to they essential interest to adopt it should congress concur in the view herein present they will doubtless see the propriety of make the necessary appropriation for carry it into effect jame monroe washington _ march 9 1822 _ _ to the house of representative _ : i transmit a report from the secretary of war together with the annual return of the militia of the united state and a exhibit of the arm accouterment and ammunition of the several state and territory of the united state prepare in conformity with the militia law on that subject jame monroe washington _ march 12 1822 _ _ to the senate and house of representative of the united state _ : i lay before the senate the copy of a supplementary report make by william lambert in relation to the longitude of the capitol from greenwich in pursuance of a joint resolution of the two house of congress of the 3d of march 1821 and i subjoin a extract from the letter of mr lambert submit that report jame monroe washington _ march 26 1822 _ _ to the senate and house of representative of the united state _ : congress have suspend the appropriation at the last session for the fortification at dauphine island in consequence of a doubt which be entertain of the propriety of that position the further prosecution of the work be suspend and a order give as intimate in the message of the 3d of December to the board of engineer and naval commissioner to examine that part of the coast and particularly that position as also the position at mobile point with which it be connect and to report they opinion thereon which have be do and which report be herewith communicate by this report it appear to be still the opinion of the board that the construction of work at both these position be of great importance to the defense of new orlean and of all that portion of we union which be connect with and dependent on the mississippus and on the other water which empty into the gulf of mexico between that river and cape florida that the subject may be fully before congress i transmit also a copy of the former report of the board be that on which the work be undertake and have be in part execute approve as i do the opinion of the board i consider it my duty to state the reason on which i adopt the first report especially as they be in part suggest by the occurrence of the late war the policy which induce congress to decide on and provide for the defense of the coast immediately after the war be found on the marked event of that interesting epoch the vast body of man which it be find necessary to call into the field through the whole extent of we maritime frontier and the number who perish by exposure with the immense expenditure of money and waste of property which follow be to be trace in a eminent degree to the defenseless condition of the coast it be to mitigate these evil in future war and even for the higher purpose of prevent war itself that the decision be form to make the coast so far as it might be practicable impregnable and that the measure necessary to that great object have be pursue with so much zeal since it be know that no part of we union be more expose to invasion by the numerous avenue lead to it or more defenseless by the thinness of the neighbor population or offer a greater temptation to invasion either as a permanent acquisition or as a prize to the cupidity of grasp invader from the immense amount of produce deposit there than the city of new orlean it be know also that the seizure of no part of we union could affect so deeply and vitally the immediate interest of so many state and of so many of we fellow-citizen comprise all that extensive territory and numerous population which be connect with and dependent on the mississippus as the seizure of that city strong work well post be therefore deem absolutely necessary for its protection it be not however by the mississippus only or the water which communicate directly with or approach nearest to new orlean that the town be assailable it will be recollect that in the late war the public solicitude be excite not so much by the danger which menace it in those direction as by the apprehension that while a feint might be make there the main force landing either in the bay of mobile or other water between that bay and the rigolet would be throw above the town in the rear of the army which have be collect there for its defense full confidence be entertain that that gallant army lead by the gallant and able chief who command it would repel any attack to which it might be expose in front but have such a force be throw above the town and a position take on the bank of the river the disadvantage to which we troops would have be subject attack in front and rear as they might have be may easily be conceive as they supplies would have be cut off they could not long have remain in the city and withdraw from it it must have fall immediately into the hand of the force below in ascend the river to attack the force above the attack must have be make to great disadvantage since it must have be on such ground and at such time as the enemy prefer these consideration shew that defens other than such as be immediately connect with the city be of great importance to its safety a attempt to seize new orlean and the lower part of the mississippus will be make only by a great power or a combination of several power with a strong naval and land force the latter of which must be bring in transport which may sail in shallow water if the defens around new orlean be well post and of sufficient strength to repel any attack which may be make on they the city can be assail only by a land force which must pass in the direction above suggest between the rigolet and the bay of mobile it become therefore a object of high importance to present such a obstacle to such a attempt as would defeat it should it be make fortification be useful for the defense of post to prevent the approach to city and the passage of river but as work they effect can not be feel beyond the reach of they cannon they be formidable in other respects by the body of man within they which may be remove and apply to other purpose between the rigolet and the bay of mobile there be a chain of island at the extremity of which be dauphine island which form with mobile point from which it be distant about 3-1\/4 mile the entrance into the bay of mobile which lead through that part of the state of alabama to the town of mobile and blakeley the distance between dauphine island and the rigolet be 90 mile the principal island between they be massacre horn ship and cat island near to which there be anchorage for large ship of war the first object be to prevent the landing of any force for the purpose above state between the rigolet and the bay of mobile the second to defeat that force in case it should be land when the distance from one point to the other be consider it be believe that it would be impossible to establish work so near to each other as to prevent the landing of such a force its defeat therefore should be effectually provide for if the arrangement should be such as to make that result evident it ought to be fairly conclude that the attempt would not be make and thus we should accomplish in the best mode possible and with the least expense the complete security of this important part of we union the great object of we system of defense for the whole there be some other view of this subject which it be think will merit particular attention in decide the point in question not be able to establish a chain of post at least for the present along the whole coast from the rigolet to dauphine island or on all the island between they at which point shall we begin should a attack on the city be anticipate it can not be doubt that a adequate force would immediately be order there for its defense if the enemy should despair of make a impression on the work near the town it may be presume that they would promptly decide to make the attempt in the manner and in the line above suggest between the rigolet and the bay of mobile it will be obvious that the nearer the fortification be erect to the rigolet with a view to this object should it be on cat or ship island for example the wider would the passage be leave open between that work and the bay of mobile for such a enterprise the main army be draw to new orlean would be ready to meet such a attempt near the rigolet or at any other point not distant from the city it be probable therefore that the enemy profit of a fair wind would make he attempt at the greatest distance compatible with he object from that point and at the bay of mobile should there not be work there of sufficient strength to prevent it should however strong work be erect there such as be sufficient not only for they own defense against any attack which might be make on they but to hold a force connect with that which might be draw from the neighboring country capable of cooperate with the force at the city and which would doubtless be order to those work in the event of war it would be dangerous for the invade force to land anywhere between the rigolet and the bay of mobile and to pass toward the mississippus above the city lest such a body might be throw in its rear as to cut off its retreat these consideration show the great advantage of establish at the mouth of the bay of mobile very strong work such as would be adequate to all the purpose suggest if fortification be necessary only to protect we country and city against the entry of large ship of war into we bay and river they would be of little use for the defense of new orlean since that city can not be approach so near either by the mississippus or in any other direction by such vessel for they to make a attack on it in the gulf within we limit west of florida which have be acquire since these work be decide on and commence there be no bay or river into which large ship of war can enter as a defense therefore against a attack from such vessel extensive work would be altogether unnecessary either at mobile point or at dauphine island since sloop of war only can navigate the deepest channel but it be not for that purpose alone that these work be intend it be to provide also against a formidable invasion both by land and sea the object of which may be to shake the foundation of we system should such small work be erect and such a invasion take place they would be sure to fall at once into the hand of the invader and to be turn against we whether the acquisition of florida may be consider as afford a inducement to make any change in the position or strength of these work be a circumstance which also merit attention from the view which i have take of the subject i be of opinion that it should not the defense of new orlean and of the river mississippus against a powerful invasion be one of the great object of such extensive work that object would be essentially abandon if they should be establish eastward of the bay of mobile since the force to be collect in they would be place at too great a distance to allow the cooperation necessary for those purpose between it and that at the city in addition to which it may be observe that by carry they to pensacolum or farther to the east that bay would fall immediately in case of such invasion into the hand of the enemy whereby such cooperation would be render utterly impossible and the state of alabama would also be leave wholly unprotected with a view to such formidable invasion of which we should never lose sight and of the great object to which it would be direct i think that very strong work at some point within the gulf of mexico will be find indispensable i think also that those work ought to be establish at the bay of mobile -- one at mobile point and the other on dauphine island -- whereby the enemy would be exclude and the complete command of that bay with all the advantage attend it be secure to ourselves in the case of such invasion it will it be presume be deem necessary to collect at some point other than at new orlean a strong force capable of move in any direction and afford aid to any part which may be attack and in my judgment no position present so many advantage as a point of rendezvous for such force as the mouth of that bay the fortification at the rigolet will defend the entrance by one passage into lake pontchartrain and also into pearl river which empty into the gulf at that point between the rigolet and mobile bay there be but two inlet which deserve the name those of st loui and pascagolum the entrance into which be too shallow even for the smallest vessel and from the rigolet to mobile bay the whole coast be equally shallow afford the depth of a few foot of water only cat island which be nearest the rigolet be about 7-1\/2 mile distant from the coast and 30 from the rigolet ship island be distant about 10 mile from cat island and 12 from the coast between these island and the coast the water be very shallow as to the precise depth of water in approach those island from the gulf the report of the topographical engineer not have yet be receive it be impossible to speak with precision but admit it to be such as for frigate and even ship of the line to enter the anchorage at both be unsafe be much expose to northwest wind along the coast therefore there be no motive for such strong work on we part -- no town to guard no inlet into the country to defend -- and if place on the island and the entrance to they be such as to admit large ship of war distant as they be from the coast it would be more easy for the enemy to assail they with effect the position however at mobile bay be essentially different that bay take its name from the mobile river which be form by the junction of the alabama and tombigbee which extend each about 300 mile into the interior approach at they head water near the tennessee river if the enemy possess its mouth and fortify mobile point and dauphine island be superior at sea it would be very difficult for we to dispossess he of either even of mobile point and hold that position pensacolum would soon fall as without incur great expense in the construction of work there it would present but a feeble resistance to a strong force in its rear if we have a work at mobile point only the enemy might take dauphine island which would afford he great aid in attack the point and enable he even should we succeed in repel the attack to render we great mischief there and throughout the whole gulf in every view which can be take of the subject it appear indispensable for we to command the entrance into mobile bay and that decision be take i think the consideration which favor the occupation of dauphine island by a strong work be conclusive it be proper to observe that after the repulse before new orlean in the late war the british force take possession of dauphine island and hold it till the peace under neither of the report of the board of engineer and naval commissioner could any but sloop of war enter the bay or the anchorage between dauphine and pelican island both report give to that anchorage 18 foot at low water and 20-1\/2 at high the only difference between they consist in this that in the first a bar lead to the anchorage reduce the depth of water to 12 foot at low tide be omit in neither case could frigate enter though sloop of war of larger size might the whole scope however of this reasoning turn on a different principle -- on the work necessary to defend that bay and by means thereof new orlean the mississippus and all the surrounding country against a powerful invasion both by land and sea and not on the precise depth of water in any of the approach to the bay or to the island the reasoning which be applicable to the work near new orlean and at the bay of mobile be equally so in certain respects to those which be to be erect for the defense of all the bay and river along the other part of the coast all those work be also erect on a greater scale than would be necessary for the sole purpose of prevent the passage of we inlet by large ship of war they be in most instance form for defense against a more powerful invasion both by land and sea there be however some difference between the work which be deem necessary in the gulf and those in other part of we union found on the peculiar situation of that part of the coast the vast extent of the mississippus the great outlet and channel of commerce for so many state all of which may be affect by the seizure of that city or of any part of the river to a great extent above it be one of those striking peculiarity which require particular provision the thinness of the population near the city make it necessary that the force requisite for its defense should be call from distant part and state be another the danger which the army assemble at new orlean would be expose to of be cut off in case the enemy should throw a force on the river above it from the difficulty of ascend the river to attack it and of make a retreat in any other direction be a third for a attack on the city of new orlean mobile bay or any part of the intermediate coast ship of war would be necessary only as a convoy to protect the transport against a naval force on they passage and on they approach to the shore for the landing of the man and on they return home in case they should be repulse on the important subject of we defens generally i think proper to observe that the system be adopt immediately after the late war by congress on great consideration and a thorough knowledge of the effect of that war -- by the enormous expense attend it by the waste of life of property and by the general distress of the country the amount of debt incur in that war and due at its conclusion without take into the estimate other loss have be heretofore communicate need not now be repeat the interest of the debt thus incur be four time more than the sum necessary by annual appropriation for the completion of we whole system of defense land and naval to the extent provide for and within the time specify when that system shall be complete the expense of construction will cease and we expenditure be proportionally diminish should another war occur before it be complete the experience of the last mark in character too strong to be mistaken its inevitable consequence and should such war occur and find we unprepared for it what will be we justification to the enlighten body whom we represent for not have complete these defens that this system should not have be adopt before the late war can not be a cause of surprise to anyone because all might wish to avoid every expense the necessity of which might be in any degree doubtful but with the experience of that war before we it be think there be no cause for hesitation will the completion of these work and the augmentation of we navy to the point contemplate by law require the imposition of onerous burthen on we fellow-citizen such as they can not or will not bear have such or any burthen be impose to advance the system to its present state it be know that no burthen whatever have be impose on the contrary that all the direct or internal tax have be long repeal and none pay but those which be indirect and voluntary such as be impose on article import from foreign country most of which be luxury and on the vessel employ in the transportation -- tax which some of we most enlighten citizen think ought to be impose on many of the article for the encouragement of we manufacture even if the revenue derive from they could be dispense with it be know also that in all other respect we condition as a nation be in the highest degree prosperous and flourishing nearly half the debt incur in the late war have already be discharge and considerable progress have also be make in the completion of this system of defense and in the construction of other work of great extent and utility by the revenue derive from these source and from the sale of the public land i may add also that a very generous provision have be make from the same source for the survive officer and soldier of we revolutionary army these important fact show that this system have be so far execute and may be complete without any real inconvenience to the public be it however otherwise i have full confidence that any burthen which might be find necessary for the completion of this system in both its branch within the term contemplated or much sooner should any emergency require it would be call for rather than complain of by we fellow-citizen from these view applicable to the very important subject of we defens generally as well as to the work at dauphine island i think it my duty to recommend to congress a appropriation for the latter i consider the withhold it at the last session as the expression only of a doubt by congress of the propriety of the position and not as a definitive opinion suppose that that question would be decide at the present session i cause the position and such part of the coast as be particularly connect with it to be reexamine that all the light on which the decision as to the appropriation could depend might be fully before you in the first survey the report of which be that on which the work intend for the defense of new orlean the mississippus the bay of mobile and all the country dependent on those water be sanction by the executive the commissioner be industriously engage about six month i should have communicate that very able and interesting document then but from a doubt how far the interest of we country would justify its publication a circumstance which i now mention that the attention of congress may be draw to it jame monroe march 26 1822 _ to the senate of the united state _ : have execute the act entitle a act to reduce and fix the military peace establishment of the united state on great consideration and accord to my best judgment and infer from the rejection of the nomination of colonel towson and colonel gadsden officer of very distinguish merit that the view which i take of that law have not be well understand i hereby withdraw all the nomination on which the senate have not decide until i can make a more full communication and explanation of that view and of the principle on which i have act in the discharge of that very delicate and important duty jame monroe washington _ march 27 1822 _ _ to the house of representative _ : in compliance with a resolution of the house of representative of the 1st instant request the president to communicate such information as he may possess relative to any private claim against the piece of land in the delaware river know by the name of the peapatch and to state if any and what process have be institute in behalf of such claim i herewith transmit a report from the secretary of war furnish the information require jame monroe washington _ march 28 1822 _ _ to the house of representative _ : i transmit the original report on the subject of the fortification on dauphin island and mobile point be those on which the work be undertake and have be in part execute the doubt express as to the propriety of publication be applicable to this document which would have accompany the message of the 26th have it be prepare in time jame monroe washington _ march 29 1822 _ _ to the senate and house of representative of the united state _ : i transmit to congress the translation of two letter from the minister of france to the secretary of state relate to the claim of the heir of caron de beaumarchais upon this government with the document therewith inclose recommend they to the favorable consideration of congress jame monroe washington _ April 5 1822 _ _ to the house of representative of the united state _ : i communicate herewith to the house a report from the secretary of war contain the information request by they resolution of the 5th ultimo it may be proper further to add that the secretary of both the territory have occasionally require and receive the aid of the military force of the united state station within they respectively to carry into effect the act of they authority the government of east and west florida be under the spanish dominion almost exclusively military the governor of both be military officer and unite in they person the chief authority both civil and military the principle upon which the act of congress of the last session provide for the temporary government of the newly cede province be carry into execution have be communicate to congress in my message at the opening of the session it be to leave the authority of the country as they be find exist at the time of the cession to be exercise until the meeting of congress when it be know that the introduction of a system more congenial to we own institution would be one of the earliest and most important subject of they deliberation from this among other obvious consideration military officer be appoint to take possession of both province but as the military command of general jackson be to cease on the 1st of June general gaine the officer next in command then here who be first designate to take possession of east florida receive from I a verbal direction to give such effect to any requisition from the governor for military aid to enforce he authority as the circumstance might require it be not foresee that the command in both the province would before further legislation by congress on that subject devolve upon the secretary of the territory but have it be foresee the same direction would have be give as applicable to they no authority have be give to either of the secretary to issue command to that portion of the army which be in florida and whenever the aid of _ the military _ have be require by they it have be by write requisition to the officer command the troops who have yield compliance thereto doubtless under the direction receive from general gaine as understand by he to be authorize shortly before the meeting of congress a letter be receive at the war department from colonel brooke the officer command at pensacolum request instruction how far he be to consider these requisition as authoritative but the assurance that a new organization of the government be immediately to be authorize by congress be a motive for supersede any specific decision upon the inquiry jame monroe washington _ April 6 1822 _ _ to the house of representative of the united state _ : in compliance with a resolution of the house of representative request the president of the united state to cause to be furnish to that house certain information relate to the amount of the public money pay to the attorney-general over and above he salary fix by law since the 1st of January 1817 specify the time when pay and the fund out of which such payment have be make i transmit a paper mark a contain the information desire i transmit also a paper marked b contain a statement of sum pay to attorney general of the united state prior to the 1st of January 1817 and in the paper marked c a like statement of sum advance to district attorney for service not require of they by law these latter document be necessary to a full view of the subject it be think proper to comprise they in this communication by the act of 24th September 1789 institute the office of attorney general it be make he duty to prosecute and conduct all suit in the supreme court in which the united state should be concern and to give he advice and opinion upon question of law when require by the president of the united state or when request by the head of any of the department touch any matter that might concern they department it will be see therefore by the statement communicate that no money whatever have be pay to the attorney general for he service in that character nor for any duty belong to he office beyond he salary as fix by law it will also be shew by the document communicate that the construction give of the law impose duty on the attorney general and district attorney have be invariably the same since the institution of the government on the same authority it be think that the compensation allow to the present attorney general for certain service consider they importance and the time employ in render they do not exceed regard precedent what might fairly be claim jame monroe April 13 1822 _ to the senate of the united state _ : have cause to infer that the reason which lead to the construction which i give to the act of the last session entitle a act to reduce and fix the peace establishment of the united state have not be well understand i consider it my duty to explain more fully the view which i take of that act and of the principle on which i execute the very difficult and important duty enjoin on I by it to do justice to the subject it be think proper to show the actual state of the army before the passage of the late act the force in service the several corps of which it be compose and the grade and number of officer command it by see distinctly the body in all its part on which the law operate viewing also with a just discrimination the spirit policy and positive injunction of that law with reference to precedent establish in a former analogous case we shall be enable to ascertain with great precision whether these injunction have or have not be strictly comply with by the act of the 3d of march 1815 entitle a act fix the military peace establishment of the united state the whole force in service be reduce to 10000 man -- infantry artillery and rifleman -- exclusive of the corps of engineer which be retain in its then state the regiment of light artillery be retain as it have be organize by the act of 3d march 1814 the infantry be form into 9 regiment 1 of which consist of rifleman the regiment of light artillery infantry rifleman and corps of engineer be command each by a colonel lieutenant-colonel and the usual battalion and company officer and the battalion of the corps of artillery of which there be 8 -- 4 for the northern and 4 for the southern division -- be command by lieutenant-colonel or major there be 4 of each grade there be therefore in the army at the time the late law be pass 12 colonel belong to those branch of the military establishment two major-general and 4 brigadier be likewise retain in service by this act but the staff in several of its branch not be provide for and be indispensable and the omission inadvertent proceeding from the circumstance under which the act be pass be at the close of the session at which time intelligence of the peace be receive it be provisionally retain by the president and provide for afterwards by the act of the 24th April 1816 by this act the ordnance department be preserve as it have be organize by the act of February 8 1815 with 1 colonel 1 lieutenant-colonel 2 major 10 captain and 10 first second and third lieutenant one adjutant and inspector general of the army and 2 adjutants-general -- 1 for the northern and 1 for the southern division -- be retain this act provide also for a paymaster-general with a suitable number of regimental and battalion paymaster as a part of the general staff constitute the military peace establishment and the pay department and every other branch of the staff be subject to the rule and article of war by the act of march 2 1821 it be ordain that the military peace establishment should consist of 4 regiment of artillery and 7 of infantry with such officer of engineer ordnance and staff as be therein specify it be provide that each regiment of artillery should consist of 1 colonel 1 lieutenant-colonel 1 major and 9 company with the usual company officer 1 of which to be equip as light artillery and that there should be attach to each regiment of artillery 1 supernumerary captain to perform ordnance duty thereby merge the regiment of artillery and ordnance department into these 4 regiment it be provide also that each regiment of infantry should consist of 1 colonel 1 lieutenant colonel 1 major and 10 company with the usual company officer the corps of engineer bombardier except with the topographical engineer and they assistant be to be retain under the exist organization the former establishment as to the number of major general and brigadier be curtail one-half and the office of inspector and adjutant general to the army and of adjutant-general to each division annul and that of adjutant general to the army institute the quartermaster paymaster and commissary department be also specially provide for as be every other branch of the staff all of which receive a new modification and be subject to the rule and article of war the immediate and direct operation of this act on the military peace establishment of 1815 be that of reduction from which no officer belong to it be exempt unless it might be the topographical engineer for in retain the corps of engineer as be manifest as well by the clear import of the section relate to it as by the provision of every other clause of the act reference be have to the organization and not to the officer of the corps the establishment of 1815 be reduce from 10000 to about 6000 man the 8 battalion of artillery constitute what be call the corps of artillery and the regiment of light artillery as establish by the act of 1815 be to be incorporate together and form into 4 new regiment the regiment of infantry be to be reduce from 9 to 7 the rifle regiment be break three of the general officer be to be reduce with very many of the officer belong to the several corps of the army and particularly of the infantry all the provision of the act declare of what number of officer and man the several corps provide for by it should thenceforward consist and not that any corps as then exist or any officer of any corps unless the topographical engineer be except should be retain have it be intend to reduce the officer by corps or to exempt the officer of any corps from the operation of the law or in the organization of the several new corps to confine the selection of the officer to be place in they to the several corps of the like kind then exist and not extend it to the whole military establishment include the staff or to confine the reduction to a proportional number of each corps and of each grade in each corps the object in either instance might have be easily accomplish by a declaration to that effect no such declaration be make nor can such intention be infer we see on the contrary that every corps of the army and staff be to be reorganize and most of they reduce in officer and man and that in arrange the officer from the old to the new corps full power be grant to the president to take they from any and every corps of the former establishment and place they in the latter in this latter grant of power it be proper to observe that the most comprehensive term that could be adopt be use the authority be to cause the arrangement to be make from the officer of the several _ corps _ then in the service of the united state comprise of course every corps of the staff as well as of artillery and infantry and not from the _ corps of troops _ as in the former act and without any limitation as to grade it merit particular attention that although the object of this latter act be reduction and such its effect on a extensive scale 5 new office be create by it -- 4 of the grade of colonel for the 4 regiment of artillery and that of adjutant-general for the army three of the first mention be altogether new the corps have be newly create and although 1 officer of that grade as applicable to the corps of light artillery have exist yet as that regiment be reduce and all its part reorganize in another form and with other duty be incorporate into the 4 new regiment the commander be manifestly displaced and incapable of take the command of either of the new regiment or any station in they until he should be authorize to do so by a new appointment the same remark be applicable to the office of adjutant-general to the army it be a office of new creation differ from that of adjutant and inspector general and likewise from that of adjutant-general to a division which be severally annul it differ from the first in title rank and pay and from the two latter because they have be create by law each for a division whereas the new office be institute without such special designation could have relation only to the whole army it be manifest therefore that neither of those officer have any right to this new station nor to any other station unless he should be specially appoint to it the principle of reduction be applicable to every officer in every corps it be proper also to observe that the duty of adjutant-general under the exist arrangement correspond in almost every circumstance with those of the late adjutant and inspector general and not with those of a adjutant-general of a division to give effect to this law the president be authorize by the twelfth section to cause the officer noncommissioned officer artificer musician and private of the several corps then in the service of the united state to be arrange in such manner as to form and complete out of the same the force thereby provide for and to cause the supernumerary officer noncommissioned officer artificer musician and private to be discharge from the service in execute this very delicate and important trust i act with the utmost precaution sensible of what i owe to my country i feel strongly the obligation of observe the utmost impartiality in select those officer who be to be retain in execute this law i have no personal object to accomplish or feel to gratify -- no one to retain no one to remove have on great consideration fix the principle on which the reduction should be make i availed myself of the example of my predecessor by appoint through the proper department a board of general officer to make the selection and whose report i adopt in transfer the officer from the old to the new corps the utmost care be take to place they in the latter in the grade and corps to which they have respectively belong in the former so far as it might be practicable this though not enjoin by the law appear to be just and proper be never depart from except in peculiar case and under imperious circumstance in fill the original vacancy in the artillery and in the newly create office of adjutant-general i consider myself at liberty to place in they any officer belong to any part of the whole military establishment whether of the staff or line in fill original vacancy -- that be office newly create -- it be my opinion as a general principle that congress have no right under the constitution to impose any restraint by law on the power grant to the president so as to prevent he make a free selection of proper person for these office from the whole body of he fellow-citizen without however enter here into that question i have no hesitation in declare it as my opinion that the law fully authorize a selection from any branch of the whole military establishment of 1815 justified therefore as i think myself in take that range by the very highest sanction the sole object to which i have to direct my attention be the merit of the officer to be select for these station three general of great merit be either to be dismiss or otherwise provide for the very gallant and patriotic defender of new orlean have intimate he intention to retire but at my suggestion express he willingness to accept the office of commissioner to receive the cession of the florida and of governor for a short time of that territory as to one therefore there be no difficulty for the other two provision could only be make in the mode which be adopt general macomb who have signalize himself in the defense of plattsburg be place at the head of the corps of engineer to which he have originally belong and in which he have acquire great experience colonel armistead then at the head of that corps have voluntarily accept one of the new regiment of artillery for which he possess very suitable qualification general atkinson likewise a officer of great merit be appoint to the newly create office of adjutant-general brevet general porter a officer of great experience in the artillery and merit be appoint to the command of another of those regiment colonel fenwick then the oldest lieutenant-colonel of artillery and who have suffer much in the late war by severe wound be appoint to a third and colonel towson who have serve with great distinction in the same corps and be twice brevett for he gallantry in the late war be appoint to the last remain one general atkinson have decline the office of adjutant general colonel gadsden a officer of distinguished merit and believe to possess qualification suitably adapt to it be appoint in he stead in make the arrangement the merit of colonel butler and colonel jone be not overlook the former be assign to the place which he would have hold in the line if he have retain he original lineal commission and the latter to he commission in the line which he have continue to hold with he staff appointment that the reduction of the army and the arrangement of the officer from the old to the new establishment and the appointment refer to be in every instance strictly conformable to law will i think be apparent to the arrangement generally no objection have be hear it have be make however to the appointment to the original vacancy and particularly to those of colonel towson and colonel gadsden to those appointment therefore further attention be due if they be improper it must be either that they be illegal or that the officer do not merit the office confer on they the acknowledged merit of the officer and the peculiar fitness for the office to which they be respectively appoint must preclude all objection on that head have already suggest my impression that in fill office newly create to which on no principle whatever anyone could have a claim of right congress could not under the constitution restrain the free selection of the president from the whole body of he fellow-citizen i shall only further remark that if that impression be well found all objection to these appointment must cease if the law impose such restraint it would in that case be void but accord to my judgment the law impose none a objection to the legality of those appointment must be found either on the principle that those officer be not comprise within the corps then in the service of the united state -- that be do not belong to the peace establishment -- or that the power grant by the word arrange impose on the president the necessity of place in these new office person of the same grade only from the old it be believe that neither objection be well found colonel towson belong to one of the corps then in the service of the united state or in other word of the military peace establishment by the act of 1815-16 the pay department of which the paymaster general be the chief be make one of the branch of the staff and he and all those under he be subject to the rule and article of war the appointment therefore of he and especially to a new office be strictly conformable to law the only difference between the fifth section of the act of 1815 for reduce the army and the twelfth section of the act of 1821 for still further reduce it by which the power to carry those law into effect be grant to the president in each instance consist in this that by the former he be to cause the arrangement to be make of the officer noncommissioned officer musician and private of the several _ corps of troops _ then in the service of the united state whereas in the latter the term _ troops _ be omit it can not be doubt that that omission have a object and that it be thereby intend to guard against misconstruction in so very material and important a circumstance by authorize the application of the act unequivocally to every corps of the staff as well as of the line with that word a much wider range be give to the act of 1815 on the reduction which then take place than under the last act the omission of it from the last act together with all the sanction which be give by congress to the construction of the law in the reduction make under the former could not fail to dispel all doubt as to the extent of the power grant by the last law and of the principle which ought to guide and on which it be thereby make the duty of the president to execute it with respect to the other objection -- that be that officer of the same grade only ought to have be transfer to these new office -- it be equally unfounded it be admit that officer may be take from the old corps and reduce and arrange in the new in inferior grade as be do under the former reduction this admission put a end to the objection in this case for if a officer may be reduce and arrange from one corps to another by a entire change of grade require a new commission and a new nomination to the senate i see no reason why a officer may not be advance in like manner in both instance the grade in the old corps be alike disregard the transfer from it to the new turn on the merit of the party and it be believe that the claim in this instance be feel by all with peculiar sensibility the claim of colonel towson be the stronger because the arrangement of he to the office to which he be now nominate be not to one from which any officer have be remove and to which any other officer may in any view of the case be suppose to have have a claim as colonel gadsden hold the office of inspector-general and as such be acknowledge by all to belong to the staff of the army it be not perceive on what ground he appointment can be object to if such a construction be to be give to the act of 1821 as to confine the transfer of officer from the old to the new establishment to the _ corps of troops _ -- that be to the line of the army -- the whole staff of the army in every branch would not only be exclude from any appointment in the new establishment but altogether disband from the service it would follow also that all the office of the staff under the new arrangement must be fill by officer belong to the new establishment after its organization and they arrangement in it other consequence not less serious would follow if the right of the president to fill these original vacancy by the selection of officer from any branch of the whole military establishment be deny he would be compel to place in they officer of the same grade whose corps have be reduce and they with they the effect therefore of the law as to those appointment would be to legislate into office man who have be already legislate out of office take from the president all agency in they appointment such a construction would not only be subversive of the obvious principle of the constitution but utterly inconsistent with the spirit of the law itself since it would provide office for a particular grade and fix every member of that grade in those office at a time when every other grade be reduce and among they general and other officer of the highest merit it would also defeat every object of selection since colonel of infantry would be place at the head of regiment of artillery a service in which they might have have no experience and for which they might in consequence be unqualified have omit in the message to congress at the commencement of the session to state the principle on which this law have be execute and have imperfectly explain they in the message to the senate of the 17th of January last i deem it particularly incumbent on I as well from a motive of respect to the senate as to place my conduct in the duty impose on I by that act in a clear point of view to make this communication at this time the example under the law of 1815 whereby officer be reduce and arrange from the old corps to the new in inferior grade fully justify all that have be do under the law of 1821 if the power to arrange under the former law authorize the removal of one officer from a particular station and the location of another in it reduce the latter from a higher to a inferior grade with the advice and consent of the senate it surely justify under the latter law the arrangement of these officer with a like sanction to office of new creation from which no one have be remove and to which no one have a just claim it be on the authority of these example support by the construction which i give to the law that i have act in the discharge of this high trust i be aware that many officer of great merit have the strongest claim on they country have be reduce and other dismiss but under the law that result be inevitable it be believe that none have be retain who have not likewise the strongest claim to the appointment which have be confer on they to discriminate between man of acknowledged merit especially in a way to affect so sensibly and materially they feeling and interest for many of whom i have personal

for form the treaty conclude in cordova on the 24th of August last between the say general and the traitor colonel dr augustine iturbide it have be falsely suppose that the former have power from he catholic majesty for that act and in a little time the correctness of those suspicion be find as among other thing the say o donoj when on the 26th of the same August he send this treaty to the governor of vera cruz notify he of its prompt and punctual observance he tell he that at he sailing from the peninsula preparation for the independence of mexico be already think of and that its basis be approve of by the government and by a commission of the corte he majesty on sight of this and of the fatal impression which so great a imposture have produce in some ultramarine province and what must without difficulty be the consequence among the rest think proper to order that by means of a circular to all the chief and corporation beyond sea this atrocious falsehood should be disbelieve and now he have deign to command I to make it know to the government of the united state that it be false as far as general o donoj publish beyond he instruction by point out to it that he never could have be furnish with other instruction than those conformable to constitutional principle in compliance with this order of he majesty i can do no less than observe to you sir how unfounded one of the reason be in you note of the 6th instant for the recognition by this government of those of the insurgent province of spanish-america -- that it be found on the treaty make by o donoj with iturbide -- since not have have that power nor instruction to conclude it it be clearly null and of no value i repeat to you sir the sentiment of my distinguished consideration and pray god that you live many

last i say that as general jackson have not specify the action which have induce he to declare the spanish officer expel from the florida criminal nor given proof of they i think myself authorize to declare the accusation false i do not this through inadvertency but upon the evident principle that every person accuse have a right to declare a accusation destitute of proof false and much more a accusation not pretend to be prove this assertion of mine do not presume that i be not persuade of the merit of the say general and of the claim which he have upon the gratitude of he country but although it be believe the duty of he country to eulogize and reward he eminent service yet it will be lawful for the representative of a power outrage by he to complain of he conduct i can not persuade myself that to aggravate my say expression you could have think that i have be want in due respect it not be possible for that opinion to have enter you mind when by he order mr forsyth have send to the spanish minister on the 1st of September last a note in which complain of the captain-general of the island of cuba he accuse he of dishonorable pecuniary motive in not have deliver the archive without give any proof of so injurious a assertion and i must remark that the rank of general mabry in spain be at least as elevated as that of general jackson in the united state and that the service perform by he to he country have render he as worthy as he of its consideration and respect second although you be pleased to tell I that part of the papers take from colonel coppinger be ready to be deliver which the american commissioner _ after have examine they _ have adjudge to be return to spain i do not think myself authorize to admit they return in this manner but in the mode which i demand in my note of the 22d of November last as i have see by the public papers that the president have communicate to congress the note which you be please to address to I date the 15th instant and that it have be order to be print i take the liberty of request that you will have the goodness to use you influence that this my answer may be treat in the same manner that congress and

the house of representative _ : have duly consider the bill entitle a act for the preservation and repair of the cumberland road it be with deep regret approve as i do the policy that i be compel to object to its passage and to return the bill to the house of representative in which it originate under a conviction that congress do not possess the power under the constitution to pass such a law a power to establish turnpike with gate and toll and to enforce the collection of toll by penalty imply a power to adopt and execute a complete system of internal improvement a right to impose duty to be pay by all person pass a certain road and on horse and carriage as be do by this bill involve the right to take the land from the proprietor on a valuation and to pass law for the protection of the road from injury and if it exist as to one road it exist as to any other and to as many road as congress may think proper to establish a right to legislate for one of these purpose be a right to legislate for the other it be a complete right of jurisdiction and sovereignty for all the purpose of internal improvement and not merely the right of apply money under the power vest in congress to make appropriation under which power with the consent of the state through which this road pass the work be originally commence and have be so far execute i be of opinion that congress do not possess this power that the state individually can not grant it for although they may assent to the appropriation of money within they limit for such purpose they can grant no power of jurisdiction or sovereignty by special compact with the united state this power can be grant only by a amendment to the constitution and in the mode prescribe by it if the power exist it must be either because it have be specifically grant to the united state or that it be incidental to some power which have be specifically grant if we examine the specific grant of power we do not find it among they nor be it incidental to any power which have be specifically grant it have never be contend that the power be specifically grant it be claim only as be incidental to some one or more of the power which be specifically grant the follow be the power from which it be say to be derive : first from the right to establish post-office and post-road second from the right to declare war third to regulate commerce fourth to pay the debt and provide for the common defense and general welfare fifth from the power to make all law necessary and proper for carry into execution all the power vest by the constitution in the government of the united state or in any department or officer thereof sixth and lastly from the power to dispose of and make all needful rule and regulation respect the territory and other property of the united state accord to my judgment it can not be derive from either of those power nor from all of they unite and in consequence it do not exist have state my objection to the bill i should now cheerfully communicate at large the reason on which they be found if i have time to reduce they to such form as to include they in this paper the advanced stage of the session render that impossible have at the commencement of my service in this high trust consider it a duty to express the opinion that the united state do not possess the power in question and to suggest for the consideration of congress the propriety of recommend to the state a amendment to the constitution to vest the power in the united state my attention have be often draw to the subject since in consequence whereof i have occasionally commit my sentiment to paper respect it the form which this exposition have assume be not such as i should have give it have it be intend for congress nor be it conclude nevertheless as it contain my view on this subject be one which i deem of very high importance and which in many of its bearing have now become peculiarly urgent i will communicate it to congress if in my power in the course of the day or certainly on Monday next jame monroe washington _ may 4 1822 _ _ to the house of representative _ : i transmit the paper allude to in the message of this day on the subject of internal improvement jame monroe view of the president of the united state on the subject of internal improvement it may be presume that the proposition relate to internal improvement by road and canal which have be several time before congress will be take into consideration again either for the purpose of recommend to the state the adoption of a amendment to the constitution to vest the necessary power in the general government or to carry the system into effect on the principle that the power have already be grant it seem to be the prevailing opinion that great advantage would be derive from the exercise of such a power by congress respect the right there be much diversity of sentiment it be of the highest importance that this question should be settle if the right exist it ought forthwith to be exercise if it do not exist surely those who be friend to the power ought to unite in recommend a amendment to the constitution to obtain it i propose to examine this question the inquiry confine to its proper object and within the most limited scale be extensive we government be unlike other government both in its origin and form in analyze it the difference in certain respects between it and those of other nation ancient and modern necessarily come into view i propose to notice these difference so far as they be connect with the object of inquiry and the consequence likely to result from they vary in equal degree from those which have attend other government the digression if it may be so call will in every instance be short and the transition to the main object immediate and direct to do justice to the subject it will be necessary to mount to the source of power in these state and to pursue this power in its gradation and distribution among the several department in which it be now vest the great division be between the state government and the general government if there be a perfect accord in every instance as to the precise extent of the power grant to the general government we should then know with equal certainty what be the power which remain to the state government since it would follow that those which be not grant to the one would remain to the other but it be on this point and particularly respect the construction of these power and they incident that a difference of opinion exist and hence it be necessary to trace distinctly the origin of each government the purpose intend by it and the means adopt to accomplish they by have the interior of both government fully before we we shall have all the means which can be afford to enable we to form a correct opinion of the endowment of each before the revolution the present state then colony be separate community unconnected with each other except in they common relation to the crown they government be institute by grant from the crown which operate accord to the condition of each grant in the nature of a compact between the settler in each colony and the crown all power not retain in the crown be vest exclusively in the colony each have a government consist of a executive a judiciary and a legislative assembly one branch of which be in every instance elect by the people no office be hereditary nor do any title under the crown give rank or office in any of the colony in resist the encroachment of the parent country and abrogate the power of the crown the authority which have be hold by it vested exclusively in the people of the colony by they be a congress appoint compose of delegate from each colony who manage the war declare independence treat with foreign power and act in all thing accord to the sense of they constituent the declaration of independence confirm in form what have before exist in substance it announce to the world new state possess and exercise complete sovereignty which they be resolve to maintain they be soon after recognize by france and other power and finally by great britain herself in 1783 soon after the power of the crown be annul the people of each colony establish a constitution or frame of government for themselves in which these separate branch -- legislative executive and judiciary -- be institute each independent of the other to these branch each have its appropriate portion the whole power of the people not delegate to congress be communicate to be exercise for they advantage on the representative principle by person of they appointment or otherwise derive they authority immediately from they and hold they office for state term all the power necessary for useful purpose hold by any of the strongest government of the old world not vest in congress be impart to these state government without other check than such as be necessary to prevent abuse in the form of fundamental declaration or bill of right the great difference between we government and those of the old world consist in this that the former be representative the person who exercise they power do it not for themselves or in they own right but for the people and therefore while they be in the highest degree efficient they can never become oppressive it be this transfer of the power of the people to representative and responsible body in every branch which constitute the great improvement in the science of government and form the boast of we system it combine all the advantage of every known government without any of they disadvantage it retain the sovereignty in the people while it avoid the tumult and disorder incident to the exercise of that power by the people themselves it possess all the energy and efficiency of the most despotic government while it avoid all the oppression and abuse inseparable from those government in every stage of the conflict from its commencement until march 1781 the power of congress be undefined but of vast extent the assembly or convention of the several colony be form by representative from every county in each colony and the congress by delegate from each colonial assembly the power of the latter for general purpose resemble those of the former for local they rest on the same basis the people and be complete for all the purpose contemplate never be a movement so spontaneous so patriotic so efficient the nation exert its whole faculty in support of its rights and of its independence after the contest take that direction and it succeed it be however foresee at a very early stage that although the patriotism of the country might be rely on in the struggle for its independence a well-digested compact would be necessary to preserve it after obtain a plan of confederation be in consequence propose and take into consideration by congress even at the moment when the other great act which sever they from great britain and declare they independence be proclaim to the world this compact be ratify on the 21st march 1781 by the last state and thereupon carry into immediate effect the follow power be vest in the united state by the article of confederation as this the first bond of union be in operation nearly eight year during which time a practical construction be give to many of its power all of which be adopt in the constitution with important addition it be think that a correct view of those power and of the manner in which they be execute may shed light on the subject under consideration it may fairly be presume that where certain power be transfer from one instrument to the other and in the same term or term descriptive only of the same power that it be intend that they should be construe in the same sense in the latter that they be in the former article i declare that the style of the confederacy shall be the united state of america article ii each state retain its sovereignty freedom and

borrow on they account article xiii every state shall abide by the determination of the united state on all question submit to they by the confederation the article of the confederation to be perpetual and not to be alter without the consent of every state this bond of union be soon find to be utterly incompetent to the purpose intend by it it be defective in its power it be defective also in the means of execute the power actually grant by it be a league of sovereign and independent state its act like those of all other league require the interposition of the state compose it to give they effect within they respective jurisdiction the act of congress without the aid of state law to enforce they be altogether nugatory the refusal or omission of one state to pass such law be urge as a reason to justify like conduct in other and thus the government be soon at a stand the experience of a few year demonstrate that the confederation could not be rely on for the security of the blessing which have be derive from the revolution the interest of the nation require a more efficient government which the good sense and virtue of the people provide by the adoption of the present constitution the constitution of the united state be form by a convention of delegate from the several state who meet in philadelphium duly authorize for the purpose and it be ratify by a convention in each state which be especially call to consider and decide on the same in this progress the state government be never suspend in they function on the contrary they take the lead in it conscious of they incompetency to secure to the union the blessing of the revolution they promote the diminution of they own power and the enlargement of those of the general government in the way in which they might be most adequate and efficient it be believe that no other example can be find of a government exert its influence to lessen its own power of a policy so enlighten of a patriotism so pure and disinterested the credit however be more especially due to the people of each state in obedience to whose will and under whose control the state government act the constitution of the united state be ratify by the people of the several state become of necessity to the extent of its power the paramount authority of the union on sound principle it can be view in no other light the people the highest authority know to we system from whom all we institution spring and on whom they depend form it have the people of the several state think proper to incorporate themselves into one community under one government they might have do it they have the power and there be nothing then nor be there anything now should they be so disposed to prevent it they wisely stop however at a certain point extend the incorporation to that point make the national government thus far a consolidated government and preserve the state government without that limit perfectly sovereign and independent of the national government have the people of the several state incorporate themselves into one community they must have remain such they constitution become then like the constitution of the several state incapable of change until alter by the will of the majority in the institution of a state government by the citizen of a state a compact be form to which all and every citizen be equal party they be also the sole party and may amend it at pleasure in the institution of the government of the united state by the citizen of every state a compact be form between the whole american people which have the same force and partake of all the quality to the extent of its power as a compact between the citizen of a state in the formation of they own constitution it can not be alter except by those who form it or in the mode prescribe by the party to the compact itself this constitution be adopt for the purpose of remedy all defect of the confederation and in this it have succeed beyond any calculation that could have be form of any human institution by bind the state together the constitution perform the great office of the confederation but it be in that sense only that it have any of the property of that compact and in that it be more effectual to the purpose as it hold they together by a much stronger bond and in all other respects in which the confederation fail the constitution have be bless with complete success the confederation be a compact between separate and independent state the execution of whose article in the power which operate internally depend on the state government but the great office of the constitution by incorporate the people of the several state to the extent of its power into one community and enable it to act directly on the people be to annul the power of the state government to that extent except in case where they be concurrent and to preclude they agency in give effect to those of the general government the government of the united state rely on its own means for the execution of its power as the state government do for the execution of theirs both government have a common origin or sovereign the people -- the state government the people of each state the national government the people of every state -- and be amenable to the power which create it it be by execute its function as a government thus originate and thus act that the constitution of the united state hold the state together and perform the office of a league it be owe to the nature of its power and the high source from whence they be derive -- the people -- that it perform that office better than the confederation or any league which ever exist be a compact which the state government do not form to which they be not party and which execute its own power independently of they there be two separate and independent government establish over we union one for local purpose over each state by the people of the state the other for national purpose over all the state by the people of the united state the whole power of the people on the representative principle be divide between they the state government be independent of each other and to the extent of they power be complete sovereignty the national government begin where the state government terminate except in some instance where there be a concurrent jurisdiction between they this government be also accord to the extent of its power a complete sovereignty i speak here as repeatedly mention before altogether of representative sovereignty for the real sovereignty be in the people alone the history of the world afford no such example of two separate and independent government establish over the same people nor can it exist except in government found on the sovereignty of the people in monarchy and other government not representative there can be no such division of power the government be inherent in the possessor it be he and can not be take from he without a revolution in such government alliance and league alone be practicable but with we individual count for nothing in the office which they hold that be they have no right to they they hold they as representative by appointment from the people in whom the sovereignty be exclusively vest it be impossible to speak too highly of this system take in its twofold character and in all its great principle of two government completely distinct from and independent of each other each constitutional found by and act directly on the people each competent to all its purpose administer all the blessing for which it be institute without even the most remote danger of exercise any of its power in a way to oppress the people a system capable of expansion over a vast territory not only without weaken either government but enjoy the peculiar advantage of add thereby new strength and vigor to the faculty of both possess also this additional advantage that while the several state enjoy all the rights reserve to they of separate and independent government and each be secure by the nature of the federal government which act directly on the people against the failure of the other to bear they equal share of the public burden and thereby enjoy in a more perfect degree all the advantage of a league it hold they together by a bond altogether different and much stronger than the late confederation or any league that be ever know before -- a bond beyond they control and which can not even be amend except in the mode prescribe by it so great a effort in favor of human happiness be never make before but it become those who make it establish in the new hemisphere descend from the same ancestor speak the same language have the same religion and universal toleration bear equal and educate in the same principle of free government make independent by a common struggle and menace by the same danger tie exist between they which never apply before to separate community they have every motive to bind they together which could operate on the interest and affection of a generous enlighten and virtuous people and it afford inexpressible consolation to find that these motive have they merit influence in thus trace we institution to they origin and pursue they in they progress and modification down to the adoption of this constitution two important fact have be disclose on which it may not be improper in this stage to make a few observation the first be that in wrest the power or what be call the sovereignty from the crown it pass directly to the people the second that it pass directly to the people of each colony and not to the people of all the colony in the aggregate to thirteen distinct community and not to one to these two fact each contribute its equal proportion i be incline to think that we be in a eminent degree indebted for the success of we revolution by pass to the people it vest in a community every individual of which have equal rights and a common interest there be no family dethrone among we no banish pretender in a foreign country look back to he connection and adherent here in the hope of a recall no order of nobility whose hereditary rights in the government have be violate no hierarchy which have be degrade and oppress there be but one order that of the people by whom everything be gain by the change i mention it also as a circumstance of peculiar felicity that the great body of the people have be bear and educate under these equal and original institution they habit they principle and they prejudice be therefore all on the side of the revolution and of free republican government have distinct order exist we fortune might and probably would have be different it would scarcely have be possible to have unite so completely the whole force of the country against a common enemy a contest would probably have arise in the outset between the order for the control have the aristocracy prevail the people would have be heartless have the people prevail the nobility would probably have leave the country or remain behind internal division would have take place in every state and a civil war break out more destructive even than the foreign which might have defeat the whole movement ancient and modern history be replete with example proceed from conflict between distinct order of revolution attempt which prove abortive of republic which have terminate in despotism it be owe to the simplicity of the element of which we system be compose that the attraction of all the part have be to a common center that every change have tend to cement the union and in short that we have be bless with such glorious and happy success and that the power wrest from the british crown pass to the people of each colony the whole history of we political movement from the emigration of we ancestor to the present day clearly demonstrate what produce the revolution the violation of we rights what rights we charter rights to whom be the charter grant to the people of each colony or to the people of all the colony as a single community we know that no such community as the aggregate exist and of course that no such rights could be violate it may be add that the nature of the power which be give to the delegate by each colony and the manner in which they be execute show that the sovereignty be in the people of each and not in the aggregate they respectively present credentials such as be usual between minister of separate power which be examine and approve before they enter on the discharge of the important duty commit to they they vote also by colony and not individually all the member from one colony be entitle to one vote only this fact alone the first of we political association and at the period of we greatest peril fix beyond all controversy the source from whence the power which have direct and secure success to all we measure have proceed have the sovereignty pass to the aggregate consequence might have ensue admit the success of we revolution which might even yet seriously affect we system by pass to the people of each colony the opposition to great britain the prosecution of the war the declaration of independence the adoption of the confederation and of this constitution be all imputable to they have it pass to the aggregate every measure would be trace to that source even the state government might be say to have emanate from it and amendment of they constitution on that principle be propose by the same authority in short it be not easy to perceive all the consequence into which such a doctrine might lead it be obvious that the people in mass would have have much less agency in all the great measure of the revolution and in those which follow than they actually have and proportionably less credit for they patriotism and service than they be now entitle to and enjoy by pass to the people of each colony the whole body in each be keep in constant and active deliberation on subject of the highest national importance and in the supervision of the conduct of all the public servant in the discharge of they respective duty thus the most effectual guard be provide against abuse and danger of every kind which human ingenuity could devise and the whole people render more competent to the self-government which by a heroic exertion they have acquire i will now proceed to examine the power of the general government which like the government of the several state be divide into three branch -- a legislative executive and judiciary -- each have its appropriate share of these the legislative from the nature of its power all law proceed from it and the manner of its appointment its member be elect immediately by the people be by far the most important the whole system of the national government may be say to rest essentially on the power grant to this branch they mark the limit within which with few exception all the branch must move in the discharge of they respective function it will be proper therefore to take a full and correct view of the power grant to it by the eighth section of the first article of the constitution it be declare that congress shall have power -- first to lay and collect tax duty impost and excise to pay the debt and provide for the common defense and general welfare of the united state second to borrow money third to regulate commerce with foreign nation and among the several state and with the indian tribe fourth to establish a uniform rule of naturalization and uniform law respect bankruptcy fifth to coin money regulate the value thereof and of foreign coin and fix the standard of weight and measure sixth to provide for the punishment of counterfeit the security and current coin of the united state seventh to establish post office and post-road eighth to promote the progress of science and useful art by secure for limited time to author and inventor the exclusive right to they respective writings and discovery ninth to constitute tribunal inferior to the supreme court to define and punish piracy and felony commit on the high sea and offens against the law of nation tenth to declare war grant letter of marque and reprisal and make rule concern capture on land and water eleventh to raise and support army twelfth to provide and maintain a navy thirteenth to make rule for the government of the land and naval force fourteenth to provide for call forth the militia to execute the law of the union suppress insurrection and repel invasion fifteenth to provide for organize arm and discipline the militia and for govern such part of they as may be in the service of the united state reserve to the state the appointment of the officer and the authority of train the militia accord to the discipline prescribe by congress sixteenth to exercise exclusive legislation in all case whatever over such district -lrb- not exceed 10 mile square -rrb- as may by the cession of particular state and the acceptance of by congress become the seat of government of the united state and to exercise like authority over all place purchase by the consent of the legislature of the state in which the same may be for the erection of fort magazine arsenal dockyard and other needful building seventeenth and to make all law which shall be necessary and proper for carry into execution the foregoing power and all other power vest by this constitution in the government of the united state or in any department or officer thereof to the other branch of the government the power properly belong to each be grant the president in whom the executive power be vest be make commander in chief of the army and navy and militia when call into the service of the united state he be authorize with the advice and consent of the senate two-third of the member present concur to form treaty to nominate and with the advice and consent of the senate to appoint ambassador other public minister and consul judge of the supreme court and all other officer whose appointment be not otherwise provide for by law he have power to grant reprieve and pardon for offens against the united state except in case of impeachment it be make he duty to give to congress from time to time information of the state of the union to recommend to they consideration such measure as he may judge necessary and expedient to convene both house on extraordinary occasion to receive ambassador and to take care that the law be faithfully execute the judicial power be vest in one supreme court and in such inferior court as congress may establish and it be make to extend to all case in law and equity arise under the constitution the law of the united state and treaty make under they authority case affect ambassador and other public character case of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction cause in which the united state be a party between two or more state between citizen of different state between citizen of the same state claim grant of land under different state between a state or the citizen thereof and foreign state be specially assign to these tribunal other power have be grant in other part of the constitution which although they relate to specific object unconnected with the ordinary administration yet as they form important feature in the government and may shed useful light on the construction which ought to be give to the power above enumerate it be proper to bring into view by article i section 9 clause 1 it be provide that the migration or importation of such person as any of the state now exist shall think proper to admit shall not be prohibit by congress prior to the year 1808 but a tax or duty may be impose on such importation not exceed $ 10 for each person by article iii section 3 clause 1 new state may be admit by congress into the union but that no new state shall be form within the jurisdiction of another state nor any state be form by the junction of two or more state or part of state without the consent of the legislature of the state concern as well as of the united state and by the next clause of the same article and section power be vest in congress to dispose of and make all needful rule and regulation respect the territory or other property belong to the united state with a proviso that nothing in the constitution shall be so construe as to prejudice any claim of the united state or of any particular state by article iv section 4 the united state guarantee to every state a republican form of government and engage to protect each of they against invasion and on application of the legislature or of the executive when the legislature can not be convene against domestic violence of the other part of the constitution relate to power some form restraint on the exercise of the power grant to congress and other on the exercise of the power remain to the state the object in both instance be to draw more completely the line between the two government and also to prevent abuse by either other part operate like conventional stipulation between the state abolish between they all distinction applicable to foreign power and secure to the inhabitant of each state all the rights and immunity of citizen in the several state by the fifth article it be provide that congress whenever two-third of both house shall deem it necessary shall propose amendment or on the application of the legislature of two-third of the several state shall call a convention for propose amendment which in either case shall be valid as a part of the constitution when ratify by the legislature of three-fourth of the several state or by convention in three-fourths thereof as the one or the other mode may be propose by congress : _ provide _ that no state without its consent shall be deprive of its equal vote in the senate and that no amendment which may be make prior to the year 1808 shall affect the first and fourth clause in the ninth section of the first article by the second section of the sixth article it be declare that the constitution and law of the united state which shall be make in pursuance thereof and all treaty make under the authority of the united state shall be the supreme law of the land and that the judge in every state shall be bind thereby anything in the constitution or law of any state to the contrary notwithstanding this right in the national government to execute its power be indispensable to its existence if the state government have not be restrain from encroach on the power vest in the national government the constitution like the confederation would soon have be set at naught and it be not within the limit of the human mind to devise any plan for the accomplishment of the object other than by make a national constitution which should be to the extent of its power the supreme law of the land this right in the national government would have exist under the constitution to the full extent provide for by this declaration have it not be make to prevent the possibility of a doubt however on so important a subject it be proper to make the declaration have present above a full view of all the power grant to the united state it will be proper to look to those remain to the state it be by fix the great power which be admit to belong to each government that we may hope to come to a right conclusion respect those in controversy between they in regard to the national government this task be easy because its power be to be find in specific grant in the constitution but it be more difficult to give a detail of the power of the state government as they constitution contain all power grant by the people not specifically take from they by grant to the united state can not well be enumerate fortunately a precise detail of all the power remain to the state government be not necessary in the present instance a knowledge of they great power only will answer every purpose contemplate and respect these there can be no diversity in opinion they be sufficiently recognize and establish by the constitution of the united state itself in designate the important power of the state government it be proper to observe first that the territory contemplate by the constitution belong to each state in its separate character and not to the united state in they aggregate character bach state hold territory accord to its original charter except in case where cession have be make to the united state by individual state the united state have none when the constitution be adopt which have not be thus cede to they and which they hold on the condition on which such cession have be make within the individual state it be believe that they hold not a single acre but if they do it be as citizen hold it merely as private property the territory acquire by cession lie without the individual state rest on a different principle and be provide for by a separate and distinct part of the constitution it be the territory within the individual state to which the constitution in its great principle apply and it apply to such territory as the territory of a state and not as that of the united state the next circumstance to be attend to be that the people compose this union be the people of the several state and not of the united state in the full sense of a consolidated government the militia be the militia of the several state land be hold under the law of the state descent contract and all the concern of private property the administration of justice and the whole criminal code except in the case of breach of the law of the united state make under and in conformity with the power vest in congress and of the law of nation be regulate by state law this enumeration show the great extent of the power of the state government the territory and the people form the basis on which all government be found the militia constitute they effective force the regulation and protection of property and of personal liberty be also among the highest attribute of sovereignty this without other evidence be sufficient to show that the great office of the constitution of the united state be to unite the state together under a government endowed with power adequate to the purpose of its institution relate directly or indirectly to foreign concern to the discharge of which a national government thus form alone could be competent this view of the exclusive jurisdiction of the several state over the territory within they respective limit except in case otherwise specially provide for be support by the obvious intent of the several power grant to congress to which a more particular attention be now due of these the right to declare war be perhaps the most important as well by the consequence attend war as by the other power grant in aid of it the right to lay tax duty impost and excise though necessary for the support of the civil government be equally necessary to sustain the charge of war the right to raise and support army and a navy and to call forth and govern the militia when in the service of the united state be altogether of the latter kind they be grant in aid of the power to make war and intend to give effect to it these several power be of great force and extent and operate more directly within the limit and upon the resource of the state than any of the other power but still they be mean only for give end war be declare and must be maintain a army and a navy must be raise fortification must be erect for the common defense debt must be pay for these purpose duty impost and excise be levy tax be lay the land merchandise and other property of the citizen be liable for they if the money be not pay seizure be make and the land be sell the transaction be terminate the land pass into other hand who hold they as the former proprietor do under the law of the individual state they be mean only to certain end the united state have nothing further to do with they the same view be applicable to the power of the general government over person the militia be call into the service of the united state the service be perform the corps return to the state to which it belong it be the militia of such state and not of the united state soldier be require for the army who may be obtain by voluntary enlistment or by some other process found in the principle of equality in either case the citizen after the tour of duty be perform be restore to he former station in society with he equal share in the common sovereignty of the nation in all these case which be the strongest which can be give we see that the right of the general government be nothing more than what it be call in the constitution a power to perform certain act and that the subject on which it operate be a means only to that end that it be both before and after that act under the protection and subject to the law of the individual state within which it be to the other power of the general government the same remark be applicable and with greater force the right to regulate commerce with foreign power be necessary as well to enable congress to lay and collect duty and impost as to support the rights of the nation in the intercourse with foreign power it be execute at the port of the several state and operate almost altogether externally the right to borrow and coin money and to fix its value and that of foreign coin be important to the establishment of a national government and particularly necessary in support of the right to declare war as indeed may be consider the right to punish piracy and felony on the high sea and offens against the law of nation the right to establish a uniform rule of naturalization and uniform law respect bankruptcy seem to be essentially connect with the right to regulate commerce the first branch of it relate to foreigner enter the country the second to merchant who have fail the right to promote the progress of useful art and science may be execute without touch any of the individual state it be accomplish by grant patent to inventor and preserve model which may be do exclusively within the federal district the right to constitute court inferior to the supreme court be a necessary consequence of the judiciary exist as a separate branch of the general government without such inferior court in every state it would be difficult and might even be impossible to carry into effect the law of the general government the right to establish post-office and post-road be essentially of the same character for political commercial and social purpose it be important that it should be vest in the general government as a mere matter of regulation and nothing more i presume be intend by it it be a power easily execute and involve little authority within the state individually the right to exercise exclusive legislation in all case whatsoever over the federal district and over fort magazine arsenal dockyard and other needful building with the consent of the state within which the same may be be a power of a peculiar character and be sufficient in itself to confirm what have be say of all the other power of the general government of this particular grant further notice will hereafter be take i shall conclude my remark on this part of the subject by observe that the view which have be present of the power and character of the two government be support by the marked difference which be observable in the manner of they endowment the state government be divide into three branch -- a legislative executive and judiciary -- and the appropriate duty of each assign to it without any limitation of power except such as is-necessary to guard against abuse in the form of bill of right but in institute the national government a entirely different principle be adopt and pursue the government itself be organize like the state government into three branch but its power be enumerate and define in the most precise form the subject have already be too fully explain to require illustration by a general view of the whole constitution every part of which afford proof of what be here advance it will be sufficient to advert to the eighth section of the first article be that more particularly which define the power and fix the character of the government of the united state by this section it be declare that congress shall have power first to lay and collect tax duty impost and excise etc have show the origin of the state government and they endowment when first form have also show the origin of the national government and the power vest in it and have show lastly the power which be admit to have remain to the state government after those which be take from they by the national government i will now proceed to examine whether the power to adopt and execute a system of internal improvement by road and canal have be vest in the united state before we can determine whether this power have be grant to the general government it will be necessary to ascertain distinctly the nature and extent of the power requisite to make such improvement when that be do we shall be able to decide whether such power be vest in the national government if the power exist it would it be presume be execute by a board of skillful engineer on a view of the whole union on a plan which would secure complete effect to all the great purpose of we constitution it be not my intention however to take up the subject here on this scale i shall state a case for the purpose of illustration only let it be suppose that congress intend to run a road from the city of washington to baltimore and to connect the chesapeake bay with the delaware and the delaware with the raritan by a canal what must be do to carry the project into effect i make here no question of the exist power i speak only of the power necessary for the purpose commissioner would be appoint to trace a route in the most direct line pay due regard to height water course and other obstacle and to acquire the right to the ground over which the road and canal would pass with sufficient breadth for each this must be do by voluntary grant or by purchase from individual or in case they would not sell or should ask a exorbitant price by condemn the property and fix its value by a jury of the vicinage the next object to be attend to after the road and canal be lay out and make be to keep they in repair we know that there be people in every community capable of commit voluntary injury of pull down wall that be make to sustain the road of break the bridge over water course and break the road itself some living near it might be disappoint that it do not pass through they land and commit these act of violence and waste from revenge or in the hope of give it that direction though for a short time injury of this kind have be commit and be still complain of on the road from cumberland to the ohio to accomplish this object congress should have a right to pass law to punish offender wherever they may be find jurisdiction over the road would not be sufficient though it be exclusive it would seldom happen that the party would be detect in the act they would generally commit it in the night and fly far off before the sun appear the power to punish these culprit must therefore reach they wherever they go they must also be amenable to competent tribunal federal or state the power must likewise extend to another object not less essential or important than those already mention experience have show that the establishment of turnpike with gate and toll and person to collect the toll be the best expedient that can be adopt to defray the expense of these improvement and the repair which they necessarily require congress must therefore have power to make such a establishment and to support it by such regulation with fine and penalty in the case of injury as may be competent to the purpose the right must extend to all those object or it will be utterly incompetent it be possess and exercise by the state individually and it must be possess by the united state or the pretension must be abandon let it be further suppose that congress believe that they do possess the power have pass a act for those purpose under which commissioner have be appoint who have begin the work they be meet at the first farm on which they enter by the owner who forbid they to trespass on he land they offer to buy it at a fair price or at twice or thrice its value he persist in he refusal can they on the principle recognize and act on by all the state government that in case of this kind the obstinacy and perverseness of a individual must yield to the public welfare summon a jury of upright and discreet man to condemn the land value it and compel the owner to receive the amount and to deliver it up to they i believe that very few would concur in the opinion that such a power exist the next object be to preserve these improvement from injury the lock of the canal be break the wall which sustain the road be pull down the bridge be break the road itself be plow up toll be refuse to be pay the gate of the canal or turnpike be force the offender be pursue catch and bring to trial can they be punish the question of right must be decide on principle the culprit will avail themselves of every barrier that may serve to screen they from punishment they will plead that the law under which they stand arraign be unconstitutional and that question must be decide by the court whether federal or state on a fair investigation of the power vest in the general government by the constitution if the judge find that these power have not be grant to congress the prisoner must be acquit and by they acquittal all claim to the right to establish such a system be at a end i have suppose a opposition to be make to the right in congress by the owner of the land and other individual charge with breach of law make to protect the work from injury because it be the mildest form in which it can present itself it be not however the only one a state also may contest the right and then the controversy assume another character government might contend against government for to a certain extent both the government be sovereign and independent of each other and in that form it be possible though not probable that opposition might be make to each limitation be prescribe and should a contest rise between they respect they rights and the people sustain it with anything like a equal division of number the worst consequence might ensue it may be urge that the opposition suggest by the owner of the land or by the state individually may be avoid by a satisfactory arrangement with the party but a suppression of opposition in that way be no proof of a right in congress nor could it if confine to that limit remove all the impediment to the exercise of the power it be not sufficient that congress may by the command and application of the public revenue purchase the soil and thus silence that class of individual or by the accommodation afford to individual state put down opposition on they part congress must be able rightfully to control all opposition or they can not carry the system into effect case would inevitably occur to put the right to the test the work must be preserve from injury toll must be collect offender must be punish with these culprit no bargain can be make when bring to trial they must deny the validity of the law and that plea be sustain all claim to the right cease if the united state possess this power it must be either because it have be specifically grant or that it be incidental and necessary to carry into effect some specific grant the advocate for the power derive it from the follow source : first the right to establish post-office and post-road second to declare war third to regulate commerce among the several state fourth from the power to pay the debt and provide for the common defense and general welfare of the united state fifth from the power to make all law necessary and proper for carry into execution all the power vest by the constitution in the government of the united state or in any department or officer thereof sixth and lastly from the power to dispose of and make all needful rule and regulation respect the territory and other property of the united state it be to be observe that there be but little accord among the advocate for this power as to the particular source from whence it be derive they all agree however in ascribe it to some one or more of those above mention i will examine the ground of the claim in each instance the first of these grant be in the follow word : congress shall have power to establish post-office and post-road what be the just import of these word and the extent of the grant the word establish be the ruling term post-office and post-road be the subject on which it act the question therefore be what power be grant by that word the sense in which word be commonly use be that in which they be to be understand in all transaction between public body and individual the intention of the party be to prevail and there be no better way of ascertain it than by give to the term use they ordinary import if we be to ask any number of we most enlighten citizen who have no connection with public affair and whose mind be unprejudiced what be the import of the word establish and the extent of the grant which it control we do not think there would be any difference of opinion among they we be satisfied that all of they would answer that a power be thereby give to congress to fix on the town court-house and other place throughout we union at which there should be post-offices the route by which the mail should be carry from one post-office to another so as to diffuse intelligence as extensively and to make the institution as useful as possible to fix the postage to be pay on every letter and packet thus carry to support the establishment and to protect the post-office and mail from robbery by punish those who should commit the offense the idea of a right to lay off the road of the united state on a general scale of improvement to take the soil from the proprietor by force to establish turnpike and toll and to punish offender in the manner state above would never occur to any such person the use of the exist road by the stage mail carrier or postboy in pass over it as other do be all that would be think of the jurisdiction and soil remain to the state with a right in the state or those authorize by its legislature to change the road at pleasure the intention of the party be support by other proof which ought to place it beyond all doubt in the former act of government the confederation we find a grant for the same purpose express in the follow word : the united state in congress assemble shall have the sole and exclusive right and power of establish and regulate post-office from one state to another throughout all the united state and exact such postage on the papers pass through the same as may be requisite to defray the expense of the say office the term establish be likewise the ruling one in that instrument and be evidently intend and understand to give a power simply and solely to fix where there should be post-offices by transfer this term from the confederation into the constitution it be doubtless intend that it should be understand in the same sense in the latter that it be in the former instrument and to be apply alike to post-office and post-road in whatever sense it be apply to post-office it must be apply in the same sense to post-road but it may be ask if such be the intention why be not all the other term of the grant transfer with it the reason be obvious the confederation be a bond of union between independent state it be necessary in grant the power which be to be exercise over they to be very explicit and minute in define the power grant but the constitution to the extent of its power have incorporate the state into one government like the government of the state individually fewer word in define the power grant by it be not only adequate but perhaps better adapt to the purpose we find that brevity be a characteristic of the instrument have it be intend to convey a more enlarged power in the constitution than have be grant in the confederation surely the same control term would not have be use or other word would have be add to show such intention and to mark the extent to which the power should be carry it be a liberal construction of the power grant in the constitution by this term to include in it all the power that be grant in the confederation by term which specifically define and as be suppose extend they limit it would be absurd to say that by omit from the constitution any portion of the phraseology which be deem important in the confederation the import of that term be enlarged and with it the power of the constitution in a proportional degree beyond what they be in the confederation the right to exact postage and to protect the post-office and mail from robbery by punish the offender may fairly be consider as incident to the grant since without it the object of the grant might be defeat whatever be absolutely necessary to the accomplishment of the object of the grant though not specify may fairly be consider as include in it beyond this the doctrine of incidental power can not be carry if we go back to the origin of we settlement and institution and trace they progress down to the revolution we shall see that it be in this sense and in none other that the power be exercise by all we colonial government post-office be make for the country and not the country for they they be the offspring of improvement they never go before it settlement be first make after which the progress be uniform and simple extend to object in regular order most necessary to the comfort of man -- school place of public worship court-house and market post-office follow road may indeed be say to be coeval with settlement they lead to all the place mention and to every other which the various and complicated interest of society require it be believe that not one example can be give from the first settlement of we country to the adoption of this constitution of a post-office be establish without a view to exist road or of a single road have be make by pavement turnpike etc for the sole purpose of accommodate a post-office such too be the uniform progress of all society in grant then this power to the united state it be undoubtedly intend by the framer and ratifier of the constitution to convey it in the sense and extent only in which it have be understand and exercise by the previous authority of the country this conclusion be confirm by the object of the grant and the manner of its execution the object be the transportation of the mail throughout the united state which may be do on horseback and be so do until lately since the establishment of stage between the great town and in other place where the population be dense stage be prefer because they afford a additional opportunity to make a profit from passenger but where the population be sparse and on crossroads it be generally carry on horseback unconnected with passenger and other object it can not be doubt that the mail itself may be carry in every part of we union with nearly as much economy and greater dispatch on horseback than in a stage and in many part with much greater in every part of the union in which stage can be prefer the road be sufficiently good provide those which serve for every other purpose will accommodate they in every other part where horse alone be use if other people pass they on horseback surely the mail carrier can for a object so simple and so easy in its execution it would doubtless excite surprise if it should be think proper to appoint commissioner to lay off the country on a great scheme of improvement with the power to shorten distance reduce height level mountain and pave surface if the united state possess the power contend for under this grant might they not in adopt the road of the individual state for the carriage of the mail as have be do assume jurisdiction over they and preclude a right to interfere with or alter they might they not establish turnpike and exercise all the other act of sovereignty above state over such road necessary to protect they from injury and defray the expense of repair they surely if the right exist these consequence necessarily follow as soon as the road be establish the absurdity of such a pretension must be apparent to all who examine it in this way a large portion of the territory of every state might be take from it for there be scarcely a road in any state which will not be use for the transportation of the mail a new field for legislation and internal government would thus be open from this view of the subject i think we may fairly conclude that the right to adopt and execute a system of internal improvement or any part of it have not be grant to congress under the power to establish post-office and post-road that the common road of the country only be contemplate by that grant and be fully competent to all its purpose the next object of inquiry be whether the right to declare war include the right to adopt and execute this system of improvement the objection to it be i presume not less conclusive than those which be applicable to the grant which we have just examine under the last-mentioned grant a claim have be set up to as much of that system as relate to road under this it extend alike to road and canal we must examine this grant by the same rule of construction that be apply to the precede one the object be to take this power from the individual state and to vest it in the general government this have be do in clear and explicit term first by grant the power to congress and secondly by prohibit the exercise of it by the state congress shall have a right to declare war this be the language of the grant if the right to adopt and execute this system of improvement be include in it it must be by way of incident only since there be nothing in the grant itself which bear any relation to road and canal the following consideration it be presume prove incontestably that this power have not be grant in that or any other manner the united state be expose to invasion through the whole extent of they atlantic coast by any european power with whom we might be engage in war -- on the northern and northwestern frontier on the side of canada by great britain and on the southern by spain or any power in alliance with she if internal improvement be to be carry to the full extent to which they may be useful for military purpose the power as it exist must apply to all the road of the union there be no limitation to it wherever such improvement may facilitate the march of troops the transportation of cannon or otherwise aid the operation or mitigate the calamity of war along the coast or in any part of the interior they would be useful for military purpose and might therefore be make the power follow as a incident to another power can be measure as to its extent by reference only to the obvious extent of the power to which it be incidental so great a scope be it be believe never give to incidental power if it have be intend that the right to declare war should include all the power necessary to maintain war it would follow that nothing would have be do to impair the right or to restrain congress from the exercise of any power which the exigency of war might require the nature and extent of this exigency would mark the extent of the power grant which should always be construe liberally so as to be adequate to the end a right to raise money by tax duty excise and by loan to raise and support army and a navy to provide for call forth arm discipline and govern the militia when in the service of the united state establish fortification and govern the troops station in they independently of the state authority and to perform many other act be indispensable to the maintenance of war -- no war with any great power can be prosecute with success without the command of the resource of the union in all these respects these power then would of necessity and by common consent have fall within the right to declare war have it be intend to convey by way of incident to that right the necessary power to maintain war but these power have all be grant specifically with many other in great detail which experience have show be necessary for the purpose of war by specifically grant then these power it be manifest that every power be thus grant which it be intend to grant for military purpose and that it be also intend that no important power should be include in this grant by way of incident however useful it might be for some of the purpose of the grant by the sixteenth of the enumerated power article i section 8 congress be authorize to exercise exclusive legislation in all case whatever over such district as may by cession of particular state and the acceptance of congress not exceed 10 mile square become the seat of the government of the united state and to exercise like authority over all place purchase by the consent of the legislature of the state in which the same shall be for the erection of fort magazine arsenal dockyard and other useful building if any doubt exist on a view of other part of the constitution respect the decision which ought to be form on the question under consideration i should suppose that this clause would completely remove it it have be show after the most liberal construction of all the enumerated power of the general government that the territory within the limit of the respective state belong to they that the united state have no right under the power grant to they with the exception specify in this grant to any the smallest portion of territory within a state all those power operate on a different principle and have they full effect without impair in the slightest degree this right in the state that those power be in every instance mean to end which be accomplish leave the subject -- that be the property in which light only land could be regard -- where it be before under the jurisdiction and subject to the law of the state government the second number of the clause which be applicable to military and naval purpose alone claim particular attention here it fully confirm the view take of the other enumerated power for have it be intend to include in the right to declare war by way of incident any right of jurisdiction or legislation over territory within a state it would have be do as to fortification magazine arsenal dockyard and other needful building by specifically grant the right as to such small portion of territory as might be necessary for these purpose and on certain condition minutely and well define it be manifest that it be not intend to grant it as to any other portion on any condition for any purpose or in any manner whatsoever it may be say that although the authority to exercise exclusive legislation in certain case within the state with they consent may be consider as a prohibition to congress to exercise like exclusive legislation in any other case although they consent should be grant it do not prohibit the exercise of such jurisdiction or power within a state as would be competent to all the purpose of internal improvement i can conceive no ground on which the idea of such a power over any part of the territory of a state can be infer from the power to declare war there never can be a occasion for jurisdiction for military purpose except in fortification dockyard and the like place if the soldier be in the field or be quarter in garrison without the fortification the civil authority must prevail where they be the government of the troops by martial law be not affect by it in war when the force be increase and the movement be on a greater scale consequence follow which be inseparable from the exigency of the state more freedom of action and a wider range of power in the military commander to be exercise on they own responsibility may be necessary to the public safety but even here the civil authority of the state never cease to operate it be also exclusive for all civil purpose whether any power short of that state would be adequate to the purpose of internal improvement be deny in the case of territory one government must prevail for all the purpose intend by the grant the jurisdiction of the united state might be modify in such manner as to admit that of the state in all case and for all purpose not necessary to the execution of the propose power but the right of the general government must be complete for all the purpose above state it must extend to the seizure and condemnation of the property if necessary to the punishment of offender for injury to the road and canal to the establishment and enforcement of toll etc it must be a complete right to the extent above state or it will be of no avail that right do not exist the reason which operate in favor of the right of exclusive legislation in fort dockyard etc do not apply to any other place the safety of such work and of the city which they be intend to defend and even of whole community may sometimes depend on it if spy be admit within they in time of war they might communicate intelligence to the enemy which might be fatal all nation surround such work with high wall and keep they gate shut even here however three important condition be indispensable to such exclusive legislation : first the ground must be requisite for and be apply to those purpose second it must be purchase third it must be purchase by the consent of the state in which it may be when we find that so much care have be take to protect the sovereignty of the state over the territory within they respective limit admit that of the united state over such small portion and for such special and important purpose only the conclusion be irresistible not only that the power necessary for internal improvement have not be grant but that it have be clearly prohibit i come next to the right to regulate commerce the third source from whence the right to make internal improvement be claim it be express in the follow word : congress shall have power to regulate commerce with foreign nation and among the several state and with the indian tribe the reasoning applicable to the precede claim be equally so to this the mischief complain of be that this power could not be exercise with advantage by the individual state and the object be to transfer it to the united state the sense in which the power be understand and exercise by the state be doubtless that in which it be transfer to the united state the policy be the same as to three branch of this grant and it be scarcely possible to separate the two first from each other in any view which may be take of the subject the last relate to the indian tribe be of a nature distinct from the other for reason too well know to require explanation commerce between independent power or community be universally regulate by duty and impost it be so regulate by the state before the adoption of this constitution equally in respect to each other and to foreign power the goods and vessel employ in the trade be the only subject of regulation it can act on none other a power then to impose such duty and impost in regard to foreign nation and to prevent any on the trade between the state be the only power grant if we recur to the cause which produce the adoption of this constitution we shall find that injury result from the regulation of trade by the state respectively and the advantage anticipate from the transfer of the power to congress be among those which have the most weight instead of act as a nation in regard to foreign power the state individually have commence a system of restraint on each other whereby the interest of foreign power be promote at they expense if one state impose high duty on the goods or vessel of a foreign power to countervail the regulation of such power the next adjoining state impose lighter duty to invite those article into they port that they might be transfer thence into the other state secure the duty to themselves this contract policy in some of the state be soon counteract by other restraint be immediately lay on such commerce by the suffering state and thus have grow up a state of affair disorderly and unnatural the tendency of which be to destroy the union itself and with it all hope of realize those blessing which we have anticipate from the glorious revolution which have be so recently achieve from this deplorable dilemma or rather certain ruin we be happily rescue by the adoption of the constitution among the first and most important effect of this great revolution be the complete abolition of this pernicious policy the state be bring together by the constitution as to commerce into one community equally in regard to foreign nation and each other the regulation that be adopt regard we in both respects as one people the duty and impost that be lay on the vessel and merchandise of foreign nation be all uniform throughout the united state and in the intercourse between the state themselves no duty of any kind be impose other than between different port and county within the same state this view be support by a series of measure all of a marked character precede the adoption of the constitution as early as the year 1781 congress recommend it to the state to vest in the united state a power to levy a duty of 5 per cent on all goods import from foreign country into the united state for the term of fifteen year in 1783 this recommendation with alteration as to the kind of duty and a extension of this term to twenty-five year be repeat and more earnestly urge in 1784 it be recommend to the state to authorize congress to prohibit under certain modification the importation of goods from foreign power into the united state for fifteen year in 1785 the consideration of the subject be resume and a proposition present in a new form with a address to the state explain fully the principle on which a grant of the power to regulate trade be deem indispensable in 1786 a meeting take place at annapoli of delegate from several of the state on this subject and on they report a convention be form at philadelphium the ensue year from all the state to whose deliberation we be indebted for the present constitution in none of these measure be the subject of internal improvement mention or even glance at those of 178417851786 and 1787 leading step by step to the adoption of the constitution have in view only the obtain of a power to enable congress to regulate trade with foreign power it be manifest that the regulation of trade with the several state be altogether a secondary object suggest by and adopt in connection with the other if the power necessary to this system of improvement be include under either branch of this grant i should suppose that it be the first rather than the second the pretension to it however under that branch have never be set up in support of the claim under the second no reason have be assign which appear to have the least weight the fourth claim be found on the right of congress to pay the debt and provide for the common defense and general welfare of the united state this claim have less reason on its side than either of those which we have already examine the power of which this form a part be express in the follow word : congress shall have power to lay and collect tax duty impost and excise to pay the debt and provide for the common defense and general welfare of the united state but all duty impost and excise shall be uniform throughout the united state that the second part of this grant give a right to appropriate the public money and nothing more be evident from the follow consideration : first if the right of appropriation be not give by this clause it be not give at all there be no other grant in the constitution which give it directly or which have any bearing on the subject even by implication except the two follow : first the prohibition which be contain in the eleventh of the enumerated power not to appropriate money for the support of army for a longer term than two year and second the declaration of the sixth member or clause of the ninth section of the first article that no money shall be draw from the treasury but in consequence of appropriation make by law second this part of the grant have none of the characteristic of a distinct and original power it be manifestly incidental to the great object of the first part of the grant which authorize congress to lay and collect tax duty impost and excise a power of vast extent not grant by the confederation the grant of which form one of the principal inducement to the adoption of this constitution if both part of the grant be take together -lrb- as they must be for the one follow immediately after the other in the same sentence -rrb- it seem to be impossible to give to the latter any other construction than that contend for congress shall have power to lay and collect tax duty impost and excise for what purpose to pay the debt and provide for the common defense and general welfare of the united state a arrangement and phraseology which clearly show that the latter part of the clause be intend to enumerate the purpose to which the money thus raise might be appropriate third if this be not the real object and fair construction of the second part of this grant it follow either that it have no import or operation whatever or one of much greater extent than the first part this presumption be evidently groundless in both instance in the first because no part of the constitution can be consider useless no sentence or clause in it without a meaning in the second because such a construction as make the second part of the clause a original grant embrace the same object with the first but with much greater power than it would be in the highest degree absurd the order generally observe in grant a order found in common sense since it promote a clear understanding of they import be to grant the power intend to be convey in the most full and explicit manner and then to explain or qualify it if explanation or qualification should be necessary this order have it be believe be invariably observe in all the grant contain in the constitution in the second because if the clause in question be not construe merely as a authority to appropriate the public money it must be obvious that it convey a power of indefinite and unlimited extent that there would have be no use for the special power to raise and support army and a navy to regulate commerce to call forth the militia or even to lay and collect tax duty impost and excise a unqualified power to pay the debt and provide for the common defense and general welfare as the second part of this clause would be if consider as a distinct and separate grant would extend to every object in which the public could be interested a power to provide for the common defense would give to congress the command of the whole force and of all the resource of the union but a right to provide for the general welfare would go much further it would in effect break down all the barrier between the state and the general government and consolidate the whole under the latter the power specifically grant to congress be what be call the enumerated power and be number in the order in which they stand among which that contain in the first clause hold the first place in point of importance if the power create by the latter part of the clause be consider a original grant unconnected with and independent of the first as in that case it must be then the first part be entirely do away as be all the other grant in the constitution be completely absorb in the transcendent power grant in the latter part but if the clause be construe in the sense contend for then every part have a important meaning and effect not a line a word in it be superfluous a power to lay and collect tax duty impost and excise subject to the call of congress every branch of the public revenue internal and external and the addition to pay the debt and provide for the common defense and general welfare give the right of apply the money raise -- that be of appropriate it to the purpose specify accord to a proper construction of the term hence it follow that it be the first part of the clause only which give a power which affect in any manner the power remain to the state as the power to raise money from the people whether it be by tax duty impost or excise though concurrent in the state as to tax and excise must necessarily do but the use or application of the money after it be raise be a power altogether of a different character it impose no burden on the people nor can it act on they in a sense to take power from the state or in any sense in which power can be controvert or become a question between the two government the application of money raise under a lawful power be a right or grant which may be abuse it may be apply partially among the state or to improper purpose in we foreign and domestic concern but still it be a power not feel in the sense of other power since the only complaint which any state can make of such partiality and abuse be that some other state or state have obtain greater benefit from the application than by a just rule of apportionment they be entitle to the right of appropriation be therefore from its nature secondary and incidental to the right of raise money and it be proper to place it in the same grant and same clause with that right by rind they then in that order we see a new proof of the sense in which the grant be make correspond with the view herein take of it the last part of this grant which provide that all duty impost and excise shall be uniform throughout the united state furnish another strong proof that it be not intend that the second part should constitute a distinct grant in the sense above state or convey any other right than that of appropriation this provision operate exclusively on the power grant in the first part of the clause it recite three branch of that power -- duty impost and excise -- those only on which it could operate the rule by which the fourth -- that be tax -- should be lay be already provide for in another part of the constitution the object of this provision be to secure a just equality among the state in the exercise of that power by congress by place it after both the grant -- that be after that to raise and that to appropriate the public money -- and make it apply to the first only it show that it be not intend that the power grant in the second should be paramount to and destroy that grant in the first it show also that no such formidable power as that suggest have be grant in the second or any power against the abuse of which it be think necessary specially to provide surely if it be deem proper to guard a specific power of limited extent and well-known import against injustice and abuse it would have be much more so to have guard against the abuse of a power of such vast extent and so indefinite as would have be grant by the second part of the clause if consider as a distinct and original grant with this construction all the other enumerated grant and indeed all the grant of power contain in the constitution have they full operation and effect they all stand well together fulfil the great purpose intend by they under it we behold a great scheme consistent in all its part a government institute for national purpose vest with adequate power for those purpose commence with the most important of all that of the revenue and proceeding in regular order to the other with which it be deem proper to endow it all too draw with the utmost circumspection and care how much more consistent be this construction with the great object of the institution and with the high character of the enlighten and patriotic citizen who frame it as well as of those who ratify it than one which subvert every sound principle and rule of construction and throw everything into confusion i have dwell thus long on this part of the subject from a earnest desire to fix in a clear and satisfactory manner the import of the second part of this grant well know from the generality of the term use they tendency to lead into error i indulge a strong hope that the view herein present will not be without effect but will tend to satisfy the unprejudiced and impartial that nothing more be grant by that part than a power to _ appropriate _ the public money raise under the other part to what extent that power may be carry will be the next object of inquiry it be contend on the one side that as the national government be a government of limited power it have no right to expend money except in the performance of act authorize by the other specific grant accord to a strict construction of they power that this grant in neither of its branch give to congress discretionary power of any kind but be a mere instrument in its hand to carry into effect the power contain in the other grant to this construction i be incline in the more early stage of we government but on further reflection and observation my mind have undergo a change for reason which i will frankly unfold the grant consist as heretofore observe of a twofold power -- the first to raise the second to appropriate the public money -- and the term use in both instance be general and unqualified bach branch be obviously draw with a view to the other and the import of each tend to illustrate that of the other the grant to raise money give a power over every subject from which revenue may be draw and be make in the same manner with the grant to declare war to raise and support army and a navy to regulate commerce to establish post-office and post-road and with all the other specific grant to the general government in the discharge of the power contain in any of these grant there be no other check than that which be to be find in the great principle of we system the responsibility of the representative to he constituent if war for example be necessary and congress declare it for good cause they constituent will support they in it a like support will be give they for the faithful discharge of they duty under any and every other power vest in the united state it afford to the friend of we free government the most heartfelt consolation to know -- and from the best evidence we own experience -- that in great emergency the boldest measure such as form the strongest appeal to the virtue and patriotism of the people be sure to obtain the most decide approbation but should the representative act corruptly and betray he trust or otherwise prove that he be unworthy of the confidence of he constituent he would be equally sure to lose it and to be remove and otherwise censure accord to he desert the power to raise money by tax duty impost and excise be alike unqualified nor do i see any check on the exercise of it other than that which apply to the other power above recite the responsibility of the representative to he constituent congress know the extent of the public engagement and the sum necessary to meet they they know how much may be derive from each branch of revenue without press it too far and pay due regard to the interest of the people they likewise know which branch ought to be resort to in the first instance from the commencement of the government two branch of this power duty and impost have be in constant operation the revenue from which have support the government in its various branch and meet its other ordinary engagement in great emergency the other two tax and excise have likewise be resort to and neither be the right or the policy ever call in question if we look to the second branch of this power that which authorize the appropriation of the money thus raise we find that it be not less general and unqualified than the power to raise it more comprehensive term than to pay the debt and provide for the common defense and general welfare could not have be use so intimately connect with and dependent on each other be these two branch of power that have either be limit the limitation would have have the like effect on the other have the power to raise money be conditional or restricted to special purpose the appropriation must have correspond with it for none but the money raise could be appropriate nor could it be appropriate to other purpose than those which be permit on the other hand if the right of appropriation have be restrict to certain purpose it would be useless and improper to raise more than would be adequate to those purpose it may fairly be infer these restraint or check have be carefully and intentionally avoid the power in each branch be alike broad and unqualified and each be draw with peculiar fitness to the other the latter require term of great extent and force to accommodate the former which have be adopt and both place in the same clause and sentence can it be presume that all these circumstance be so nicely adjust by mere accident be it not more just to conclude that they be the result of due deliberation and design have it be intend that congress should be restrict in the appropriation of the public money to such expenditure as be authorize by a rigid construction of the other specific grant how easy would it have be to have provide for it by a declaration to that effect the omission of such declaration be therefore a additional proof that it be not intend that the grant should be so construe it be evidently impossible to have subject this grant in either branch to such restriction without expose the government to very serious embarrassment how carry it into effect if the grant have be make in any degree dependent upon the state the government would have experience the fate of the confederation like it it would have wither and soon perish have the supreme court be authorize or should any other tribunal distinct from the government be authorize to impose its veto and to say that more money have be raise under either branch of this power -- that be by tax duty impost or excise -- than be necessary that such a tax or duty be useless that the appropriation to this or that purpose be unconstitutional the movement might have be suspend and the whole system disorganize it be impossible to have create a power within the government or any other power distinct from congress and the executive which should control the movement of the government in this respect and not destroy it have it be declare by a clause in the constitution that the expenditure under this grant should be restricted to the construction which might be give of the other grant such restraint though the most innocent could not have fail to have have a injurious effect on the vital principle of the government and often on its most important measure those who might wish to defeat a measure propose might construe the power rely on in support of it in a narrow and contract manner and in that way fix a precedent inconsistent with the true import of the grant at other time those who favor a measure might give to the power rely on a forced or strained construction and succeed in the object fix a precedent in the opposite extreme thus it be manifest that if the right of appropriation be confine to that limit measure may oftentimes be carry or defeat by consideration and motive altogether independent of and unconnected with they merit and the several power of congress receive construction equally inconsistent with they true import no such declaration however have be make and from the fair import of the grant and indeed its positive term the inference that such be intend seem to be preclude many consideration of great weight operate in favor of this construction while i do not perceive any serious objection to it if it be establish it follow that the word to provide for the common defense and general welfare have a definite safe and useful mean the idea of they form a original grant with unlimited power supersede every other grant be abandon they will be consider simply as convey a right of appropriation a right indispensable to that of raise a revenue and necessary to expenditure under every grant by it as already observe no new power will be take from the state the money to be appropriate be raise under a power already grant to congress by it too the motive for give a forced or strained construction to any of the other specific grant will in most instance be diminish and in many utterly destroy the importance of this consideration can not be too highly estimate since in addition to the example already give it ought particularly to be recollect that to whatever extent any specified power may be carry the right of jurisdiction go with it pursue it through all its incident the very important agency which this grant have in carry into effect every other grant be a wrong argument in favor of the construction contend for all the other grant be limit by the nature of the office which they have severally to perform each convey a power to do a certain thing and that only whereas this be coextensive with the great scheme of the government itself it be the lever which raise and put the whole machinery in motion and continue the movement should either of the other grant fail in consequence of any condition or limitation attach to it or misconstruction of its power much injury might follow but still it would be the failure of one branch of power of one item in the system only all the other might move on but should the right to raise and appropriate the public money be improperly restricted the whole system might be sensibly affect if not disorganize each of the other grant be limit by the nature of the grant itself this by the nature of the government only hence it become necessary that like the power to declare war this power should be commensurate with the great scheme of the government and with all its purpose if then the right to raise and appropriate the public money be not restricted to the expenditure under the other specific grant accord to a strict construction of they power respectively be there no limitation to it have congress a right to raise and appropriate the money to any and to every purpose accord to they will and pleasure they certainly have not the government of the united state be a limited government institute for great national purpose and for those only other interest be commit to the state whose duty it be to provide for they each government should look to the great and essential purpose for which it be institute and confine itself to those purpose a state government will rarely if ever apply money to national purpose without make it a charge to the nation the people of the state would not permit it nor will congress be apt to apply money in aid of the state administration for purpose strictly local in which the nation at large have no interest although the state should desire it the people of the other state would condemn it they would declare that congress have no right to tax they for such a purpose and dismiss at the next election such of they representative as have vote for the measure especially if it should be severely feel i do not think that in office of this kind there be much danger of the two government mistake they interest or they duty i rather expect that they would soon have a clear and distinct understanding of they and move on in great harmony good road and canal will promote many very important national purpose they will facilitate the operation of war the movement of troops the transportation of cannon of provision and every warlike store much to we advantage and to the disadvantage of the enemy in time of war good road will facilitate the transportation of the mail and thereby promote the purpose of commerce and political intelligence among the people they will by be properly direct to these object enhance the value of we vacant land a treasure of vast resource to the nation to the appropriation of the public money to improvement have these object in view and carry to a certain extent i do not see any well-founded constitutional objection in regard to we foreign concern provide they be manage with integrity and ability great liberality be allowable in the application of the public money in the management of these concern no state interest can be affect no state rights violate the complete and exclusive control over they be vest in congress the power to form treaty of alliance and commerce with foreign power to regulate by law we commerce with they to determine on peace or war to raise army and a navy to call forth the militia and direct they operation belong to the general government these great power embrace the whole scope of we foreign relation be grant on what principle can it be say that the minor be withhold be not the latter clearly and evidently comprise in the former nation be sometimes call upon to perform to each other act of humanity and kindness of which we see so many illustrious example between individual in private life great calamity make appeal to the benevolence of mankind which ought not to be resist good office in such emergency exalt the character of the party render they by exciting grateful feeling they soften the intercourse between nation and tend to prevent war surely if the united state have a right to make war they have a right to prevent it how be it possible to grant to congress a power for such minor purpose other than in general term comprise it within the scope and policy of that which convey it for the greater the right of appropriation be nothing more than a right to apply the public money to this or that purpose it have no incidental power nor do it draw after it any consequence of that kind all that congress could do under it in the case of internal improvement would be to appropriate the money necessary to make they for every act require legislative sanction or support the state authority must be rely on the condemnation of the land if the proprietor should refuse to sell it the establishment of turnpike and toll and the protection of the work when finish must be do by the state to these purpose the power of the general government be believe to be utterly incompetent to the objection that the united state have no power in any instance which be not complete to all the purpose to which it may be make instrumental and in consequence that they have no right to appropriate any portion of the public money to internal improvement because they have not the right of sovereignty and jurisdiction over they when make a full answer have it be presume be already give it may however be proper to add that if this objection be well found it would not be confine to the simple case of internal improvement but would apply to other of high importance congress have a right to regulate commerce to give effect to this power it become necessary to establish custom-house in every state along the coast and in many part of the interior the vast amount of goods import and the duty to be perform to accommodate the merchant and secure the revenue make it necessary that spacious building should be erect especially in the great town for they reception this it be manifest could best be perform under the direction of the general government have congress the right to seize the property of individual if they should refuse to sell it in quarter best adapt to the purpose to have it value and to take it at the valuation have they a right to exercise jurisdiction within those building neither of these claim have ever be set up nor could it as be presume be sustain they have invariably either rent house where such as be suitable could be obtain or where they could not purchase the ground of individual erect the building and hold they under the law of the state under the power to establish post-office and post-roads house be also requisite for the reception of the mail and the transaction of the business of the several office these have always be rent or purchase and hold under the law of the state in the same manner as if they have be take by a citizen the united state have a right to establish tribunal inferior to the supreme court and such have be establish in every state of the union it be believe that the house for these inferior court have invariably be rent no right of jurisdiction in they have ever be claim nor other right than that of privilege and that only while the court be in session a still stronger case may be urge should congress be compel by invasion or other cause to remove the government to some town within one of the state would they have a right of jurisdiction over such town or hold even the house in which they hold they session under other authority than the law of such state it be believe that they would not if they have a right to appropriate money for any of these purpose to be lay out under the protection of the law of the state surely they have a equal right to do it for the purpose of internal improvement it be believe that there be not a corporation in the union which do not exercise great discretion in the application of the money raise by it to the purpose of its institution it would be strange if the government of the united state which be institute for such important purpose and endowed with such extensive power should not be allow at least equal discretion and authority the evil to be particularly avoid be the violation of state rights shun that it seem to be reasonable and proper that the power of congress should be so construe as that the general government in its intercourse with other nation and in we internal concern should be able to adopt all such measure lie within the fair scope and intend to facilitate the direct object of its power as the public welfare may require and a sound and provident policy dictate the measure of congress have be in strict accord with the view take of the right of appropriation both as to its extent and limitation as will be show by a reference to the law commence at a very early period many road have be open of which the follow be the principal : the first from cumberland at the head water of the potomac in the state of maryland through pennsylvanium and virginium to the state of ohio -lrb- march 29 1806 see vol 4 p 13 of the late edition of the law -rrb- the second from the frontier of

112 -rrb- the eleventh from reynoldsburg on tennessee river in the state of tennessee through the chickasaw nation to intersect the natchez road near the chickasaw old town -lrb- march 3 1817 p 252 -rrb- the twelfth : by this act authority be give to the president to appoint three commissioner for the purpose of examine the country and lay out a road from the termination of the cumberland road at wheeling on the ohio through the state of ohio indiana and illinoi to a point to be choose by they on the left bank of the mississippus between st loui and the mouth of the illinoi river and to report a accurate plan of the say road with a estimate of the expense of make it it be however declare by the act that nothing be thereby intend to imply a obligation on the part of the united state to make or defray the expense of make the say road or any part thereof in the late war two other road be make by the troops for military purpose -- one from the upper sandusky in the state of ohio through the black swamp toward detroit and another from plattsburg on lake champlain through the chatauga wood toward sackett harbor which have since be repair and improve by the troops of these latter there be no notice in the law the extra pay to the soldier for repair and improve those road be advance in the first instance from the appropriation to the quartermaster 's department and afterwards provide for by a specific appropriation by congress the necessity of keep those road open and in good repair be on the frontier to facilitate a communication between we post be apparent all of these road except the first be form merely by cut down the tree and throw log across so as to make causeway over such part as be otherwise impassable the execution be of the coarsest kind the cumberland road be the only regular work which have be undertake by the general government or which could give rise to any question between the two government respect its power it be a great work over the highest mountain in we union connect from the seat of the general government the eastern with the western water and more intimately the atlantic with the western state in the formation of which $ 1800000 have be expend the measure pursue in this case require to be particularly notice as fix the opinion of the party and particularly of congress on the important question of the right pass through maryland pennsylvanium and virginium it be think necessary and proper to bring the subject before they respective legislature to obtain they sanction which be grant by each state by a legislative act approve the route and provide for the purchase and condemnation of the land this road be found on a article of compact between the united state and the state of ohio under which that state come into the union and by which the expense attend it be to be defray by the application of a certain portion of the money arise from the sale of the public land within that state in this instance which be by far the strongest in respect to the expense extent and nature of the work do the united state have exercise no act of jurisdiction or sovereignty within either of the state by take the land from the proprietor by force by pass act for the protection of the road or to raise a revenue from it by the establishment of turnpike and toll or any other act found on the principle of jurisdiction or right whatever they have do have on the contrary be found on the opposite principle on the voluntary and unqualified admission that the sovereignty belong to the state and not to the united state and that they could perform no act which should tend to weaken the power of the state or to assume any to themselves all that they have do have be to appropriate the public money to the construction of this road and to cause it to be construct for i presume that no distinction can be take between the appropriation of money raise by the sale of the public land and of that which arise from tax duty impost and excise nor can i believe that the power to appropriate derive any sanction from a provision to that effect have be make by a article of compact between the united state and the people of the then territory of ohio this point may however be place in a clearer light by a more particular notice of the article itself by a act of April 30 1802 entitle a act to enable the people of the eastern division of the territory northwest of the river ohio to form a constitution and state government and for the admission of such state into the union on a equal footing with the original state and for other purpose after describe the limit of the propose new state and authorize the people thereof to elect a convention to form a constitution the three follow proposition be make to the convention to be obligatory on the united state if accept by it : first that section no 16 of every township or where such section have be sell other land equivalent thereto should be grant to the inhabitant of such township for the use of free school second that the 6 mile ' reservation include the salt spring commonly call the sciota salt spring the salt spring near the muskingum river and in the military tract with the section which include the same should be grant to the say state for the use of the people thereof under such regulation as the legislature of the state should prescribe : _ provide _ that it should never sell or lease the same for more than ten year third that one twentieth part of the proceeds of the public land lie within the say state which might be sell by congress from and after the 30th June ensue should be apply to the lay out and make public road from the navigable water empty into the atlantic to the ohio and through the state of ohio such road to be lay out under the authority of congress with the consent of the several state through which they should pass these three proposition be make on the condition that the convention of the state should provide by a ordinance irrevocable without the consent of the united state that every tract of land sell by congress after the 30th of June ensue should remain for the term of five year after sale exempt from every species of tax whatsoever it be impossible to read the ordinance of the 23d of April 1784 or the provision of the act of April 30 1802 which be found on it without be profoundly impressed with the enlighten and magnanimous policy which dictate they anticipate that the new state would be settle by the inhabitant of the original state and they offspring no narrow or contract jealousy be entertain of they admission into the union in equal participation in the national sovereignty with the original state it be foresee at the early period at which that ordinance pass that the expansion of we union to the lake and to the mississippus and all its water would not only make we a greater power but cement the union itself these three proposition be well calculate to promote these great result a grant of land to each township for free school and of the salt spring to the state which be within its limit for the use of its citizen with 5 per cent of the money to be raise from the sale of land within the state for the construction of road between the original state and the new state and of other road within the state indicate a spirit not to be mistake nor could it fail to produce a corresponding effect in the bosom of those to whom it be address for these consideration the sole return require of the convention be that the new state should not tax the public land which might be sell by the united state within it for the term of five year after they should be sell as the value of these land would be enhance by this exemption from tax for that term and from which the new state would derive its proportionable benefit and as it would also promote the rapid sale of those land and with it the augmentation of its own population it can not be doubt have this exemption be suggest unaccompanied by any proposition of particular advantage that the convention would in consideration of the relation which have before exist between the party and be about to be so much improve most willingly have accede to it and without regard it as a onerous condition since then it appear that the whole of the money to be employ in make this road be to be raise from the sale of the public land and which would still belong to the united state although no mention have be make of they in the compact it follow that the application of the money to that purpose stand upon the same ground as if such compact have not be make and in consequence that the example in favor of the right of appropriation be in no manner affect by it the same rule of construction of the right of appropriation have be observe and the same liberal policy pursue toward the other new state with certain modification adapt to the situation of each which be adopt with the state of ohio as however the reasoning which be applicable to the compact with ohio in relation to the right of appropriation in which light only i have advert to it be equally applicable to the several compact with the other new state i deem it unnecessary to take a particular notice of they it be proper to observe that the money which be employ in the construction of all the other road be take directly from the treasury this fact afford a additional proof that in the contemplation of congress no difference exist in the application of money to those road between that which be raise by the sale of land and that which be derive from tax duty impost and excise so far i have confine my remark to the act of congress respect the right of appropriation to such measure only as operate internally and affect the territory of the individual state in adverting to those which operate externally and relate to foreign power i find only two which appear to merit particular attention these be gratuitous grant of money for the relief of foreigner in distress -- the first in 1794 to the inhabitant of st domingo who seek a asylum on we coast from the convulsion and calamity of the island the second in 1812 to the people of caraca reduce to misery by a earthquake the consideration which be applicable to these grant have already be notice and need not be repeat in this examination of the right of appropriation i think it proper to present to view also the practice of the government under it and to explore the ground on which each example rest that the precise nature and extent of the construction thereby give of the right might be clearly understand the right to raise money would have give as be presume the right to use it although nothing have be say to that effect in the constitution and where the right to raise it be grant without special limitation we must look for such limitation to other cause we attention be first draw to the right to appropriate and not find it there we must then look to the general power of the government as designate by the specific grant and to the purpose contemplate by they allow to this -lrb- the right to raise money -rrb- the first and most important of the enumerated power a scope which will be competent to those purpose the practice of the government as illustrate by numerous and strong example directly applicable ought surely to have great weight in fix the construction of each grant it ought i presume to settle it especially where it be acquiesce in by the nation and produce a manifest and positive good a practical construction thus support show that it have reason on its side and be call for by the interest of the union hence too the presumption that it will be persevere in it will surely be better to admit that the construction give by these example have be just arid proper than to deny that construction and still to practice on it -- to say one thing and to do another wherein consist the danger of give a liberal construction to the right of congress to raise and appropriate the public money it have be show that its obvious effect be to secure the rights of the state from encroachment and greater harmony in the political movement between the two government while it enlarge to a certain extent in the most harmless way the useful agency of the general government for all the purpose of its institution be not the responsibility of the representative to he constituent in every branch of the general government equally strong and as sensibly feel as in the state government and be not the security against abuse as effectual in the one as in the other government the history of the general government in all its measure fully demonstrate that congress will never venture to impose unnecessary burden on the people or any that can be avoid duty and impost have always be light not greater perhaps than would have be impose for the encouragement of we manufacture have there be no occasion for the revenue arise from they and tax and excise have never be lay except in case of necessity and repeal as soon as the necessity cease under this mild process and the sale of some hundred of million of acre of good land the government will be possess of money which may be apply with great advantage to national purpose within the state only will it be apply and of course for they benefit it not be presumable that such appeal as be make to the benevolence of the country in the instance of the inhabitant of st domingo and caraca will often occur how then shall this revenue be apply should it be idle in the treasury that we resource will be equal to such useful purpose i have no doubt especially if by complete we fortification and raise and maintain we navy at the point provide for immediately after the war we sustain we present altitude and preserve by means thereof for any length of time the peace of the union when we hear charge raise against other government of breach of they constitution or rather of they charter we always anticipate the most serious consequence -- community deprive of privilege which they have long enjoy or individual oppress and punish in violation of the ordinary form and guard of trial to which they be accustom and entitle how different be the situation of the united state nor can anything mark more strongly the great characteristic of that difference than the grounds on which like charge be raise against this government it be not allege that any portion of the community or any individual have be oppress or that money have be raise under a doubtful title the principal charge be that a work of great utility to the union and affect immediately and with like advantage many of the state have be construct that pension to the survive patriot of we revolution to patriot who fight the battle and promote the independence of they country have be grant by money too raise not only without oppression but almost without be feel and under a acknowledged constitutional power from this view of the right to appropriate and of the practice under it i think that i be authorize to conclude that the right to make internal improvement have not be grant by the power to pay the debt and provide for the common defense and general welfare include in the first of the enumerated power that that grant convey nothing more than a right to appropriate the public money and stand on the same ground with the right to lay and collect tax duty impost and excise convey by the first branch of that power that the government itself be limit both branch of the power to raise and appropriate the public money be also limit the extent of the government as designate by the specific grant mark the extent of the power in both branch extend however to every object embrace by the fair scope of those grant and not confine to a strict construction of they respective power it be safer to aid the purpose of those grant by the appropriation of money than to extend by a forced construction the grant itself that although the right to appropriate the public money to such improvement afford a resource indispensably necessary to such a scheme it be nevertheless deficient as a power in the great characteristic on which its execution depend the substance of what have be urge on this subject may be express in a few word my idea be that congress have a unlimited power to raise money and that in its appropriation they have a discretionary power restricted only by the duty to appropriate it to purpose of common defense and of general not local national not state benefit i will now proceed to the fifth source from which the power be say to be derive viz the power to make all law which shall be necessary and proper for carry into execution all the power vest by the constitution in the government of the united state or in any department or officer thereof this be the seventeenth and last of the enumerated power grant to congress i have always consider this power as have be grant on a principle of greater caution to secure the complete execution of all the power which have be vest in the general government it contain no distinct and specific power as every other grant do such as to lay and collect tax to declare war to regulate commerce and the like look to the whole scheme of the general government it give to congress authority to make all law which should be deem necessary and proper for carry all its power into effect my impression have be invariably that this power would have exist substantially if this grant have not be make for why be any power grant unless it be to be execute when require and how can it be execute under we government unless it be by law necessary and proper for the purpose -- that be well adapt to the end it be a principle universally admit that a grant of a power convey as a necessary consequence or incident to it the means of carry it into effect by a fair construction of its import in the formation however of the constitution which be to act directly upon the people and be paramount to the extent of its power to the constitution of the state it be wise in its framer to leave nothing to implication which might be reduce to certainty it be know that all power which rest solely on that ground have be systematically and zealously oppose under all government with which we have any acquaintance and it be reasonable to presume that under we system where there be a division of the sovereignty between the two independent government the measure of the general government would excite equal jealousy and produce a opposition not less systematic though perhaps less violent hence the policy by the framer of we government of secure by a fundamental declaration in the constitution a principle which in all other government have be leave to implication only the term necessary and proper secure to the power of all the grant to which the authority give in this be applicable a fair and sound construction which be equally bind as a rule on both government and on all they department in examine the right of the general government to adopt and execute under this grant a system of internal improvement the sole question to be decide be whether the power have be grant under any of the other grant if it have this power be applicable to it to the extent state if it have not it do not exist at all for it have not be hereby grant i have already examine all the other grant -lrb- one only excepted which will next claim attention -rrb- and show as i presume on the most liberal construction of they power that the right have not be grant by any of they hence it follow that in regard to they it have not be grant by this i come now to the last source from which this power be say to be derive viz the power to dispose of and make all needful rule and regulation respect the territory or other property of the united state which be contain in the second clause of the third section of the fourth article of the constitution to form a just opinion of the nature and extent of this power it will be necessary to bring into view the provision contain in the first clause of the section of the article refer to which make a essential part of the policy in question by this it be declare that new state shall be admit into the union but that no new state shall be form or erect within the jurisdiction of any other state nor any state be form by the junction of two or more state or part of state without the consent of the legislature of the state concern as well as of the united state if we recur to the condition of we country at the commencement of the revolution we shall see the origin and cause of these provision by the charter of the several colony limit by latitude and other description be assign to each in commence the revolution the colony as have already be observe claim by those limit although they population extend in many instance to a small portion of the territory lie within they it be contend by some of the state after the declaration of independence that the vacant land lie within any of the state should become the property of the union as by a common exertion they would be acquire this claim be resist by the other on the principle that all the state enter into the contest in the full extent of they chartered rights and that they ought to have the full benefit of those rights in the event of success happily this controversy be settle as all interfere claim and pretension between the member of we union and between the general government and any of these member have be in the most amicable manner and to the satisfaction of all party on the recommendation of congress the individual state have such territory within they chartered limit cede large portion thereof to the united state on condition that it should be lay off into district of proper dimension the land to be sell for the benefit of the united state and that the district be admit into the union when they should obtain such a population as it might be think proper and reasonable to prescribe this be the territory and this the property refer to in the second clause of the fourth article of the constitution all the state which have make cession of vacant territory except georgium have make they before the adoption of the constitution and that state have make a proposition to congress to that effect which be under consideration at the time the constitution be adopt the cession be complete after the adoption of the constitution it be make on the same principle and on similar condition with those which have be already make by the other state as difference might arise respect the right or the policy in congress to admit new state into the union under the new government or to make regulation for the government of the territory cede in the intermediate state or for the improvement and sale of the public land or to accept other cession it be think proper to make special provision for these object which be accordingly do by the above-recited clause in the constitution thus the power of congress over the cede territory be not only limited to these special object but be also temporary as soon as the territory become a state the jurisdiction over it as it have before exist cease it extend afterwards only to the unsold land and as soon as the whole be sell it cease in that sense also altogether from that moment the united state have no jurisdiction or power in the new state other than in the old nor can it be obtain except by a amendment of the constitution since then it be manifest that the power grant to congress to dispose of and make all needful regulation respect the territory and other property of the united state relate solely to the territory and property which have be cede by individual state and which after such cession lay without they respective limit and for which special provision be deem necessary the main power of the constitution operating internally not be applicable or adequate thereto it follow that this power give no authority and have even no bearing on the question of internal improvement the authority to admit new state and to dispose of the property and regulate the territory be not among the enumerated power grant to congress because the duty to be perform under it be not among the ordinary duty of that body like the imposition of tax the regulation of commerce and the like they be object in they nature special and for which special provision be more suitable and proper have now examine all the power of congress under which the right to adopt and execute a system of internal improvement be claim and the reason in support of it in each instance i think that it may fairly be conclude that such a right have not be grant it appear and be admit that much may be do in aid of such a system by the right which be derive from several of the exist grant and more especially from that to appropriate the public money but still it be manifest that as a system for the united state it can never be carry into effect under that grant nor under all of they unite the great and essential power be deficient consist of a right to take up the subject on principle to cause we union to be examine by man of science with a view to such improvement to authorize commissioner to lay off the road and canal in all proper direction to take the land at a valuation if necessary and to construct the work to pass law with suitable penalty for they protection and to raise a revenue from they to keep they in repair and make further improvement by the establishment of turnpike and toll with gate to be place at the proper distance it need scarcely be remark that this power will operate like many other now exist without affect the sovereignty of the state except in the particular office to be perform the jurisdiction of the several state may still exist over the road and canal within they respective limit extend alike to person and property as if the right to make and protect such improvement have not be vest in congress the right be make commensurate simply with the purpose indispensable to the system may be strictly confine to they the right of congress to protect the work by law impose penalty would operate on the same principle as the right to protect the mail the act be punishable only a jurisdiction over the place would be altogether unnecessary and even absurd in the precede inquiry little have be say of the advantage which would attend the exercise of such a power by the general government i have make the inquiry under a deep conviction that they be almost incalculable and that there be a general concurrence of opinion among we fellow-citizen to that effect still it may not be improper for I to state the grounds upon which my own impression be found if it shed no additional light on this interesting part of the subject it will at least show that i have have more than one powerful motive for make the inquiry a general idea be all that i shall attempt the advantage of such a system must depend upon the interest to be affect by it and the extent to which they may be affect and those must depend on the capacity of we country for improvement and the means at its command applicable to that object i think that i may venture to affirm that there be no part of we globe comprehend so many degree of latitude on the main ocean and so many degree of longitude into the interior that admit of such great improvement and at so little expense the atlantic on the one side and the lake form almost inland sea on the other separate by high mountain which rise in the valley of the st lawrence and determine in that of the mississippus traverse from north to south almost the whole interior with innumerable river on every side of those mountain some of vast extent many of which take they source near to each other give the great outline the detail be to be see on the valuable map of we country it appear by the light already before the public that it be practicable and easy to connect by canal the whole coast from its southern to its northern extremity in one continue inland navigation and to connect in like manner in many part the western lake and river with each other it be equally practicable and easy to facilitate the intercourse between the atlantic and the western country by improve the navigation of many of the river which have they source near to each other in the mountain on each side and by good road across the mountain between the highest navigable point of those river in addition to the example of the cumberland road already notice another of this kind be now in train from the head water of the river jame to those of the kanawha and in like manner may the savannah be connect with the tennessee in some instance it be understand that the eastern and western water may be connect together directly by canal one great work of this kind be now in its progress and far advance in the state of new york and there be good reason to believe that two other may be form one at each extremity of the high mountain above mention connect in the one instance the water of the st lawrence with lake champlain and in the other some of the most important of the western river with those empty into the gulf of mexico the advantage of which will be see at the first glance by a enlighten observer great improvement may also be make by good road in proper direction through the interior of the country as these road would be lay out on principle on a full view of the country its mountain river etc it would be useless if i have the knowledge to go into detail respect they much have be do by some of the state but yet much remain to be do with a view to the union under the colonial government improvement of this kind be not think of there be it be believe not one canal and little communication from colony to colony it be they policy to encourage the intercourse between each colony and the parent country only the road which be attend to be those which lead from the interior of each colony to its principal town on the navigable water by those route the produce of the country be carry to the coast and ship thence to the mercantile house in london liverpool glasgow or other town to which the trade be carry on it be believe that there be but one connected route from north to south at the commencement of the revolution and that a very imperfect one the existence and principle of we union point out the necessity of a very different policy the advantage which would be derive from such improvement be incalculable the facility which would thereby be afford to the transportation of the whole of the rich production of we country to market would alone more than amply compensate for all the labor and expense attend they great however as be that advantage it be one only of many and by no mean the most important every power of the general government and of the state government connect with the strength and resource of the country would be make more efficient for the purpose intend by they in war they would facilitate the transportation of man ordnance and provision and munitions of war of every kind to every part of we extensive coast and interior on which a attack might be make or threaten those who have any knowledge of the occurrence of the late war must know the good effect which would result in the event of another war from the command of a interior navigation alone along the coast for all the purpose of war as well as of commerce between the different part of we union the impediment to all military operation which proceed from the want of such a navigation and the reliance which be place notwithstanding those impediment on such a commerce can not be forget in every other line they good effect would be most sensibly feel intelligence by means of the post-office department would be more easily extensively and rapidly diffuse part the most remote from each other would be bring more closely together distant land would be make more valuable and the industry of we fellow-citizen on every portion of we soil be better reward it be natural in so great a variety of climate that there should be a corresponding difference in the produce of the soil that one part should raise what the other might want it be equally natural that the pursuit of industry should vary in like manner that labor should be cheaper and manufacture succeed better in one part than in another that be the climate the most severe and the soil less productive navigation the fishery and commerce should be most rely on hence the motive for a exchange for mutual accommodation and active intercourse between they each part would thus find for the surplus of its labor in whatever article it consist a extensive market at home which would be the most profitable because free from duty there be another view in which these improvement be of still more vital importance the effect which they would have on the bond of union itself afford a inducement for they more powerful than any which have be urge or than all of they unite the only danger to which we system be expose arise from its expansion over a vast territory we union be not hold together by stand army or by any tie other than the positive interest and powerful attraction of its part toward each other ambitious man may hereafter grow up among we who may promise to themselves advancement from a change and by practice upon the sectional interest feeling and prejudice endeavor under various pretext to promote it the history of the world be replete with example of this kind -- of military commander and demagogue become usurper and tyrant and of they fellow-citizen become they instrument and slave i have little fear of this danger know well how strong the bond which hold we together be and who the people be who be thus hold together but still it be proper to look at and to provide against it and it be not within the compass of human wisdom to make a more effectual provision than would be make by the propose improvement with they aid and the intercourse which would grow out of they the part would soon become so compacted and bind together that nothing could break it the expansion of we union over a vast territory can not operate unfavorably to the state individually on the contrary it be believe that the greater the expansion within practicable limit -- and it be not easy to say what be not so -- the greater the advantage which the state individually will derive from it with government separate vigorous and efficient for all local purpose they distance from each other can have no injurious effect upon they respective interest it have already be show that in some important circumstance especially with the aid of these improvement they must derive great advantage from that cause alone -- that be from they distance from each other in every other way the expansion of we system must operate favorably for every state in proportion as it operate favorably for the union it be in that sense only that it can become a question with the state or rather with the people who compose they as state they can be affect by it only by they relation to each other through the general government and by its effect on the operation of that government manifest it be that to any extent to which the general government can sustain and execute its function with complete effect will the state -- that be the people who compose they -- be benefit it be only when the expansion shall be carry beyond the faculty of the general government so as to enfeeble its operation to the injury of the whole that any of the part can be injure the tendency in that stage will be to dismemberment and not to consolidation this danger should therefore be look at with profound attention as one of a very serious character i will remark here that as the operation of the national government be of a general nature the state have complete power for internal and local purpose the expansion may be carry to very great extent and with perfect safety it must be obvious to all that the further the expansion be carry provide it be not beyond the just limit the greater will be the freedom of action to both government and the more perfect they security and in all other respects the better the effect will be to the whole american people extent of territory whether it be great or small give to a nation many of its characteristic it mark the extent of its resource of its population of its physical force it mark in short the difference between a great and a small power to what extent it may be proper to expand we system of government be a question which do not press for a decision at this time at the end of the revolutionary war in 1783 we have as we contend and believe a right to the free navigation of the mississippus but it be not until after the expiration of twelve year in 1795 that that right be acknowledge and enjoy further difficulty occur in the bustling of a contentious world when at the expiration of eight year more the unite state sustain the strength and energy of they character acquire the province of louisiana with the free navigation of the river from its source to the ocean and a liberal boundary on the western side to this florida have since be add so that we now possess all the territory in which the original state have any interest or in which the exist state can be say either in a national or local point of view to be in any way interested a range of state on the western side of the mississippus which already be provide for put we essentially at ease whether it will be wise to go further will turn on other consideration than those which have dictate the course heretofore pursue at whatever point we may stop whether it be at a single range of state beyond the mississippus or by take a greater scope the advantage of such improvement be deem of the highest importance it be so on the present scale the further we go the greater will be the necessity for they it can not be doubt that improvement for great national purpose would be better make by the national government than by the government of the several state we experience prior to the adoption of the constitution demonstrate that in the exercise by the individual state of most of the power grant to the united state a contract rivalry of interest and misapply jealousy of each other have a important influence on all they measure to the great injury of the whole this be particularly exemplify by the regulation which they severally make of they commerce with foreign nation and with each other it be this utter incapacity in the state government proceed from these and other cause to act as a nation and to perform all the duty which the nation owe to itself under any system which leave the general government dependent on the state which produce the transfer of these power to the united state by the establishment of the present constitution the reasoning which be applicable to the grant of any of the power now vest in congress be likewise so at least to a certain extent to that in question it be natural that the state individually in make improvement should look to they particular and local interest the member compose they respective legislature represent the people of each state only and might not feel themselves at liberty to look to object in these respects beyond that limit if the resource of the union be to be bring into operation under the direction of the state assembly or in concert with they it may be apprehend that every measure would become the object of negotiation of bargain and barter much to the disadvantage of the system as well as discredit to both government but congress would look to the whole and make improvement to promote the welfare of the whole it be the peculiar felicity of the propose amendment that while it will enable the united state to accomplish every national object the improvement make with that view will eminently promote the welfare of the individual state who may also add such other as they own particular interest may require the situation of the cumberland road require the particular and early attention of congress be form over very lofty mountain and in many instance over deep and wide stream across which valuable bridge have be erect which be sustain by stone wall as be many other part of the road all these work be subject to decay have decay and will decay rapidly unless timely and effectual measure be adopt to prevent it the declivity from the mountain and all the height must suffer from the frequent and heavy fall of water and its descent to the valley as also from the deep congelation during we severe winter other injury have also be experience on this road such as the displace the cap of the wall and other work commit by worthless people either from a desire to render the road impassable or to have the transportation in another direction or from a spirit of wantonness to create employment for idler these consideration show that a active and strict police ought to be establish over the whole road with power to make repair when necessary to establish turnpike and toll as the means of raise money to make they and to prosecute and punish those who commit waste and other injury should the united state be willing to abandon this road to the state through which it pass would they take charge of it each of that portion within its limit and keep it in repair it be not to be presume that they would since the advantage attend it be exclusively national by connect as it do the atlantic with the western state and in a line with the seat of the national government the most expensive part of this road lie within pennsylvanium and virginium very near the confines of each state and in a route not essentially connect with the commerce of either if it be think proper to vest this power in the united state the only mode in which it can be do be by a amendment of the constitution the state individually can not transfer the power to the united state nor can the united state receive it the constitution form a equal and the sole relation between the general government and the several state and it recognize no change in it which shall not in like manner apply to all if it be once admit that the general government may form compact with individual state not common to the other and which the other might even disapprove into what pernicious consequence might it not lead such compact be utterly repugnant to the principle of the constitution and of the most dangerous tendency the state through which this road pass have give they sanction only to the route and to the acquisition of the soil by the united state a right very different from that of jurisdiction which can not be grant without a amendment to the constitution and which need not be grant for the purpose of this system except in the limited manner heretofore state on full consideration therefore of the whole subject i be of opinion that such a amendment ought to be recommend to the several state for they adoption i have now essentially execute that part of the task which i impose on myself of examine the right of congress to adopt and execute a system of internal improvement and i presume have show that it do not exist it be i think equally manifest that such a power vest in congress and wisely execute would have the happiest effect on all the great interest of we union it be however my opinion that the power should be confine to great national work only since if it be unlimited it would be liable to abuse and might be productive of evil for all minor improvement the resource of the state individually would be fully adequate and by the state such improvement might be make with greater advantage than by the union as they would understand better such as they more immediate and local interest require in the view above present i have think it proper to trace the origin of we institution and particularly of the state and national government for although they have a common origin in the people yet as the point at issue turn on what be the power grant to the one government and what be those which remain to the other i be persuade that a analysis which should mark distinctly the source of power in both government with its progress in each would afford the best means for obtain a sound result in we political career there be obviously three great epoch the colonial state form the first the revolutionary movement from its commencement to the adoption of the article of confederation the second and the intervene space from that event to the present day the third the first may be consider the infant state it be the school of morality of political science and just principle the equality of rights enjoy by the people of every colony under they original charter form the basis of every exist institution and it be owe to the creation by those charter of distinct community that the power when wrest from the crown pass directly and exclusively to the people of each colony the revolutionary struggle give activity to those principle and its success secure to they a permanent existence in the government of we union state and national the third epoch comprise the administration under the article of confederation with the adoption of the constitution and administration under it on the first and last of these epoch it be not necessary to enlarge for any purpose connect with the object of this inquiry to the second in which we be transfer by a heroic exertion from the first to the third stage and whose event give the true character to every institution some further attention be due in trace in greater detail the prominent act of a movement to which we owe so much i shall perform a office which if not useful will be gratify to my own feeling and i hope not unacceptable to my reader of the revolutionary movement itself sentiment too respectful too exalted can not be entertain it be impossible for any citizen have a just idea of the danger which we have to encounter to read the record of we early proceedings and to see the firmness with which they be meet and the wisdom and patriotism which be display in every stage without be deeply affect by it a attack on massachusett be consider a attack on every colony and the people of each move in she defense as in they own cause the meeting of the general congress in philadelphium on the 6th of September 1774 appear to have be the result of a spontaneous impulse in every quarter at the same time the first public act propose it accord to the journal of the first congress be pass by the house of representative of connecticut on the 3d of June of that year but it be presume that the first suggestion come from massachusett the colony most oppressed and in whose favor the general sympathy be much excite the exposition which that congress make of grievance in the petition to the king in the address to the people of great britain and in that to the people of the several colony evince a knowledge so profound of the english constitution and of the general principle of free government and of liberty of we rights found on that constitution and on the charter of the several colony and of the numerous and egregious violation which have be commit of they as must have convince all impartial mind that the talent on this side of the atlantic be at least equal to that on the other the spirit in which those papers be draw which be know to be in strict accord with the public sentiment prove that although the whole people cherish a connection with the parent country and be desirous of preserve it on just principle they nevertheless stand embody at the parting line ready to separate forever if a redress of grievance the alternative offer be not promptly render that alternative be reject and in consequence war and dismemberment follow the power grant to the delegate of each colony who compose the first congress look primarily to the support of rights and to a redress of grievance and in consequence to the restoration of harmony which be ardently desire they justified however any extremity in case of necessity they be ample for such purpose and be execute in every circumstance with the utmost fidelity it be not until after the meeting of the second congress which take place on the 10th may 1775 when full proof be lay before it of the commencement of hostility in the precede month by a deliberate attack of the british troops on the militia and inhabitant of lexington and concord in massachusett that war might be say to be decide on and measure be take to support it the progress even then be slow and reluctant as will be see by they second petition to the king and they second address to the people of great britain which be prepare and forward after that event the arrival however of large body of troops and the pressure of war in every direction soon dispel all hope of accommodation on the 15th of June 1775 a commander in chief of the force raise and to be raise for the defense of american liberty be appoint by the unanimous vote of congress and he conduct in the discharge of the duty of that high trust which he hold through the whole of the war have give a example to the world for talent as a military commander for integrity fortitude and firmness under the severest trial for respect to the civil authority and devotion to the rights and liberty of he country of which neither rome nor greece have exhibit the equal i see he in my earliest youth in the retreat through jersey at the head of a small band or rather in its rear for he be always next the enemy and he countenance and manner make a impression on I which time can never efface a lieutenant then in the third virginium regiment i happen to be on the rear guard at newark and i count the force under he immediate command by platoon as it pass I which amount to less than 3000 man a deportment so firm so dignified so exalted but yet so modest and compose i have never see in any other person on the 6th July 1775 congress publish a declaration of the cause which compel they to take up arm and immediately afterwards take measure for augment the army and raise a navy for organize the militia and provide cannon and small arm and military store of every kind for raise a revenue and push the war offensively with all the means in they power nothing escape the attention of that enlighten body the people of canada be invite to join the union and a force send into the province to favor the revolutionary party which however be not capable of afford any essential aid the people of ireland be address in term manifest due respect for the suffering the talent and patriotism of that portion of the british empire and a suitable acknowledgment be make to the assembly of jamaica for the approbation it have express of we cause and the part it have take in support of it with the british government on the 2d of June 1775 the convention of massachusett by a letter sign by they president of may the 10th state to congress that they labor under difficulty for the want of a regular form of government and request to be favor with explicit advice respect the take up and exercise the power of civil government and declare they readiness to submit to such a general plan as the congress might direct for the colony or that they would make it they great study to establish such a form of government there as should not only promote they own advantage but the union and interest of all america to this application a answer be give on the 9th by which it be recommend to the convention to write letter to the inhabitant of the several place entitle to representation in assembly request they to choose such representative and that the assembly when choose should elect councilor and that say assembly or council should exercise the power of government until a governor of he majesty 's appointment will consent to govern the colony accord to its charter on the 18th October of the same year the delegate from new hampshire lay before congress a instruction from they convention to use they utmost endeavor to obtain the advice and direction of congress with respect to a method for administer justice and regulate they civil police to this a reply be give on the 3d November by which it be recommend to the convention to call a full and free representation of the people and that the representative if they think it necessary should establish such a form of government as in they judgment would best promote the happiness of the people and most effectually secure peace and good order in the province during the continuance of the present dispute between great britain and the colony on the 4th November it be resolve by congress that if the convention of south carolina shall find it necessary to establish a form of government in that colony it be recommend to that convention to call a full and free representation of the people and the say representative if they think it necessary shall establish such a form of government as in they judgment will best promote the happiness of the people and most effectually secure peace and good order in the colony during the continuance of the present dispute between great britain and the colony on the 4th December follow a resolution pass recommend the same measure and precisely in the same word to the convention of virginium on the 10th may 1776 it be recommend to the respective assembly and convention of the unite colony where no government sufficient to the exigency of they affair have be establish to adopt such government as should in the opinion of the representative of the people best conduce to the happiness and safety of they constituent in particular and america in general on the 7th June resolution respect independence be move and second which be refer to a committee of the whole on the 8th and 10th on which latter day it be resolve to postpone a decision on the first resolution or main question until the 1st July but that no time might be lose in case the congress agree thereto that a committee be appoint to

independence the adoption of a confederation for the state and the propriety of institute state government with the nature of those government respect which it have be consult by the convention of several of the colony so great a trust be never repose before in a body thus constitute and i be authorize to add look to the great result that never be duty more ably or faithfully perform the distinguishing characteristic of this movement be that although the connection which have exist between the people of the several colony before they dismemberment from the parent country be not only not dissolve but increase by that event even before the adoption of the article of confederation yet the preservation and augmentation of that tie be the result of a new creation and proceed altogether from the people of each colony into whose hand the whole power pass exclusively when wrest from the crown to the same cause the greater change which have since occur by the adoption of the constitution be to be trace the establishment of we institution form the most important epoch that history have record they extend unexampled felicity to the whole body of we fellow-citizen and be the

various subject to which they apply with the amendment which they occasionally require impose annually a important duty on the representative of a free people we system have happily advance to such maturity that i be not aware that you care in that respect will be augmented other cause exist which be highly interesting to the whole civilized world and to no portion of it more so in certain view than to the united state of these cause and of they bearing on the interest of we union i shall communicate the sentiment which i have form with that freedom which a sense of duty dictate it be proper however to invite you attention in the first instance to those concern respect which legislative provision be think to be particularly urgent on the 24th of June last a convention of navigation and commerce be conclude in this city between the united state and france by minister duly authorize for the purpose the sanction of the executive have be give to this convention under a conviction that take all its stipulation into view it rest essentially on a basis of reciprocal and equal advantage i deem it my duty in compliance with the authority vest in the executive by the second section of

next session of congress be open to the vessel of great britain employ in that trade under the limitation specify in that proclamation a doubt be entertain whether the act of congress apply to the british colony on this continent as well as to those in the west indy but as the act of parliament open the intercourse equally with both and it be the manifest intention of congress as well as the obvious policy of the united state that the provision of the act of parliament should be meet in equal extent on the part of the united state and as also the act of congress be suppose to vest in the president some discretion in the execution of it i think it advisable to give it a corresponding construction should the constitutional sanction of the senate be give to the ratification of the convention with france legislative provision will be necessary to carry it fully into effect as it likewise will be to continue in force on such condition as may be deem just and proper the intercourse which have be open between the united state and the british colony every light in the possession of the executive will in due time be communicate on both subject rest essentially on a basis of reciprocal and equal advantage it have be the object of the executive in transaction with other power to meet the proposition of each with a liberal spirit believe that thereby the interest of we country would be most effectually promote this course have be systematically pursue in the late occurrence with france and great britain and in strict accord with the view of the legislature a confident hope be entertain that by the arrangement thus commence with each all difference respect navigation and commerce with the dominion in question will be adjust and a solid foundation be lay for a active and permanent intercourse which will prove equally advantageous to both party the decision of he imperial majesty the emperor of russium on the question submit to he by the united state and great britain concern the construction of the first article of the treaty of ghent have be receive a convention have since be conclude between the party under the mediation of he imperial majesty to prescribe the mode by which that article shall be carry into effect in conformity with that decision i shall submit this convention to the senate for its advice and consent as to the ratification and if obtain shall immediately bring the subject before congress for such provision as may require the interposition of the legislature in compliance with a act of the last session a territorial government have be establish in florida on the principle of we system by this act the inhabitant be secure in the full enjoyment of they rights and liberty and to admission into the union with equal participation in the government with the original state on the condition heretofore prescribe to other territory by a clause in the ninth article of the treaty with spain by which that territory be cede to the united state it be stipulate that satisfaction shall be make for the injury if any which by process of law shall be establish to have be suffer by the spanish officer and individual spanish inhabitant by the late operation of we troops in florida no provision have yet be make to carry that stipulation into effect it be submit to the consideration of congress whether it will not be proper to vest the competent power in the district court at pensacolum or in some tribunal to be specially organize for the purpose the fiscal operation of the year have be more successful than have be anticipate at the commencement of the last session of congress the receipt into the treasury during the three first quarter of the year have exceed the sum of $ 14745000 the payment make at the treasury during the same period have exceed $ 12279000 leave in the treasury on the 30th day of September last include $ 116859224 which be in the treasury on the 1st day of January last a sum exceed $ 4128000 besides discharge all demand for the current service of the year include the interest and reimbursement of the public debt the 6 per cent stock of 1796 amounting to $ 80000 have be redeem it be estimate that after defray the current expense of the present quarter and redeem the two million of 6 per cent stock of 1820 there will remain in the treasury on the 1st of January next nearly $ 3000000 it be estimate that the gross amount of duty which have be secure from the 1st of January to the 30th of September last have exceed $ 19500000 and the amount for the whole year will probably not fall short of $ 23000000 of the actual force in service under the present military establishment the post at which it be station and the condition of each post a report from the secretary of war which be now communicate will give a distinct idea by like report the state of the academy at west point will be see as will be the progress which have be make on the fortification along the coast and at the national armory and arsenal the position on the red river and that at the sault of st marie be the only new post that have be take these post with those already occupy in the interior be think to be well adapt to the protection of we frontier all the force not place in the garrison along the coast and in the ordnance depot and indispensably necessary there be place on the frontier the organization of the several corps compose the army be such as to admit its expansion to a great extent in case of emergency the officer carry with they all the light which they possess to the new corps to which they might be appoint with the organization of the staff there be equal cause to be satisfy by the concentration of every branch with its chief in this city in the presence of the department and with a grade in the chief military station to keep alive and cherish a military spirit the greatest promptitude in the execution of order with the greatest economy and efficiency be secure the same view be take of the military academy good order be preserve in it and the youth be well instruct in every science connect with the great object of the institution they be also well train and discipline in the practical part of the profession it have be always find difficult to control the ardor inseparable from that early age in such manner as to give it a proper direction the rights of manhood be too often claim prematurely in press which too far the respect which be due to age and the obedience necessary to a course of study and instruction in every such institution be sometimes lose sight of the great object to be accomplish be the restraint of that ardor by such wise regulation and government as by direct all the energy of the youthful mind to the attainment of useful knowledge will keep it within a just subordination and at the same time elevate it to the highest purpose this object seem to be essentially obtain in this institution and with great advantage to the union the military academy form the basis in regard to science on which the military establishment rest it furnish annually after due examination and on the report of the academic staff many well-informed youth to fill the vacancy which occur in the several corps of the army while other who retire to private life carry with they such attainment as under the right reserve to the several state to appoint the officer and to train the militia will enable they by afford a wider field for selection to promote the great object of the power vest in congress of provide for the organize arming and discipline the militia thus by the mutual and harmonious cooperation of the two government in the execution of a power divide between they a object always to be cherish the attainment of a great result on which we liberty may depend can not fail to be secure i have to add that in proportion as we regular force be small should the instruction and discipline of the militia the great resource on which we rely be push to the utmost extent that circumstance will admit a report from the secretary of the navy will communicate the progress which have be make in the construction of vessel of war with other interesting detail respect the actual state of the affair of that department it have be find necessary for the protection of we commerce to maintain the usual squadron on the mediterranean the pacific and along the atlantic coast extend the cruise of the latter into the west indy where piracy organize into a system have prey on the commerce of every country trading thither a cruise have also be maintain on the coast of africa when the season would permit for the suppression of the slave trade and order have be give to the commander of all we public ship to seize we own vessel should they find any engage in that trade and to bring they in for adjudication in the west indy piracy be of recent date which may explain the cause why other power have not combine against it by the document communicate it will be see that the effort of the united state to suppress it have have a very salutary effect the benevolent provision of the act under which the protection have be extend alike to the commerce of other nation can not fail to be duly appreciate by they in compliance with the act of the last session entitle a act to abolish the united state trade establishment agent be immediately appoint and instruct under the direction of the secretary of the treasury to close the business of the trading house among the indian tribe and to settle the account of the factor and subfactor engage in that trade and to execute in all other respects the injunction of that act in the mode prescribe therein a final report of they proceedings shall be communicate to congress as soon as it be receive it be with great regret i have to state that a serious malady have deprive we of many valuable citizen at pensacolum and check the progress of some of those arrangement which be important to the territory this effect have be sensibly feel in respect to the indian who inhabit that territory consist of the remnant of several tribe who occupy the middle ground between st augustine and pensacolum with extensive claim but undefined boundary although peace be preserve with those indian yet they position and claim tend essentially to interrupt the intercourse between the eastern and western part of the territory on which we inhabitant be principally settle it be essential to the growth and prosperity of the territory as well as to the interest of the union that these indian should be remove by special compact with they to some other position or concentrate within narrower limit where they be with the limited means in the power of the executive instruction be give to the governor to accomplish this object so far as it might be practicable which be prevent by the distressing malady refer to to carry it fully into effect in either mode additional fund will be necessary to the provision of which the power of congress alone be competent with a view to such provision as may be deem proper the subject be submit to you consideration and in the interim further proceedings be suspend it appear that so much of the act entitle a act regulate the staff of the army which pass on the 14th April 1818 as relate to the commissariat will expire in April next and the practical operation of that department have evince its great utility the propriety of its renewal be submit to you consideration the view which have be take of the probable productiveness of the lead mine connect with the importance of the material to the public defense make it expedient that they should be manage with peculiar care it be therefore suggest whether it will not comport with the public interest to provide by law for the appointment of a agent skilled in mineralogy to superintend they under the direction of the proper department it be understand that the cumberland road which be construct at a great expense have already suffer from the want of that regular superintendence and of those repair which be indispensable to the preservation of such a work this road be of incalculable advantage in facilitate the intercourse between the western and the atlantic state through it the whole country from the northern extremity of lake erie to the mississippus and from all the water which empty into each find a easy and direct communication to the seat of government and thence to the atlantic the facility which it afford to all military and commercial operation and also to those of the post-office department can not be estimate too highly this great work be likewise a ornament and a honor to the nation believe that a competent power to adopt and execute a system of internal improvement have not be grant to congress but that such a power confine to great national purpose and with proper limitation would be productive of eminent advantage to we union i have think it advisable that a amendment of the constitution to that effect should be recommend to the several state a bill which assume the right to adopt and execute such a system have be present for my signature at the last session i be compel from the view which i have take of the power of the general government to negative it on which occasion i think it proper to communicate the sentiment which i have form on mature consideration on the whole subject to that communication in all the view in which the great interest to which it relate may be suppose to merit you attention i have now to refer should congress however deem it improper to recommend such a amendment they have accord to my judgment the right to keep the road in repair by provide for the superintendence of it and appropriate the money necessary for repair surely if they have the right to appropriate money to make the road they have a right to appropriate it to preserve the road from ruin from the exercise of this power no danger be to be apprehend under we happy system the people be the sole and exclusive fountain of power each government originate from they and to they alone each to its proper constituent be they respectively and solely responsible for the faithful discharge of they duty within they constitutional limit and that the people will confine they public agent of every station to the strict line of they constitutional duty there be no cause to doubt have however communicate my sentiment to congress at the last session fully in the document to which i have refer respect the right of appropriation as distinct from the right of jurisdiction and sovereignty over the territory in question i deem it improper to enlarge on the subject here from the best information that i have be able to obtain it appear that we manufacture though depressed immediately after the peace have considerably increase and be still increase under the encouragement give they by the tariff of 1816 and by subsequent law satisfied i be whatever may be the abstract doctrine in favor of unrestricted commerce provide all nation would concur in it and it be not liable to be interrupt by war which have never occur and can not be expect that there be other strong reason applicable to we situation and relation with other country which impose on we the obligation to cherish and sustain we manufacture satisfied however i likewise be that the interest of every part of we union even of those most benefit by manufacture require that this subject should be touch with the greatest caution and a critical knowledge of the effect to be produce by the slightest change on full consideration of the subject in all its relation i be persuade that a further augmentation may now be make of the duty on certain foreign article in favor of we own and without affect injuriously any other interest for more precise detail i refer you to the communication which be make to congress during the last session so great be the amount of account for money advance during the late war in addition to other of a previous date which in the regular operation of the government necessarily remain unsettled that it require a considerable length of time for they adjustment by a report from the first comptroller of the treasury it appear that on the 4th of march 1817 the account then unsettled amount to $ 10306887641 of which on the 30th of September of the present year $ 9317539656 have be settle leave on that day a balance unsettled of $ 989347985 that there have be draw from the treasury in pay the public debt and sustain the government in all its operation and disbursement since the 4th of march 1817 $ 15719938096 the account for which have be settle to the amount of $ 13750145112 leave a balance unsettled of $ 1969792984 for precise detail respect each of these balance i refer to the report of the comptroller and the document which accompany it from this view it appear that we commercial difference with france and great britain have be place in a train of amicable arrangement on condition fair and honorable in both instance to each party that we finances be in a very productive state we revenue be at present fully competent to all the demand upon it that we military force be well organize in all its branch and capable of render the most important service in case of emergency that its number will admit of that due progress have be make under exist appropriation in the construction of fortification and in the operation of the ordnance department that due progress have in like manner be make in the construction of ship of war that we navy be in the best condition feel and respect in every sea in which it be employ for the protection of we commerce that we manufacture have augment in amount and improve in quality that great progress have be make in the settlement of account and in the recovery of the balance due by individual and that the utmost economy be secure and observe in every department of the administration other object will likewise claim you attention because from the station which the united state hold as a member of the great community of nation they have rights to maintain duty to perform and danger to encounter a strong hope be entertain that peace would ere this have be conclude between spain and the independent government south of the united state in this hemisphere long experience have evince the competency of those government to maintain the independence which they have declare it be presume that the consideration which induce they recognition by the united state would have have equal weight with other power and that spain herself yield to those magnanimous feeling of which she history furnish so many example would have terminate on that basis a controversy so unavailing and at the same time so destructive we still cherish the hope that this result will not long be postpone sustain we neutral position and allow to each party while the war continue equal rights it be incumbent on the united state to claim of each with equal rigor the faithful observance of we rights accord to the well-known law of nation from each therefore a like cooperation be expect in the suppression of the piratical practice which have grow out of this war and of blockade of extensive coast on both sea which consider the small force employ to sustain they have not the slightest foundation to rest on europe be still unsettled and although the war long menace between russium and turkey have not break out there be no certainty that the difference between those power will be amicably adjust it be impossible to look to the oppression of the country respect which those difference arise without be deeply affect the mention of greece fill the mind with the most exalted sentiment and arouse in we bosom the best feeling of which we nature be susceptible superior skill and refinement in the art heroic gallantry in action disinterested patriotism enthusiastic zeal and devotion in favor of public and personal liberty be associate with we recollection of ancient greece that such a country should have be overwhelm and so long hide as it be from the world under a gloomy despotism have be a cause of unceasing and deep regret to generous mind for age past it be natural therefore that the reappearance of those people in they original character contend in favor of they liberty should produce that great excitement and sympathy in they favor which have be so signally display throughout the united state a strong hope be entertain that these people will recover they independence and resume they equal station among the nation of the earth a great effort have be make in spain and portugal to improve the condition of the people and it must be very console to all benevolent mind to see the extraordinary moderation with which it have be conduct that it may promote the happiness of both nation be the ardent wish of this whole people to the expression of which we confine ourselves for whatever may be the feeling or sentiment which every individual under we government have a right to indulge and express it be nevertheless a sacred maxim equally with the government and people that the destiny of every independent nation in what relate to such improvement of right belong and ought to be leave exclusively to themselves whether we reason from the late war or from those menacing symptom which now appear in europe it be manifest that if a convulsion should take place in any of those country it will proceed from cause which have no existence and be utterly unknown in these state in which there be but one order that of the people to whom the sovereignty exclusively belong should war break out in any of those country who can foretell the extent to which it may be carry or the desolation which it may spread exempt as we be from these cause we internal tranquillity be secure and distant as we be from the troubled scene and faithful to first principle in regard to other power we might reasonably presume that we should not be molest by they this however ought not to be calculate on as certain unprovoked injury be often inflict and even the peculiar felicity of we situation might with some be a cause for excitement and aggression the history of the late war in europe furnish a complete demonstration that no system of conduct however correct in principle can protect neutral power from injury from any party that a defenseless position and distinguish love of peace be the surest invitation to war and that there be no way to avoid it other than by be always prepared and willing for just cause to meet it if there be a people on earth whose more especial duty it be to be at all time prepare to defend the rights with which they be bless and to surpass all other in sustain the necessary burden and in submit to sacrifice to make such preparation it be undoubtedly the people of these state when we see that a civil war of the most frightful character rage from the adriatic to the black sea that strong symptom of war appear in other part proceed from cause which should it break out may become general and be of long duration that the war still continue between spain and the independent government she late province in this hemisphere that it be likewise menace between portugal and brazil in consequence of the attempt of the latter to dismember itself from the former and that a system of piracy of great extent be maintain in the neighbor sea which will require equal vigilance and decision to suppress it the reason for sustain the attitude which we now hold and for push forward all we measure of defense with the utmost vigor appear to I to acquire new force the united state owe to the world a great example and by means thereof to the cause of liberty and humanity a generous support they have so far succeed to the satisfaction of the virtuous and enlighten of every country there be no reason to doubt that they whole movement will be regulate by a sacred regard to principle all we institution be found on that basis the ability to support we own cause under any trial to which it may be expose be the great point on which the public solicitude rest it have be often charge against free government that they have neither the foresight nor the virtue to provide at the proper season for great emergency that they course be improvident and expensive that war will always find they unprepared and whatever may be its calamity that its terrible warning will be disregard and forget as soon as peace return i have full confidence that this charge so far as relate to the united state will be shewn to be utterly destitute of truth jame monroe special message December 4 1822 _ to the senate of

necessary i do it however with peculiar satisfaction from a knowledge that in this respect i shall comply more fully with the sound principle of we government the people be with we exclusively the sovereign it be indispensable that full information be lay before they on all important subject to enable they to exercise that high power with complete effect if keep in the dark they must be incompetent to it we be all liable to error and those who be engage in the management of public affair be more subject to excitement and to be lead astray by they particular interest and passion than the great body of we constituent who live at home in the pursuit of they ordinary avocation be calm but deeply interested spectator of event and of the conduct of those who be party to they to the people every department of the government and every individual in each be responsible and the more full they information the better they can judge of the wisdom of the policy pursue and of the conduct of each in regard to it from they dispassionate judgment much aid may always be obtain while they approbation will form the greatest incentive and most gratifying reward for virtuous action and the dread of they censure the best security against the abuse of they confidence they interest in all vital question be the same and the bond by sentiment as well as by interest will be proportionably strengthen as they be better inform of the real state of public affair especially in difficult conjuncture it be by such knowledge that local prejudice and jealousy be surmount and that a national policy extend its foster care and protection to all the great interest of we union be form and steadily adhere to a precise knowledge of we relation with foreign power as respects we negotiation and transaction with each be think to be particularly necessary equally necessary be it that we should form a just estimate of we resource revenue and progress in every kind of improvement connect with the national prosperity and public defense it be by render justice to other nation that we may expect it from they it be by we ability to resent injury and redress wrong that we may avoid they the commissioner under the fifth article of the treaty of ghent have disagree in they opinion respect that portion of the boundary between the territory of the united state and of great britain the establishment of which have be submit to they have make they respective report in compliance with that article that the same might be refer to the decision of a friendly power it be manifest however that it would be difficult if not impossible for any power to perform that office without great delay and much inconvenience to itself a proposal have be make by this government and accede to by that of great britain to endeavor to establish that boundary by amicable negotiation it appear from long experience that no satisfactory arrangement could be form of the commercial intercourse between the united state and the british colony in this hemisphere by legislative act while each party pursue its own course without agreement or concert with the other a proposal have be make to the british government to regulate this commerce by treaty as it have be to arrange in like manner the just claim of the citizen of the united state inhabit the state and territory border on the lake and river which empty into the st lawrence to the navigation of that river to the ocean for these and other object of high importance to the interest of both party a negotiation have be open with the british government which it be hope will have a satisfactory result the commissioner under the sixth and seventh article of the treaty of ghent have successfully close they labor in relation to the sixth have proceed to the discharge of those relate to the seventh they progress in the extensive survey require for the performance of they duty justify the presumption that it will be complete in the ensue year the negotiation which have be long depend with the french government on several important subject and particularly for a just indemnity for loss sustain in the late war by the citizen of the united state under unjustifiable seizure and confiscation of they property have not as yet have the desire effect as this claim rest on the same principle with other which have be admit by the french government it be not perceive on what just grind it can be reject a minister will be immediately appoint to proceed to france and resume the negotiation on this and other subject which may arise between the two nation at the proposal of the russian imperial government make through the minister of the emperor reside here a full power and instruction have be transmit to the minister of the united state at st petersburg to arrange by amicable negotiation the respective rights and interest of the two nation on the northwest coast of this continent a similar proposal have be make by he imperial majesty to the government of great britain which have likewise be accede to the government of the united state have be desirous by this friendly proceeding of manifest the great value which they have invariably attach to the friendship of the emperor and they solicitude to cultivate the best understanding with he government in the discussion to which this interest have give rise and in the arrangement by which they may terminate the occasion have be judge proper for assert as a principle in which the rights and interest of the united state be involve that the american continent by the free and independent condition which they have assume and maintain be henceforth not to be consider as subject for future colonization by any european power since the close of the last session of congress the commissioner and arbitrator for ascertain and determine the amount of indemnification which may be due to citizen of the united state under the decision of he imperial majesty the emperor of russium in conformity to the convention conclude at st petersburg on the 12th of July 1822 have assemble in this city and organize themselves as a board for the performance of the duty assign to they by that treaty the commission constitute under the eleventh article of the treaty of the 22d of February 1819 between the united state and spain be also in session here and as the term of three year limit by the treaty for the execution of the trust will expire before the period of the next regular meeting of congress the attention of the legislature will be draw to the measure which may be necessary to accomplish the object for which the commission be institute in compliance with a resolution of the house of representative adopt at they last session instruction have be give to all the minister of the united state accredit to the power of europe and america to propose the proscription of the african slave trade by class it under the denomination and inflict on its perpetrator the punishment of piracy should this proposal be accede to it be not doubt that this odious and criminal practice will be promptly and entirely suppress it be earnestly hope that it will be accede to from the firm belief that it be the most effectual expedient that can be adopt for the purpose at the commencement of the recent war between france and spain it be declare by the french government that it would grant no commission to privateer and that neither the commerce of spain herself nor of neutral nation should be molest by the naval force of france except in the breach of a lawful blockade this declaration which appear to have be faithfully carry into effect concur with principle proclaim and cherish by the united state from the first establishment of they independence suggest the hope that the time have arrive when the proposal for adopt it as a permanent and invariable rule in all future maritime war might meet the favorable consideration of the great european power instruction have accordingly be give to we minister with france russium and great britain to make those proposal to they respective government and when the friend of humanity reflect on the essential amelioration to the condition of the human race which would result from the abolition of private war on the sea and on the great facility by which it might be accomplish require only the consent of a few sovereign a earnest hope be indulge that these overture will meet with a attention animated by the spirit in which they be make and that they will ultimately be successful the minister who be appoint to the republic of colombium and bueno ayre during the last session of congress proceed shortly afterwards to they destination of they arrival there official intelligence have not yet be receive the minister appoint to the republic of chile will sail in a few day a early appointment will also be make to mexico a minister have be receive from colombium and the other government have be inform that minister or diplomatic agent of inferior grade would be receive from each accordingly as they might prefer the one or the other the minister appoint to spain proceed soon after he appointment for cadiz the residence of the sovereign to whom he be accredit in approach that port the frigate which convey he be warn off by the commander of the french squadron by which it be blockade and not permit to enter although apprise by the captain of the frigate of the public character of the person whom he have on board the landing of whom be the sole object of he proposed entry this act be consider a infringement of the rights of ambassador and of nation will form a just cause of complaint to the government of france against the officer by whom it be commit the actual condition of the public finances more than realize the favorable anticipation that be entertain of it at the opening of the last session of congress on the 1st of January there be a balance in the treasury of $ 423742755 from that time to the 30th September the receipt amount to upward of $ 16100000 and the expenditure to $ 11400000 during the fourth quarter of the year it be estimate that the receipt will at least equal the expenditure and that there will remain in the treasury on the 1st day of January next a surplus of nearly $ 9000000 on the 1st of January 1825 a large amount of the war debt and a part of the revolutionary debt become redeemable additional portion of the former will continue to become redeemable annually until the year 1835 it be believe however that if the united state remain at peace the whole of that debt may be redeem by the ordinary revenue of those year during that period under the provision of the act of march 3 1817 create the sink fund and in that case the only part of the debt that will remain after the year 1835 will be the $ 7000000 of 5 per cent stock subscribe to the bank of the united state and the 3 per cent revolutionary debt amount to $ 1329609906 both of which be redeemable at the pleasure of the government the state of the army in its organization and discipline have be gradually improve for several year and have now attain a high degree of perfection the military disbursement have be regularly make and the account regularly and promptly render for settlement the supplies of various description have be of good quality and regularly issue at all of the post a system of economy and accountability have be introduce into every branch of the service which admit of little additional improvement this desirable state have be attain by the act reorganize the staff of the army pass on the 14th of April 1818 the money appropriate for fortification have be regularly and economically apply and all the work advance as rapidly as the amount appropriate would admit three important work will be complete in the course of this year -- that be fort washington fort delaware and the fort at the rigolet in louisiana the board of engineer and the topographical corps have be in constant and active service in survey the coast and project the work necessary for its defense the military academy have attain a degree of perfection in its discipline and instruction equal as be believe to any institution of its kind in any country the money appropriate for the use of the ordnance department have be regularly and economically apply the fabrication of arm at the national armory and by contract with the department have be gradually improve in quality and cheapness it be believe that they quality be now such as to admit of but little improvement the completion of the fortification render it necessary that there should be a suitable appropriation for the purpose of fabricate the cannon and carriage necessary for those work under the appropriation of $ 5000 for explore the western water for the location of a site for a western armory a commission be constitute consist of colonel mcree colonel lee and captain talcott who have be engage in explore the country they have not yet report the result of they labor but it be believe that they will be prepare to do it at a early part of the session of congress during the month of June last general ashley and he party who be trade under a license from the government be attack by the ricaree while peaceably trade with the indian at they request several of the party be kill and wound and they property take or destroy colonel leavenworth who command fort atkinson at the council bluff the most western post apprehend that the hostile spirit of the ricaree would extend to other tribe in that quarter and that thereby the life of the trader on the missourus and the peace of the frontier would be endanger take immediate measure to check the evil with a detachment of the regiment station at the bluff he successfully attack the ricaree village and it be hope that such a impression have be make on they as well as on the other tribe on the missourus as will prevent a recurrence of future hostility the report of the secretary of war which be herewith transmit will exhibit in greater detail the condition of the department in its various branch and the progress which have be make in its administration during the three first quarter of the year i transmit a return of the militia of the several state accord to the last report which have be make by the proper officer in each to the department of war by reference to this return it will be see that it be not complete although great exertion have be make to make it so as the defense and even the liberty of the country must depend in time of imminent danger on the militia it be of the highest importance that it be well organize armed and disciplined throughout the union the report of the secretary of war shew the progress make during the three first quarter of the present year by the application of the fund appropriate for arm the militia much difficulty be find in distribute the arm accord to the act of congress provide for it from the failure of the proper department in many of the state to make regular return the act of may 12 1820 provide that the system of tactic and regulation of the various corps of the regular army shall be extend to the militia this act have be very imperfectly execute from the want of uniformity in the organization of the militia proceeding from the defect of the system itself and especially in its application to that main arm of the public defense it be think that this important subject in all its branch merit the attention of congress the report of the secretary of the navy which be now communicate furnish a account of the administration of that department for the three first quarter of the present year with the progress make in augment the navy and the manner in which the vessel in commission have be employ the usual force have be maintain in the mediterranean sea the pacific ocean and along the atlantic coast and have afford the necessary protection to we commerce in those sea in the west indy and the gulf of mexico we naval force have be augment by the addition of several small vessel provide for by the act authorize a additional naval force for the suppression of piracy pass by congress at they last session that armament have be eminently successful in the accomplishment of its object the piracy by which we commerce in the neighborhood of the island of cuba have be afflict have be repress and the confidence of we merchant in a great measure restore the patriotic zeal and enterprise of commodore porter to whom the command of the expedition be confide have be fully second by the officer and man under he command and in reflect with high satisfaction on the honorable manner in which they have sustain the reputation of they country and its navy the sentiment be alloy only by a concern that in the fulfillment of that arduous service the disease incident to the season and to the climate in which it be discharge have deprive the nation of many useful life and among they of several officer of great promise in the month of August a very malignant fever make its appearance at thompson island which threaten the destruction of we station there many perish and the commanding officer be severely attack uncertain as to he fate and know that most of the medical officer have be render incapable of discharge they duty it be think expedient to send to that post a officer of rank and experience with several skillful surgeon to ascertain the origin of the fever and the probability of its recurrence there in future season to furnish every assistance to those who be suffer and if practicable to avoid the necessity of abandon so important a station commodore rodger with a promptitude which do he honor cheerfully accept that trust and have discharge it in the manner anticipate from he skill and patriotism before he arrival commodore porter with the greater part of the squadron have remove from the island and return to the united state in consequence of the prevail sickness much useful information have however be obtain as to the state of the island and great relief afford to those who have be necessarily leave there although we expedition cooperate with a invigorated administration of the government of the island of cuba and with the corresponding active exertion of a british naval force in the same sea have almost entirely destroy the unlicensed piracy from that island the success of we exertion have not be equally effectual to suppress the same crime under other pretens and color in the neighboring island of porto rico they have be commit there under the abusive issue of spanish commission at a early period of the present year remonstrance be make to the governor of that island by a agent who be send for the purpose against those outrage on the peaceful commerce of the united state of which many have occur that officer profess he own want of authority to make satisfaction for we just complaint answer only by a reference of they to the government of spain the minister of the united state to that court be specially instruct to urge the necessity of the immediate and effectual interposition of that government direct restitution and indemnity for wrong already commit and interdict the repetition of they the minister as have be see be debar access to the spanish government and in the meantime several new case of flagrant outrage have occur and citizen of the united state in the island of porto rico have suffer and other be threaten with assassination for assert they unquestionable rights even before the lawful tribunal of the country the usual order have be give to all we public ship to seize american vessel engage in the slave trade and bring they in for adjudication and i have the gratification to state that not one so employ have be discover and there be good reason to believe that we flag be now seldom if at all disgrace by that traffic it be a source of great satisfaction that we be always enable to recur to the conduct of we navy with pride and commendation as a means of national defense it enjoy the public confidence and be steadily assume additional importance it be submit whether a more efficient and equally economical organization of it might not in several respects be effect it be suppose that higher grade than now exist by law would be useful they would afford well-merited reward to those who have long and faithfully serve they country present the best incentive to good conduct and the best means of insure a proper discipline destroy the inequality in that respect between military and naval service and relieve we officer from many inconvenience and mortification which occur when we vessel meet those of other nation ours be the only service in which such grade do not exist a report of the postmaster-general which accompany this communication will shew the present state of the post-office department and its general operation for some year past there be establish by law 88600 mile of post-road on which the mail be now transport 85700 mile and contract have be make for its transportation on all the established route with one or two exception there be 5240 post-office in the union and as many postmaster the gross amount of postage which accrue from the 1st July 1822 to the 1st July 1823 be $ 111434512 during the same period the expenditure of the post-office department amount to $ 116988551 and consist of the follow item viz : compensation to postmaster $ 35399598 incidental expense $ 3086637 transportation of the mail $ 78460008 payment into the treasury $ 42308 on the 1st of July last there be due to the department from postmaster $ 13524528 from _ late _ postmaster and contractor $ 25674931 make a total amount of balance due to the department of $ 39199459 these balance embrace all delinquency of postmaster and contractor which have take place since the organization of the department there be due by the department to contractor on the 1st of July last $ 2654864 the transportation of the mail within five year past have be greatly extend and the expenditure of the department proportionably increase although the postage which have accrue within the last three year have fall short of the expenditure $ 26282146 it appear that collection have be make from the outstanding balance to meet the principal part of the current demand it be estimate that not more than $ 250000 of the above balance can be collect and that a considerable part of this sum can only be realize by a resort to legal process some improvement in the receipt for postage be expect a prompt attention to the collection of money receive by postmaster it be believe will enable the department to continue its operation without aid from the treasury unless the expenditure shall be increase by the establishment of new mail route a revision of some part of the post-office law may be necessary and it be submit whether it would not be proper to provide for the appointment of postmaster where the compensation exceed a certain amount by nomination to the senate as other officer of the general government be appoint have communicate my view to congress at the commencement of the last session respect the encouragement which ought to be give to we manufacture and the principle on which it should be found i have only to add that those view remain unchanged and that the present state of those country with which we have the most immediate political relation and greatest commercial intercourse tend to confirm they under this impression i recommend a review of the tariff for the purpose of afford such additional protection to those article which we be prepare to manufacture or which be more immediately connect with the defense and independence of the country the actual state of the public account furnish additional evidence of the efficiency of the present system of accountability in relation to the public expenditure of the money draw from the treasury since the 4th march 1817 the sum remain unaccounted for on the 30th of September last be more than a million and a half of dollar less than on the 30th of September precede and during the same period a reduction of nearly a million of dollar have be make in the amount of the unsettled account for money advance previously to the 4th of march 1817 it will be obvious that in proportion as the mass of account of the latter description be diminish by settlement the difficulty of settle the residue be increase from the consideration that in many instance it can be obtain only by legal process for more precise detail on this subject i refer to a report from the first comptroller of the treasury the sum which be appropriate at the last session for the repair of the cumberland road have be apply with good effect to that object a final report have not yet be receive from the agent who be appoint to superintend it as soon as it be receive it shall be communicate to congress many patriotic and enlighten citizen who have make the subject a object of particular investigation have suggest a improvement of still greater importance they be of opinion that the water of the chesapeake and ohio may be connect together by one continue canal and at a expense far short of the value and importance of the object to be obtain if this could be accomplish it be impossible to calculate the beneficial consequence which would result from it a great portion of the produce of the very fertile country through which it would pass would find a market through that channel troops might be move with great facility in war with cannon and every kind of munition and in either direction connect the atlantic with the western country in a line pass through the seat of the national government it would contribute essentially to strengthen the bond of union itself believe as i do that congress possess the right to appropriate money for such a national object -lrb- the jurisdiction remain to the state through which the canal would pass -rrb- i submit it to you consideration whether it may not be advisable to authorize by a adequate appropriation the employment of a suitable number of the officer of the corps of engineer to examine the unexplored ground during the next season and to report they opinion thereon it will likewise be proper to extend they examination to the several route through which the water of the ohio may be connect by canal with those of lake erie as the cumberland road will require annual repair and congress have not think it expedient to recommend to the state a amendment to the constitution for the purpose of vest in the united state a power to adopt and execute a system of internal improvement it be also submit to you consideration whether it may not be expedient to authorize the executive to enter into a arrangement with the several state through which the road pass to establish toll each within its limit for the purpose of defray the expense of future repair and of provide also by suitable penalty for its protection against future injury the act of congress of the 7th of may 1822 appropriate the sum of $ 22700 for the purpose of erect two pier as a shelter for vessel from ice near cape henlopen delaware bay to effect the object of the act the officer of the board of engineer with commodore bainbridge be direct to prepare plan and estimate of pier sufficient to answer the purpose intend by the act it appear by they report which accompany the document from the war department that the appropriation be not adequate to the purpose intend and as the pier would be of great service both to the navigation of the delaware bay and the protection of vessel on the adjacent part of the coast i submit for the consideration of congress whether additional and sufficient appropriation should not be make the board of engineer be also direct to examine and survey the entrance of the harbor of the port of presquille in pennsylvanium in order to make a estimate of the expense of remove the obstruction to the entrance with a plan of the best mode of effect the same under the appropriation for that purpose by act of congress pass 3d of march last the report of the board accompany the papers from the war department and be submit for the consideration of congress a strong hope have be long entertain found on the heroic struggle of the greek that they would succeed in they contest and resume they equal station among the nation of the earth it be believe that the whole civilized world take a deep interest in they welfare although no power have declare in they favor yet none accord to we information have take part against they they cause and they name have protect they from danger which might ere this have overwhelm any other people the ordinary calculation of interest and of acquisition with a view to aggrandizement which mingle so much in the transaction of nation seem to have have no effect in regard to they from the fact which have come to we knowledge there be good cause to believe that they enemy have lose forever all dominion over they that greece will become again a independent nation that she may obtain that rank be the object of we most ardent wish it be state at the commencement of the last session that a great effort be then make in spain and portugal to improve the condition of the people of those country and that it appear to be conduct with extraordinary moderation it need scarcely be remark that the result have be so far very different from what be then anticipate of event in that quarter of the globe with which we have so much intercourse and from which we derive we origin we have always be anxious and interested spectator the citizen of the united state cherish sentiment the most friendly in favor of the liberty and happiness of they fellow-men on that side of the atlantic in the war of the european power in matter relate to themselves we have never take any part nor do it comport with we policy so to do it be only when we rights be invade or seriously menace that we resent injury or make preparation for we defense with the movement in this hemisphere we be of necessity more immediately connect and by cause which must be obvious to all enlighten and impartial observer the political system of the ally power be essentially different in this respect from that of america this difference proceed from that which exist in they respective government and to the defense of we own which have be achieve by the loss of so much blood and treasure and mature by the wisdom of they most enlighten citizen and under which we have enjoy unexampled felicity this whole nation be devote we owe it therefore to candor and to the amicable relation exist between the united state and those power to declare that we should consider any attempt on they part to extend they system to any portion of this hemisphere as dangerous to we peace and safety with the exist colony or dependency of any european power we have not interfere and shall not interfere but with the government who have declare they independence and maintain it and whose independence we have on great consideration and on just principle acknowledge we could not view any interposition for the purpose of oppress they or control in any other manner they destiny by any european power in any other light than as the manifestation of a unfriendly disposition toward the united state in the war between those new government and spain we declare we neutrality at the time of they recognition and to this we have adhere and shall continue to adhere provide no change shall occur which in the judgment of the competent authority of this government shall make a corresponding change on the part of the united state indispensable to they security the late event in spain and portugal shew that europe be still unsettled of this important fact no stronger proof can be adduce than that the ally power should have think it proper on any principle satisfactory to themselves to have interpose by force in the internal concern of spain to what extent such interposition may be carry on the same principle be a question in which all independent power whose government differ from theirs be interested even those most remote and surely none more so than the united state we policy in regard to europe which be adopt at a early stage of the war which have so long agitate that quarter of the globe nevertheless remain the same which be not to interfere in the internal concern of any of its power to consider the government _ de facto _ as the legitimate government for we to cultivate friendly relation with it and to preserve those relation by a frank firm and manly policy meeting in all instance the just claim of every power submit to injury from none but in regard to those continent circumstance be eminently and conspicuously different it be impossible that the ally power should extend they political system to any portion of either continent without endanger we peace and happiness nor can anyone believe that we southern brethren if leave to themselves would adopt it of they own accord it be equally impossible therefore that we should behold such interposition in any form with indifference if we look to the comparative strength and resource of spain and those new government and they distance from each other it must be obvious that she can never subdue they it be still the true policy of the united state to leave the party to themselves in the hope that other power will pursue the same course if we compare the present condition of we union with its actual state at the close of we revolution the history of the world furnish no example of a progress in improvement in all the important circumstance which constitute the happiness of a nation which bear any resemblance to it at the first epoch we population do not exceed 3000000 by the last census it amount to about 10000000 and what be more extraordinary it be almost altogether native for the immigration from other country have be inconsiderable at the first epoch half the territory within we acknowledged limit be uninhabited and a wilderness since then new territory have be acquire of vast extent comprise within it many river particularly the mississippus the navigation of which to the ocean be of the highest importance to the original state over this territory we population have expand in every direction and new state have be establish almost equal in number to those which form the first bond of we union this expansion of we population and accession of new state to we union have have the happiest effect on all its highest interest that it have eminently augmented we resource and add to we strength and respectability as a power be admit by all but it be not in these important circumstance only that this happy effect be feel it be manifest that by enlarge the basis of we system and increase the number of state the system itself have be greatly strengthen in both its branch consolidation and disunion have thereby be render equally impracticable each government confide in its own strength have less to apprehend from the other and in consequence each enjoy a greater freedom of action be render more efficient for all the purpose for which it be institute it be unnecessary to treat here of the vast improvement make in the system itself by the adoption of this constitution and of its happy effect in elevate the character and in protect the rights of the nation as well as of individual to what then do we owe these blessing it be know to all that we derive they from the excellence of we institution ought we not then to adopt every measure which may be necessary to perpetuate they jame monroe special message washington city _ December 7 1823 _ _

the history of all age prove that this can not be presume on the contrary that at least one-half of every century in ancient as well as modern time have be consume in war and often of the most general and desolating character nor be there any cause to infer if we examine the condition of the nation with which we have the most intercourse and strongest political relation that we shall in future be exempt from that calamity within any period to which a rational calculation may be extend and as to the rights of neutral power it be sufficient to appeal to we own experience to demonstrate how little regard will be pay to they whenever they come in conflict with the interest of the power at war while we rely on the justice of we cause and on argument alone the amount of the property of we fellow-citizen which be seize and confiscate or destroy by the belligerent party in the war of the french revolution and of those which follow before we become a party to the war be almost incalculable the whole movement of we government from the establishment of we independence have be guide by a sacred regard for peace situate as we be in the new hemisphere distant from europe and unconnected with its affair bless with the happiest government on earth and have no object of ambition to gratify the united state have steadily cultivate the relation of amity with every power and if in any european war a respect for we rights might be rely on it be undoubtedly in those to which i have advert the conflict be vital the force be nearly equally balanced and the result uncertain each party have the strongest motive of interest to cultivate we good will lest we might be throw into the opposite scale powerful as this consideration usually be it be nevertheless utterly disregard in almost every stage of and by every party to those war to these encroachment and injury we regard for peace be finally force to yield in the war to which at length we become a party we whole coast from st croix to the mississippus be either invade or menace with invasion and in many part with a strong impose force both land and naval in those part where the population be most dense the pressure be comparatively light but there be scarcely a harbor or city on any of we great inlet which could be consider secure new york and philadelphium be eminently expose the then exist work not be sufficient for they protection the same remark be applicable in a certain extent to the city eastward of the former and as to the condition of the whole country southward of the latter the event which mark the war be too recent to require detail we army and navy signalize themselves in every quarter where they have occasion to meet they gallant foe and the militia voluntarily fly to they aid with a patriotism and fight with a bravery which exalt the reputation of they government and country and which do they the highest honor in whatever direction the enemy choose to move with they squadron and to land they troops we fortification where any exist present but little obstacle to they they pass those work without difficulty they squadron in fact annoy we whole coast not of the sea only but every bay and great river throughout its whole extent in enter those inlet and sail up they with a small force the effect be disastrous since it never fail to draw out the whole population on each side and to keep it in the field while the squadron remain there the expense attend this species of defense with the exposure of the inhabitant and the waste of property may readily be conceive the occurrence which precede the war and those which attend it be alike replete with useful instruction as to we future policy those which mark the first epoch demonstrate clearly that in the war of other power we can rely only on force for the protection of we neutral rights those of the second demonstrate with equal certainty that in any war in which we may be engage hereafter with a strong naval power the expense waste and other calamity attend it consider the vast extent of we maritime frontier can not fail unless it be defend by adequate fortification and a suitable naval force to correspond with those which be experience in the late war two great object be therefore to be regard in the establishment of a adequate naval force : the first to prevent war so far as it may be practicable the second to diminish its calamity when it may be inevitable hence the subject of defense become intimately connect in all its part in war and in peace for the land and at sea no government will be dispose in its war with other power to violate we rights if it know we have the means be prepared and resolve to defend they the motive will also be diminish if it know that we defens by land be so well plan and execute that a invasion of we coast can not be productive of the evil to which we have heretofore be expose it be under a thorough conviction of these truth derive from the admonition of the late war that congress as early as the year 1816 during the term of my enlighten and virtuous predecessor under whom the war have be declare prosecute and terminate digest and make provision for the defense of we country and support of its rights in peace as well as in war by act which authorize and enjoin the augmentation of we navy to a prescribe limit and the construction of suitable fortification throughout the whole extent of we maritime frontier and wherever else they might be deem necessary it be to the execution of these work both land and naval and under a thorough conviction that by hasten they completion i should render the best service to my country and give the most effectual support to we free republican system of government that my humble faculty would admit of that i have devote so much of my time and labor to this great system of national policy since i come into this office and shall continue to do it until my retirement from it at the end of you next session the navy be the arm from which we government will always derive most aid in support of we neutral rights every power engage in war will know the strength of we naval force the number of we ship of each class they condition and the promptitude with which we may bring they into service and will pay due consideration to that argument justice will always have great weight in the cabinet of europe but in long and destructive war exigency often occur which press so vitally on they that unless the argument of force be bring to its aid it will be disregard we land force will always perform they duty in the event of war but they must perform it on the land we navy be the arm which must be principally rely on for the annoyance of the commerce of the enemy and for the protection of we own and also by cooperation with the land force for the defense of the country capable of move in any and every direction it possess the faculty even when remote from we coast of extend its aid to every interest on which the security and welfare of we union depend annoy the commerce of the enemy and menacing in turn its coast provide the force on each side be nearly equally balanced it will draw its squadron from we own and in case of invasion by a powerful adversary by a land and naval force which be always to be anticipate and ought to be provide against we navy may by like cooperation with we land force render essential aid in protect we interior from incursion and depredation the great object in the event of war be to stop the enemy at the coast if this be do we city and whole interior will be secure for the accomplishment of this object we fortification must be principally rely on by place strong work near the mouth of we great inlet in such position as to command the entrance into they as may be do in many instance it will be difficult if not impossible for ship to pass they especially if other precaution and particularly that of steam battery be resort to in they aid in the war between other power into which we may be draw in support of we neutral rights it can not be doubt that this defense would be adequate to the purpose intend by it nor can it be doubt that the knowledge that such work exist would form a strong motive with any power not to invade we rights and thereby contribute essentially to prevent war there be it be admit some entrance into we interior which be of such vast extent that it would be utterly impossible for any work however extensive or well post to command they of this class the chesapeake bay which be a arm of the sea may be give as a example but in my judgment even this bay may be defend against any power with whom we may be involve in war as a third party in the defense of we neutral rights by erect strong work at the mouth of jame river on both side near the cape as we be now do and at old point comfort and the rip rap and connect those work together by chain whenever the enemy 's force appear place in the rear some large ship and steam battery the passage up the river would be render impracticable this guard would also tend to protect the whole country border on the bay and river empty into it as the hazard would be too great for the enemy however strong he naval force to ascend the bay and leave such a naval force behind since in the event of a storm whereby he vessel might be separate or of a calm the ship and steam battery behind the work might rush forth and destroy they it could only be in the event of a invasion by a great power or a combination of several power and by land as well as by naval force that those work could be carry and even then they could not fail to retard the movement of the enemy into the country and to give time for the collection of we regular troops militia and volunteer to that point and thereby contribute essentially to he ultimate defeat and expulsion from we territory under a strong impression that a peace establishment of we navy be connect with the possible event of war and that the naval force intend for either state however small it may be be connect with the general system of public defense i have think it proper in communicate this report to submit these remark on the whole subject jame monroe washington _ February 2 1824 _ _ to the house of representative of the united state _ : in compliance with a resolution

_ _ to the senate and house of representative of the united state _ : i herewith transmit to congress certain document relate to a claim of massachusett for service render by the militia of that state in the late war and for which payment be make by the state from the particular circumstance attend this claim i have think it proper to submit the subject to the consideration of congress in form a just estimate of this claim it will be necessary to recur to the cause which prevent its admission or the admission of any part thereof at a earlier day it will be recollect that when a call be make on the militia of that state for service in the late war under a arrangement which be alike applicable to the militia of all the state and in conformity with the act of congress the executive of massachusett refuse to comply with the call on the principle that the power vest in congress by the constitution to provide for call forth the militia to execute the law of the union suppress insurrection and repel invasion be not a complete power for those purpose but conditional and dependent on the consent of the executive of the several state and also that when call into service such consent be give they could not be command by a regular officer of the united state or other officer than of the militia except by the president in person that this decision of the executive of massachusett be repugnant to the constitution of the united state and of dangerous tendency especially when it be consider that we be then engage in a war with a powerful nation for the defense of we common rights be the decide opinion of this government and when the period at which that decision be form be consider it be as early as the 5th of August 1812 immediately after the war be declare and that it be not relinquish during the war it be infer by the executive of the united state that the decision of the executive of that state be alike applicable to all the service that be render by the militia of the state during the war in the correspondence with the governor of massachusett at that important epoch and on that very interesting subject it be announce to he by the secretary of war that if the militia of the state be call into service by the executive of the state and not put under the command of the major-general of the united state as the militia of the other state be the expense attend they service would be chargeable to the state and not to the united state it be also state to he at the same time that any claim which the state might have for the reimbursement of such expense could not be allow by the executive of the united state since it would involve principle on which that branch of the government could not decide under these circumstance a decision on the claim of the state of massachusett have hitherto be suspend and it need not be remark that the suspension have proceed from a conviction that it would be improper to give any sanction by its admission or by the admission of any part thereof either to the construction of the constitution contend for by the then executive of that state or to its conduct at that period toward the general government and the union in January 1823 the representative in congress from massachusett and maine suggest by memorial that the constitutional objection could not apply to a portion of the claim and request that the accounting officer of the government might be instruct to audit and admit such part as might be free from that objection in all case where claim be present for militia service it be the duty and the practice of the accounting officer to submit they to the department for instruction as to the legality of the claim that be whether the service have be render by order of the competent authority or otherwise under circumstance to justify the claim against the united state admit that the evidence in support of it should be satisfactory to this request there appear to be no well-founded objection under the reservation as to the constitutional principle and accordingly a order be give to the accounting officer of the treasury to proceed in auditing the claim with that reservation in conformity with this arrangement the executive of massachusett appoint two citizen of that state commissioner to attend to the settlement of its claim and who in execution of the trust repose in they have present to the accounting officer of the treasury that portion comprehend the service of the fifth division of the militia of the state which have be audit and report for consideration subject to the objection above state i have examine this report with the document present by the commissioner and be of opinion that the service render by that division be spontaneous patriotic and proper necessary for self-defense to repel in some instance actual invasion and in other to meet by adequate preparation invasion that be menace the commissioner of the state have intimate that other portion of service stand on similar ground the accounting officer have be instruct in auditing the whole to do it in such manner as to enable the department to show distinctly under what circumstance each portion of service be render whether voluntary call out by invasion or the menace of invasion or by public authority and in such case whether the militia render such service be place under the authority of the united state or retain under that of the state it afford I great pleasure to state that the present executive of massachusett have disclaim the principle which be maintain by the former executive and that in this disclaimer both branch of the legislature have concur by this renunciation the state be place on the same ground in this respect with the other state and this very distressing anomaly in we system be remove it be well know that the great body of we fellow-citizen in massachusett be as firmly devote to we union and to the free republican principle of we government as we fellow-citizen of the other state of this important truth they conduct in every stage of we revolutionary struggle and in many other emergency bear ample testimony and i add with profound interest and a thorough conviction that although the difficulty advert to in the late war with they executive excited equal surprise and regret it be not believe to extend to they there never be a moment when the confidence of the government in the great body of we fellow-citizen of that state be impaired nor be a doubt entertain that they be at all time willing and ready to support they rights and repel a invasion by the enemy the commissioner of massachusett have urge in compliance with they instruction the payment of so much of they claim as apply to the service render by the fifth division which have be audit and i should have no hesitation in admit it if i do not think under all the circumstance of the case that the claim in all its part be cognizable by congress alone the period at which the constitutional difficulty be raise by the executive of the state be in the highest degree important as be the tendency of the principle for which it contend and which be adhere to during the war the public mind throughout the union be much excite by that occurrence and great solicitude be feel as to its consequence the executive of the united state be bind to maintain and do maintain a just construction of the constitution in do which it be gratify to recollect that the most friendly feeling be cherish toward they brethren of that state the executive of the state be warn in the correspondence which then take place of the light in which its conduct be view and of the effect it would have so far as related to the right of the executive of the united state on any claim which might afterwards be present by the state to compensation for such service under these circumstance the power of the executive of the united state to settle any portion of this claim seem to be preclude it seem proper also that this claim should be decide on full investigation before the public that the principle on which it be decide may be thoroughly understand by we fellow-citizen of every state which can be do by congress alone who alone also possess the power to pass law which may be necessary to carry such decision into effect in submit this subject to the calm and enlighten judgment of congress i do it with peculiar satisfaction from a knowledge that you be now place by the course of event in a situation which will enable you to adopt such measure as will not only comport with the sound principle of we government but likewise be conducive to other the highest interest of we union by the renunciation of the principle maintain by the then executive of massachusett as have be do by its present executive and both branch of the legislature in the most formal manner and in accord with the sentiment of the great body of the people the constitution be restore in a very important feature -lrb- that connect with the public defense -rrb- and in the most important branch -lrb- that of the militia -rrb- to its native strength it be very gratifying to know that this renunciation have be produce by the regular orderly and pacific operation of we republican system whereby those who be in the right at the moment of difficulty and who sustain the government with great firmness have daily gain strength until this result be accomplish the point on which you will have to decide be what be fairly due for the service which be actually render by what mean shall we contribute most to cement the union and give the greatest support to we most excellent constitution in seek each object separately we be lead to the same result all that can be claim by we fellow-citizen of massachusett be that the constitutional objection be waive and that they be place on the same footing with they brethren in the other state that regard the service render by the militia of other state for which compensation have be make give to the rule the most liberal construction like compensation be make for similar service render by the militia of that state i have be lead to conclude on great consideration that the principle of justice as well as a due regard for the great interest of we union require that this claim in the extent propose should be accede to essential service be render in the late war by the militia of massachusett and with the most patriotic motive it seem just therefore that they should be compensate for such service in like manner with the militia of the other state the constitutional difficulty do not originate with they and have now be remove it comport with we system to look to the service render and to the intention with which it be render and to award the compensation accordingly especially as it may now be do without the sacrifice of principle the motive in this instance be the stronger because well satisfied i be that by so do we shall give the most effectual support to we republican institution no latent cause of discontent will be leave behind the great body of the people will be gratify and even those who now survive who be then in error can not fail to see with interest and satisfaction this distressing occurrence thus happily terminate i therefore consider it my duty to recommend it to congress to make provision for the settlement of the claim of massachusett for service render in the late war by the militia of the state in conformity with the rule which have govern in the settlement of the claim for service render by the militia of the other state jame monroe February 24 1824 _ to the house of representative of the united state _ : i transmit herewith a report of the secretary of war

whereby the latter cede to the former a portion of the territory then within its limit on the condition therein specify by the fourth article of that compact it be stipulate that the united state should at they own expense extinguish for the use of georgium the indian title to all the land within the state as soon as it might be do _ peaceably _ and on _ reasonable _ condition these papers show the measure adopt by the executive of the united state in fulfillment of the several condition of the compact from its date to the present time and particularly the negotiation and treaty with the indian tribe for the extinguishment of they title with a estimate of the number of acre purchase and sum pay for land they acquire they show also the state in which this interesting concern now rest with the cherokee one of the tribe within the state and the inability of the executive to make any further movement with this tribe without the special sanction of congress i have full confidence that my predecessor exert they best endeavor to execute this compact in all its part of which indeed the sum pay and the land acquire during they respective term in fulfillment of its several stipulation be a full proof i have also be animated since i come into this office with the same zeal from a anxious desire to meet the wish of the state and in the hope that by the establishment of these tribe beyond the mississippus they improvement in civilization they security and happiness would be promote by the paper bearing date on the 30th of January last which be communicate to the chief of the cherokee nation in this city who come to protest against any further appropriation of money for hold treaty with they the obligation impose on the united state by the compact with georgium to extinguish the indian title to the right of soil within the state and the incompatibility with we system of they existence as a distinct community within any state be press with the utmost earnestness it be propose to they at the same time to procure and convey to they territory beyond the mississippus in exchange for that which they hold within the limit of georgium or to pay they for it its value in money to this proposal they answer which bear date 11th of February follow give a unqualified refusal by this it be manifest that at the present time and in they present temper they can be remove only by force to which should it be deem proper the power of the executive be incompetent i have no hesitation however to declare it as my opinion that the indian title be not affect in the slightest circumstance by the compact with georgium and that there be no obligation on the united state to remove the indian by force the express stipulation of the compact that they title should be extinguish at the expense of the united state when it may be do _ peaceably _ and on _ reasonable _ condition be a full proof that it be the clear and distinct understanding of both party to it that the indian have a right to the territory in the disposal of which they be to be regard as free agent a attempt to remove they by force would in my opinion be unjust in the future measure to be adopt in regard to the indian within we limit and in consequence within the limit of any state the united state have duty to perform and a character to sustain to which they ought not to be indifferent at a early period they improvement in the art of civilized life be make a object with the government and that have since be persevere in this policy be dictate by motive of humanity to the aborigine of the country and under a firm conviction that the right to adopt and pursue it be equally applicable to all the tribe within we limit my impression be equally strong that it would promote essentially the security and happiness of the tribe within we limit if they could be prevail on to retire west and north of we state and territory on land to be procure for they by the united state in exchange for those on which they now reside surround as they be and press as they will be on every side by the white population it will be difficult if not impossible for they with they kind of government to sustain order among they they interior will be expose to frequent disturbance to remedy which the interposition of the united state will be indispensable and thus they government will gradually lose its authority until it be annihilate in this process the moral character of the tribe will also be lose since the change will be too rapid to admit they improvement in civilization to enable they to institute and sustain a government found on we principle if such a change be compatible either with the compact with georgium or with we general system or to become member of a state should any state be willing to adopt they in such number regard the good order peace and tranquillity of such state but all these evil may be avoid if these tribe will consent to remove beyond the limit of we present state and territory land equally good and perhaps more fertile may be procure for they in those quarter the relation between the united state and such indian would still be the same consideration of humanity and benevolence which have now great weight would operate in that event with a augmented force since we should feel sensibly the obligation impose on we by the accommodation which they thereby afford we place at ease as the united state would then be the improvement of those tribe in civilization and in all the art and usage of civilized life would become the part of a general system which might be adopt on great consideration and in which every portion of we union would then take a equal interest these view have steadily be pursue by the executive and the money which have be place at its disposal have be so apply in the manner best calculate accord to its judgment to produce this desirable result as will appear by the document which accompany the report of the secretary of war i submit this subject to the consideration of congress under a high sense of its importance and of the propriety of a early decision on it this compact give a claim to the state which ought to be execute in all its condition with perfect good faith in do this however it be the duty of the united state to regard its strict import and to make no sacrifice of they

menace the pressure be most sensibly feel in 1814 after the attack on this city and its capture when the invade force retire to its squadron menace alike baltimore norfolk and richmond the attack on

majority of 131 to 9 pass a resolution to the following effect : _ resolve _ that the president of the united state be request to enter upon and prosecute from time to time such negotiation with the several maritime power of europe and america as he may deem expedient for the effectual abolition of the african slave trade and its ultimate denunciation as piracy under the law of nation by the consent of the civilized world by the act of congress above refer to whereby the most effectual means that could be devise be adopt for the extirpation of the slave trade the wish of the united state be explicitly declare that all nation might concur in a similar policy it could only be by such concurrence that the great object could be accomplish and it be by negotiation and treaty alone that such concurrence could be obtain commence with one power and extend it to other the course therefore which the executive who have concur in the act have to pursue be distinctly mark out for it have there however be any doubt respect it the resolution of the house of representative the branch which might with strict propriety express its opinion could not fail to have remove it by the tenth article of the treaty of peace between the united state and great britain conclude at ghent it be stipulate that both party should use they best endeavor to accomplish the abolition of the african slave trade this object have be accordingly pursue by both government with great earnestness by separate act of legislation and by negotiation almost uninterrupted with the purpose of establish a conceit between they in some measure which might secure its accomplishment great britain in she negotiation with other power have conclude treaty with spain portugal and the netherland in which without constitute the crime as piracy or class it with crime of that denomination the party have concede to the naval officer of each other the right of search and capture of the vessel of either that might be engage in the slave trade and have institute court consist of judge subject of both party for the trial of the vessel so capture in the negotiation with the united state great britain have earnestly and repeatedly press on they the adoption of similar provision they have be resist by the executive on two grounds : one that the constitution of mixed tribunal be incompatible with they constitution and the other that the concession of the right of search in time of peace for a offense not piratical would be repugnant to the feeling of the nation and of dangerous tendency the right of search be the right of war of the belligerent toward the neutral to extend it in time of peace to any object whatever might establish a precedent which might lead to other with some power and which even if confine to the instance specify might be subject to great abuse animated by a ardent desire to suppress this trade the united state take stronger ground by make it by the act above refer to piratical a measure more adequate to the end and free from many of the objection applicable to the plan which have be propose to they it be this alternative which the executive under the sanction and injunction above state offer to the british government and which that government have accept by make the crime piracy the right of search attach to the crime and which when adopt by all nation will be common to all and that it will be so adopt may fairly be presume if steadily persevere in by the party to the present convention in the meantime and with a view to a fair experiment the obvious course seem to be to carry into effect with every power such treaty as may be make with each in succession in present this alternative to the british government it be make a indispensable condition that the trade should be make piratical by act of parliament as it have be by a act of congress this be provide for in the convention and have since be comply with in this respect therefore the nation rest on the same ground suitable provision have also be adopt to protect each party from the abuse of the power grant to the public ship of the other instead of subject the person detect in the slave trade to trial by the court of the captor as would be the case if such trade be piracy by the law of nation it be stipulate that until that event they shall be try by the court of they own country only hence there could be no motive for a abuse of the right of search since such abuse could not fail to terminate to the injury of the captor should this convention be adopt there be every reason to believe that it will be the commencement of a system destine to accomplish the entire abolition of the slave trade great britain by make it she own confessedly adopt at the suggestion of the united state and be pledge to propose and urge its adoption by other nation in concert with the united state will find it for she interest to abandon the less-effective system of she previous treaty with spain portugal and the netherland and to urge on those and other power they accession to this the crime will then be universally proscribe as piracy and the traffic be suppress forever other consideration of high importance urge the adoption of this convention we have at this moment pend with great britain sundry other negotiation intimately connect with the welfare and even the peace of we union in one of they nearly a third part of the territory of the state of maine be in contestation in another the navigation of the st lawrence the admission of consul into the british island and a system of commercial intercourse between the united state and all the british possession in this hemisphere be subject of discussion in a third we territorial and other rights upon the northwest coast be to be adjust while a negotiation on the same interest be open with russium in a fourth all the most important controvertible point of maritime law in time of war be bring under consideration and in the fifth the whole system of south american concern connect with a general recognition of south american independence may again from hour to hour become as it have already be a object of concerted operation of the highest interest to both nation and to the peace of the world it can not be disguise that the rejection of this convention can not fail to have a very injurious influence on the good understanding between the two government on all these point that it would place the executive administration under embarrassment and subject it the congress and the nation to the charge of insincerity respect the great result of the final suppression of the slave trade and that its first and indispensable consequence will be to constrain the executive to suspend all further negotiation with every european and american power to which overture have be make in compliance with the resolution of the house of representative of 28th February 1823 must be obvious to invite all nation with the statute of piracy in we hand to adopt its principle as the law of nation and yet to deny to all the common right of search for the pirate whom it would be impossible to detect without enter and search the vessel would expose we not simply to the charge of inconsistency it must be obvious that the restriction of search for pirate to the african coast be incompatible with the idea of such a crime it be not doubt also if the convention be adopt that no example of the commission of that crime by the citizen or subject of either power will ever occur again it be believe therefore that this right as applicable to piracy would not only extirpate the trade but prove altogether innocent in its operation in further illustration of the view of congress on this subject i transmit to the senate extract from two resolution of the house of representative one of the 9th February 1821 the other of 12th April 1822 i transmit also a letter from the charg d'affaire of the british government which show the

of we affair foreign and domestic realize the most sanguine anticipation which have be entertain of the public prosperity if we look to the whole we growth as a nation continue to be rapid beyond example if to the state which compose it the same gratifying spectacle be exhibit we expansion over the vast territory within we limit have be great without indicate any decline in those section from which the emigration have be most conspicuous we have daily gain strength by a native population in every quarter -- a population devote to we happy system of government and cherish the bond of union with fraternal affection experience have already shewn that the difference of climate and of industry proceeding from that cause inseparable from such vast domain and which under other system might have a repulsive tendency can not fail to produce with we under wise regulation the opposite effect what one portion want the other may supply and this will be most sensibly feel by the part most distant from each other form thereby a domestic market and a active intercourse between the extreme and throughout every portion of we union thus by a happy distribution of power between the national and state government government which rest exclusively on the sovereignty of the people and be fully adequate to the great purpose for which they be respectively institute cause which might otherwise lead to dismemberment operate powerfully to draw we closer together in every other circumstance a correct view of the actual state of we union must be equally gratifying to we constituent we relation with foreign power be of a friendly character although certain interesting difference remain unsettled with some we revenue under the mild system of impost and tonnage continue to be adequate to all the purpose of the government we agriculture commerce manufacture and navigation flourish we fortification be advance in the degree authorize by exist appropriation to maturity and due progress be make in the augmentation of the navy to the limit prescribe for it by law for these blessing we owe to almighty god from whom we derive they and with profound reverence we most grateful and unceasing acknowledgment in adverting to we relation with foreign power which be always a object of the highest importance i have to remark that of the subject which have be bring into discussion with they during the present administration some have be satisfactorily terminate other have be suspend to be resume hereafter under circumstance more favorable to success and other be still in negotiation with the hope that they may be adjust with mutual accommodation to the interest and to the satisfaction of the respective party it have be the invariable object of this government to cherish the most friendly relation with every power and on principle and condition which might make they permanent a systematic effort have be make to place we commerce with each power on a footing of perfect reciprocity to settle with each in a spirit of candor and liberality all exist difference and to anticipate and remove so far as it might be practicable all cause of future variance it have be stipulate by the seventh article of the convention of navigation and commerce which be conclude on the 24th of June 1822 between the united state and france that the say convention should continue in force for two year from the 1st of October of that year and for a indefinite term afterwards unless one of the party should declare its intention to renounce it in which event it should cease to operate at the end of six month from such declaration and no such intention have be announce the convention have be find advantageous to both party it have since remain and still remain in force at the time when that convention be conclude many interesting subject be leave unsettled and particularly we claim to indemnity for spoliation which be commit on we commerce in the late war for these interest and claim it be in the contemplation of the party to make provision at a subsequent day by a more comprehensive and definitive treaty the object have be duly attend to since by the executive but as yet it have not be accomplish it be hope that a favorable opportunity will present itself for open a negotiation which may embrace and arrange all exist difference and every other concern in which they have a common interest upon the accession of the present king of france a event which have occur since the close of the last session of congress with great britain we commercial intercourse rest on the same footing that it do at the last session by the convention of 1815 the commerce between the united state and the british dominion in europe and the east indy be arrange on a principle of reciprocity that convention be confirm and continue in force with slight exception by a subsequent treaty for the term of ten year from the 20th of October 1818 the date of the latter the trade with the british colony in the west indy have not as yet be arrange by treaty or otherwise to we satisfaction a approach to that result have be make by legislative act whereby many serious impediment which have be raise by the party in defense of they respective claim be remove a earnest desire exist and have be manifest on the part of this government to place the commerce with the colony likewise on a footing of reciprocal advantage and it be hope that the british government see the justice of the proposal and its importance to the colony will ere long accede to it the commissioner who be appoint for the adjustment of the boundary between the territory of the united state and those of great britain specify in the fifth article of the treaty of ghent have disagree in they decision and both government have agree to establish that boundary by amicable negotiation between they it be hope that it may be satisfactorily adjust in that mode the boundary specify by the sixth article have be establish by the decision of the commissioner from the progress make in that provide for by the seventh accord to a report recently receive there be good cause to presume that it will be settle in the course of the ensue year it be a cause of serious regret that no arrangement have yet be finally conclude between the two government to secure by joint cooperation the suppression of the slave trade it be the object of the british government in the early stage of the negotiation to adopt a plan for the suppression which should include the concession of the mutual right of search by the ship of war of each party of the vessel of the other for suspect offender this be object to by this government on the principle that as the right of search be a right of war of a belligerent toward a neutral power it might have a ill effect to extend it by treaty to a offense which have be make comparatively mild to a time of peace anxious however for the suppression of this trade it be think advisable in compliance with a resolution of the house of representative found on a act of congress to propose to the british government a expedient which should be free from that objection and more effectual for the object by make it piratical in that mode the enormity of tho crime would place the offender out of the protection of they government and involve no question of search or other question between the party touch they respective rights it be believe also that it would completely suppress the trade in the vessel of both party and by they respective citizen and subject in those of other power with whom it be hope that the odium which would thereby be attach to it would produce a corresponding arrangement and by means thereof its entire extirpation forever a convention to this effect be conclude and sign in london on the 13th day of march 1824 by plenipotentiary duly authorize by both government to the ratification of which certain obstacle have arise which be not yet entirely remove the difference between the party still remain have be reduce to a point not of sufficient magnitude as be presume to be permit to defeat a object so near to the heart of both nation and so desirable to the friend of humanity throughout the world as objection however to the principle recommend by the house of representative or at least to the consequence inseparable from it and which be understand to apply to the law have be raise which may deserve a reconsideration of the whole subject i have think it proper to suspend the conclusion of a new convention until the definitive sentiment of congress may be ascertain these document relate to the negotiation be with that intent submit to you consideration we commerce with sweden have be place on a footing of perfect reciprocity by treaty and with russium the netherland prussia the free hanseatic city the dukedom of oldenburg and sardinium by internal regulation on each side found on mutual agreement between the respective government the principle upon which the commercial policy of the united state be found be to be trace to a early period they be essentially connect with those upon which they independence be declare and owe they origin to the enlighten man who take the lead in we affair at that important epoch they be develop in they first treaty of commerce with france of 6th February 1778 and by a formal commission which be institute immediately after the conclusion of they revolutionary struggle for the purpose of negotiate treaty of commerce with every european power the first treaty of the united state with prussium which be negotiate by that commission afford a signal illustration of those principle the act of congress of the 3d march 1815 adopt immediately after the return of a general peace be a new overture to foreign nation to establish we commercial relation with they on the basis of free and equal reciprocity that principle have pervade all the act of congress and all the negotiation of the executive on the subject since a convention for the settlement of important question in relation to the northwest coast of this continent and its adjoining sea be conclude and sign at st petersburg on the 5th day of April last by the minister plenipotentiary of the united state and plenipotentiary of the imperial government of russium it will immediately be lay before the senate for the exercise of the constitutional authority of that body with reference to its ratification it be proper to add that the manner in which this negotiation be invite and conduct on the part of the emperor have be very satisfactory the great and extraordinary change which have happen in the government of spain and portugal within the last two year without seriously affect the friendly relation which under all of they have be maintain with those power by the united state have be obstacle to the adjustment of the particular subject of discussion which have arise with each a resolution of the senate adopt at they last session call for information as to the effect produce upon we relation with spain by the recognition on the part of the united state of the independent south american government the papers contain that information be now communicate to congress a charg d'affaire have be receive from the independent government of brazil that country heretofore a colonial possession of portugal have some year since be proclaim by the sovereign of portugal himself a independent kingdom since he return to lisbon a revolution in brazil have establish a new government there with a imperial title at the head of which be place a prince in whom the regency have be vest by the king at the time of he departure there be reason to expect that by amicable negotiation the independence of brazil will ere long be recognize by portugal herself with the remain power of europe with those on the coast of barbary and with all the new south american state we relation be of a friendly character we have minister plenipotentiary reside with the republic of colombium and chile and have receive minister of the same rank from colombium guatemalum bueno ayre and mexico we commercial relation with all those state be mutually beneficial and increase with the republic of colombium a treaty of commerce have be form of which a copy be receive and the original daily expect a negotiation for a like treaty would have be commence with bueno ayre have it not be prevent by the indisposition and lament decease of mr rodney we minister there and to whose memory the most respectful attention have be shew by the government of that republic a advantageous alteration in we treaty with tuni have be obtain by we consular agent reside there the official document of which when receive will be lay before the senate the attention of the government have be draw with great solicitude to other subject and particularly to that relate to a state of maritime war involve the relative rights of neutral and belligerent in such war most of the difficulty which we have experience and of the loss which we have sustain since the establishment of we independence have proceed from the unsettled state of those rights and the extent to which the belligerent claim have be carry against the neutral party it be impossible to look back on the occurrence of the late war in europe and to behold the disregard which be pay to we rights as a neutral power and the waste which be make of we commerce by the party to those war by various act of they respective government and under the pretext by each that the other have set the example without great mortification and a fix purpose never to submit to the like in future a attempt to remove those cause of possible variance by friendly negotiation and on just principle which should be applicable to all party could it be presume be view by none other than as a proof of a earnest desire to preserve those relation with every power in the late war between france and spain a crisis occur in which it seem probable that all the controvertible principle involve in such war might be bring into discussion and settle to the satisfaction of all party proposition have this object in view have be make to the government of great britain france russium and of other power which have be receive in a friendly manner by all but as yet no treaty have be form with either for its accomplishment the policy will it be presume be persevere in and in the hope that it may be successful it will always be recollect that with one of the party to those war and from whom we receive those injury we seek redress by war from the other by whose then reign government we vessel be seize in port as well as at sea and they cargo confiscate indemnity have be expect but have not yet be tender it be under the influence of the latter that we vessel be likewise seize by the government of spain holland denmark sweden and naple and from whom indemnity have be claim and be still expect with the exception of spain by whom it have be render with both party we have abundant cause of war but we have no alternative but to resist that which be most powerful at sea and press we nearest at home with this all difference be settle by a treaty found on condition fair and honorable to both and which have be so far execute with perfect good faith it have be earnestly hope that the other would of its own accord and from a sentiment of justice and conciliation make to we citizen the indemnity to which they be entitle and thereby remove from we relation any just cause of discontent on we side it be estimate that the receipt into the treasury during the current year exclusive of loan will exceed $ 18500000 which with the sum remain in the treasury at the end of the last year amount to $ 946392281 will after discharge the current disbursement of the year the interest on the public debt and upward of $ 1163301152 of the principal leave a balance of more than $ 3000000 in the treasury on the 1st day of January next a larger amount of the debt contract during the late war bear a interest of 6 per cent become redeemable in the course of the ensue year than could be discharge by the ordinary revenue the act of the 26th of may authorize a loan of $ 5000000 at 4-1\/2 per cent to meet the same by this arrangement a annual saving will accrue to the public of $ 75000 under the act of the 24th of may last a loan of $ 5000000 be authorize in order to meet the award under the florida treaty which be negotiate at par with the bank of the united state at 4-1\/2 percent the limit of interest fix by the act by this provision the claim of we citizen who have sustain so great a loss by spoliation and from whom indemnity have be so long withhold be promptly pay for these advance the public will be amply repay at no distant day by the sale of the land in florida of the great advantage result from the acquisition of the territory in other respects too high a estimate can not be form it be estimate that the receipt into the treasury during the year 1825 will be sufficient to meet the disbursement of the year include the sum of $ 10000000 which be annually appropriate by the act constitute the sink fund to the payment of the principal and interest of the public debt the whole amount of the public debt on the 1st of January next may be estimate at $ 86000000 inclusive of $ 2500000 of the loan authorize by the act of the 26th of may last in this estimate be include a stock of $ 7000000 issue for the purchase of that amount of the capital stock of the bank of the united state and which as the stock of the bank still hold by the government will at least be fully equal to its reimbursement ought not to be consider as constitute a part of the public debt estimate then the whole amount of the public debt at $ 79000000 and regard the annual receipt and expenditure of the government a well-founded hope may be entertain that should no unexpected event occur the whole of the public debt may be discharge in the course of ten year and the government be leave at liberty thereafter to apply such portion of the revenue as may not be necessary for current expense to such other object as may be most conducive to the public security and welfare that the sum applicable to these object will be very considerable may be fairly conclude when it be recollect that a large amount of the public revenue have be apply since the late war to the construction of the public building in this city to the erection of fortification along the coast and of arsenal in different part of the union to the augmentation of the navy to the extinguishment of the indian title to large tract of fertile territory to the acquisition of florida to pension to revolutionary officer and soldier and to invalid of the late war on many of these object the expense will annually be diminish and cease at no distant period on most of they on the 1st of January 1817 the public debt amount to $ 12349196516 and notwithstanding the large sum which have be apply to these object it have be reduce since that period $ 3744696178 the last portion of the public debt will be redeemable on the 1st of January 1835 and while there be the best reason to believe that the resource of the government will be continually adequate to such portion of it as may become due in the interval it be recommend to congress to seize every opportunity which may present itself to reduce the rate of interest on every part thereof the high state of the public credit and the great abundance of money be at this time very favorable to such a result it must be very gratifying to we fellow-citizen to witness this flourishing state of the public finances when it be recollect that no burthen whatever have be impose upon they the military establishment in all its branch in the performance of the various duty assign to each justify the favorable view which be present of the efficiency of its organization at the last session all the appropriation have be regularly apply to the object intend by congress and so far as the disbursement have be make the account have be render and settle without loss to the public the condition of the army itself as relate to the officer and man in science and discipline be highly respectable the military academy on which the army essentially rest and to which it be much indebted for this state of improvement have attain in comparison with any other institution of a like kind a high degree of perfection experience however have shewn that the dispersed condition of the corps of artillery be unfavorable to the discipline of that important branch of the military establishment to remedy this inconvenience eleven company have be assemble at the fortification erect at old point comfort as a school for artillery instruction with intention as they shall be perfect in the various duty of that service to order they to other post and to supply they place with other company for instruction in like manner in this mode a complete knowledge of the science and duty of this arm will be extend throughout the whole corps of artillery-but to carry this object fully into effect will require the aid of congress to obtain which the subject be now submit to you consideration of the progress which have be make in the construction of fortification for the permanent defense of we maritime frontier accord to the plan decide on and to the extent of the existing appropriation the report of the secretary of war which be herewith communicate will give a detailed account they final completion can not fail to give great additional security to that frontier and to diminish proportionably the expense of defend it in the event of war the provision in the several act of congress of the last session for the improvement of the navigation of the mississippus and the ohio of the harbor of presqu'isle on lake erie and the repair of the plymouth beach be in a course of regular execution and there be reason to believe that the appropriation in each instance will be adequate to the object to carry these improvement fully into effect the superintendence of they have be assign to officer of the corps of engineer under the act of 30th April last authorize the president to cause a survey to be make with the necessary plan and estimate of such road and canal as he might deem of national importance in a commercial or military point of view or for the transportation of the mail a board have be institute consist of two distinguished officer of the corps of engineer and a distinguish civil engineer with assistant who have be actively employ in carry into effect the object of the act they have carefully examine the route between the potomac and the ohio river between the latter and lake erie between the alleghany and the susquehannah and the route between the delaware and the raritan barnstable and buzzard bay and between boston harbor and narraganset bay such portion of the corps of topographical engineer as could be spare from the survey of the coast have be employ in survey the very important route between the potomac and the ohio considerable progress have be make in it but the survey can not be complete until the next season it be gratify to add from the view already take that there be good cause to believe that this great national object may be fully accomplish it be contemplate to commence early in the next season the execution of the other branch of the act -- that which relate to road -- and with the survey of a route from this city through the southern state to new orlean the importance of which can not be too highly estimate all the officer of both the corps of engineer who could be spare from other service have be employ in explore and survey the route for canal to digest a plan for both object for the great purpose specify will require a thorough knowledge of every part of we union and of the relation of each part to the other and of all to the seat of the general government for such a digest it will be necessary that the information be full minute and precise with a view to these important object i submit to the consideration of the congress the propriety of enlarge both the corps of engineer -- the military and topographical it need scarcely be remark that the more extensively these corps be engage in the improvement of they country in the execution of the power of congress and in aid of the state in such improvement as lie beyond that limit when such aid be desire the happier the effect will be in many view of which the subject be susceptible by profit of they science the work will always be well execute and by give to the officer such employment we union will derive all the advantage in peace as well as in war from they talent and service which they can afford in this mode also the military will be incorporate with the civil and unfounded and injurious distinction and prejudice of every kind be do away to the corps themselves this service can not fail to be equally useful since by the knowledge they would thus acquire they would be eminently better qualify in the event of war for the great purpose for which they be institute we relation with the indian tribe within we limit have not be materially change during the year the hostile disposition evince by certain tribe on the missourus during the last year still continue and have extend in some degree to those on the upper mississippus and the upper lake several party of we citizen have be plunder and murder by those tribe in order to establish relation of friendship with they congress at the last session make a appropriation for treaty with they and for the employment of a suitable military escort to accompany and attend the commissioner at the place appoint for the negotiation this object have not be effect the season be too far advance when the appropriation be make and the distance too great to permit it but measure have be take and all the preparation will be complete to accomplish it at a early period in the next season believe that the hostility of the tribe particularly on the upper mississippus and the lake be in no small degree owe to the war which be carry on between the tribe reside in that quarter measure have be take to bring about a general peace among they which if successful will not only tend to the security of we citizen but be of great advantage to the indian themselves with the exception of the tribe refer to we relation with all the other be on the same friendly footing and it afford I great satisfaction to add that they be make steady advance in civilization and the improvement of they condition many of the tribe have already make great progress in the art of civilized life this desirable result have be bring about by the humane and persevere policy of the government and particularly by means of the appropriation for the civilization of the indian there have be establish under the provision of this act 32 school contain 916 scholar who be well instruct in several branch of literature and likewise in agriculture and the ordinary art of life under the appropriation to authorize treaty with the creek and quaupaw indian commissioner have be appoint and negotiation be now pend but the result be not yet know for more full information respect the principle which have be adopt for carry into effect the act of congress authorize survey with plan and estimate for canal and road and on every other branch of duty incident to the department of war i refer you to the report of the secretary the squadron in the mediterranean have be maintain in the extent which be propose in the report of the secretary of the navy of the last year and have afford to we commerce the necessary protection in that sea apprehend however that the unfriendly relation which have exist between algier and some of the power of europe might be extend to we it have be think expedient to augment the force there and in consequence the _ north carolina _ a ship of the line have be prepare and will sail in a few day to join it the force employ in the gulf of mexico and in the neighbor sea for the suppression of piracy have likewise be preserve essentially in the state in which it be during the last year a persevere effort have be make for the accomplishment of that object and much protection have thereby be afford to we commerce but still the practice be far from be suppress from every view which have be take of the subject it be think that it will be necessary rather to augment than to diminish we force in that quarter there be reason to believe that the piracy now complain of be commit by band of robber who inhabit the land and who by preserve good intelligence with the town and seize favorable opportunity rush forth and fall on unprotected merchant vessel of which they make a easy prey the pillage thus take they carry to they lurk place and dispose of afterwards at price tend to seduce the neighbor population this combination be understand to be of great extent and be the more to be deprecate because the crime of piracy be often attend with the murder of the crew these robber know if any survive they lurk place would be expose and they be catch and punish that this atrocious practice should be carry to such extent be cause of equal surprise and regret it be presume that it must be attribute to the relax and feeble state of the local government since it be not doubt from the high character of the governor of cuba who be well know and much respect here that if he have the power he would promptly suppress it whether those robber should be pursue on the land the local authority be make responsible for these atrocity or any other measure be resort to to suppress they be submit to the consideration of congress in execution of the law for the suppression of the slave trade a vessel have be occasionally send from that squadron to the coast of africa with order to return thence by the usual track of the slave ship and to seize any of we vessel which might be engage in that trade none have be find and it be believe that none be thus employ it be well know however that the trade still exist under other flag the health of we squadron while at thompson island have be much better during the present than it be the last season some improvement have be make and other be contemplate there which it be believe will have a very salutary effect on the pacific we commerce have much increase and on that coast as well as on that sea the united state have many important interest which require attention and protection it be think that all the consideration which suggest the expediency of place a squadron on that sea operate with augmented force for maintain it there at least in equal extent for detailed information respect the state of we maritime force on each sea the improvement necessary to be make on either in the organization of the naval establishment generally and of the law for its better government i refer you to the report of the secretary of the navy which be herewith communicate the revenue of the post-office department have receive a considerable augmentation in the present year the current receipt will exceed the expenditure although the transportation of the mail within the year have be much increase a report of the postmaster-general which be transmit will furnish in detail the necessary information respect the administration and present state of this department in conformity with a resolution of congress of the last session a invitation be give to general lafayette to visit the united state with a assurance that a ship of war should attend at any port of france which he might designate to receive and convey he across the atlantic whenever it might be convenient for he to sail he decline the offer of the public ship from motive of delicacy but assure I that he have long intend and would certainly visit we union in the course of the present year in August last he arrive at new york where he be receive with the warmth of affection and gratitude to which he very important and disinterested service and sacrifice in we revolutionary struggle so eminently entitle he a corresponding sentiment have since be manifest in he favor throughout every portion of we union and affectionate invitation have be give he to extend he visit to they to these he have yield all the accommodation in he power at every designate point of rendezvous the whole population of the neighboring country have be assemble to greet he among whom it have excite in a peculiar manner the sensibility of all to behold the survive member of we revolutionary contest civil and military who have share with he in the toil and danger of the war many of they in a decrepit state a more interesting spectacle it be believe be never witness because none could be found on purer principle none proceed from higher or more disinterested motive that the feeling of those who have fight and bleed with he in a common cause should have be much excite be natural there be however circumstance attend these interview which pervade the whole community and touch the breast of every age even the youngest among we there be not a individual present who have not some relative who have not partake in those scene nor a infant who have not hear the relation of they but the circumstance which be most sensibly feel and which he presence bring forcibly to the recollection of all be the great cause in which we be engage and the blessing which we have derive from we success in it the struggle be for independence and liberty public and personal and in this we succeed the meeting with one who have bear so distinguish a part in that great struggle and from such lofty and disinterested motive could not fail to affect profoundly every individual and of every age it be natural that we should all take a deep interest in he future welfare as we do he high claim on we union be feel and the sentiment universal that they should be meet in a generous spirit under these impression i invite you attention to the subject with a view that regard he very important service loss and sacrifice a provision may be make and tender to he which shall correspond with the sentiment and be worthy the character of the american people in turn we attention to the condition of the civilized world in which the united state have always take a deep interest it be gratify to see how large a portion of it be bless with peace the only war which now exist within that limit be those between turkey and greece in europe and between spain and the new government we neighbor in this hemisphere in both these war the cause of independence of liberty and humanity continue to prevail the success of greece when the relative population of the contend party be consider command we admiration and applause and that it have have a similar effect with the neighbor power be obvious the feeling of the whole civilized world be excite in a high degree in they favor may we not hope that these sentiment win on the heart of they respective government may lead to a more decisive result that they may produce a accord among they to replace greece on the ground which she formerly hold and to which she heroic exertion at this day so eminently entitle she with respect to the contest to which we neighbor be a party it be evident that spain as a power be scarcely feel in it these new state have completely achieve they independence before it be acknowledge by the united state and they have since maintain it with little foreign pressure the disturbance which have appear in certain portion of that vast territory have proceed from internal cause which have they origin in they former government and have not yet be thoroughly remove it be manifest that these cause be daily lose they effect and that these new state be settle down under government elective and representative in every branch similar to we own in this course we ardently wish they to persevere under a firm conviction that it will promote they happiness in this they career however we have not interfere believe that every people have a right to institute for themselves the government which in they judgment may suit they best we example be before they of the good effect of which be we neighbor they be competent judge and to they judgment we leave it in the expectation that other power will pursue the same policy the deep interest which we take in they independence which we have acknowledge and in they enjoyment of all the rights incident thereto especially in the very important one of institute they own government have be declare and be know to the world separate as we be from europe by the great atlantic ocean we can have no concern in the war of the european government nor in the cause which produce they the balance of power between they into whichever scale it may turn in its various vibration can not affect we it be the interest of the united state to preserve the most friendly relation with every power and on condition fair equal arid applicable to all but in regard to we neighbor we situation be different it be impossible for the european government to interfere in they concern especially in those allude to which be vital without affect we indeed the motive which might induce such interference in the present state of the war between the party if a war it may be call would appear to be equally applicable to we it be gratify to know that some of the power with whom we enjoy a very friendly intercourse and to whom these view have be communicate have appear to acquiesce in they the augmentation of we population with the expansion of we union and increase number of state have produce effect in certain branch of we system which merit the attention of congress some of we arrangement and particularly the judiciary establishment be make with a view to the original thirteen state only since then the united state have acquire a vast extent of territory eleven new state have be admit into the union and territory have be lay off for three other which will likewise be admit at no distant day a organization of the supreme court which assign to the judge any portion of the duty which belong to the inferior require they passage over so vast a space under any distribution of the state that may now be make if not impracticable in the execution must render it impossible for they to discharge the duty of either branch with advantage to the union the duty of the supreme court would be of great importance if its decision be confine to the ordinary limit of other tribunal but when it be consider that this court decide and in the last resort on all the great question which arise under we constitution involve those between the united state individually between the state and the united state and between the latter and foreign power too high a estimate of they importance can not be form the great interest of the nation seem to require that the judge of the supreme court should be exempt from every other duty than those which be incident to that high trust the organization of the inferior court would of course be adapt to circumstance it be presume that such a one might be form as would secure a able and faithful discharge of they duty and without any material augmentation of expense the condition of the aborigine within we limit and especially those who be within the limit of any of the state merit likewise particular attention experience have show that unless the tribe be civilized they can never be incorporate into we system in any form whatever it have likewise show that in the regular augmentation of we population with the extension of we settlement they situation will become deplorable if they extinction be not menace some well-digested plan which will rescue they from such calamity be due to they rights to the rights of humanity and to the honor of the nation they civilization be indispensable to they safety and this can be accomplish only by degree the process must commence with the infant state through whom some effect may be work on the parental difficulty of the most serious character present themselves to the attainment of this very desirable result on the territory on which they now reside to remove they from it by force even with a view to they own security and happiness would be revolting to humanity and utterly unjustifiable between the limit of we present state and territory and the rocky mountain and mexico there be a vast territory to which they might be invite with inducement which might be successful it be think if that territory should be divide into district by previous agreement with the tribe now reside there and civil government be establish in each with school for every branch of instruction in literature and the art of civilized life that all the tribe now within we limit might gradually be draw there the execution of this plan would necessarily be attend with expense and that not inconsiderable but it be doubt whether any other can be devise which would be less liable to that objection or more likely to succeed in look to the interest which the united state have on the pacific ocean and on the western coast of this continent the propriety of establish a military post at the mouth of columbium river or at some other point in that quarter within we acknowledged limit be submit to the consideration of congress we commerce and fishery on that sea and along the coast have much increase and be increase it be think that a military post to which we ship of war might resort would afford protection to every interest and have a tendency to conciliate the tribe to the northwest with whom we trade be extensive it be think also that by the establishment of such a post the intercourse between we western state and territory and the pacific and we trade with the tribe reside in the interior on each side of the rocky mountain would be essentially promote to carry this object into effect the appropriation of a adequate sum to authorize the employment of a frigate with a officer of the corps of engineer to explore the mouth of the columbium river and the coast contiguous thereto to enable the executive to make such establishment at the most suitable point be recommend to congress it be think that attention be also due to the improvement of this city the communication between the public building and in various other part and the grounds around those building require it it be presume also that the completion of the canal from the tiber to the eastern branch would have a very salutary effect great exertion have be make and expense incur by the citizen in improvement of various kind but those which be suggest belong exclusively to the government or be of a nature to require expenditure beyond they resource the public lot which be still for sale would it be not doubt be more than adequate to these purpose from the view above present it be manifest that the situation of the united state be in the highest degree prosperous and happy there be no object which as a people we can desire which we do not possess or which be not within we reach bless with government the happiest which the world ever know with no distinct order in society or divide interest in any portion of the vast territory over which they dominion extend we have every motive to cling together which can animate a virtuous and enlighten people the great object be to preserve these blessing and to hand they down to the latest posterity we experience ought to satisfy we that we progress under the most correct and provident policy will not be exempt from danger we institution form a important epoch in the history of the civilized world on they preservation and in they utmost purity everything will depend extend as we interest do to every part of the inhabit globe and to every sea to which we citizen be carry by they industry and enterprise to which they be invite by the want of other and have a right to go we must either protect they in the enjoyment of they rights or abandon they in certain event to waste and desolation we attitude be highly interesting as relate to other power and particularly to we southern neighbor we have duty to perform with respect to all to which we must be faithful to every kind of danger we should pay the most vigilant and unceasing attention remove the cause where it may be practicable and be prepare to meet it when inevitable against foreign danger the policy of the government seem to be already settle the event of the late war admonish we to make we maritime frontier impregnable by a well-digested chain of fortification and to give efficient protection to we commerce by augment we navy to a certain extent which have be steadily pursue and which it be incumbent upon we to complete as soon as circumstance will permit in the event of war it be on the maritime frontier that we shall be assail it be in that quarter therefore that we should be prepare to meet the attack it be there that we whole force will be call into action to prevent the destruction of we town and the desolation and pillage of the interior to give full effect to this policy great improvement will be indispensable access to those work by every practicable communication should be make easy and in every direction the intercourse between every part of we union should also be promote and facilitate by the exercise of those power which may comport with a faithful regard to the great principle of we constitution with respect to internal cause those great principle point out with equal certainty the policy to be pursue rest on the people as we government do state and national with well-defined power it be of the highest importance that they severally keep within the limit prescribe to they fulfil that sacred duty it be of equal importance that the movement between they be harmonious and in case of any disagreement should any such occur a calm appeal be make to the people and that they voice be hear and promptly obey both government be institute for the common good we can not fail to prosper while those who make they be attentive to the conduct of they representative and control they measure in the pursuit of these great object let a generous spirit and national view and feeling be indulge and let every part recollect that by cherish that spirit and improve the condition of the other in what relate to they welfare the general interest will not only be promote but the local advantage be reciprocate by all i can not conclude this communication the last of the kind which i shall have to make without recollect with great sensibility and heartfelt gratitude the many instance of the public confidence and the generous support which i have receive from my fellow-citizen in the various trust with which i have be honor have commence my service in early youth and continue it since with few and short interval i have witness the great difficulty to which we union have be expose and admire the virtue and intelligence with which they have be

lately take upon that point i inform he that i should communicate in write a answer to the overture make by count de menou at washington for unite in a new negotiation this subject with that of the

minister have consent to enter upon the consideration of these claim but they propose to couple with it another subject have no connection with those claim either in its nature its origin or the principle on which it depend -- a question of the disputed construction of one of the article of the treaty of cession of louisiana by virtue of which france claim certain commercial privilege in the port of that province mr gallatin have not receive from he government any authority to connect these two dissimilar subject in the same negotiation or indeed to treat upon the latter which have already be very amply discuss at washington between the secretary of state of the united state and he majesty 's minister at that place without produce any result except a conviction on the part of the government of the united state that the privilege for french vessel as claim by the minister of france never could have be and be not in fact concede by the treaty in question a stop be then put to the negotiation already commence in relation to the claim and with which have be unite on the proposition of the french government and as be naturally connect with it the consideration of certain claim of french citizen on the government of the united state the charg d'affaire of france at washington have lately on behalf of he government express to that of the united state a wish that this double negotiation might be resume and that a definitive arrangement might be make as well in relation to the disputed article of the louisiana treaty as of the subject of the claim upon the one side and upon the other the government of the united state have nothing more at heart than to remove by friendly arrangement every subject of difference which may exist between the two country and to examine with the greatest impartiality and good faith as well the nature and extent of the stipulation into which they have enter as the appeal to they justice make by individual claim reparation for wrong suppose to have be sustain at they hand but these two subject be essentially dissimilar there be no point of connection between they the principle upon which they depend be totally different they have no bearing upon each other and the justice which be due to individual ought not to be delay or make dependent upon the right or the wrong interpretation by one or the other party of a treaty have for its object the regulation of entirely distinct and different interest the reclamation of american citizen upon the government of france be for mere justice -- for the reparation of unquestionable wrong indemnity or restitution of property take from they or destroy forcibly and without right they be of ancient date and justice have be long and anxiously wait for they have be

government of france could consent to enter upon they consideration although the question arise under the eighth article of the louisiana treaty have already be fully examine the government of the united state be ready if it be desire by france and if it be think that any new light can be throw upon it to discuss the subject further whenever it shall be present anew by france to they consideration but they be convince that by blend it with the claim not only will no progress be make toward its solution but that these last standing upon they own unquestionable character ought not to be trammele with a subject to which they be wholly foreign i be instruct to bring they anew before you excellency and to express the hope of the president that he majesty 's government will not continue to insist upon connect together two subject of so different a nature but that the claim may be take up on they own merit and receive the consideration which they deserve unencumbered with other discussion i request you excellency to accept the assurance etc d sheldon -lrb- extract of a letter from the secretary of state to mr brown dated washington December 23 1823 -rrb- you will

wrong the question upon the louisiana treaty be a question of _ right _ upon the meaning of a contract it have be fully deliberately and thoroughly investigate and the government of the united state be under the entire and solemn conviction that the pretension of france be utterly unfounded we be nevertheless willing to resume the discussion if desire by france but to refuse justice to individual unless the united state will accede to the construction of a article in a treaty contrary to what they believe to be its real meaning would be not only incompatible with the principle of equity but submit to a species of compulsion derogatory to the honor of the nation -lrb- extract of a letter -lrb- no 2 -rrb- from jame brown envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary of the united state

m de chateaubriand _ pari _ April 28 1824 _ he excellency viscount de chateaubriand _ minister of foreign affair etc _ sir : in the conference with which you excellency honor I a few day ago i mention a subject deeply interesting to many citizen of the united state on which i have be instruct to address you excellency and to which i earnestly wish to call you immediate attention it be well know to you excellency that my predecessor mr gallatin during several year make repeat and urgent application to he majesty 's government for the adjustment of claim to a very large amount affect the interest of american citizen and originate in gross violation of the law of nation and of the rights of the united state and that he never could obtain from france either a settlement of those claim or even a examination and discussion of they validity to numerous letter address by he to he majesty 's minister on that subject either no answer be give or answer which have for they only object to postpone the investigation of the subject whilst however he indulge the hope that these delay would be abandon and that the rights of we citizen which have be urge for so many year would at length be take up for examination he learn with surprise and regret that he majesty 's government have determine to insist that they should be discuss in connection with the question of the construction of the eighth article of the louisiana treaty of cession against this determination he strongly but ineffectually remonstrate in a letter to mr de villele date the 12th November 1822 it be notorious that the government of the united state whenever request by that of he majesty have uniformly agree to discuss any subject present for they consideration whether the object have be to obtain the redress of public or private injury act upon this principle the question of the eighth article of the louisiana treaty be upon the suggestion of the minister of france make the subject of a voluminous correspondence in the course of which all the argument of the party respectively be fully make know to each other and examine the result of this discussion have be a thorough conviction on the part of the government of the united state that the construction of that article of the treaty contend for by france be destitute of any solid foundation and wholly inadmissible after a discussion so full as to exhaust every argument on that question the attempt to renew it in connection with the question of the claim of we citizen appear to the government of the united state to be a measure so contrary to the fair and regular course of examine controvert point between nation that they instruct mr sheldon they charg d'affaire to prepare and present a note explain they view of the proceeding which he deliver on the 11th of October 1823 to this note no answer have ever be receive i have the express instruction of the government again to call the attention of that of he majesty to this subject and to insist that the claim of we citizen may continue to be discuss as a distinct question without connect it in any way with the construction of the louisiana treaty the two subject be in every respect dissimilar the difference in the nature and character of the two interest be such as to prevent they from be blended in the same discussion the claim against france be of reparation to individual for they property take from they by undisputed wrong and injustice the claim of france under the treaty be that of a right found on a contract in the examination of these question the one can impart no light to the other they be wholly unconnected and ought on every principle to undergo a distinct and separate examination to involve in the same investigation the indisputable rights of american citizen to indemnity for loss and the doubtful construction of a treaty can have no other effect than to occasion a indefinite postponement of the reparation due to individual or a sacrifice on the part of the government of the united state of a treaty stipulation in order to obtain that reparation the united state would hope that such a alternative will not be press upon they by the government of he majesty whilst i indulge a hope that the course to which i have object will no longer be insist on by he majesty 's minister permit I to renew to you excellency the sincere assurance that the united state earnestly desire that every subject of difference between the two country should be amicably adjust and all they relation place upon the most friendly footing although they believe that any further discussion of the eighth article of the louisiana treaty would be wholly unprofitable they will be at all time ready to renew the discussion of that article or to examine any question which may remain to be adjust between they and france i request you excellency to accept etc jame brown -lrb- extract of a letter -lrb- no 3 -rrb- from jame brown to the secretary of state dated pari

the examination of the difficulty which be raise about the execution of the eighth article of the louisiana treaty should not be include although the claim make by france upon this last point be of a different nature from those of the american yet no less attention ought to be pay to arrange both in a just and amicable manner we claim upon the eighth article have already be lay before the federal government by he majesty 's plenipotentiary when he be negotiate the commercial convention of 24th June 1822 the negotiator not agree upon a subject so important the king 's government do not wish this difficulty to suspend any longer the conclusion of a arrangement which might give more activity to commerce and multiply relation equally useful to the two power it reserve to itself the power of comprehend this object in another negotiation and it do not renounce in any manner the claim which it urge it be for this reason sir that my predecessor and myself have constantly insist that the arrangement to be make upon the eighth article of the louisiana treaty should be make a part of those which you government be desirous of make upon other question still at issue it be the intention of he majesty not to leave unsettled any subject of grave discussion between the two state and the king be too well convinced of the friendly sentiment of you government not to believe that the united

minister and do not inspire a hope that we claim will be more favorably attend to than they have be under the former administration the interpretation of the eighth article of the louisiana treaty contend for by france will i apprehend be persist in and all indemnity refuse until it shall have be discuss and decide after the correspondence which have already pass upon that article it would

declare that he reign would be only a continuation of that of the late king no change in the policy of the government be expect and probably none in the composition of the ministry the present king be satisfy with mr de villele who be at its head and if any of its member should be change the spirit in which public affair be direct will not it be believe be affect by that circumstance the ceremony attend the change of the crown have principally occupy the public attention for the last fortnight it will i presume be officially announce by the french minister at washington and accord to the form

month in which event it may probably reach washington about the 15th of December the recent change which have be make in the ministry of which i have already inform you do not justify any very strong expectation that a change of measure in relation to we affair at this court will follow the same individual fill different place in the ministry from those which they formerly hold but in all probability adhere to they former opinion in relation to the subject of discussion between the united state and france on the point to which my letter to the baron de damas particularly relate the count de villele have already give he deliberate view in he letter to mr gallatin date 6th and 15th November 1822 and i have every reason to believe that they remain unchanged have bestow much attention on the subject it be probable he opinion will be in a great measure decisive as to the answer which shall be give to my letter it be the opinion of many well-informed man that in the course of a few month important change will be make in the composition of the ministry as these change however will proceed from cause wholly unconnected with foreign affair i be by no means sanguine in my expectation that under any new composition of the ministry we may hope for a change of policy as it relate to we claim the eighth article of the louisiana treaty will be continually put forward as a bar to we claim and its adjustment urge as often as we renew we claim for indemnity the journal des dbats of this morning state that at a superior council of commerce and of the colony at which he

consideration of the subject of that correspondence my government have send I recent instruction to renew with earnestness the application already so frequently and so ineffectually make for indemnity to we citizen for claim notoriously just and rest on the same principle with other which have be admit and adjust by the government of france in reply to that part of the viscount de chateaubriand 's letter in which he offer to open with I a negotiation upon american claim if that negotiation should also include french claim and particularly the arrangement to be conclude concern the eighth article of the louisiana treaty i have be instruct to declare that any just claim which the subject of france may have upon the government of the united state will readily be embrace in the negotiation and that i be authorize to stipulate any suitable provision for the examination adjustment and satisfaction of they the question relate to the eighth article of the louisiana treaty be view by my government as one of a very different character it can not be blended with that of indemnity for individual claim without a sacrifice on the part of the united state of a principle of right every negotiation for indemnity necessarily presuppose that some wrong have be do and that indemnity ought to be make and the object of every treaty stipulation respect it can only be to ascertain the extent of the injury and to make provision for its adequate reparation this be precisely the nature of the negotiation for american claim which have be for so many year the subject of discussion between the government of the united state and of france the wrong do to we citizen have never be deny whilst they right to indemnity have be establish by act do by the french government in case depend upon the same principle under which they derive they claim by consent to connect with such a negotiation that relate to the eighth article of the louisiana treaty the united state would abandon the principle upon which the whole discussion depend when ask for reparation for acknowledged wrong the united state have be tell that france will not discuss it with they unless they will first renounce they own sense of right and admit and discuss in connection with it a claim the justice of which they have hitherto constantly deny in any negotiation commence under such circumstance the situation of the party would be unequal by consent to connect the pretension of france under the eighth article of the louisiana treaty with claim for indemnity for acknowledged injustice and injury the united state would be understand as admit that those pretension be well found that wrong have be do to france for which reparation ought to be make the government of the united state not have yet be convince that this be the case can not consent to any arrangement which shall imply a admission so contrary to they deliberate sense of right i be authorize and prepare on behalf of the united state to enter upon a further discussion of the eighth article of the louisiana treaty in any manner which may be desire and by which they shall not be understand previously to admit that the construction of that article claim by france be well found and also to renew the separate negotiation for american claim embrace at the same time all just claim winch french subject may have upon the government of the united state the change which have lately take place in he majesty 's department of foreign affair encourage the hope that this important subject will be candidly reconsider that the obstacle which have arrest the progress of the negotiation may be remove and that the subject of contestation between the two government may be ultimately adjust upon such principle as may perpetuate the good understanding and harmony which have so long subsist between the united state and france should i however be disappoint in the result of this application it be to be seriously apprehend that as the united state have not hitherto see in the course of the discussion any just claim of france arise from the eighth article of the louisiana treaty so in the persevere refusal of the french government to discuss and adjust the well-founded claim of citizen of the united state to indemnity for wrong unless in connection with one which they be satisfied be unfounded the united state will ultimately perceive only a determination to deny justice to the claimant permit I respectfully to request that at as early a day as you convenience will allow you excellency will favor I with a answer

interesting to I and which in the movement of we government be deem on principle equally interesting to the public i have be long in the service of my country and in its most difficult conjuncture as well abroad as at home in the course of which i have have a control over the public money to a vast amount if in the course of my service it shall appear on the most severe scrutiny which i invite that the public have sustain any loss by any act of mine or of other for which i ought to be hold responsible i be willing to bear it if on the other hand it shall appear on a view of the law and of precedent in other case that justice have be withhold from I in any instance as i have believe it to be in many and greatly to my injury it be submit whether it ought not to be render it be my wish that all matter of account and claim between my country and myself be settle with that strict regard to justice which be observe in settlement between individual in private life it would be gratify to I and it appear to be just that the subject should be now examine in both respects with a view to a decision hereafter no bill would it be presume be present for my signature which would operate either for or against I and i would certainly sanction none in my favor while here i can furnish testimony applicable to any case in both view which a full investigation may require and the committee to whom the subject may be refer by report fact now with a view to a decision after my retirement will allow time for further information and due consideration of all matter relate thereto settlement with a person in this trust which could not be make with the accounting officer of the government should always be make by congress and before the public the cause of the delay in present these claim will be explain to the committee to whom the subject may be refer it will i presume be make apparent that it be inevitable that from the peculiar circumstance attend each case congress alone could decide on it and that from consideration of delicacy it would have be highly improper for I to have seek it from congress at a earlier period than that which be now propose -- the expiration of my term in this high trust other consideration appear to I to operate with great force in favor of the measure which i now propose a citizen who have long serve he country in its highest trust have a right if he have serve with fidelity to enjoy undisturbed tranquillity and peace in he retirement this he can not expect to do unless he conduct in all pecuniary concern shall be place by severe scrutiny on a basis not to be shake this therefore form a strong motive with I for the inquiry which i now invite the public may also derive considerable advantage from the precedent in the future movement of the government it be know that such scrutiny be make in my case it may form a new and strong barrier against the abuse of the public confidence in future jame monroe washington _ January 10 1825 _ _ to the house of representative of the united state _ : i should hasten to communicate to you the document call for by the resolution of the house of representative of the 4th instant relate to the conduct of the officer of the navy of the united state on the pacific ocean and of other public agent in south america if such a communication might now be make consistently with the public interest or with justice to the party concern in consequence of several charge which have be allege against commodore stewart touch he conduct while command the squadron of the united state on that sea it have be deem proper to suspend he from duty and to subject he to trial on these charge it appear also that some of those charge have be communicate to the department by mr prevost political agent at this time of the united state at peru and heretofore at bueno ayre and chile and apparently with he sanction and that charge have likewise be make against he by citizen of the united state engage in commerce in that quarter it have be think equally just and proper that he should attend here as well to furnish the evidence in he possession applicable to the charge exhibit against commodore stewart as to answer such as have be exhibit against himself in this stage the publication of those document might tend to excite prejudice which might operate to the injury of both it be important that the public servant in every station should perform they duty with fidelity accord to the injunction of the law and the order of the executive in fulfillment thereof it be peculiarly so that this should be do by the commander of we squadron especially on distant sea and by political agent who represent the united state with foreign power for reason that be obvious in both instance it be due to they rights and to the character of the government that they be not censure without just cause which can not be ascertain until on a view of tho charge they be hear in they defense and after a thorough and impartial investigation of they conduct under these circumstance it be think that a communication at this time of those document would not comport with the public interest nor with what be due to the party concerned jame monroe washington _ January 13 1825 _ _ to the senate of the united state _ : in compliance with two resolution of the senate the first of the

object and in that event what other mean it will be most advisable to recur to i herewith transmit a report from the secretary of state and likewise a report from the secretary of the navy with the document refer to in each on the very important question submit to the executive as to the necessity of recur to other more effectual means for the suppression of a practice so destructive of the life and property of we citizen i have to observe that three expedient occur -- one by the pursuit of the offender to the settle as well as the unsettled part of the island from whence they issue another by reprisal on the property of the inhabitant and a third by the blockade of the port of those island it will be obvious that neither of these measure can be resort to in a spirit of amity with spain otherwise than in a firm belief that neither the government of spain nor the government of either of the island have the power to suppress that atrocious practice and that the united state interpose they aid for the accomplishment of a object which be of equal importance to they as well as to we act on this principle the fact which justify the proceeding be universally know and feel by all engage in commerce in that sea it may fairly be presume that neither will the government of spain nor the government of either of those island complain of a resort to either of those measure or to all of they should such resort be necessary it be therefore suggest that a power commensurate with either resource be grant to the executive to be exercise accord to he discretion and as circumstance may imperiously require it be hope that the manifestation of a policy so decisive will produce the happiest result that it will rid these sea and this hemisphere of this practice this hope be strengthen by the belief that the government of spain and the government of the island particularly of cuba whose chief be know here will faithfully cooperate in such measure as may be necessary for the accomplishment of this very important object to secure such cooperation will be the earnest desire and of course the zealous and persevere effort of the executive jame monroe washington _ January 17

washington _ January 27 1825 _ _ to the senate and house of representative of the united state _ : be deeply impressed with the opinion that the removal of the indian tribe from the land which they now occupy within the limit of the several state and territory to the country lie westward and northward thereof within we acknowledged boundary be of very high importance to we union and may be accomplish on condition and in a manner to promote the interest and happiness of those tribe the attention of the government have be long draw with great solicitude to the object for the removal of the tribe within the limit of the state of georgium the motive have be peculiarly strong arise from the compact with that state whereby the united state be bind to extinguish the indian title to the land within it whenever it may be do peaceably and on reasonable condition in the fulfillment of this compact i have think that the united state should act with a generous spirit that they should omit nothing which should comport with a liberal construction of the instrument and likewise be in accordance with the just rights of those tribe from the view which i have take of the subject i be satisfied that in the discharge of these important duty in regard to both the party allude to the united state will have to encounter no conflicting interest with either on the contrary that the removal of the tribe from the territory which they now inhabit to that which be designate in the message at the commencement of the session which would accomplish the object for georgium under a well-digested plan for they government and civilization which should be agreeable to themselves would not only shield they from impend ruin but promote they welfare and happiness experience have clearly demonstrate that in they present state it be impossible to incorporate they in such mass in any form whatever into we system it have also demonstrate with equal certainty that without a timely anticipation of and provision against the danger to which they be expose under cause which it will be difficult if not impossible to control they degradation and extermination will be inevitable the great object to be accomplish be the removal of these tribe to the territory designate on condition which shall be satisfactory to themselves and honorable to the united state this can be do only by convey to each tribe a good title to a adequate portion of land to which it may consent to remove and by provide for it there a system of internal government which shall protect they property from invasion and by the regular progress of improvement and civilization prevent that degeneracy which have generally mark the transition from the one to the other state i transmit herewith a report from the secretary of war which present the best estimate which can be form from the document in that department of the number of indian within we state and territory and of the amount of land hold by the several tribe within each of the state of the country lie northward and westward thereof within we acknowledged boundary of the part to which the indian title have already be extinguish and of the condition on which other part in a amount which may be adequate to the object contemplate may be obtain by this report it appear that the indian title have already be extinguish to extensive tract in that quarter and that other portion maybe acquire to the extent desire on very moderate condition satisfied i also be that the removal propose be not only practicable but that the advantage attend it to the indian may be make so apparent to they that all the tribe even those most oppose may be induce to accede to it at no very distant day the digest of such a government with the consent of the indian which should be endow with sufficient power to meet all the object contemplate -- to connect the several tribe together in a bond of amity and preserve order in each to prevent intrusion on they property to teach they by regular instruction the art of civilized life and make they a civilized people -- be a object of very high importance it be the powerful consideration which we have to offer to these tribe as a inducement to relinquish the land on which they now reside and to remove to those which be designate it be not doubt that this arrangement will present consideration of sufficient force to surmount all they prejudice in favor of the soil of they nativity however strong they may be they elder have sufficient intelligence to discern the certain progress of event in the present train and sufficient virtue by yield to momentary sacrifice to protect they family and posterity from inevitable destruction they will also perceive that they may thus attain a elevation to which as community they could not otherwise aspire to the united state the propose arrangement offer many important advantage in addition to those which have be already enumerate by the establishment of such a government over these tribe with they consent we become in reality they benefactor the relation of conflict interest which have heretofore exist between they and we frontier settlement will cease there will be no more war between they and the united state adopt such a government they movement will be in harmony with we and its good effect be feel throughout the whole extent of we territory to the pacific it may fairly be presume that through the agency of such a government the condition of all the tribe inhabit that vast region may be essentially improve that permanent peace may be preserve with they and we commerce be much extend with a view to this important object i recommend it to congress to adopt by solemn declaration certain fundamental principle in accord with those above suggest as the basis of such arrangement as may be enter into with the several tribe to the strict observance of which the faith of the nation shall be pledge i recommend it also to congress to provide by law for the appointment of a suitable number of commissioner who shall under the direction of the president be authorize to visit and explain to the several tribe the object of the government and to make with they accord to they instruction such arrangement as shall be best calculate to carry those object into effect a negotiation be now depend with the creek nation for the cession of land hold by it within the limit of georgium and with a reasonable prospect of success it be presume however that the result will not be know during the present session of congress to give effect to this negotiation and to the negotiation which it be propose to hold with all the other tribe within the limit of the several state and territory on the principle and for the purpose state it be recommend that a adequate appropriation be now make by congress jame monroe washington _ January 27 1825 _ _ to the senate of the united state _ : i transmit to the senate a treaty conclude in this
