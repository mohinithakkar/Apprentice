martin _ with map and plan _ 1903 to my dear wife preface this account of the commercial ruin of the french settlement take almost entirely from hitherto unpublished document originate as follow whilst engage in historical research connect with the government record in calcutta i find many reference to the french in bengal which interested I strongly in the personal side of they quarrel with the english but the information obtainable from the indian record alone be still meager and incomplete a few month ago however i come across law 's memoir in the british museum and a little later when visit pari to examine the french archive i find not only a copy of law 's memoir but also renault 's and courtin 's letter of which there be i believe no copy in england in these papers i think that i have sufficient material to give something like a idea of bengal as it appear to the french when clive arrive there there be much bitterness in these old french account and much misconception of the english but they be write when misconception of national enemy be the rule and not the exception and when the rights of non-belligerent be little respected in time of war some of the accusation i have check by give the english version but i think that whilst it be only justice to we anglo-indian hero to let the world know what manner of man they opponent be it be equally only justice to they opponent to allow they to give they own version of the story this be my apology if any one should think i allow they to say too much the translation be my own and be make in a state of some perplexity as to how far i be bind to follow my original -- the writings of man who of course be not literary and often have not only no pretension to style but also no knowledge of grammar i have try however to preserve both form and spirit but if any reader be dissatisfied and would like to see the original papers for himself the courtesy of the record official in both pari and london will give he access to a immense quantity of document as interesting as they be important in the various account that i have use there be naturally slightly different version of particular incident and often it be not easy to decide which be the correct one under the circumstance i may perhaps be excuse for not always call attention to discrepancy which the reader will detect for himself he will also notice that the ground cover in one narrative be partly traverse in one or both of the other this have be due to the necessity of treat the story from the point of view of each of the three chief actor i may here mention that the correspondence between clive and the prince of bengal from which i have give some illustrative passage be first see by I in a collection of papers print in 1893 in the government of indium central printing office calcutta under the direction of mr gw forrest cie these papers have not yet be publish but there exist a complete though slightly different copy of this correspondence in the indium office library -lrb- orme mss indium xi -rrb- and it be from the latter copy that i have by permission make the extract here give the remain english quotation when not from print book have be take chiefly from other volume of the orme mss a smaller number from the bengal and madra record in the indium office and a few from mss in the british museum or among the clive papers at walcot to which last i be allow access by the kindness of the earl of powi finally i wish to express my thanks to m omont of the bibliothèque nationale pari to mr w foster of the record department of

the quarrel with the english writing in 1725 the french naval commander the chevalier d'albert tell we that the three most handsome town on the gange be calcutta chandernagore and chinsurah the chief factory of the english french and dutch these town be all situate within thirty mile of each other calcutta the latest found be the greatest and the richest owing partly to its situation which permit the largest ship of the time to anchor at its quay and partly to the privilege enjoy by the english merchant of trading freely as individual through the length and breadth of the land native merchant and native artisan crowd to calcutta and the french and dutch less advantageously situate and hamper by restriction of trade have no chance of compete with the english on equal term the same be of course true of they minor establishment in the interior all three nation have important factory at cossimbazar -lrb- in the neighborhood of murshidabad the capital of bengal -rrb- and at dacca and minor factory at jugdea or luckipore and at balasore the french and dutch have also factory at patna besides calcutta chandernagore and chinsurah the only factory which be fortify be the english factory at cossimbazar during the long reign of the usurper aliverdus khan -lrb- 1 -rrb- that strong and politic ruler enforce peace among he european guest and forbid any fortification of the factory except such as be necessary to protect they against possible incursion of the maratha who at that time make periodical attack on muhammadan and hindu alike to enforce the payment of the _ chauth _ -lrb- 2 -rrb- or blackmail which they levy upon all the country within they reach in southern indium the english and french have be constantly at war whenever there be war in europe but in bengal the strength of the government the terror of the maratha and the general weakness of the european have contrived to enforce a neutrality still there be nothing to guarantee its continuance if the fear of the native government and of the maratha be once remove and if any one of the three nation happen to find itself much stronger than the other the fear of the maratha have nearly disappear but that of the government still remain however it be not till more than sixty year after the foundation of calcutta that there appear any possibility of a breach of peace amongst the european in bengal during this time the three factory calcutta always lead increase rapidly in wealth and importance to the government they be already a cause of anxiety and a object of greed even during the life of aliverdus khan there be many of he counsellor who advise the reduction of the status of european to that of the armenian ie mere trader at the mercy of local official but aliverdus khan whether owe to the enfeeblement of he energy by age or to a intelligent recognition of the value of european commerce would not allow any step to be take against the european many story be tell of the debate in he _ durbar _ -lrb- 3 -rrb- on this subject : accord to one he be report to have compare the european to bee who produce honey when leave in peace but furiously attack those who foolishly disturb they accord to another he compare they to a fire -lrb- 4 -rrb- which have come out of the sea and be play harmlessly on the shore but which would devastate the whole land if any one be so imprudent as to anger it he wisdom die with he and in April 1756 he grandson siraj-ud-daulum a young man of nineteen -lrb- 5 -rrb- already notorious for he debauchery and cruelty come to the throne the french -- who of all european know he best for he seem to have prefer they to all other -- say he chief characteristic be cruelty rapacity and cowardice in he public speech he seem to be ambitious of military fame calcutta be describe to he as a strong fortress full of wealth which belong largely to he native subject and inhabit by a race of foreigner who have grow insolent on they privilege as a proof of this it be point out that they have not present he with the offering which accord to oriental custom be the due of a sovereign on he accession the only person who dare oppose the wish of the young nawab be he mother -lrb- 6 -rrb- but she advice be of no avail and she taunt that he a soldier be go to war upon mere trader be equally inefficacious the record of the time give no definite information as to the tortuous diplomacy which fan the quarrel between he and the english but it be sufficiently clear that the english refuse to surrender the son of one of he uncle 's _ diwan _ -lrb- 7 -rrb- who with he master 's and he father 's wealth have betake himself to calcutta siraj-ud-daulum by the treacherous promise of he commander make himself master of the english factory at cossimbazar without firing a shot and on the 20th of June 1756 find himself in possession of fort william the fortify factory of calcutta -lrb- 8 -rrb- the governor the commandant -lrb- 9 -rrb- of the troops and some two hundred person of lesser note have desert the fort almost as soon as it be actually invest and holwell one of the councillor a ex-surgeon and the gallant few who stand by he and continue the defense be capture and to the number of 146 cast into a little dungeon -lrb- 10 -rrb- intend for military offender from which the next morning only twenty-three come out alive the english take refuge at fulta thirty mile down the river where the nawab in he pride and ignorance leave they unmolested there they be gradually reinforce from madras first by major kilpatrick and later on by colonel clive and admiral watson about the same time both french and english learn that war have be declare in europe between england and france in the previous may but for different reason neither nation think the time suitable for make the fact formally know towards the end of December the english animated by the desire of revenge and of repair they ruin fortune advance on calcutta and on the 2nd of January 1757 the british flag again float over fort william the governor manik chand be like many of the nawab 's servant a hindu some say he be scare away by a bullet through he turban other that he be rouse from the enjoyment of a _ nautch _ -- a native dance -- by the news of the arrival of the english -lrb- 11 -rrb- hasten to murshidabad he report he defeat and assert that the british they have now to deal with be very different from those they have drive from or capture in calcutta the english be not satisfy with recover calcutta they wish to impress the nawab and so they send a small force to huglus which lie above chandernagore and chinsurah storm the muhammadan fort burn the town and destroy the magazine which would have supply the nawab 's army in a attack on calcutta the inhabitant of the country have never know anything so terrible as the big gun of the ship and the nawab actually believe the man-of-war could ascend the river and bombard he in he palace at murshidabad call on the french and dutch for aid which they refuse he determine to try he fortune a second time at calcutta at first everything seem the same as on the former occasion : the native merchant and artisan disappear from the town but it be not as he think out of fear but because the english wish to have they out of the way and so expel they except for the military camp to the north of the city where clive be station with he little army the town lay open to he attack envoy from calcutta soon appear ask for term and the nawab pretend to be willing to negotiate in order to gain time while he outflank clive and seize the town see through this pretence watson and clive think it be time to give he a lesson and on the morning of the 5th of February in the midst of a dense fog clive beat up he quarter though clive have to retire when the whole army be rouse the slaughter amongst the enemy have be immense and though he mockingly inform the nawab that he have be careful to injure none but those who get in he way the nawab himself narrowly escape capture the action however be in no sense decisive most of the nawab 's military leader be eager to avenge they disgrace but some of the chief noble notably he hindu adviser exaggerate the loss already incur and the future danger and advise he to make peace in fact the cruelty and folly of the nawab have turn he court into a nest of traitor with one or two exception there be not a man of note upon whom he could rely and he have not the wit to distinguish the faithful from the unfaithful accordingly he grant the english everything they ask for -- the full restoration of all they privilege and restitution of all they have lose in the sack of calcutta as the english value they loss at several hundred of thousand and the nawab have find only some # 5000 in the treasury of fort william it be clear that the wealth of calcutta be either sink in the gange or have fall as booty into the hand of the moorish soldier siraj-ud-daula though he do not yet know it be a ruin man when he return to he capital he only chance of safety lay in one of two course -- either a loyal acceptance of the condition impose by the english or a loyal alliance with the french against the english from the dutch he could hope for nothing they be as friendly to the english as commercial rival could be they have always declare they be mere trader and would not fight and they keep they word after the capture of calcutta the nawab have exact heavy contribution from both the french and dutch but france and england be now at war and he think it might be possible that in these circumstance the restoration of they money to the french and the promise of future privilege might win they to he side he could not however decide finally on either course and the french be not eager to meet he they detest he character and they prefer if the english would agree to preserve the old neutrality and to trade in peace further they have receive no supplies of man or money for a long time the fortification of chandernagore ie of fort d'orléans be practically in ruin and the lesser factory in the interior be helpless they military force for attack be next to nothing : all they could offer be wise counsel and brave leader they be loth to offer these to a man like the nawab against european and he and he court be as loth to accept they unluckily for the french deserter from chandernagore have serve the nawab 's artillery when he take calcutta and it be even assert that the french have supply the nawab with gunpowder and so when the english hear of these new negotiation they consider the proposal for a neutrality to be a mere blind they forget the kindness show by the french to english refugee at dacca cossimbazar and chandernagore and determine that as a permanent peace with the nawab be out of the question they would whilst he hesitate as to he course of action anticipate he by destroy the one element of force which if add to he power might have make he irresistible they continue the negotiation for a neutrality on the gange only until they be reinforce by a body of 500 european from bombay when they send back the french envoy and exact permission from the nawab to attack chandernagore clive march on that town with a land force of 4000 european and sepoy and admiral watson proceed up the river with a small but powerful squadron thus begin the ruin of the french in bengal the chief french factory be as i have say at chandernagore cossimbazar and dacca the chief of these factory be m renault the director of all the french in bengal m law a nephew of the celebrated law of lauriston the financier and m courtin it be the doings and suffering of these three gallant man which be record in the follow chapter they have no hope of be able to resist the english by themselves but they hope and actually believe that france would send they assistance if they could only hold out till it arrive renault whose case be the most desperate perhaps think that the nawab would in he own interest support he if the english attack chandernagore but know the nawab as well as he do and reflect that he have himself refuse the nawab assistance when he ask for it he hope must have be a feeble one still he could not with honor give up a fortified position without attempt a defense and he determine to do he best when he fail all that law and courtin could expect to do be to maintain they personal liberty and create a diversion in the north of bengal when french force attack it in the south it be not they fault that the attack be never make i shall make no mention of the fate of the factory at balasore and jugdea at these the number of frenchman be so very small that resistance and escape be equally hopeless patna lay on the line of law 's retreat and as we shall see he be join by the second and other subordinate officer of that factory the chief m de la bretesche be too ill to be move but he manage by the assistance of he native friend to secure a large portion of the property of the french east indium company and so to finance law during he wanderings footnote : -lrb- footnote 1 : aliverdus khan enter muxadavad or

indium company be found in 1664 during the ministry of m colbert chandernagore on the gange or rather that mouth of it now know as the river huglus be found in 1676 and in 1688 the town and territory be cede to france by the emperor aurengzebe i know of no plan of chandernagore in the 17th century and those of the 18th be extremely rare two or three be to be find in pari but the destruction of the fort and many of the building by the english after its capture in 1757 and the decay of the town after its restoration to the french owing to diminish trade make it extremely difficult to recognize old landmark the settlement however consist of a strip of land about two league in length and one in depth on the right or western bank of the hugli fort d'orléans lay in the middle of the river front it be commence in 1691 and finish in 1693 -lrb- 12 -rrb- face the north be the porte royale and to the east or river-side be the water gate the north-eastern bastion be know as that of the standard or pavillon the north-western bastion be overlook by the jesuit church and the south-eastern by the dutch octagon this last building be situate on one of a number of piece of land which though within the french bound belong to the dutch before the grant of the imperial charter and which the dutch have always refuse to sell the factory building be in the fort itself to the west lay the company 's tank the hospital and the cemetery european house intersperse with native dwelling lay all around m d'albert say that these house be large and convenient but chiefly of one story only build along avenue of fine tree or along the handsome quay d'albert also mention a chapel in the fort -lrb- 13 -rrb- the church of the jesuit and the capucin and some miserable _ pagoda _ belong to the hindu who owe to the necessity of employ they as clerk and servant be allow the exercise of they religion in he time the european number about 500 there be besides some 400 armenian moor -lrb- 14 -rrb- and topass 1400 to 1500 christian include slave and 18000 to 20000 gentile divide he say into 52 different caste or occupation it be to be suppose that the european house have improve in the thirty year since d'albert 's visit at any rate many of those which be close to the fort now command its interior from they roof or upper story exactly as the house of the lead official in calcutta command the interior of fort william no other fact could be so significant of the security which the european in bengal believe they enjoy from any attack by the force of the native government the site of the fort be now cover with native hut the cemetery still remain and the company 's tank -lrb- now know as lal dighus -rrb- whilst kootus ghat be the old landing-place of fort d'orlean as regard the european population at the time of the siege we have no definite information the return draw up by the french official at the time of the capitulation do not include the woman and child or the native and mixed population the lady -lrb- 15 -rrb- and it be to be presume the other woman also for there be no mention of woman during the siege retire to the dutch and danish settlement at chinsurah and serampore a few day before and the native population disappear as soon as the british army approach the return therefore show only 538 european and 66 topass the governor or director as already mention be pierre renault : he council consist of mm fournier caillot laporterie nicola and picque there be 36 frenchman of lesser rank in the company 's service as well as 6 surgeon the troops be command by m de tury and 10 officer there be also 10 officer of the french east indium company 's vessel and 107 person of sufficient importance for they _ parole _ to be demand when the fort fall apparently these return do not include those who be kill in the defense nor have we any definite information as to the number of french sepoy but eyre coote -lrb- 16 -rrb- say there be 500 the story of the siege be to be gather from many account m renault and he council submit a official report renault write many letter to dupleix and other patron or friend several of the council and other private person do the same -lrb- 17 -rrb- m jean law whose personal experience we shall deal with in the next chapter be chief of cossimbazar and watch the siege as it be from the outside he straightforward narrative help we now and then to correct a mis-statement make by the besiege in the bitterness of defeat on the english side besides the bengal record there be clive 's and eyre coote 's military journal the log of the british ship of war and the journal of surgeon edward ive of he majesty 's ship _ kent _ thus this passage of arm almost the only one in bengal -lrb- 18 -rrb- in which the protagonist be european be no obscure event but one in which almost every incident be see and describe from opposite point of view this multiplicity of authority make it difficult to form a connected narrative and in respect to many incident i shall have to follow that account which seem to enter into the fullest or most interesting detail it will now be necessary to go back a little after the capture of calcutta in June 1756 the behavior of the nawab to all european be so overbearing that renault find it necessary to ask the superior council of pondicherry for reinforcement but all that he receive be 67 european and 167 sepoy no money be send he and every day he expect to hear that war have break out between france and england full of these inquietude gentleman i be in the most cruel embarrassment know not even what to desire a strong detestation of the tyranny of the nawab and of the excess which he be commit against european make I long for the arrival of the english in the gange to take vengeance for they at the same time i fear the consequence of war be declare in every letter m de leyrit -lrb- 19 -rrb- impressed upon I the necessity of fortify chandernagore as best i could and of put the town in a state of security against a surprise but you have only to look at chandernagore to see how difficult it be for we absolutely destitute as we be of man and money to do this with a town open on all side and with nothing even to mark it off from the surrounding country -lrb- 20 -rrb- he go on to describe fort d'orléans -- almost in the middle of the settlement surround by house which command it a square of about 600 foot -lrb- 21 -rrb- build of brick flank with four bastion with six gun each without rampart or glaci the southern curtain about 4 foot thick not raise to its full height be provide only with a battery of 3 gun there be a similar battery to the west but the rest of the west curtain be only a wall of mud and brick about a foot and a half thick and 8 or 10 foot high there be warehouse range against the east curtain which face the gange and which be still in process of construction the whole of this side have no ditch and that round the other side be dry only 4 foot in depth and a mere ravine the wall of the fort up to the rampart be 15 foot high and the house on the edge of the counterscarp which command it be as much as 30 foot perhaps the fort be best defend on the west where the company 's tank -lrb- 22 -rrb- be situate its bank be only about twelve foot from the fort ditch this use of tank for defensive purpose be a excellent one as they also provide the garrison with a good supply of drinking water a little later clive protect he great barracks at berhampur with a line of large tank along the landward side however this tank protect one side only and the task of hold such a fort with a inadequate garrison be not a hopeful one even for a frenchman it be only he weakness which have make renault submit to pay the contribution demand by the nawab on he triumphant return from calcutta in July of the previous year and he and he comrade feel very bitterly the neglect of the company in not send money and reinforcement one of he younger subordinate write to a friend in pondicherry : -lrb- 23 -rrb- -- but the 3-1\/2 lahk that the company have to pay to the nawab be that a trifle yes my dear fellow for i should like it to have to pay still more to teach it how to leave this factory which be beyond contradiction the finest of its settlement denude of soldier and munitions of war so that it be not possible for we to show we tooth the wish be prophetic like the english the french be forbid by the nawab to fortify themselves renault dare not pay attention to this order he have see what have happen to the english by the neglect of proper precaution and when thing be at they worst the nawab have to seek he alliance against the english grant he leave to fortify chandernagore and later on even to provide he with money under the pretence that he be simply restore the sum forcibly extort from he the previous year -lrb- 24 -rrb- trade be at a standstill and renault be determine that if the enemy of he nation be destine to take the company 's property they should have the utmost difficulty possible in do so he expend the money on provision and ammunition at the same time that he might not lose any chance of settle affair peaceably with the english he refuse to associate himself with the nawab and enter upon negotiation for a neutrality in the gange to protect himself if these fail he begin raise fortification and pull down the house which command the fort or mask its fire he could not pull down the house on the south of the fort from which clive subsequently make he attack partly for want of time partly because the native workman run away and partly because of the bad feeling prevalent in the motley force which form he garrison -lrb- 25 -rrb- the most fatal defect of all be the want of a military engineer the person who hold that position have be send from france he be a master mason and have no knowledge of engineering it have be the same story in calcutta drake 's two engineer have be a subaltern in the military and a young covenanted servant renault have to supervise the fortification himself i commence to pull down the church and the house of the jesuit father situate on the edge of the ditch also all the house of private person which mask the entire north curtain the wood take from the ruin of these serve to construct a barrier extend from bastion to bastion and support this same north curtain which seem ready to fall to piece from old age this barrier be place four foot outside the wall the intervene space be fill in with earth also in front of porte royale -lrb- ie outside the gate in the avenue -rrb- the weakest side of the fort i place a battery of 3 gun and work hard at clear out and enlarge the ditch but there be no time to make it of any use as a defense a warehouse on which i put bale of _ gunny _ -lrb- 26 -rrb- to prevent cannon ball from break in the vault of the roof serve it as a casemate the east or river curtain be leave alone the french be in fact so confident that the ship of war would not be able to force they way up the river and that clive would not therefore think of attack on that side that the only precaution they take at first be the erection of two battery outside the fort it be a well-known maxim in war that one should attack at that point at which the enemy deem himself most secure and it will be see that all clive 's effort be aim at prepare for admiral watson to attack on the east as regard artillery renault be better off the alarm which the prince -lrb- siraj-ud-daulum -rrb- give we in June last have give I reason to examine into the state of the artillery i find that not one of the carriage of the gun on the rampart be in a serviceable condition not a field-piece mount not a platform ready for the mortar i give all my attention to these matter and fortunately have time to put they right to serve he gun renault have the sailor of the company 's ship _ saint contest _ whose commander m de la vigne buisson be the soul of the defense about this time he receive a somewhat doubtful increase to he garrison a crowd of deserter from the english east indium company 's force the latter at this time be compose of man of all nationality english german swiss dutch and even french many of they and naturally the foreigner especially be ready to desert upon little provocation the hardship of service in a country where the climate and road be execrable where food and pay be equally uncertain and where promise be make not to be keep be provocation which the best soldier might have find it difficult to resist we read of whole regiment in the english and french service refuse to obey order and of mutiny of officer as well as of man the one reward of service be the chance of plunder and naturally then as soon as the fight with the nawab have stop for a time the desertion from the british force be numerous colonel clive have more than once write to renault to remonstrate with he for take british soldier into he service probably renault could have retort the accusation with justice -- at any rate he go on enlist deserter and from those who have now come over he form a company of grenadier of 50 man one of artillery of 30 and one of sailor of 60 wisely give they a little higher pay than usual to excite they emulation one of these be a man name lee -- a corporal and a deserter from the _ tyger _ who pledge himself to the enemy that he would throw two shell out of three into the _ tyger _ but whilst he be bring the mortar to bear for that purpose he be disable by a musket bullet from the _ kent 's _ top he be afterwards send home a prisoner to england -lrb- 27 -rrb- as might be expect the younger frenchman be wild with delight at the chance of see a good fight some of they have be much disappointed that the nawab have not attack chandernagore in June 1756 one of they write -lrb- 28 -rrb- -- i be charm with the adventure and the chance of carry a musket have always have -lrb- what frenchman have not -rrb- a secret lean towards a military life i intend to kill a dozen moor myself in the first sortie we make for i be determine not to stand like a stock on a bastion where one only run the risk of get wound without have any of the pleasure of inflict they if not the highest form of military spirit this be at any rate one of which a good commander might make much use renault take advantage of this feeling and from the young man of the colony such as company 's servant ship ' officer supercargo and european inhabitant -lrb- 29 -rrb- he make a company of volunteer to whom at they own request he give he son a officer of the garrison as commander one of the volunteer officer write : -- i have the honor to be appoint lieutenant and be much pleased when i see the spirit of emulation which reign in every heart i can not sufficiently praise the spirit of exactitude with which every one be animated and the progress which all make in so short a time in the management of they arm i lay stress on the fact that it be a occupation entirely novel to they and one of which the commencement always appear very hard but they overcome all difficulty and find amusement in what to other would appear merely laborious all this time renault be watch the war between the english and the moor in January the english sail up the hugli pass chandernagore contemptuously without a salute burn the moorish town of huglus and bandel ravage the bank of the river and retire to calcutta up to this the nawab have not condescend to notice the english now in a moment of timidity he ask the intervention of the french as mediator -lrb- 30 -rrb- renault eagerly comply for have he mediation be accept he would have insert in the treaty a clause enforce peace amongst the european in bengal but the english refuse to treat through the french this could have only one mean renault feel that he course be now clear and be on the point of offer the alliance which the nawab have so long seek for when he receive order from m de leyrit forbid he to attack the english by land as m law write if renault have be free to join the nawab with 500 european either clive would not have venture a night attack on the nawab 's camp or have he do so the event would probably have be very different under the circumstance all that renault could do be to continue he fortification it be now that he first realize that admiral watson would take part in the attack as the ship of war be what we have most to fear from we construct on the river bank a battery of 6 gun four of which cover the approach to the fort from the foot of the battery a bank twenty-two foot high stretch to the fort be begin so as to protect the curtain on this side from the fire of the ship _ but it be not finish _ we have also to attend to the inhabit portion of the town it be impossible to do more but we determine to protect it from a surprise and so ditch be dig across the street and outpost establish -lrb- 31 -rrb- it be this waste of valuable time upon the defense of the town that a capable engineer would have save renault from the mistake of commit have he limit he effort to strengthen the wall of the fort and clear away the surround house he would have be not only stronger against the attack of the land force but also in a much better position to resist the ship the issue of the nawab 's attack on calcutta have already be tell he be so depress by he failure that he now treated renault with the greatest respect and it be now that he give he the sum of money -- a lakh of rupee then worth # 12500 -- which he spend on provision and munitions of war renault say : -- the nawab 's envoy further give I to understand that he be in he heart enrage with the english and continue to regard they as he enemy in spite of this we see clearly from the treaty just make -lrb- with the english -rrb- that we should be its victim and know siraj-ud-daulum 's character he promise to assist I strongly if the english attack we do not quiet my mind i prepare for whatever might happen by press on we preparation and collect all kind of provision in the fort the nawab and the english conclude a treaty of peace and alliance on the 9th of February 1757 renault mention no actual treaty between the nawab and the french but the french doctor refer to in a note above assert that the nawab demand that the council should bind itself in write to oppose the passage of the english past chandernagore it be merely engage to defend ourselves against the maritime force of the english because chandernagore be the only place on this coast against which they could undertake any enterprise by water _ this engagement be sign _ and send to the nawab three day after he have make peace with the english the council receive in reply two privilege the one to coin money with the king 's stamp at chandernagore the other liberty of trade for individual frenchman on the same footing as the company and 100000 rupee on account of the 300000 which he have extort the previous year it do not matter whether this engagement be sign or not -lrb- 32 -rrb- as a frenchman thus mention it the rumor of its signature must have be very strong it be probable that the english hear of it and believe it to be conclusive proof of the secret understanding between the nawab and the french the privilege of individual trade be particularly likely to excite they commercial jealousy for it be to this very privilege in they own case that the wealth and strength of calcutta be due such a rumor therefore be not likely to facilitate negotiation nevertheless renault send mm fournier and nicola the latter of whom have many friend amongst the english to calcutta to re-open the negotiation for a neutrality these negotiation seem to be endless the most striking feature be admiral watson 's apparent vacillation when the council propose war he want peace when they urge neutrality he want war clive go so far as to present a memorial to the council say it be unfair to continue the negotiation if the admiral be determine not to agree to a treaty it seem as if the council want war but wish to throw the responsibility upon the admiral on the other hand the admiral be only too eager to fight but hesitate to involve the company in a war with the french and the nawab combine at a moment when the british land force be so weaken by disease that success might be consider doubtful he have also to remember the fact that the council at chandernagore be subordinate to the council at pondicherry and the latter might whenever convenient to the french repudiate the treaty however in spite of all difficulty the term be agree to the draft be prepare and only the signature be want when a large reinforcement of european arrive from bombay and the admiral receive formal notification of the declaration of war and order from the admiralty to attack the french -lrb- 33 -rrb- this put a immediate end to negotiation and the envoy be instruct to return to chandernagore at the same time the english determine to try and prevent the nawab from join the french whilst the admiral be make up he mind fortune have favor the english the nawab in fear of a invasion of bengal by the pathan have call upon the british for assistance and on the 3rd of march clive 's army leave calcutta _ en route _ for murshidabad the admiral now point out to the nawab that the british could not safely leave chandernagore behind they in the hand of a enemy and clive write to the same effect say he would wait near chandernagore for a reply on the 10th of march the nawab write a letter to the admiral which conclude with the follow significant word : -- you have understanding and generosity : if you enemy with a upright heart claim you protection you will give he life but then you must be _ well _ satisfied of the innocence of he intention : if not whatever you think right that do law say this letter be a forgery -lrb- 34 -rrb- but as the nawab do not write any letter himself the only test of authenticity be he seal which be duly attach the english believe it to be genuine and the word quote could have but one mean admiral watson read they as a permission to attack the french without fear of the nawab 's interference he prepare to support clive as soon as the water in the huglus would allow he ship to pass up and it must be suppose informed clive of the letter he have receive at any rate he so inform the council clive reach chandernagore on the 12th and probably hear on that day or the next from calcutta on the 13th he send the follow summons -- which renault do not mention and do not reply to -- to chandernagore : -- sir the king of great britain have declare war against france i summons you in he name to surrender the fort of chandernagore in case of refusal you be to answer the consequence and expect to be treat accord to the usage of war in such case i have the honor to be sir you most obedient and humble servant robert clive it be important in the light of what happen later to notice that clive address renault as a combatant and the head of the garrison in england we have recently see man eager to vilify they own nation france have produce similar monster one of they write from pondicherry : -- the english have change they mind on the arrival of the reinforcement from bombay we gentleman at chandernagore prepare to ransom themselves and they would have do so at whatever price the ransom have be fix provide anything have remain to they that mode of agreement could not possibly suit the taste of the english it be reject and the council of chandernagore have no other resource except to surrender on the best condition they could obtain from the generosity of they enemy this course be so firmly resolve upon that they give no thought to defend themselves the military insist only on firing a single discharge which they desire the council would grant they it be only the marine and the citizen who though they have no vote in the council cry out tumultuously that the fort must be defend a plot be form to prevent the director 's son who be ready to carry the key of the town to the english camp from go out suddenly some one fire a musket the english thought it be the reply to they summons they commence on they side to fire they artillery and that be how a defense which last ten whole day be begin how much truth be contain in the above paragraph may be judge by what have be already state it will be sufficient to add that clive receive no answer to he summons make a sudden attack on a small earthwork to the south-west of the fort at 3 be on the 14th of march for two whole day then the english have be in sight of chandernagore without attack the french lady have be send to chinsurah and serampore so that the defender have nothing to fear on they account besides the french soldier and civilian there be also about 2000 moorish troops present whom law say he persuade the nawab to send down as soon as the english left calcutta other account say that renault hire they to assist he the nawab have a strong force at murshidabad ready to march under one of he commander rai durlabh ram but the latter have experience what even a small english force could do in the night attack on the nawab 's camp and be by no means incline to match himself a second time against clive accordingly he never get further than five league from murshidabad urgent message be send from chandernagore as soon as the attack begin m law beg of the nawab to send reinforcement mr watt the english chief and all he party in the _ durbar _ do they utmost to prevent any order be issue the nawab give order which he almost immediately countermand renault ascribe this to a letter which he say clive write on the 14th of march the very day of the attack promise the nawab to leave the french alone but it be not at all likely that he do so it be true clive have write to this effect on the 22nd of February but since then much have happen and he be now act as he think and say with the nawab 's permission on the 16th of march he write to nand kumar faujdar -lrb- 35 -rrb- of huglus as follow : -- the many deceitful wicked measure that the french have take to endeavor to deprive I of the nawab 's favor -lrb- tho ' i thank god they have prove in vain since he excellency 's friendship towards I be daily increase -rrb- have long make I look on they as enemy to the english but i could no longer stifle my resentment when i find that they dare to oppose the freedom of the english trade on the gange by seize a boat with a english _ dustuck _ -lrb- 36 -rrb- and under english color that be pass by they town i be therefore come to a resolution to attack they i be tell that some of the government 's force have be perswade under promise of great reward from the french to join they against we i should be sorry at a time when i be so happy in he excellency 's favor and friendship that i should do any injury to he servant i be therefore to desire you will send these force a order to withdraw and that no other may come to they assistance -lrb- 37 -rrb- what clive fear be that though the nawab might not interfere openly some of he servant might receive secret order to do so and on the 22nd of march he write even more curtly to rai durlabh himself : -- i hear you be arrive within 20 mile of hughly whether you come as a friend or a enemy i know not if as the latter say so at once and i will send some people out to fight you immediately now you know my mind -lrb- 38 -rrb- when diplomatic correspondence be conduct in letter of this kind it be easy to understand that the nawab be frighten out of he wit and absolutely unable to decide what course he should take there be little likelihood of the siege be influence by anything he might do the outpost mention as the object of the first attack be a small earthwork erect at the meeting of three road it be cover by the moorish troops who hold the roof of the house around as the intention of the outpost be merely to prevent the town from be surprised and to enable the inhabitant to take shelter in the fort the outpost ought to have be withdraw as quickly as possible but probably because they think it a point of honor to make a stout defense wherever they be first attack the defender stand to it gallantly renault send repeat reinforcement first the company of grenadier then at 9 o'clock the company of artillery and at 10 o'clock when the surround house be in flame and many of the moor have flee a company of volunteer with these and a further reinforcement of sixty sailor the little fort hold out till 7 o'clock in the evening when the english after three fruitless assault cease fire and withdraw street fighting be always confusing and hence the follow vague description of the day 's event from captain eyre coote 's journal : -- colonel clive order the picquet with the company 's grenadier to march into the french bound which be encompass with a old ditch -lrb- 39 -rrb- the entrance into it a gateway with embrasure on the top but no cannon which the french evacuate on we people 's advance as soon as captain lynn who command the party have take possession he acquaint the colonel who order major kilpatrick and I with my company of grenadier to join captain lynn and send he word after we have reconnoitr the place on we arrival there we find a party of french be in possession of a road lead to a redoubt that they have throw up close under they fort where they have a battery of cannon and upon we advance down the road they fire some shot at we we detach some party through a wood and drive they from the road into they battery with the loss of some man we then send for the colonel who as soon as he join we send to the camp for more troops we continue firing at each other in a irregular manner till about noon at which time the colonel order I to continue with my grenadier company and about 200 sepoy at the advance post and that he would go with the rest of we troops to the entrance which be about a mile back about 2 o'clock word be bring I that the french be make a sortie soon after i perceive the sepoy retire from they post upon which i send to the colonel to let he know the french be come out i be then oblige to divide my company which consist of about 50 man into 2 or 3 party -lrb- very much against my inclination -rrb- to take possession of the ground the sepoy have quit we fire pretty warmly for a quarter of a hour from the different party at each other when the french retreat again into they battery on this occasion i have a gentleman -lrb- mr tooke -lrb- 40 -rrb- -rrb- who be a volunteer kill and 2 of my man wound the enemy lose 5 or 6 european and some black i get close under the battery and be tolerably well sheltered by a old house where i continue firing till about 7 o'clock at which time i be relieved and march back to camp the defender be much exhaust as well by the fighting as by the smoke and heat from the burning house and the heat of the weather for it be almost the hottest season of the year it seem probable that the english would make another attack during the night and as the defender already amount to a very large portion of the garrison it be almost impossible to reinforce they without leave the fort itself in great danger if clive manage to approach it from any other quarter renault call a council of war and after take the opinion of he officer in write to the effect that the outpost must be abandon he withdraw the defender at 9 o'clock under cover of the darkness : the french have suffer a loss of only 10 man kill and wound clive mention that at the same time all the other outpost and battery except those on the river side be withdraw muster he force in the fort renault find they to be compose of 237 soldier -lrb- of whom 117 be deserter from the british -rrb- 120 sailor 70 half-caste and private european 100 person employ by the company 167 sepoy and 100 _ topass _ another french account put the total of the french garrison at 489 but this probably exclude many of the private people -lrb- 41 -rrb- on the 15th the english established themselves in the town and drive out the moor who have be station on the roof of the house this give they to some extent the command of the interior of the fort but no immediate attack be make on the latter a french account -lrb- 42 -rrb- say this be because -- all they soldier be drunk with the wine they have find in the house unfortunately we do not know of this it would have be the moment to make a sortie of which the result must have be favourable to we the enemy be incapable of defense during the night of the 15th the fort be bombard and on the morning of the 16th the british complete the occupation of the house desert by the moor the latter not be receive into the fort either flee or be send away they betake themselves to nand kumar the faujdar of hugli announce the capture of the town nand kumar who be say to have have a understanding with the british send on the message to rai durlabh and the nawab with the malicious addition that the fort if it have not already fall would fall before raus durlabh could reach it this put a end to all chance of the nawab interfere the french spend the day in block a narrow passage form by a sandbank in the river a short distance below the town they sink -- four large ship and a hulk and have a chain and boom across in order to prevent we go up with the squadron captain toby send he 2nd lieutenant mr bloomer that night who cut the chain and bring off a sloop that buoy it up -lrb- 43 -rrb- it be apparently this rapid attack on the position that account for the timidity of the pilot and boatman who renault tell we hurry away without stay to sink two other ship which be half laden and which if sink would have completely block the passage even on the ship which be sink the mast have be leave stand so as to point out they position to the enemy besides the ship sink in the passage there be at chandernagore the french east indiaman the _ saint contest _ -lrb- captain de la vigne buisson -rrb- four large ship and several small one the french need all the sailor for the fort so they sink all the vessel they could not send up the river except three which it be suppose they intend to use as fire-ship clive in the meantime be advance cautiously he man erect battery which seem to be very easily silence by the superior gunnery of the fort he object be partly to weary out the garrison by constant fighting and partly to creep round to the river face so as to be in a position to take the battery which command the narrow river passage as soon as admiral watson be ready to attack the fort later on the naval officer assert he could not have take the fort without the assistance of the fleet he say he could and it be certain that if he have have no fleet to assist he he mode of attack would have be a very different one early in the siege the french be warn from chinsurah to beware of treachery amongst the deserter in they pay and on the 17th of march a number of arrow be find in the fort with label attach bear the word : -- pardon to deserter who will rejoin they color and reward to officer who will come over to we these be seize by the officer before the man could see they but one of the officer themselves charle cossard de terraneau a sub-lieutenant of the garrison take advantage of the offer to go over to the english this officer have serve with credit in the south of indium and have lose a arm in he country 's service the reason of he desertion be say to have be a quarrel with m renault m raymond the translator of a native history of the time by gholam husain khan -lrb- 44 -rrb- tell a story of de terraneau which seem improbable it be to the effect that he betray the secret of the river passage to admiral watson and that a few year later he send home part of the reward of he treachery to he father in france the old man return the money with indignant comment on he son 's conduct and de terraneau commit suicide in despair as a matter of fact de terraneau be a land officer -lrb- 45 -rrb- and therefore not likely to be able to advise the admiral who as we shall see solve the riddle of the passage in a perfectly natural manner and the probate record show that de terraneau live till 1765 and in he will leave he property to he wife ann so the probability be that he live and die quietly in the british service he only trouble seem to have be to get himself receive by he new brother officer however he be so clive tell we the only artillery officer the french have and he desertion be a very serious matter renault write : -- the same night by the improved direction of the besieger ' bomb i have no doubt but that he have do we a bad service on the 18th the french destroy a battery which the english have establish near the river and drive they out of a house opposite the south-east bastion the same day the big ship of the squadron -- the _ kent _ -lrb- captain speke -rrb- the _ tyger _ -lrb- captain latham -rrb- and the _ salisbury _ -lrb- captain martin -rrb- appear below the town the _ bridgewater _ and _ kingfisher _ have come up before admiral watson be on board the _ kent _ and admiral pocock on the _ tyger _ the fleet anchor out of range of the fort at the prussian garden a mile and a half below the town and half a mile below the narrow passage in which the ship have be sink on the 19th admiral watson formally announce the declaration of war -lrb- 46 -rrb- and summon the fort to surrender the governor call a council of war in which there be much difference of opinion some think the admiral would not have come so far without he be certain of he ability to force the passage indeed the presence of so many deserter in the garrison render it probable that he have secret source of information as a matter of fact it be only when lieutenant hey the officer who have bring the summons and in do so have row between the mast of the sunken vessel return to the _ kent _ that admiral watson know the passage be clear renault and the council be aware that the fort could not resist the big gun of the ship and accordingly the more thoughtful member of the council of war determine if possible to try and avoid fight by offer a ransom this apparently give rise to the idea that they wish to surrender and a english officer say : -- upon the admiral 's send they a summons to surrender they be very stout they give we to understand there be two party in the factory the renaultion and the anti-renaultion the former which they call the great-wigg would gentry or councillor be for give up the fort but the other vow they would die in the breach to these high and lofty expression the admiral could give no other answer than that in a very few day or hour perhaps he would give they a very good opportunity of testify they zeal for the company and the grand monarque the offer of ransom be make and be refuse by the admiral renault say he -- insist on we surrender and the troops take possession of the fort _ promising however that every one should keep he own property _ there be not a man amongst we who do not prefer to run the risk of whatever might happen to surrender in this fashion without the fort have yet suffer any material damage and every one be willing to risk he own interest in order to defend those of the company every one swear to do he best the admiral could not attack at once owe to the state of the river but to secure he own position against any counter-attack such as be very likely with a man like captain de la vigne in the fort he send up boat the same night and sink the vessel which it be suppose the french intend to use as fire-ship and the next day mr john delamotte master of the _ kent _ under a heavy fire sound and buoy the passage for the ship the army meanwhile continue its monotonous work ashore the soldier build battery for the french to knock to piece but succeed in clive 's object which be to keep the enemy constantly awake -lrb- 47 -rrb- sometimes this work be dangerous as for instance on the 21st when a ball from the fort knock down a verandah close to one of the english battery the rubbish of which choke up one of we gun very much bruise two artillery officer and bury several man in the ruin -lrb- 48 -rrb- by the 22nd clive have work he way round to the river and be establish to the north-east and south-east of the fort so as to assist the admiral and on the river the admiral have at last get the high tide he be wait for surgeon ive tell the story as follow : -lrb- 49 -rrb- -- the admiral the same evening order light to be place on the mast of the vessel that have be sink with blind towards the fort that we might see how to pass between they a little before daylight and without be discover by the enemy at length the glorious morning of the 23rd of march arrive clive 's man gallantly storm the battery cover the narrow pass -lrb- 50 -rrb- and upon the ship get under sail the colonel 's battery which have be finish behind a dead wall to take off the fire of the fort when the ship pass up begin firing away and have almost batter down the corner of the south-east bastion before the ship arrive within shot of the fort the _ tyger _ with admiral pocock 's flag fly take the lead and about 6 o'clock in the morning get very well into she station against the north-east bastion the _ kent _ with admiral watson 's flag fly quickly follow she but before she could reach she proper station the tide of ebb unfortunately make down the river which occasion she anchor to drag so that before she bring up she have fall abreast of the south-east bastion the place where the _ salisbury _ should have be and from she mainmast aft she be expose to the flank gun of the south-west bastion also the accident of the _ kent 's _ anchor not hold fast and she drive down into the _ salisbury 's _ station throw this last ship out of action to the great mortification of the captain officer and crew for she never have it in she power to fire a gun unless it be now and then when she could sheer on the tide the french during the whole time of the _ kent _ and _ tyger 's _ approach towards the fort keep up a terrible cannonade upon they without any resistance on they part but as soon as the ship come properly to a anchor they return it with such fury as astonished they adversary colonel clive 's troops at the same time get into those house which be nearest the fort and from thence greatly annoy the enemy with they musketry we ship lay so near to the fort that the musket ball fire from they top by strike against the _ chunam _ -lrb- 51 -rrb- wall of the governor 's palace which be in the very center of the fort be beat as flat as a half-crown the fire now become general on both side and be keep up with extraordinary spirit the flank gun of the south-west bastion gall the _ kent _ very much and the admiral 's aide-de-camp be all wound mr watson go down himself to lieutenant william brereton who command the lower deck battery and order he particularly to direct he fire against those gun and they be accordingly soon afterwards silence at 8 in the morning several of the enemy 's shot strike the _ kent _ at the same time one enter near the foremast and set fire to two or three 32-pound cartridge of gunpowder as the boy hold they in they hand ready to charge the gun by the explosion the wad-net and other loose thing take fire between deck and the whole ship be so fill with smoke that the man in they confusion cry out she be on fire in the gunner 's store-room imagine from the shock they have feel from the ball that a shell have actually fall into she this notion strike a panic into the greater part of the crew and 70 or 80 jump out of the port-hole into the boat that be alongside the ship the french presently see this confusion on board the _ kent _ and resolve to take the advantage keep up as hot a fire as possible upon she during the whole time lieutenant brereton however with the assistance of some other brave man soon extinguish the fire and then run to the port he beg the seaman to come in again upbraid they for desert they quarter but find this have no effect upon they he think the more certain method of succeed would be to strike they with a sense of shame and therefore loudly exclaim ` be you briton you englishman and fly from danger for shame for shame ' this reproach have the desire effect to a man they immediately return into the ship repair to they quarter and renew a spirited fire on the enemy in about three hour from the commencement of the attack the parapet of the north and south bastion be almost beat down the gun be mostly dismount and we could plainly see from the main-top of the _ kent _ that the ruin from the parapet and merlon have entirely block up those few gun which otherwise might have be fit for service we could easily discern too that there have be a great slaughter among the enemy who find that we fire against they rather increase hang out the white flag whereupon a cessation of hostility take place and the admiral send lieutenant brereton -lrb- the only commission officer on board the _ kent _ that be not kill or wound -rrb- and captain coote of the king 's regiment with a flag of truce to the fort who soon return accompany by the french governor 's son with article of capitulation which be settle by the admiral and colonel we soon after take possession of the place so far then from the besieger ' side renault 's description of the fight be as follow : -- the three largest vessel aid by the high-water of the equinoctial tide which moreover have move the vessel sink in the narrow passage pass over the sunken ship which do not delay they for a moment to within half pistol shot of the fort and open fire at 6 be then the troops in the battery on the bank of the gange who have so far fire only one discharge suddenly find themselves overwhelm with the fire from the top of the ship abandon it and have much difficulty in gain the fort i immediately send the company of grenadier with a detachment of the artillery company as reinforcement to the south-eastern bastion and the bastion du pavillon which two bastion face the gange but those troops under the fire of the ship join to that of the land battery _ rebuild the same night _ and of more than 3000 man place on the roof of house which overlook the fort almost all take flight leave two of they officer behind one dead and the other wounded i be oblige to send immediately all the marine and the inhabitant from the other post the attack be maintain with vigor from 6 be to 1030 when all the battery be cover with dead and wound the gun dismount and the merlon destroy in spite of they be strengthen with bale of cloth no one could show himself on the bastion demolish by the fire of more than 100 gun the troops be terrify during this attack by the loss of all the gunner and of nearly 200 man the bastion be undermine and threaten to crumble away and make a breach which the exhaustion of we people and the smallness of the number who remain make it impossible for we to hope to defend successfully not a soldier would put he hand to a gun it be only the european marine who stand to they duty and half of these be already kill or disable a body of english troops lie flat on the ground behind the screen which we have commence to erect on the bank of the gange be wait the signal to attack see the impossibility of hold out longer i think that in the state in which the fort be i could not in prudence expose it to a assault consequently i hoist the white flag and order the drum to beat a parley accord to a account write later by a person who be not present at the siege renault lose he fort by a quarter of a hour this writer say the tide be rapidly fall and have the eastern defence of the fort be able to resist a little longer the ship would have find they lower tier of gun useless and might have be easily destroy by the french supposition of this kind always suppose a stupidity on the part of the enemy which renault have no right to count upon admiral watson must have know the strength of the fortress he be about to attack before he place he ship in a position from which it would be impossible to withdraw they whenever he wish to do so the flag of truce be display captain eyre coote be send ashore and return in a quarter of a hour with the governor 's son bear a letter concern the delivery of the place article be agree upon and about 3 o'clock in the afternoon captain coote with a company of artillery and two company of grenadier take possession of the fort before this take place there occur a event the consequence of which be very unfortunate for the french everything be in a state of confusion and the deserter who form the majority of the garrison expect no mercy from the admiral and clive determine to escape rush tumultuously to the porte royale they arm in they hand they force it to be open to they and find the northern road to chinsurah unguarded make the best of they way in that direction they be accompany by a number of the military and marine as well as by some of the company 's servant and private person who be determine not to surrender as all this take place after the hoisting of the white flag and pend the conclusion of the capitulation the english consider it a breach of the law of warfare and when later on the meaning of the capitulation itself be contest they absolutely refuse to listen to any of the representation of the french in all about 150 person leave the fort they have agree to reassemble at a place a little above huglus the english send a small force after they who shoot some and capture other but about 80 officer and man arrive at the rendezvous in safety the pursuit however be carry further and law write : -- constantly pursue they have to make forced march some lose they way other weary out be catch as they stop to rest themselves however when i least expect it i be delighted to see the officer and many of the soldier arrive in little band of 5 and 6 all naked and so worn out that they could hardly hold themselves upright most of they have lose they arm this reinforcement increase law 's garrison from 10 or 12 man to 60 and secure the safety of he person but the condition of the fugitive must have be a object lesson to the nawab and he _ durbar _ which it be not wise for the french to set before they a naval officer write : -- from the letter that have lately pass between the nawab and we we have great reason to hope he will not screen the french at all at cossimbazar or dacca i only wish the colonel do not alarm he too much by move with the army to the northward i do assure you he be so sufficiently frighten that he have rather encounter the new mogul -lrb- 52 -rrb- himself than accept we assistance though he strenuously beg for it about three week ago he write word he need no fuller assurance of we friendship for he when a single letter bring we so far on the road to murshidabad as chandernagore -lrb- 53 -rrb- the escape of the french from chandernagore be of interest as it show the extraordinary condition of the country it be probable that the peasantry and gentry be indifferent as to whether the english or the french be victorious whilst the local authority be so paralyze by the nawab 's hesitation that they do not know which side to assist later on we shall find that small party and even solitary frenchman wander through the country with little or no interference though the english have be recognize as the friend and ally of the new nawab mir jafar to return however to renault and the garrison of chandernagore the capitulation propose by renault and the admiral 's answer be to the following effect : -- 1 the life of the deserter to be spare _ answer _ the deserter to surrender absolutely 2 officer of the garrison to be prisoner on parole and allow to keep they effect _ answer _ agree to 3 soldier of the garrison to be prisoner of war _ answer _ agree to on condition that foreigner may enter the english service 4 sepoy of the garrison to be set free _ answer _ agree to 5 officer and crew of the french company 's ship to be send to pondicherry _ answer _ these person to be prisoner of war accord to article 2 and 3 6 the jesuit father to be allow to practice they religion and retain they property _ answer _ no european to be allow to remain at chandernagore but the father to be allow to retain they property 7 all inhabitant to retain they property _ answer _ this to be leave to the admiral 's sense of equity 8 the french factory up-country to be leave in the hand of they present chief _ answer _ this to be settle by the nawab and the admiral 9 the french company 's servant to go where they please with they clothes and linen _ answer _ agree to it be evident that the capitulation be badly draw up civilian who have take part in the defense as have all the company 's servant might be justly include in the garrison and accordingly admiral watson and clive declare they be all prisoner of war and that article 9 merely permit they to reside where they please on _ parole _ on the other hand renault and the french council declare that be civilian nothing could make they part of the garrison and therefore under article 9 they might do what they please accordingly they express much surprise when they be stop at the fort gate by one of clive 's officer and force to sign before they be allow to pass a paper promising not to act against britain directly or indirectly during the course of the war another point of difficulty be in reference to article 7 the town have be in the hand of the british soldier and sepoy for day much have be plunder and both soldier and sailor be wild for loot they consider that the admiral be act unjustly to they in restore they property to civilian who have be offer the chance of retain it if they would avoid unnecessary bloodsh by a prompt surrender instead of this the defense be so desperate that one officer write : -- we loss have be very great and we have never yet obtain a victory at so dear a rate perhaps you will hear of few instance where two ship have meet with heavier damage than the _ kent _ and _ tyger _ in this engagement -lrb- 54 -rrb- clive 's total loss be only about 40 man kill and wound but the loss on the ship be so great that before the fort surrender the besieger have lose quite as many man as the besiege and it be by no means clear to the common mind what claim the french have to leniency even english officer write : -- the monsieur themselves deserve but little mercy from we for they mean behavior in set fire to so many bale of cloth and raw silk in the fort but a very few minute before we enter and it grieve we much to see such a number of stout and good vessel sink with they whole cargo far above the fort which be a great loss to we and no profit to they those indeed below to hinder we passage be necessary the other be _ merely through mischief _ but notwithstanding this they scarcely ask a favor from the admiral but it be grant the result be that the soldier on guard begin to beat the coolie who be help the french to secure they goods until they be induce by gift to leave they alone and much plunder go on when the soldier could manage to escape notice on one day three black soldier be execute and on another sergeant nover -lrb- 55 -rrb- and a private soldier of the 39th regiment be condemn to death for break open the treasury and steal 3000 rupee another theft which be not trace be the holy vessel and treasure of the church many individual frenchman be ruin of one of these surgeon ive narrate the follow please incident : -- it happen unfortunately that monsieur nicola a man of most amiable character and the father of a large family have not be so provident as the rest of he countryman in secure he effect within the fort but have leave they in the town consequently upon colonel clive 's first take possession of the place they have all be plunder by we common soldier and the poor gentleman and he family be to all appearance ruin the generous and humane captain speke -lrb- 56 -rrb- have hear of the hard fate of monsieur nicola take care to represent it to the two admiral in all its affect circumstance who immediately advance the sum of 1500 rupee each they example be follow by the five captain of the squadron who subscribe 5000 between they mr doidge add 800 more and the same sum be throw in by another person who be a sincere well-wisher to this unfortunate gentleman so that a present of 9600 rupee or # 1200 sterling be in a few minute collect towards the relief of this valuable frenchman and he distressed family one of the company be presently despatch with this money who have order to acquaint monsieur nicola that a few of he english friend desire he acceptance of it as a small testimony of the very high esteem they have for he moral character and of they unfeigned sympathy with he in he misfortune the poor gentleman quite transport by such a instance of generosity in a enemy cry out in a sort of ecstasy ` good god they axe friend indeed ' he accept of the present with great thankfulness and desire that he most grateful acknowledgement might be make to he unknown benefactor for whose happiness and the happiness of they family not only he but the prayer of he child 's child he hope would frequently be present to heaven he could add no more the tear which run plentifully down he cheek bespeak the feeling of he heart : and indeed imply much more than even cicero with all he power of oratory could possibly have express this however be but a solitary instance the state of the french be as a rule wretched in the extreme and renault write : -- the whole colony be disperse and the inhabitant be seek a asylum some -- the greatest part -- have go to chinsurah other to the dane and to calcutta this dispersion be cause by the misery to which we countryman be reduce they poverty which i can not relieve draw tear from my eye the more bitter that i have see they risk they life so generously for the interest of the company and of we nation in such circumstance there be but one consolation possible to brave man -- the knowledge that in the eye of friend and foe they have do they duty the officer of the british army and navy all speak warmly of the gallant behavior of the french and the historian broome himself a soldier and the chronicler of many a brave deed express himself as follow : -- the conduct of the french on this occasion be most creditable and well worthy the acknowledged gallantry of that nation monsieur renault the governor display great courage and determination : but the chief merit of the defense be due to monsieur devigne -lrb- captain de la vigne buisson -rrb- commander of the french company 's ship _ saint contest _ he take charge of the bastion and direct they fire with great skill and judgment and by he own example inspire energy and courage into all those around he renault himself find some consolation in the gallant behavior of he son in my misfortune i have have the satisfaction to see my two son distinguish themselves in the siege with all the courage and intrepidity which i could desire the elder brother be in the company 's service and serve as a volunteer the younger a officer in the army be as have be say above commandant of the volunteer other who be mention by renault and he companion as have distinguish themselves on the french side be the councillor mm caillot nicola and picque captain de la vigne buisson and he son and officer m sinfray -lrb- secretary to the council -rrb- the officer de kallus -lrb- 57 -rrb- and launay the company 's servant matel le conte dompierre boissemont and renault de st germain the private inhabitant renault de la fuye and the two supercargo of indiamen delabar and chambon caillot -lrb- or caillaud -rrb- be wound the official report of the loss of chandernagore be draw up on the 29th of march 1757 the original be in the french archive and caillaud 's signature show that he be still suffer from he wound sinfray we shall come across again he join law at cossimbazar and accompany he on he first retreat to patna send back by law he join siraj-ud-daulum and command the small french contingent at plassey when the battle be lose he take refuge in birbhum be arrest by the raja and hand over to the english the immediate gain to the english by the capture of chandernagore be immense clive write to the select committee at madra : -- i can not at present give you a account to what value have be take -lrb- 58 -rrb- the french company have no great stock of merchandize remain have sell off most of they import and even they investment for europe to pay in part the large debt they have contract with respect to the artillery and ammunition they be not indifferently furnish : there be likewise a very fine marine arsenal well stock in short nothing could have happen more seasonable for the expeditious re-establishment of calcutta than the reduction of charnagore -lrb- ie chandernagore -rrb- it be certainly a large rich and thriving colony and the loss of it be a inexpressible blow to the french company -lrb- 59 -rrb- the french gentleman after have sign under protest the document present to they by clive betook themselves to chinsurah where they repudiate they signature as have be extort by force subsequent to and contrary to the capitulation they proceed to communicate with pondicherry they up-country factory and the native government they also give assistance to french soldier who have escape from chandernagore clive and the calcutta council be equally determine to interpret the capitulation in they own way and send renault a order through m bisdom the dutch director to repair to the british camp renault refuse and when clive send a party of sepoy for he and the other councillor they appeal to m bisdom for the protection of the dutch flag m bisdom inform they somewhat curtly that they have come to he without he invitation that he have no intention of take any part in they quarrel that he would not give they the protection of he flag to enable they to intrigue against the english and in short request they to leave dutch territory as it be evident that the british be prepare to use force renault and the council give in and be take to calcutta where for some time they be keep close prisoner it be not till the nawab have be overthrow at plassey that they be absolutely release and even then it be only that they might prepare for they departure from bengal renault surmise quite correctly that this severity be probably due to the fear that they would assist the nawab the follow incident during renault 's captivity show how little could be expect from the nawab towards a friend who be no longer able to be of use to he after the capture of chandernagore the english council call on the nawab to surrender the french up-country factory to they siraj-ud-daulum have not even yet learn the folly of he double policy on the 4th of April he write to clive : -- i receive you letter and observe what you desire in regard to the french factory and other goods i address you see you be a man of wisdom and knowledge and well acquaint with the custom and trade of the world and you must know that the french by the permission and _ phirmaund _ -lrb- 60 -rrb- of the king -lrb- 61 -rrb- have build they several factory and carry on they trade in this kingdom i can not therefore without hurt my character and expose myself to trouble hereafter deliver up they factory and goods unless i have a write order from they for so do and i be perswade that from you friendship for I you would never be glad at anything whereby my fame would suffer as i on my part be ever desirous of promote -lrb- yours -rrb- mr renault the french governor be in you power if you could get from he a paper under he own hand and seal to this purpose ` that of he own will and pleasure he thereby give up to the english company 's servant and empower they to receive all the factory money and goods belong to the french company without any hindrance from the nawab 's people ' and would send this to I i should be secure by that from any trouble hereafter on this account but it be absolutely necessary you come to some agreement about the king 's duty arise from the french trade i shall then be able to answer to he servant ` that in order to make good the duty accrue from the french trade i have deliver up they factory into the hand of the english ' -lrb- 62 -rrb- clive reply on the 8th of April : -- now that i have grant term to mr renault and that he be under my protection it be contrary to we custom after this to use violence and without it how would he ever of he own will and pleasure write to desire you to deliver up he master 's property weigh the justice of this in you own mind notwithstanding we have reduce the french so low you contrary to you own interest and the treaty you have make with we that my enemy should be yours you still support and encourage they but should you think it would hurt you character to deliver up the french factory and goods you excellency need only signify to I you approbation and i will march up and take they -lrb- 63 -rrb- the more we study the record of the time the more clearly we realize the terrible determination of clive 's character and we almost feel a kind of pity for the weak creature who find themselves oppose to he until we come across incident like the above which show the depths of meanness to which they be prepare to descend as to renault 's further career little be know and that little we should be glad to forget place in charge of the french settlement at karical he surrender on the 5th of April 1760 to what be undoubtedly a overwhelming british force but after so poor a defense that he be bring before a court martial and cashier it speak highly for the respect in which he have be hold by both nation that none of the various report and account of the siege mention he by name even lally who hate the french civilian though he say he deserve death -lrb- 64 -rrb- only refer to he indirectly as be the same officer of the company who have surrender chandernagore to

factory in the village or suburb of cossimbazar -lrb- 65 -rrb- of these one only the english be fortify the other ie the french and dutch be merely large house lie in enclosure the wall of which might keep out cattle and wild animal and even thief but be useless as fortification in 1756 the chief of the english factory as we have already see be the worshipful mr william watt the dutch factory be under m vernet -lrb- 66 -rrb- and the french under m jean law the last mention be the elder son of william law brother of john law the financier who settle in france and place he son in the french service french writer -lrb- 67 -rrb- on genealogy have hopelessly mix up the two brother jean and jacque françois both come to india both distinguish themselves both rise to the rank of colonel one by he service to the french east indium company and one by the usual promotion of a officer in the king 's army the only proof that the elder be the chief of cossimbazar be to be find in a few letter mostly copy in which he name be give as jean or john as a usual rule he sign himself in the french manner by he surname only or as law of lauriston he experience during the four year follow the accession of siraj-ud-daulum be painful and exciting and he have record they in a journal or memoir -lrb- 68 -rrb- which have never yet be publish but which be of great interest to the student of indian history for we it have the add charm of contain a picture of ourselves paint by one who though a foreigner by education be enable by he birth to understand we national peculiarity in the present chapter i shall limit myself almost entirely to quotation from this memoir law be by no mean a admirer of aliverdus khan 's successor -- siraj-ud-daulum a young man of twenty-four or twenty-five -lrb- 69 -rrb- very common in appearance before the death of aliverdi khan the character of siraj-ud-daulum be report to be one of the worst ever know in fact he have distinguish himself not only by all sort of debauchery but by a revolting cruelty the hindu woman be accustom to bathe on the bank of the gange siraj-ud-daulum who be inform by he spy which of they be beautiful send he satellite in disguise in little boat to carry they off he be often see in the season when the river overflow cause the ferry boat to be upset or sink in order to have the cruel pleasure of watch the terrify confusion of a hundred people at a time man woman and child of whom many not be able to swim be sure to perish when it become necessary to get rid of some great lord or minister siraj-ud-daulum alone appear in the business aliverdus khan retire to one of he house or garden outside the town so that he might not hear the cry of the person whom he be cause to be kill so bad be the reputation of this young prince that many person among they mr watt imagine it impossible that the people would ever tolerate he accession the european nation in bengal have no regular representative at the court of the nawab and the chief of the factory at cossimbazar though now and then admit to the _ durbar _ transact they business mainly through _ wakil _ or native agent who of course have the advantage of know the language and what be of much greater importance understand all those indirect way in which in eastern country one 's own business be forward and that of one 's rival thwart then as now the difficulty of deal with native agent be to induce these agent to express they own opinion frankly and clearly -lrb- 70 -rrb- so far from the english chief be correct by he _ wakil _ we find the latter whilst apply to other noble for patronage and assistance studiously refrain from make any application to siraj-ud-daulum when english business have to be transact at court the english go even further : -- on certain occasion they refuse he admission into they factory at cossimbazar and they country house because in fact this excessively blustering and impertinent young man use to break the furniture or if it please he fancy take it away but siraj-ud-daulum be not the man to forget what he regard as a insult the day after the capture of the english fort at cossimbazar he be hear to say in full _ durbar _ ` behold the english formerly so proud that they do not wish to receive I in they house ' in short people know long before the death of aliverdus khan that siraj-ud-daulum be hostile to the english with the french it be different : -- on the other hand he be very well disposed towards we it be we interest to humor he we have receive he with a hundred time more politeness than he deserve by the advice of rai durlabh ram and mohan lal we have recourse to he in important affair consequently we give he present from time to time and this confirm he friendship for we the previous year -lrb- 1755 -rrb- have be a very good one for he owe to the business connect with the settlement of the dane in bengal in fact it be by he influence that i be enable to conclude this affair and aliverdus khan allow he to retain all the profit from it so i can say that i have no bad place in the heart of siraj-ud-daulum it be true he be a profligate but a profligate who be to be fear who could be useful to we _ and who might some day be a good man _ nawaji muhammad khan -lrb- 71 -rrb- have be at least as vicious as siraj-ud-daulum and yet he have become the idol of the people law therefore have cultivate the young nawab mr watt on the other hand be not only foolish enough to neglect he but carry he folly to extreme he be not in a position to prevent he accession and ought therefore to have be careful by the correctness of he behavior to show no sign of be oppose to it so far from this he be strongly suspect of have enter into correspondence with the widow of nawaji khan who have adopt siraj-ud-daulum 's younger brother -lrb- 72 -rrb- and be support he candidature for the throne and also with saukat jang nawab of purneah and cousin of siraj-ud-daulum who be try to obtain the throne for himself still further he advise mr drake governor of calcutta to give shelter to kissenda son of raj balav -lrb- nawaji khan 's _ diwan _ -rrb- who have flee with the treasure in he charge when he father be call to account for he master 's property contrary to mr watt 's expectation aliverdi khan 's last act so smooth the way for siraj-ud-daulum and the latter act with such decision and promptitude on he grandfather 's death that in a incredibly short time he have all he enemy at he foot and be at leisure to attend to state business and especially the affair of the foreign settlement aliverdus khan have always be extremely jealous of allow the european nation to erect any fortification but during he last illness all of they expect a contest succession during which owe to complication in europe they might find themselves at war with each other in indium begin to repair they old wall or to erect new one this be exactly what siraj-ud-daulum want he first care on he accession have be to make himself master of he grandfather 's and uncle 's treasure to these he have add those of such of he grandfather 's servant as he could readily lay hand on other wealthy noble and officer have flee to the english or be suspect of have secretly send they treasure to calcutta it be also suppose that the european settlement and especially calcutta be fill with the riches accumulate by the foreigner whilst therefore the nawab be determine to make all the european nation contribute largely in honor of he accession and in atonement for they insolence in fortify themselves without he permission he have special reason for begin with the english in the mean time however he have first to settle with he cousin saukat jang the nawab of purneah so he contented himself with send order to the chief of the factory to pull down they new fortification law act wisely and promptly i immediately draw up a _ arzus _ or petition and have one bring from the council in chandernagore of the same tenor as my own these two papers be send to siraj-ud-daulum who appear satisfied with they he even write I in reply that he do not forbid we repair old work but merely we make new one besides the spy who have be send to chandernagore be well receive and satisfy with the present make they submit a report favourable to we so that we business be hush up the english behave very differently and they answer which be bold if not insolent in tone -lrb- 73 -rrb- reach the nawab at the very moment when he have receive the submission of the nawab of purneah law add : -- i be assure that the nawab of purneah show he some letter which he have receive from the english this be difficult to believe but this be how the match take fire accordingly no sooner have the nawab hear the contents of the answer from the english than he jump up in anger and pull out he sword swear he would go and exterminate all the feringhee -lrb- 74 -rrb- at the same time he give order for the march of he army and appoint several jemadar -lrb- 75 -rrb- to command the advance guard as in he first burst of rage he have use the general word feringhee which be apply to all european some friend whom i have in the army and who do not know how we business have end send to warn I to be on my guard as we factory would be besiege the alarm be great with we and with the english at cossimbazar i spend more than twenty-four hour in much anxiety carry wood provision etc into the factory but i soon know what to expect i see horseman arrive and surround the english fort and at the same time i receive a official letter from the nawab tell I not to be anxious and that he be as well pleased with we as he be ill pleased with the english cossimbazar surrender without firing a shot owe to the treacherous advice of the nawab 's general and siraj-ud-daulum advance on calcutta it be with the greatest difficulty that law escape be force to march in he train the remains of the respect which he have formerly feel for european make he afraid of failure in he attack on calcutta which have be represent to he as a very strong place defend by three or four thousand man he write to I in the strongest term to engage the director of chandernagore to give he what assistance he could in man and ammunition ` calcutta be yours ' he say to we agent in full _ durbar _ ' i give you that place and its dependency as the price of the service you will render I i know besides that the english be you enemy you be always at war with they either in europe or on the coromandel coast so i can interpret you refusal only as a sign of the little interest you take in what concern I i be resolve to do you as much good as salabat jang -lrb- 76 -rrb- have do you in the deccan but if you refuse my friendship and the offer i make you you will soon see I fall on you and cause you to experience the same treatment that i be now prepare for other in you favor ' he wish we to send down at once to calcutta all the ship and other vessel which be at chandernagore after have thank he for he favourable disposition towards we i represent to he that we be not at war with the english that what have happen on the coromandel coast be a particular affair which we have settle amicably and that the english in bengal have give we no cause of offence it be impossible for we without order either from europe or pondicherry to give he the assistance he ask for such reason could only excite irritation in the mind of a man of siraj-ud-daulum 's character he swear he would have what he want whether we wish it or not and that as we live in he country he will ought to be law to we i do my best to appease he but uselessly at the moment of he departure he send we word by one of he uncle that he still count on we assistance and he send I a letter for the governor of pondicherry in which he beg he to give we the necessary order i think to myself this be so much time gain the nawab capture calcutta without any open assistance from the french and though he set free most of the prisoner who survive the black hole he send holwell and three other before he to murshidabad law who have already sheltered mr watt and she family and such of the english of cossimbazar as have be able to escape to he now show similar kindness to holwell and he companion of this he say modestly : -- the gratitude mr holwell express for a few little service which i be able to render he make I regret my inability to do as much to deserve he gratitude as i should have like to do -lrb- 77 -rrb- he also apparently with some difficulty obtain consent to m courtin 's request for the release of the english prisoner at dacca for -- siraj-ud-daulum be inform that there be two or three very charming english lady at dacca be strongly tempt to adorn he harem with they law 's success in these matter be a striking instance of he personal influence for siraj-ud-daulum be by no means any longer well disposed towards the french and dutch the fear of draw on he back all the european nation at once have make he politic at first he pretend to be satisfy with the reply send by the governor of chandernagore and assure he that he would always treat we with the greatest kindness he say the same to the dutch but when calcutta be take the mask fall he have nothing more to fear scarcely have he arrive at huglus when he send detachment to chandernagore and chinsurah to summon the commandant to pay contribution or to resolve to see they flag take away and they fort demolish in short we be force to yield what the nawab demand whilst he as he say be content with have punish a nation which have offend he and with have put the other to ransom to pay for the expense of the expedition we see the tyrant reappear in triumph at murshidabad little thinking of the punishment which providence be prepare for he crime and to make which still more striking he be yet to have some further success it may be here point out that not only do the nawab not insist on the destruction of the french and dutch fortification but he do not destroy the fortification of calcutta this prove that if the english have show the humility and readiness to contribute which he desire he would have leave they in peace at the first or after the capture of calcutta have permit they to resettle there without farther disturbance in short the real necessity of make the european nation respect he authority instead of guide he in a settle course merely provide a pretext for satisfy he greed this be the opinion not only of the french and english who be at murshidabad when the trouble begin but of the english official who go there later on and make careful inquiry amongst all class of people in order to ascertain the real reason of siraj-ud-daulum 's attack upon the english he avarice be to prove the nawab 's ruin siraj-ud-daulum be one of the richest nawab that have ever reign without mention he revenue of which he give no account at the court of delhus he possess immense wealth both in gold and silver coin and in jewel and precious stone which have be leave by the precede three nawab in spite of this he think only of increase he wealth if any extraordinary expense have to be meet he order contribution and levy they with extreme rigor have never know himself what it be to want money he suppose that in due proportion money be as common with other people as with himself and that the european especially be inexhaustible he violence towards they be partly due to this in fact from he behavior one would have say he object be to ruin everybody he spare no one not even he relative from whom he take all the pension and all the office which they have hold in the time of aliverdus khan be it possible for such a man to keep he throne those who do not know he intimately when they see he victorious over he enemy and confirm as nawab by a _ firman _ -lrb- 78 -rrb- from the great mogul be force to suppose that there be in he character some great virtue which balance he vice and counteract they effect however this young giddy-pate have no talent for government except that of make himself fear and at the same time pass for the most cowardly of man at first he have show some regard for the officer of the army because until he be recognize as nawab he feel he need of they he have even show generosity but this quality which be quite oppose to he real character soon disappear to make place for violence and greed which decide against he all those who have favor he accession in the hope that he would behave discreetly when he become nawab owe to the general disgust feel at murshidabad for the nawab he cousin saukat jang nawab of purneah think the opportunity favourable for revive he claim and early in October siraj-ud-daula hearing of he contemplated rebellion invade he country every one long for a change and many flattered themselves it would take place in fact it be the most favourable opportunity to procure it the result would have be happiness and tranquillity for bengal whilst contribute to the general good -- which even the dutch might have interested themselves in -- we could have prevent the misfortune which have since happen to we three or four hundred european and a few sepoy would have do the business if we could have join this force to the enemy of siraj-ud-daulum we should have place on the throne another nawab -- not indeed one wholly to we taste but not to worry about trifle one to the liking of the house of jagat seth -lrb- 79 -rrb- and the chief moor and raja i be sure such a nawab would have keep he throne the english would have be re-establish peaceably they would certainly have receive some compensation and would have have to be satisfied whether they like it or not the neutrality of the gange assure at least to the same extent as in the time of aliverdi khan the english would have be prevent from invade bengal and from send thither the reinforcement which have contribute so much to they success on the madras coast all this depend on we but how could we foresee the succession of event which have be as contrary to we as it have be favourable to the english as it be we remain quiet and the rash valor of the young nawab of purneah whilst it deliver siraj-ud-daulum from the only enemy he have to fear in the country make it clear to the whole of bengal that the change so much desire could be effect only by the english mir jafar and other leader of the nawab 's army be about to declare in favor of saukat jang when ramnarain -lrb- 80 -rrb- naib of patna arrive to support siraj-ud-daula whilst the malcontent be hesitate what to do saukat jang make a rash attack on the nawab 's army and be shoot dead in the fight behold he then free by this event from all he inquietude detest it be true but fear even by those who only know he by name in a country where predestination have so much power over the mind the star of siraj-ud-daulum be people say predominant nothing could resist he he be himself persuade of this sure of the good fortune which protect he he abandon himself more than ever to those passion which urge he to the commission of every imaginable form of violence it can be guess what we have to suffer we and the dutch at cossimbazar demand follow demand and insult follow insult on the part of the native officer and soldier for they form they behavior on that of they master think they could not sufficiently show they contempt for everything european we could not go outside of we factory without be expose to annoyance of one kind or another every one in the land turn wistful eye towards the english but they lay inactive at fulta and it seem as if help from madras would never come the english therefore try to bring about a revolution favourable to themselves at murshidabad and begin to look for person who might be induce to undertake it but this be not easy as the moor noble have little acquaintance with the european of the hindu in bengal -- the best inform be the banker and merchant who by they commercial correspondence have be in a position to learn many thing the house of jagat seth for instance be likely to help the english all the more because to its knowledge of they it join several cause of complaint against siraj-ud-daulum up to the death of aliverdi khan it have always enjoy the greatest respect it be this family which have conduct almost all he financial business and it may be say that it have long be the chief cause of all the revolution in bengal but now thing be much change siraj-ud-daulum the most inconsiderate of man never suppose that he would need the assistance of mere banker or that he could ever have any reason to fear they never show they the slightest politeness he want they wealth and some day or other it be certain he would seize it these banker then be the person to serve the english they could by themselves have form a party and even without the assistance of any european have put another nawab upon the throne and re-establish the english but this would have require much time business move very slowly amongst indian and this would not have suit the english the banker also be hindu and of a race which do not like to risk danger to stimulate they to action it be necessary for the english to commence operation and achieve some initial success and as yet there seem no likelihood of they do so to negotiate with siraj-ud-daulum for a peaceful re-establishment be quite as difficult unless they be incline to accept the very hardest condition for the nawab have now the most extravagant contempt for all european a pair of slipper he say be all that be need to govern they just as it seem likely that the english would have to stoop to the nawab 's term they receive news of the despatch of reinforcement from madras about the same time it become know to both french and english that france and england have declare war against each other in the precede may -lrb- 81 -rrb- the english naturally say nothing about it and the french be too eager to see the nawab well beat to put any unnecessary obstacle in they way the negotiation with the friend of the european at murshidabad be quietly continue until admiral watson and colonel clive arrive a rapid advance be then make on calcutta which be capture with hardly any resistance siraj-ud-daulum be so little disturbed by the recapture of calcutta that the french think everything would terminate amicably but possibly owe to the reputation of watson and clive who have so long fight against the french -lrb- 82 -rrb- they think it likely that if the english demand compensation for they loss the nawab would allow they to recoup themselves by seize the french settlement m renault therefore write to law to make sure that in any treaty between the nawab and the english a article should be insert provide for the neutrality of the gange but the french at present be needlessly alarm the english have no intention of creep quietly back into the country watson and clive address haughty letter to the nawab demand reparation for the wrong inflict on the english and the admiral and the council declare war in the name of the king and the company this possibly amuse the nawab who take no notice of they letter but it be a different matter when a small english force sail up the huglus pass chandernagore unopposed by the french capture the fort of hugli burnt huglus -lrb- 83 -rrb- and bandel town and ravage both bank of the river down to calcutta the french be in a awkward position the english have pass chandernagore without a salute which be a unfriendly if not a hostile act whilst the nawab think that as the french have not fire on they they must be in alliance with they law have to bear the brunt of this suspicion he common sense tell he that the english would never consent to a neutrality and he write to renault that it be absolutely necessary to join the moor the neutrality be by no means obligatory as no treaty exist in fact what confidence could we have in a forced neutrality which have be observe so long only out of fear of the nawab who for the general good of the country be unwilling to allow any act of hostility to be commit by the european much more so when the english be at war with the nawab himself if they manage to get the better of he what would become of this fear the sole foundation of the neutrality so law write to renault beg he if he could not persuade the english to sign a treaty of neutrality at once to make up he mind and join the nawab we have see why renault could do neither and law writing after the event say generously enough : -- i be bind to respect the reason which determine m renault as well as the gentleman of the council who be all much too good citizen not to have keep constantly in they mind the welfare of we nation and the company people always do see thing differently and the event do not always prove the correctness or incorrectness of the reason which have decide we to take one or the other course as soon as the nawab hear of the plundering of huglus he set out for calcutta but to blind the english he request m renault to mediate between they the english refusal to treat through the french have the effect of clear up matter between the latter and the nawab but he could not understand why the french would not actively assist he certain at any rate that he have only the english to deal with he foolishly play into they hand by march to fight they on they own ground whereas if he have remain idle at a little distance merely forbid supplies to be send they he could have starve they out of calcutta in a few month as i have say before clive attack he camp on the 5th of February and so terrify he that he consent to a shameful peace in which he forget all mention of the neutrality of the gange law tell a curious story to the effect that what frighten the nawab most of all be a letter from admiral watson threaten to make he a prisoner and carry he to england watson 's letter be extant and contain no such threat but it be quite possible that it be so interpret to the nawab though the nawab have assure the english that he would have the same friend and enemy as they and have omit to mention the french in the treaty he now of he own accord give the french all that the english have extort from he this act could not be keep secret a great fault at present and which have always exist in the management of affair in indium especially in bengal be that nothing be secret scarcely have the nawab form any project when it be know to the lowest of he slave the english who be suspicious and who have for friend every one who be a enemy of siraj-ud-daulum whom all detest be soon inform of he proposal to m renault and of the letter write on both side yet law think it be only the european war and the fear that renault intend a alliance with the nawab that induce the english to proceed to extremity : -- the dethronement of the nawab have become a absolute necessity to drive we out of bengal be only a preliminary piece of work a squadron of ours with considerable force might arrive siraj-ud-daulum might join he force to it what then would become of the english they need for nawab a man attach to they interest besides this revolution be not so difficult to carry out as one might imagine with chandernagore destroy nothing could be more easy but even if we be leave alone the revolution could have be effect by the junction of the english with the force which would have be produce against siraj-ud-daulum by the crowd of enemy whom he have and amongst whom be to be count the most respectable person in the three province -lrb- 84 -rrb- this statement demand a explanation i have already speak of the house of jagat seth or rather of its chief who be name seth mahtab raus and seth sarup chand banker of the mogul the richest and most powerful merchant who have ever live they be i can say the _ mover _ of the revolution without they the english would never have carry out what they have i have already say they be not please with siraj-ud-daulum who do not show they the same respect as the old nawab aliverdus khan have do but the arrival of the english force the capture of the moorish fort and the fright of the nawab before calcutta have make a change which be apparently in they favor the nawab begin to perceive that the banker be necessary to he the english would have no one except they as mediator and so they have become as it be responsible for the behavior of both the nawab and the english accordingly after the peace there be nothing but kindness and politeness from the nawab towards they and he consult they in everything at the bottom this behavior of he be sheer trickery the seth be persuade that the nawab who hate the english must also dislike the person whom the english employ profit by the hatred which the nawab have draw on himself by he violence and distribute money judiciously they have long since gain over those who be nearest to the nawab whose imprudence always enable they to know what he have in he heart from what come to the knowledge of the seth it be easy to guess what he intend and this make they tremble for it be nothing less than they destruction which could be avert only by he own the cause of the english have become that of the seth they interest be identical can one be surprise to see they act in concert further when one remember that it be this same house of banker that overthrow sarfaraz khan -lrb- 85 -rrb- to enthrone aliverdus khan and who during the reign of the latter have the management of all important business one must confess that it ought not to be difficult for person of so much influence to execute a project in which the english be take a share -lrb- 86 -rrb- law could not persuade renault to act and without he do so the game be nearly hopeless still he work at form a french party in the court by means of coja wajid a armenian merchant of hugli whose property have be plunder by the english he obtain a interview with the nawab and persuade he to send the 2000 soldier who be with renault at the beginning of the siege more would have be despatch but for the apparent certainty that the treaty of neutrality would be sign in fact renault be so worried that on the complaint of watson and clive that law be exciting the nawab against the english he write law a letter which cause the latter to ask to be recall from cossimbazar and it be only at renault 's earnest request that he consent to remain at he post law continue form he party it would appear from the english memoirs that we corrupt the whole _ durbar _ at murshidabad to we side by present and lie i might with justice retort this reproach as a matter of fact except siraj-ud-daula himself one may say the english have the whole _ durbar _ always in they favor without insist on this point let we honestly agree since the english themselves confess it that we be like they much engage in oppose corruption to corruption in order to gain the friendship of scoundrel so as to place ourselves on equal term with we enemy this have always happen and ought not to cause surprise in a court where right count for nothing and every other motive apart one can never be successful except by the weight of what one put in the balance of iniquity for the rest right or wrong it be certain that the english be always in a position to put in more than we could fear and greed be the two chief motive of indian mind everything depend on one or the other often they be combine towards the same object but when they be oppose fear always conquer a proof of this be easily to be see in all the event connect with the revolution in bengal when in 1756 siraj-ud-daula determine to expel the english fear and greed combine to make he act as soon as he have himself prove the superiority of the english troops fear take the upper hand in he mind grow stronger day by day and soon put he in a condition in which he be unable to follow and often even to see he true interest i mention the nawab first he hatred for the english certainly indicate friendship for we i think so myself but we have see what be he character and he state of mind in general i ask in all good faith whether we could expect any advantage from he friendship this person cow by fear irresolute and imprudent could he alone be of any use to we it be necessary for he to be support by some one who have he confidence and be capable by he own firmness of fix the irresolution of the prince mohan lal chief _ diwan _ of siraj-ud-daulum be this man the greatest scoundrel the earth have ever bear worthy minister of such a master and yet in truth the only person who be really attach to he he have firmness and also sufficient judgment to understand that the ruin of siraj-ud-daulum must necessarily bring on he own he be as much detest as he master the swear enemy of the seth and capable of hold he own against they i think those banker would not have succeed so easily in they project if he have be free to act but unfortunately for we he have be for some time and be at this most critical moment dangerously ill he could not leave he house i go to see he twice with siraj-ud-daulum but it be not possible to get a word from he there be strong reason to believe he have be poison owe to this siraj-ud-daulum see himself deprive of he only support coja wajid who have introduce I to the nawab and who it would be natural to suppose be we patron be a great merchant of huglus he be consult by the nawab only because as he have frequent the european and especially the english the nawab imagine he know they perfectly he be one of the most timid of man who want to be polite to everybody and who have he see the dagger raise would have think he might offend siraj-ud-daulum by warn he that some one intend to assassinate he -lrb- 87 -rrb- possibly he do not love the seth but he fear they which be sufficient to make he useless to we rai durlabh ram the other _ diwan _ of the nawab be the man to whom i be bind to trust most before the arrival of clive he might have be think the enemy of the english it be he who pretend to have beat they and to have take calcutta he wish he say to maintain he reputation but after the affair of the 5th of February in which the only part he take be to share in the flight he be not the same man he fear nothing so much as to have to fight the english this fear dispose he to gradually come to term with the seth of whose greatness he be very jealous he also hate the nawab by whom he have be ill-use on many occasion in short i could never get he to say a single word in we favor in the _ durbar _ the fear of compromise himself make he decide to remain neutral for the present though firmly resolve to join finally the side which appear to he to be the strongest this then be the french party whose sole bond be dislike to the seth and the member of which by timidity or ill-health be unable to act it be different with they enemy the english have on they side in the _ durbar _ the terror of they arm the fault of siraj-ud-daulum the ruling influence and the refined policy of the seth who to conceal they game more completely and know that it please the nawab often speak all the ill they could think of about the english so as to excite he against they and at the same time gain he confidence the nawab fall readily into the snare and say everything that come into he mind thus enable he enemy to guard against all the evil which otherwise he might have manage to do they the english have also on they side all the chief officer in the nawab 's army -- jafar all khan khodadad khan latty and a number of other who be attach to they by they present or the influence of the seth all the minister of the old court whom siraj-ud-daulum have disgrace nearly all the secretary -lrb- 88 -rrb- the writer -lrb- 89 -rrb- of the _ durbar _ and even the eunuch of the harem what might they not expect to achieve by the union of all these force when guide by so skilful a man as mr watt with such enemy to combat in the court itself law hear that the english be march on chandernagore by the most painful effort he obtain order for reinforcement to be send to the french they -- be ready to start the soldier have be pay the commandant -lrb- 90 -rrb- wait only for final order i go to see he and promise he a large sum if he succeed in raise the siege of chandernagore i also visit several of the chief officer to whom i promise reward proportionate to they rank i represent to the nawab that chandernagore must be certainly capture if the reinforcement do not set out at once and i try to persuade he to give he order to the commandant in my presence ` all be ready ' reply the nawab ` but before resort to arm it be proper to try all possible means to avoid a rupture and all the more so as the english have just promise to obey the order i shall send they ' -lrb- 91 -rrb- i recognize the hand of the seth in these detail they encourage the nawab in a false impression about this affair on the one hand they assure he that the march of the english be only to frighten we into subscribe to a treaty of neutrality and on the other hand they increase he natural timidity by exaggerate the force of the english and by represent the risk he run in assist we with reinforcement which would probably not prevent the capture of chandernagore if the english be determine to take it but would serve as a reason for the english to attack the nawab himself they manage so well that they destroy in the evening all the effect i have produce in the morning i resolve to visit the banker they immediately commence talk about we debt and call my attention to the want of punctuality in we payment i say that this be not the question just now and that i come to they upon a much more interesting matter which however concern they as well as we with respect to those very debt for which they be ask payment and security i ask why they support the english against we they deny it and after much explanation they promise to make any suggestion i wish to the nawab they add that they be quite sure the english would not attack we and that i might remain tranquil know that they be well acquaint with the design of the english i tell they i know as well as they do what these be and that i see no way of prevent they from attack chandernagore except by hasten the despatch of the reinforcement which the nawab have promise and that as they be dispose to serve I i begged they to make the nawab understand the same they reply that the nawab wish to avoid any rupture with the english and they say many other thing which only show I that in spite of they good will they would do nothing for we ranjit raus who be they man of business as well as the agent of the english say to I in a mock tone ` you be a frenchman be you afraid of the english if they attack you defend yourselve no one be ignorant of what you nation have do on the madras coast and we be curious to see how you will come off in this business here ' i tell he i do not expect to find such a warlike person in a bengali merchant and that sometimes people repent of they curiosity that be enough for such a fellow but i see clearly that the laugh would not be on my side however every one be very polite and i leave the house law think the seth honestly believe that the english march on chandernagore be merely intend to frighten the french and as a proof of they friendliness narrate a further incident of this visit : -- the conversation have turn on siraj-ud-daulum on the reason he have give the seth to fear he and on he violent character i say i understand clearly enough what they mean and that they certainly want to set up another nawab the seth instead of deny this contented themselves with say in a low voice that this be a subject which should not be talk about omichand the english agent -lrb- 92 -rrb- -lrb- who by the way cry ` away with they ' wherever he go -rrb- be present if the fact have be false the seth would certainly have deny it and would have reproach I for talk in such a way if they have even think i intend to thwart they they would also have deny it but consider all that have happen the vexation cause we by the nawab and we obstinate refusal to help he they imagine that we should be just as content as they be to see he depose provide only the english would leave we in peace in fact they do not as yet regard we as enemy law be however ignorant that clive have already promise or do so soon after to give the property of the french company to the seth in payment of the money the french owe they but he now for the first time fully realize the gravity of the situation the indiscretion of the seth show he the whole extent of the plot and the same evening he tell the nawab but -- the poor young man begin to laugh not be able to imagine i could be so foolish as to indulge in such idea and yet whilst he refuse to believe in the treason of he officer the nawab indulge at time in the most violent outbreak of temper against they siraj-ud-daulum be not master of himself -lrb- 93 -rrb- it would have need as much firmness in he character as there be deceitfulness to make the latter quality of use to he at certain time he natural disposition overmaster he especially when in he harem surround by he wife and servant when he be accustom to say openly all that be in he heart sometimes this happen to he in full _ durbar _ the same evening also mr watt come to the _ durbar _ and the matter of the neutrality be talk over the nawab wish the two gentleman to pledge they respective nation to keep the peace but mr watt skilfully avoid give any promise and suggest the nawab should write to the admiral law see that further delay be aim at exclaim that the admiral would pay as little respect to this letter as to the nawab 's previous one ` how ' say the nawab look angrily at I instead of at mr watt : ` who be i then ' all the member of he court cry out together that he order would certainly be attend to as law expect chandernagore be attack before the admiral 's reply be receive law receive the news on the 15th and hurry to the nawab reinforcement be order and counter-order at midnight the nawab 's eunuch come to inform law that the english have be repulse with loss and on the morning of the 16th the nawab 's troops be order to advance but when the same day news come that the french have withdraw into the fort every one cry out that the fort must fall and that it be mere folly to incense the english by send down troops they be immediately recall then news arrive that the fort be hold out and rai durlabh ram be order to advance again there come a false report that the fort have fall law know raus durlabh be a coward and he whole reliance be on the second in command mir madan : -- a capable officer and one who would have attack the enemy with pleasure this mir madan be say to have be a hindu convert to muhammadanism native poem still tell of the gallantry with which he command the hindu soldier of the nawab he be one of the first to fall at plassey and though it can not be say that he death cause the loss of the battle it be certain that it put a end to all chance of the victory be contest law be at he wit ' end it be no time to stick at trifle and that he might know the worst at once he intercept mr watt 's letter from they he gather that the english intend to march straight upon murshidabad he set about fortify the enclosure round the french factory and as he have only 10 or 12 man he induce the nawab to send he a native officer with 100 musketeer he soon learn that the report english advance be merely the pursuit of the fugitive from chandernagore who be mention in the last chapter by the end of march he have 60 european : -- of whom the half in truth be not fit to serve but what do that matter the number be worth 120 to I outside the fort since rumor always delight in exaggeration of the sepoy also whom the english set free some 30 find they way to law and so far be he now from be afraid of mr watt that it be the latter who have to ask the nawab 's protection the vacillation which have mark the nawab 's conduct previous to the fall of chandernagore still continue he protect law but would not help he with money further at the solicitation of my enemy the nawab send people to pull down the earthwork i have erect he even wish the native agent of the english to be present in my life i have never suffer what i do that day to the order of the nawab i reply that so long as i be in the factory no foreigner should touch my fortification but that to keep my agreement with he i be ready to withdraw and to make over the factory to he with which he could afterwards do as he like and for which i should hold he responsible at the same time i make my whole troop arm themselves and have have my munitions load on cart for several day previous i prepare to depart with the small amount of money which belong to I and to a few other individual the nawab 's officer see my resolution and fear to do anything which might not be approve postpone the execution of he order and inform the nawab of what be happen he reply that he absolutely forbid my leave the factory and order the pioneer to be send away but at the same time he inform I that it be absolutely necessary for I to pull down the earthwork that under the present circumstance he have himself to do many thing contrary to he own wish that by refuse to obey i should draw the english upon he and upon we that we could not defend ourselves and must therefore submit that i should not be trouble any more and that finally he would give I money enough to build in brick what i have wish to make in earth i know well the value of he promise but i be force to humor he it do not suit I to abandon the factory altogether so i set my workman to pull down what i have build and the same night the work be finish the english now try to win over the french soldier and have some success for many of they be deserter from the british force and they quickly see how precarious be the shelter which law could afford they but the nawab could not be persuade to force law to surrender and though he agree to leave the country law declare he would not do even that unless he receive passport and money on the 8th of April he receive passport and be promise that if he would go to phulbari near patna he should there receive all he want he be allow four or five day to make he preparation i profit by this interval to persuade the only man who dare speak for we to get to action this be the nazir dalal a man of no importance but at the same time a man in whom the nawab appear to have some confidence as he be constantly at the factory i have opportunity of tell he many thing of particular interest to the nawab and i believe that by politeness and present i have bring he over to we interest a little later however i learn that he receive quite as much from the english as from we he tell the nawab all that he learn from I _ viz _ the view of the english and of the seth and the risk he himself be run and he bring to he notice that the english be steadily increase they garrison at cossimbazar by bring up soldier who pretend they be deserter and wish to pass over to the trench by this trick indeed many soldier have pass through the moorish camp without be stop there be also talk of a english fleet prepare to come up and wait only for the nawab 's permission the nazir dalal represent to he that the trading boat might be load with ammunition and that they ought to be strictly search and the cask and barrel open as gun and mortar might be find in they the nawab open he eye at information of this kind and promptly send the nazir dalal to tell I not to leave this order come on the 10th of April i accordingly pass my garrison in review before the nawab 's agent and a statement show the monthly pay of each officer and soldier be send to the nawab who promise to pay they accordingly on the 12th of April law receive a sudden summons to attend the _ durbar _ the next day after some reflection i determine to obey i think that by take present i could avoid the inconvenience i fear so i arrange to start early on the morning of the 13th with five

determine to have a good understanding with the english he would force I to accept they they then ask what i intend to do i say i intend to stay at cossimbazar and to oppose to the utmost of my power the ambitious design of the english ` well well what can you do ' they reply ` you be about a hundred european the nawab have no need of you you will certainly be force to leave this place it would be much better to accept the term offer you by mr watt ' the same person who have beg I to do this then take mr watt aside i do not know what they say to each other but a quarter of a hour after they go into the hall where the nawab be i be in the utmost impatience to know the result of all these parleying so much the more as from some word that have escape they i have reason to think they intend to arrest I fire or six minute after mr watt have go to the nawab the _ arzbegus _ accompany by some officer and the agent of the seth and the english come and tell I aloud in the presence of some fifty person of rank that the nawab order I to submit myself entirely to what mr watt demand i tell he i would not and that it be impossible for the nawab to have give such a order i demand to be present to

he ask mr watt to withdraw and wait for he in a cabinet the order to appear be give I i wish to go -- another difficulty the officer with I do not wish to let I go alone a great debate between they and the nawab 's officer at last give way to my entreaty and on my assure they that i have no fear i persuade they to be quiet and to let I go i present myself before the nawab who return my salute in a kindly manner as soon as i be seat he tell I in a shamefaced way that i must either accept mr watt 's proposal or must certainly leave he territory _ you nation be the cause _ he say _ of all the importunity i now suffer from the english i do not wish to put the whole country in trouble for you sake you be not strong enough to defend yourselve you must give way you ought to remember that when i have need of you assistance you always refuse it you ought not to expect assistance from I now _ it must be confess that after all we behavior to he i have not much to reply i notice however that the nawab keep he eye cast down and that it be as it be against he will that he pay I this compliment i tell he i should be dishonour if i accept mr watt 's proposal but that as he be absolutely determine to expel we from he country i be ready to withdraw and that as soon as i have the necessary passport i would go towards patna at this every one in concert except the nawab and coja wajid cry out that i could not take that road that the nawab would not consent to it i ask what road they wish I to take they say i must go towards midnapur or cuttack i answer that the english might at any moment march in that direction and fall upon I they reply i must get out of the difficulty as best i could the nawab meanwhile keep he face bent down listen attentively but say nothing wish to force

betel -lrb- 95 -rrb- and go out gholam husain khan say that the nawab be much affect at parting with law as he now believe in the truth of he warning against the english and the english party -- but as he do not dare to keep he in he service for fear of offend the english he tell he that at present it be fit that he should depart but that if anything new should happen he would send for he again ' _ send for I again _ ' answer law ' _ rest assure my lord nawab that this be the last time we shall see each other remember my word : we shall never meet again it be nearly impossible _ law hurry back to he factory and by the evening of the 15th of April he be ready to depart the same day the nawab write to clive : -- mr law i have put out of the city and have write expressly to my naib -lrb- 96 -rrb- at patna to turn he and he attendant out of the bound of he subaship and that he shall not suffer they to stay in any place within it -lrb- 97 -rrb- at the end of April the nawab write to abdulla khan the afghan general at delhus that he have supply law with rs10000 clive be quickly inform of this on the morning of the 16th the french march through murshidabad with color fly and drum beat prepare against any surprise in the narrow street of the city mr watt write to clive : -- they have 100 european 60 tellingee 30 _ hackery _ -lrb- ie bullock-waggon -rrb- and 4 elephant with they -lrb- 98 -rrb- close on they track follow two spy send by mr watt to try and seduce the french soldier and sepoy law leave a m bugro behind in charge of the french factory shortly after leave cossimbazar law be reinforce by a party of 45 man mostly sailor of the _ saint contest _ who have manage to escape from the english on the 2nd of may the french arrive at bhagulpur the nawab write to they to move on whenever he hear they be halt and not to go so fast when he hear they be on the march to satisfy he we should have be always in motion and yet not advance this do not suit we it be of the utmost importance to arrive at some place where i could find means for the equipment of my troop we be destitute of everything these contradictory order and even letter of recall reach law on he march but though he send back m sinfray with letter to m bugro and coja wajid -- which the latter afterwards make over to clive -- he continue he march to patna where he arrive on the 3rd of June and be well receive by raja ramnarain and where he be within four or five day ' march or sail from sooty the mouth of the murshidabad or cossimbazar river and therefore in a position to join the nawab whenever it might be necessary in the mean time fate have avenge law on one of he lesser enemy this be that ranjit raus who have insult he during he interview with the seth the latter have pursue they old policy of incite the english to make extravagant demand which they at the same time urge the nawab to refuse to justify one such demand the english produce a letter in the handwriting of ranjit raus purport to be write at the dictation of the seth under instruction from the nawab the latter deny the instruction and the seth promptly assert that the whole letter be a forgery of they agent 's the notorious ranjit raus be drive in disgrace from the _ durbar _ banish and assassinate on the road it be say he have receive 2 lakh from the english to apply he master ' seal unknown to they i can hardly believe this this agent be attach to the english only because he know the seth be devote to they this incident warn the seth to be more cautious but still the plot against the nawab be well know in the country renault who have be at this time a prisoner in calcutta say : -- never be a conspiracy conduct as publicly and with such indiscretion as this be both by the moor and the english nothing else be talk about in all the english settlement and whilst every place echo with the noise of it the nawab who have a number of spy be ignorant of everything nothing can prove more clearly the general hatred which be feel towards he -lrb- 99 -rrb- m sinfray have return to murshidabad but could not obtain a interview with the nawab till the 8th of June when he find he still absolutely tranquil and even on the 10th the nawab write to law to have no fear on he account but this letter do not reach law till the 19th i complain of the delay in the strongest term to ramnarain who receive the packet from the nawab but it be quite useless the nawab be betray by those whom he think most attach to he the faujdar of rajmehal use to stop all he messenger and detain they as long as he think fit this officer be a brother of mir jafar -lrb- 100 -rrb- the seth and the english have long find the chief difficulty in they way to be the choice of a man of sufficient distinction to replace siraj-ud-daulum on the throne at this moment the nawab himself give they as a leader mir jafar alus khan who have marry the sister of aliverdus khan and be therefore a relative of he mir jafar be _ bukshus _ or paymaster and generalissimo of the army and he influence have greatly contribute to siraj-ud-daulum 's peaceful accession he be a man of good reputation and a brave and skilful soldier it be such a person as this that the nawab after a long course of petty insult see fit to abuse in the vilest term in full _ durbar _ and to dismiss summarily from he post he now listen to the proposal of the seth and towards the end of April term be settle between he and the english -lrb- 101 -rrb- the actual conclusion of the treaty take place early in June and on the 13th of that month mr watt and the other english gentleman at cossimbazar escape under the pretence of a hunting expedition and join clive in safety as soon as he hear of this the nawab know that war be inevitable and it have come at a moment when he have disband half he army unpaid and the other half be grumble for arrears not only have he insult mir jafar but he have also manage to quarrel with raus durlabh instead of try to postpone the conflict until he have crush these two dangerous enemy he beg they to be reconcile to he and put himself in they hand letter after letter be send to recall law but even the first despatch on the 13th do not reach law till the 22nd owing to the treachery of the faujdar of rajmehal law 's letter entreat the nawab to await he arrival certainly never reach he and though law have start at the first rumor of danger before get the nawab 's letter he do not reach rajmehal till the 1st of July the nawab have be capture in the neighborhood a few hour before the arrival of he advance-guard gholam husain khan say that law would have be in time have the nawab 's last remittance be a bill of exchange and not a order on the treasury for -- as slowness of motion seem to be of etiquette with the people of hindustan the disbursing of the money take up so much time that when m law be come down as far rajmehal he find that all be over law who be nothing if not philosophical remark on this disappointment : -- in save siraj-ud-daulum we should have score a great success but possibly he would have be save for a short time only he would have find enemy and traitor wherever he might have present himself in the country suppose to be subject to he no one would have acknowledge he force by mir jafar and the english to flee to a foreign country he would have be a burden to we rather than a assistance in indium no one know what it be to stand by a unfortunate man the first idea which suggest itself be to plunder he of the little -lrb- 102 -rrb- which remain to he besides a character like that of siraj-ud-daulum could nowhere find a real friend siraj-ud-daulum defeat by clive at plassey on the 23rd of June be say scrafton -- himself one of the first that carry the news of he defeat to the capital which he reach that night he wisest councillor urge he to surrender to clive but he think this advice treacherous and determine to flee towards rajmehal when nearly there he be recognize by a fakir -lrb- 103 -rrb- whose ear he have some time before order to be cut off the fakir inform the faujdar who seize he and send he to murshidabad where miran mir jafar 's son put he to death on the 4th of July it be necessary for law to withdraw as quickly as possible if he be to preserve he liberty clive and mir jafar write urgent letter to ramnarain at patna to stop he but ramnarain be no lover of mir jafar and he be not yet acquaint with clive so he allow he to pass law say : -- on the 16th of July we arrive at dinapur eight mile above patna where i soon see we have no time to lose the raja of patna himself would not have trouble we much by means of we boat we could have avoid he as we please for though we fleet be in a very bad condition still it could have hold its own against the naval force of bengal ie the indian force but the english be advance command by major coote as the english call themselves the master of the aquatic element it become we the less to wait for they when we know they have stronger and more numerous boat than we have possibly we could have outsail they but we do not wish to give they the pleasure of see we flee on the 18th instant a order from the raja instruct I in the name of mir jafar to halt -- no doubt to wait for the english -- whilst another on he own part advise I to hurry off some small detachment of horseman appear along the bank apparently to hinder we from get provision or to lay violent hand on the boatman on this we set sail resolve to quit all the dependency of bengal in spite of ourselves we have to halt at chupra twenty-two mile higher up because we rower refuse to go further : prayer and threat all seem useless i think the english have find some means to gain they over the boat do not belong to we but we should have have little scruple in seize they have we european know how to manage they unfortunately they know nothing about it the boat in bengal have no keel and consequently do not carry sail well so we lose two day in discussion with the boatman but at last by double they pay term be make and five day after on the 25th of July we arrive at ghazipur the first place of importance in the province of suja-ud-daula viceroy of the subah of oudh lucknow and allahabad before law leave rajmehal on he return to patna the faujdar try to stop he on pretence that mir jafar wish to reconcile he to the english law think this unlikely yet know the native proclivity for underhand intrigue he write he a letter but the answer which he receive at chupra be merely a order to surrender law say : -- i have a idea that he might write to I in a quite different style _ unknown to the english _ i know the new nawab whom i meet at the time i be solicit reinforcement to raise the siege of chandernagore he have not then take up the idea of make himself nawab he appear to I a very intelligent man and much inclined to do we service pity we greatly for have to work with a man so cowardly and undecided as siraj-ud-daula law think he communication -- be well calculate to excite in he mind sentiment favourable to we but if it do mir jafar let none of they appear the revolution be too recent and the influence of the english too great for he to risk the least correspondence with we from clive on the other hand he receive a letter -- such as become a general who though a enemy interested himself in we fate out of humanity know by he own experience into what peril and fatigue we be go to throw ourselves when we leave the european settlement this letter date murshidabad July 9th be as follow : -- as the country people be now all become you enemy and order be go everywhere to intercept you passage and i myself have send party in quest of you and order be go to ramnarain the naib of patna to seize you if you pursue that road you must be sensible if you fall into they hand you can not expect to find they a generous enemy if therefore you have any regard for the man under you command i would recommend you to treat with we from whom you may expect the most favourable term in my power to grant -lrb- 104 -rrb- law do not say much about the hardship of he flight but eyre coote who command the detachment which follow he have the utmost difficulty in persuade he man to advance and write to clive that he have never know soldier expose to greater hardship at patna eyre coote seize the french factory where the chief m de la bretesche be lie ill the military and other company 's servant have go on with law leave in charge a person variously call m innocent and innocent jesus he be not a frenchman but nevertheless he be send down to calcutta from patna eyre coote get as far as chupra only to find law safe beyond the frontier at ghazipur and nothing leave for he to do but to return from now on to January 1761 law be out of the reach of the english living precariously on supplies send from bussy in the south from he wife at chinsurah and from a secret store which m de la bretesche have establish at patna unknown to the english and upon loan raise from wealthy native such as the raja of bettiah he believe all along that the french would soon make a effort to invade bengal where there be a large native party in they favor and where he could assist they by create a diversion in the north i shall touch on he adventure very briefly he first halt be at benare which he reach on the 2nd of August and where the raja bulwant singh try to wheedle and frighten he into surrender he gun he escape out of he hand by sheer bluff and go on to chunargarh where he receive letter from suja-ud-daula nawab of oudh a friend of siraj-ud-daulum 's whom he hope to persuade into invade bengal on the 3rd of September he reach allahabad and here leave he troop under the command of m le comte de carryon whilst he go on to lucknow the capital of oudh it be only at this moment that law bethink he of describe he troop it consist of 175 european and 100 sepoy drill in european fashion the officer be d'hurvillier le comte de carryon -lrb- who have bring a detachment from dacca before law leave cossimbazar -rrb- ensign brayer -lrb- who have command the military at patna -rrb- ensign jobard -lrb- who have escape from chandernagore -rrb- and ensign martin de la case he also entertain as officer mm debellême -lrb- captain of a french east indiaman -rrb- boissemont and la ville martère company 's servant -lrb- these three have all escape from chandernagore -rrb- dangereux and duboi -lrb- company 's servant station at cossimbazar -rrb- beinge -lrb- a company 's servant station at patna -rrb- and two private gentleman kerdizien and gourbin besides these mm anquetil du perron -lrb- 105 -rrb- la rue desjoux villequain desbross and calvé serve as volunteer he chaplain be the reverend father onofre and he have two surgeon duboi and le page the last two be probably the surgeon of cossimbazar and patna he have also with he m lenoir second of patna whose acquaintance with the language and the people be invaluable law seem to have be always able to recruit he sepoy but he have no great opinion of they in fact it may be say that the sepoy be a singular animal especially until he have have time to acquire a proper sense of discipline as soon as he have receive he red jacket and he gun he think he be a different man he look upon himself as a european and have a very high estimation of this qualification he think he have the right to despise all the country people whom he treat as kaffir and wretched negro though he be often just as black as they be in every place i have be i have remark that the inhabitant have less fear of the european soldier who in he disorderly behavior sometimes show a amount of generosity which they would expect in vain from a sepoy law have leave the follow description of lucknow : -- lucknow capital of the subah -lrb- 106 -rrb- so call be 160 mile north of allahabad on the other side of the gange and about 44 mile from that river the country be beautiful and of great fertility but what can one expect from the best land without cultivation it be particularly the fate of this province and of a large portion of oudh to have be exhaust by the war of mansur alus khan -lrb- 107 -rrb- that prince at he death leave the treasury empty and a quantity of debt suja-ud-daula he successor think he could satisfy he creditor all of they officer of the army by give they order upon several of the large estate this method be too slow for these military gentleman in a short time every officer have become the farmer -lrb- 108 -rrb- or rather the tyrant of the village abandon to he forcible execution quickly reimburse he to a extent greater than he claim but the country suffer the ill-used inhabitant leave it and the land remain uncultivated this might have be repair the good order establish by suja-ud-daulum commence to bring the inhabitant back when a evil against which human prudence be powerless achieve they total destruction for two whole year cloud of locust traverse the country regularly with the monsoon -lrb- 109 -rrb- and reduce the hope of the cultivator to nothing when two day from lucknow we ourselves see the ravages commit by this insect it be perfect weather suddenly we see the sky overcast a darkness like that of a total eclipse spread itself abroad and last a good hour in less than no time we see the tree under which we be camp strip of they leaf the next day as we journey we see that the same devastation have be produce for a distance of ten mile the grass on the road and every green thing in the field be eat away down to the root this recurrent plague have drive away the inhabitant even those who have survive the exaction of the military town and village be abandon the small number of people who remain -- i be speak without exaggeration -- only serve to augment the horror of this solitude we see nothing but spectre the state of the people of lucknow city the residence of the nawab be hardly better the evil be perhaps less evident owe to the variety of object but from what one could see from time to time nature do not suffer less the environs of the palace be cover with poor sick people lie in the middle of the road so that it be impossible for the nawab to go out without cause he elephant to tread on the body of several of they except when he have the patience to wait and have they clear out of the way -- a act which would not accord with oriental idea of grandeur in spite of this there be few accident the animal use to guide its footstep so as to show it be more friendly to human being than man themselves be at lucknow suja-ud-daulum greet he with a sympathetic interest which law quaintly liken to that show by dido for aenea but money be not forthcoming and law soon find that suja-ud-daulum be not on sufficiently good term with the mogul 's -lrb- 110 -rrb- vizir -lrb- 111 -rrb- at delhus to risk a attack on bengal on the 18th of October he return to allahabad with the intention of go to delhi to see what he could do with the vizir but as it might have be dangerous to disclose he object he pretend he be go to march south to bussy in the deccan and obtain a passport from the maratha general holkar this take some time and it be not till march 1758 that he start for delhus he reach farukhabad without difficulty and on the 21st enter the country of the jat on the evening of the 23rd a barber who come into they camp warn the french they would be attack the next day the jat to the number of 20000 attack they on the march the fight last the whole day and the french fire 6000 musket shot and 800 cannon the cannon-ball be make of clay mould round a pebble and be find sufficiently effective in the level country soon after they arrive at delhus only to find the maratha master of the situation and in actual possession of the person of the shahzada or crown prince -lrb- 112 -rrb- the prince be friendly give law money and eagerly welcome the idea of attack bengal but he be himself practically a prisoner the vizir too could do nothing and would give no money the maratha amuse he with promise and try to trap he into fight they battle no one seem to know anything about what have happen in bengal he speak to several of the chief man about the english i feel sure that after the revolution in bengal they would be the only subject of conversation in the capital the revolution have make much noise but it be ascribe entirely to the seth and to rai durlabh ram clive 's name be well know he be they say a great captain whom the seth have bring from very far at a great expense to deliver bengal from the tyranny of siraj-ud-daulum as salabat jang have engage m bussy to keep the maratha in order many of the principal person even ask I what country he come from other mix up all european together think that i be a deputy from clive it be useless for I to say we be enemy that it be the english who have do everything in bengal that it be they who govern and not jafar alus khan who be only nawab in name no one would believe I in fact how could one persuade people who have never see a race of man different from they own that a body of two or three thousand european at the most be able to dictate the law in a country as large as bengal law could do nothing at delhus and it be only by bribe the maratha general that he obtain a escort through the jat country to agra most of he soldier be glad to be off but about 60 european desert with they arm to delhi where the vizir offer they pay as high as 50 rupee a month m jobard be nearly kill by some of they when he try to persuade they to return to duty but a few month after more than half rejoin law from agra law go to chatrapur in bundelkand where apparently though he do not say so he be in the service of the raja indrapat he stay last from the 10th of June 1758 to February 1759 in order to keep on good term with the inhabitant who be almost all hindu law forbid he man to kill cattle or any of the sacred bird or to borrow anything without he permission and at the same time severely punish all disorderly behavior the people have never hear of christian think the french must be a kind of muhammadan but they could not make out from what country they come see they drink a red wine of which they have a few bottle they think they be drink blood and be horrify but the good behavior of the man soon put they on friendly term early in 1759 the shahzada at last invade bengal and on the 5th of February law march to join he but the invasion be badly manage and be a absolute failure on the 28th of may law be back at chatrapur the only result of the invasion be that the land of a number of raja in bihar be plunder by miran son of mir jafar and the english these raja be all hindu they have a understanding with ramnarain all these raja of whom there be a great number in the dependency of bengal unite to each other by the same religion mutually support each other as much as they can they detest the muhammadan government and if it have not be for the seth the famous banker with whom they have close connection it be probable that after the revolution in which siraj-ud-daulum be the victim they would all have rise together to establish a hindu government from which the english would not have obtain all the advantage they do from the muhammadan in 1759 the dutch risk a quarrel with the english they refuse however any assistance from law who far away as he be hear all about it they be defeat at biderra on the 25th of November the effect of this be to reduce bengal to such tranquillity that clive consider it safe to visit england the shahzada however think the opportunity a favourable one for another invasion and on the 28th of February 1760 law again start to join he patna be besiege and accord to broome be very nearly capture owe to law 's skill and the courage of he frenchman in fact the french be on the rampart when dr fullerton and the english sepoy arrive just in time to drive they back -lrb- 113 -rrb- the siege be raise and the prince 's general kamgar khan lead the army about the country with apparently no object but that of plunder this suit the maratha but do not suit law on one occasion he be order with he own troops and a body of maratha to capture the little fort of soupy the french storm it at three o'clock in the morning but find that the maratha who have carefully avoid the breach have swarm the wall where there be no one to oppose they and be carry off the plunder my chief occupation and that of the officer for more than five hour during which we stay in soupy be to keep we soldier and sepoy from bayonet the maratha who without have incur the least danger have by they cleverness and lightness carry off more than twenty time as much as we own man observe among themselves a kind of order in they plunder very like that of monkey when they strip a field in fact law have a personal altercation with the maratha commander about a young and beautiful hindu woman whom the maratha wish to seize but whom law be determine to restore unhurt to she relation who live in a village close by for the capture of the fort law receive from the shahzada various high-sounding title and the right to have the royal music play before he but as he could not afford to entertain the native musician he allow the privilege to sleep in 1760 mr vansittart assume the governorship of bengal and he first act be to complete the project begin by he predecessor mr holwell namely the dethronement of mir jafar this be effect on the 20th of October 1760 the ex-nawab go quietly to calcutta and mir kasim reign in he stead the shahzada have now become emperor by the death of he father and have assume the title of shah alam he be still hang with he army round patna and mir kasim and the english determine to bring he to book kamgar khan continue to lead the imperial army aimlessly about the country and in January 1761 find himself near the town of bihar he have 35 to 40 thousand cavalry maintain chiefly by plunder but he only musketeer and artillery be those command by law ie 125 european and 200 sepoy with 18 gun of small calibre the british commander major carnac have 650 european and 5 to 6 thousand sepoy with 12 gun mir kasim have some 20000 cavalry and the same number of musketeer all good troops for everybody be pay in the army of kasim alus khan -lrb- 114 -rrb- on the 14th of January scout bring word of the approach of the english the emperor consult law who advise a retreat but he be not deficient in courage and determine to fight the next day be fight the battle of suan -lrb- 115 -rrb- at the dawn of day we hear that the enemy be on the march and that they would quickly appear no disposition of we army have yet be make by kamgar khan who in fact trouble himself very little about the matter it be at first decide to re-enter the camp so i put my man as much as possible under shelter behind a bank along which i place my gun in what i think the most useful position about 6 or 7 o'clock the enemy be see advance in good order cross a canal -lrb- 116 -rrb- full of mud and water the passage of which might have be easily contest have we be ready soon enough but everything be neglect for some time we think the enemy be go to encamp by the canal but see that they be still

out a good cannon-shot away abandon to ourselves we should have be expose to all the fire of the english artillery and even to be outflank by the enemy and capture at the first attack we advance a few pace in obedience to the order but see no one move to support we i suspect they want to get rid of we i therefore bring back my man to where i have first place they on a line about 200 pace in front of the army the enemy advance steadily the english at they head with all they artillery be already within range of we gun they quickly place they piece in two battery to the right and leave and keep up a very lively cross fire in a very short time have kill many man elephant and horse -- amongst other one of mine -- they cause the whole of the prince 's army to turn tail kamgar khan at they head

large body of native command by ramnarain and raj balav but the engagement be decide by the english who fall with so much effect upon the enemy that they onset could not be withstand by either the emperor or kamgar khan the latter finding he could not resist turn about and flee the emperor oblige to follow he quit the field of battle and the handful of troops that follow m law discourage by this flight and tired of the wander life which they have hitherto lead in he service turn about likewise and follow the emperor m law finding himself abandon and alone resolve not to turn he back he bestride one of he gun and remain firm in that posture wait the moment for he death this be report to major carnac he detach himself from he main body with captain knox and some other officer and he

from you loin come amongst we and abandon all thought of contend with the english ' the other answer that if they would accept of he surrender himself just as he be he have no objection but that as to surrender himself with the disgrace of be without he sword it be a shame he would never submit to and that they might take he life if they be not satisfy with that condition the english commander

whom much honor have always be pay no one do speak to he any more or make a show of stand up at he departure this reprimand do much honor to the english and it must be acknowledge to the honor of those stranger that as they conduct in war and battle be worthy of admiration so on the other hand nothing be more modest and more become than they behavior to a enemy whether in the heat of action or in the pride of success and victory these people seem to act entirely accord to the rule observe by we ancient commander and we man of genius gholam husain khan say the victory be decide by the

council request mr scrafton third in council to write to m courtin chief of the french factory for information in reply m courtin send they a number of letter which he have receive from chandernagore confirm the bad news from calcutta take into consideration the unfortified condition of the factory and that dacca be only four day by river from murshidabad whilst it be fourteen from calcutta it seem idle to hope to defend it even when assistance could be expect from the latter place and now that it be certain that calcutta itself have fall any attempt at defense appear rather a act of rashness than of bravery it be therefore resolve to obtain the best term they could through the french the next day m fleurin second of the french factory -- m courtin -lrb- 124 -rrb- be not well acquaint with the english language -- come to inform they that the nawab of dacca agree that the lady and gentleman should be allow to retire to the french factory on m courtin give he word that they would there await the order of siraj-ud-daulum as to they future fate the soldier be to lay down they arm and be prisoner to the nawab this amicable arrangement be entirely due to m courtin 's good office and he be much congratulate on the tact he have show in prevent the nawab from use violent measure as he seem inclined to do at first as the nawab would not allow the english to take away any of they property except the clothes they be wear they be entirely dependent upon the french for everything and be treat with the greatest kindness the council write : -- the french have behave with the greatest humanity to such as have take refuge at they factory and the tenor of they conduct everywhere to we on this melancholy occasion have be such as to merit the grateful acknowledgment of we nation for some two month the english remain in the french factory m law at cossimbazar warmly solicit they release from siraj-ud-daulum this he obtain with difficulty and at last mr becher and he companion sail in a sloop provide by m courtin for fulta where they arrive safely on the 26th of August when calcutta have be recapture by the english m courtin like a good business man send in a bill for the cost of the sloop to the council at calcutta and the consultation of the 16th of may 1757 duly notify its payment the english do not regain possession of the factory at dacca till the 8th of march by which time the declaration of war between france and england be know and the likelihood of trouble in bengal be very apparent as we have see the english be successful in they attack on chandernagore but the whole country be aware that the nawab be only the more enraged with they and he local officer might at any moment be instruct to take vengeance on englishman find defenceless up country on the 23rd of march messr sumner and waller write from dacca that jusserat khan have refuse to restore the factory cannon and to pass they goods without a new _ parwana _ -lrb- 125 -rrb- from murshidabad it be therefore still very doubtful whether he would assist the english or the french at dacca and though the english obtain the _ parwana _ they want early in may on the 9th the council at calcutta send they order to do the best they could for they own security and inform they they have send a armed sloop to luckipore to cover they retreat they immediately send down all the goods they could but as matter become quieter again they soon resume business and appear to have have no further trouble it may be imagine that m courtin and he friend know that the english have demand the surrender of the french factory have a very uncomfortable experience all this time -lrb- 126 -rrb- unfortunately no record of the french factory in bengal be now to be find and i have despair of obtain any information about the expulsion from dacca when in the bibliothèque nationale at paris i come on a m entitle _ copy of a letter from m courtin from indium write to he wife in which be give in detail the different affair which he have with the moor from the 22nd of June 1757 the day of he evacuation of dacca to the 9th of march 1758 _ -lrb- 127 -rrb- m courtin have marry a madame direy widow of a french company 's servant and the letter show she be fortunately in france at the time of she husband 's trouble as be natural but inconveniently enough for we courtin do not think it necessary to trouble she with unintelligible and unpronounceable indian name where possible i shall fill they in from the english record otherwise i shall interrupt the course of the letter as little as possible it run as follow : -- calcapur -lrb- 128 -rrb- April 20 1758 word must have reach thee in france of the loss of chandernagore which be take from we by the english on the 23rd of march 1757 after eleven day ' siege i be then at dacca and expect every day to see m chevalier return from he journey to the king of assam judge my dear wife of the chagrin and embarrassment into which i be throw by this deplorable event the english have have no idea of attack chandernagore until they have recover calcutta from the moor take the moorish village at huglus and force the moor to agree to a most shameful peace this be not as thou wilt see sufficient for they for siraj-ud-daulum have offend they too deeply for they to stop when once they find themselves on a good road but unfortunately we be a obstacle in the way of they vengeance otherwise i believe they would have observe the neutrality which have be always so carefully maintain by the european nation in the country of the gange in spite of all the war which take place in europe many of the french from chandernagore -- officer company 's servant and other -- have take refuge at cossimbazar with m law who form there a party which oppose the english in various way the english however force siraj-ud-daulum against he true interest and in spite of he promise to protect we to abandon we and to make m law leave he factory and go to patna this imprudent act be the ruin of the prince and put the final touch to we misfortune whilst it have make the english master of bengal and have fill they coffer with wealth i hold on at dacca till the 22nd of June i be trouble as little as be possible in such circumstance owe i think to the gratitude which the english feel for the service i have render they in dacca the year before i have all the more reason to think this be so because after the misfortune which befall chandernagore they have often offer to secure to I all my effect and merchandise in murshidabad -lrb- -rrb- -- they be worth a million -- provide i make over to they the french factory and all that belong to the company and would myself leave for pondicherry in the follow October they say i should not be consider a prisoner of war and should not require to be exchange these be no doubt very good term and most advantageous to I but should i not have be dishonour for ever if i have have a soul so servile and base as to accept they i would have be cover with ignominy in my own eye and without doubt in those of all the world i therefore think it my duty to reject they thing be on this footing when at the beginning of June i learn that the english have get rid of m law be march upon murshidabad with all they force to achieve the destruction of a prince who be already half ruin by he own timidity and cowardice and still further weaken by the faction form against he by the chief member of he own family -- a prince detest by every one for he pride and tyranny and for a thousand dreadful crime with which he have already soil he reputation though he be barely twenty-five year old i know only too well what be prepare against he and i be also most eager to find some honorable means of escape for myself m chevalier 's absence trouble I greatly and i do not like to leave he behind I at last he arrive on the 16th or 17th i have take the precaution to provide myself with a _ parwana _ or passport sign by siraj-ud-daula allow I to go where i pleased that prince have recall m law to he but too late for i feel certain he could not rejoin he in time to save he or to check the progress of he enemy i be in a hurry therefore to go and help to save he if that be possible take care however to choose a route by which i could escape if as i think probable he should have succumb beforehand to the effort of the english and the treason of he subject it be then the 22nd of June when i start with about 35 boat -lrb- 129 -rrb- mm chevalier brayer -lrb- possibly a relation of the m brayer who command at patna -rrb- gourlade the surgeon and a augustine father chaplain of the factory 8 european soldier of whom several be old and past service 17 topass gunner 4 or 5 of the company 's servant and about 25 or 30 peon -lrb- 130 -rrb- there my dear wife be the troop with which thou seest I start upon my adventure -lrb- 131 -rrb- to these however should be add my christian clerk my domestic and even my cook all of whom i dress and arm as soldier to assist I in what i expect to be a losing game and which in fact have result the most disastrous in the world for my personal interest it be not till seven or eight day after i have set out with this fine troop that i learn there have be a battle at plassey between the english and the nawab in which the latter have be defeat and force to flee and that jafar ali khan he maternal uncle -lrb- 132 -rrb- have be enthrone in he place this report though likely enough as far as i could judge do not come from a source so trustworthy that i could rely on it with entire faith accordingly i do not yet abandon the route which i have propose to myself in fact i follow it for some day more and almost as far as the mouth of the patna river -lrb- 133 -rrb- there i learn beyond possibility of doubt that siraj-ud-daulum have be capture conduct to murshidabad and there massacre that he have just miss be rejoin by m law who be come to meet he and could easily have do so if he have follow the instruction give he and have be willing to march only three hour longer and that the english have send a body of troops towards patna to capture or destroy m law if possible we have see in a previous chapter the real reason why law be unable to rejoin siraj-ud-daulum in time for the battle i now see that a junction with he have become impossible unless i determine to run the most evident risk of lose my liberty and all i have it appear that courtin have the company 's effect as well as he own private property and that of he companion on board he little fleet this make I change my route immediately the mountain of tibet -lrb- 134 -rrb- appear to I a safe and eminently suitable asylum until the arrival in the gange of the force which we flatter ourselves be come i therefore direct my route in this direction but find myself suddenly and unexpectedly so close to murshidabad that for two day together we hear the sound of the gun fire in honor of the revolution which have take place it be easy to judge into what alarm this unexpected and disagreeable proximity throw I however we arrive safely on the 10th of July at the capital of the raja of dinajpur who wish to oppose we passage this be the raja ram nath whom orme describe as a raja who with much timidity be a good man we make it in spite of he threaten to attack he if he show any further intention of oppose we i do not know what would have happen if he have have a little firmness for we learn afterwards that he have always in he service a body of 5000 infantry and cavalry the person whom he send to we have at first suggest that i should pretend i be english assure I that by that mean all difficulty would be remove but i think this trick too much beneath a man of honor for I to make use of it and in fact i object to pass for anything but what i really be i find here a french soldier who have be at the battle of plassey where the brave sinfray -lrb- 135 -rrb- at the head of 38 frenchman have fight like a hero for a long time and have retreat only at the order of siraj-ud-daulum who see himself betray and the battle lose send he word to cease fight this worthy gentleman afterwards take refuge in birbhum the raja of which country betray he and disgracefully hand he over to the english in October last courtin be somewhat unfair to the raja -lrb- apparently a muhammadan as he be call assaduzama muhammad -rrb- -lrb- 136 -rrb- for this prince be a ally of the english and have offer clive the assistance of he force before the battle of plassey it could be no treachery on he part to pick up fugitive from the battle like sinfray and hand they over to he ally i may as well quote one of the raja 's letter to clive receive 28th October 1757 : -- before you letter arrive the french be go through some wood in my country i know they be you enemy therefore i order my people to surround they the french be afraid some say they be english and some dutch in the meantime i receive you letter that if i could apprehend they i should send they to you therefore i have send they surajah dowlat have plunder my country so much that there be hardly anything leave in it -lrb- 137 -rrb- courtin continue : -- to return to my journey and my adventure i now find myself outside of bengal and in sight of the mountain of tibet a month have elapse since my departure from dacca i be only two or three day distant from these mountain and my intention as thou hast see above be to go there but i be prevent by the murmur of my people especially the boatman who already begin to desert in small party accordingly i accept a offer make I on the part of the raja of sahibgunj to give I a site for a fort and to aid I with everything i might want i descend the river again for a little and near this site which be on the river bank i commence a fort but the thickness of the forest force I to abandon it and i enter a little river close by which conduct I to a marsh on the border of which i find a elevated site admirably situate and in a very agreeable neighborhood -lrb- 138 -rrb- this belong to the same raja and with he consent i again set to work and that with such promptitude that in less than a month my fortress commence to take form and visibly progress owe to the extraordinary effort i make to complete it it be triangular with a bastion at each angle at two of the angle i have find superb tree with very heavy foliage and on the third i erect the mast of my boat and hoist we flag all three bastion have four embrasure a fine entrance gate opening on the marsh and a little open turret above a small entrance gate lead to the open country the curtain be carefully pierce for musketry and strengthen outside with a trellis work of bamboo and finish off with banquette on the rampart a excellent powder magazine be build in the same way and be situate in the interior of the fort be quite safe from any accident as i have bring workman of all kind with I the work go on well especially as the care of we health make we all industrious i be not without cannon and i mount on we rampart two swedish gun which afterwards prove we safety and preservation -lrb- 139 -rrb- also be provide with the requisite for make gunpowder i very soon have nearly 3000 lb weight of very good quality hardly anything remain to complete my fortress which i have name ` bourgogne ' except to provide it with a glaçis it be already furnish with a market which be sufficiently flourish when to my misfortune i receive the false information that we force which be say to be considerable be ready to enter the gange and that there be certain news of the arrival of a very strong squadron at pondicherry -lrb- 140 -rrb- on the 8th September there break out at purneah and in the province of that name a evolution head by a person name hazir ali khan -lrb- 141 -rrb- who have seize the capital at once write to I to join he and assist he against the english and jafar alus khan -lrb- 142 -rrb- these two event make I stop everything else and devote myself entirely to get my boat out of the little river by which i have enter the marsh and which be now almost quite dry up i succeed in do so after some time by means of ditch which i cut from the marsh but this take I more than a month and considerable labor as i be about two league from the great river to complete my misfortune my troop be attack by sickness which rage with a violence such as i have scarcely ever see it cost I nine soldier of whom three be european the latter be luckily replace some day after by the same number who join I -lrb- 143 -rrb- poor m brayer and m gourlade have be during almost the whole campaign in the most pitiable condition especially the former who i think a thousand time must have die as for I the powder _ d'aillot _ preserve I from the pestilential air and cure I from the effect of a fall in my _ bajarow _ -lrb- 144 -rrb- cause by the clumsiness of my boatman i narrowly escape break my rib and back before quit fort bourgogne i must tell thee my dear wife that i often play there a very grand rôle i be call the ` fringuey raja ' or ` king of the christian ' i be often choose as arbiter amongst the little prince in my neighborhood who send I ambassador my reputation spread so wide and the respect that i gain be so great that the king of tibet do not disdain to honor I with a embassy of nearly eight hundred person whom i entertain for nine whole day and whose chief i dismiss with present suitable to they rank they king we nation and the idea which i wish to leave behind I in this country of the european name the present which be make I consist of five horse some bag of scent three or four piece of china piece of gilt paper and a sabre like those use by the bhutiya or people of tibet who be man as strong and robust as those of bengal be feeble though pagan like the latter they eat all kind of thing and live almost like the tartar from whom they be descend they have no beard and be clothe in a fashion which be good enough but which look singular they be very dirty the complexion of those whom i saw be very dark but i know it be not the same in the interior of the country and in the mountain where all be as fair as the chinese who be say to be they neighbor i take some trouble to form a alliance and to make a party amongst they they appear very willing but i soon have occasion to convince myself that not only be they not fitting person for my design but also that they be play with I it be not that they do not make raid upon the lower country but they make these only in the cold weather always withdraw at the commencement of the hot without try to make any permanent conquest there then my reign be finish or nearly so for the good news that i continue to receive -lrb- though always without foundation as i learn afterwards -rrb- join to the entreaty of hazir all khan and to the unhealthy air which continue to decimate my poor little troop induce I at last to abandon my fort to embark again upon my boat and to reapproach bengal from which i have hitherto be travel away the second day after my departure be mark by a very annoying accident namely the loss of one of my largest boat on which be my library and a quantity of my effect these be quickly draw out of the water but be none the less ruin for the company and for I from that moment commence my misfortune the sixth day -- i have pass three in the salvage of the effect on my boat -- i receive a _ pattamar _ -lrb- messenger -rrb- who inform I that the english and the troops of jafar alus khan be at purneah from which they have chase hazir alus khan and wholly destroy he faction from broome we see that this be in the middle of December 1757 it be now that clive first hear what courtin be attempt he immediately send order direct and also through the nawab to kasim ali khan faujdar of rungpore and to raja ram nath of dinajpur to seize the french it be almost impossible for I to reascend the river because of the dry bank and the strong current which would have put my boat in danger however i find myself in the country of rungpore which be a dependency of bengal i determine nevertheless to remain where i be flattering myself the english would not come to look for I nor the nawab or the ruler of the province think of disturbing themselves about I as i be do no harm in the country and as i be very strict in observe proper order and discipline i be so confident on this latter head that i do not think of throw up now entrenchment and occupy myself only with hunting and walk whilst i await the arrival of the french force however one day towards the middle of January a secret rumor come to I that kasim ali khan faujdar of rungpore be come to attack I i send out scout who report that all be tranquil in he town and that far from wish to come and look for a quarrel he be in fear lest i should march against he town which be three day ' journey from where i be doubtless my man deceive I or do not take the trouble to go to rungpore for on the 15th of the same month at 3 pm on the opposite side of the river to that on which we be there appear a body of soldier cavalry and infantry about 600 in number who approach so near my fleet that i no longer doubt the correctness of the first advice which have be give I i order a discharge of three gun on this troop which be so well direct that the enemy be force to take themselves off and to encamp a little further from I next day the commander send I a present of some fruit and a intimation that he only wish to see I quit he country he know i could not do this without risk and accord to the custom of the infidel he give I the strongest possible assurance of my safety and tranquillity i take care not to trust to they i be then as i say above without entrenchment and without defense so in the evening i set to work at surround myself with a ditch the mud take out of which would serve I for embrasure i be short of provision which make I very anxious and i be still more so when i learn that the enemy be try to cut I off from provision on all side and that they intention be to capture I by famine or treachery they number quickly increase to 3000 man of whom a part come over to my side of the river and harass my people whenever they go out for provision this force I to detach mm chevalier and gourlade with about 10 man some peon and boatman against one of they little camp where there be about 150 man foot and horse we man receive they fire storm the camp and destroy it after have put every one to flight there be not a single person wound on we side this little advantage give I time to make a good provision of rice and other thing in the village near my entrenchment i clear out these village and drive out the inhabitant but i be still in need of a quantity of thing necessary to life to procure these i try to frighten the enemy by cannonade they chief camp on the other side of the river this only result in make they withdraw altogether beyond the reach of my gun not with the idea of go away but of starve I out and as i learn later to give time for a reinforcement of artillery which they be expect to arrive they have already 4 or 5 gun but they calibre be small compare with mine as i be able to see from the ball which fall in my camp when it be entrench only on the land side the 19th of January early in the morning i send across the river a number of workman support by a little detachment under m gourlade to cut down a grove of bamboo which mask my gun and to burn down some house which be also in they way i forbid they to engage the enemy and all go well until some topass and peon advance too far towards the enemy 's camp and i hear discharge so loud and frequent on both side that i order a retreat to be beat in my entrenchment to make my people recross the river i fire my gun continually to facilitate this and to cover the movement in this skirmish i have only one soldier wound and i do not know whether the enemy have any loss this day more than 1500 shot be fire on both side some of the gun which the enemy bring up troubled we greatly as we be not entrench on the water side several ball fall at my side or pass over my head this determine I to set all my people at work the next night with torch to put we under cover on this side also -lrb- it be apparently this fight which kasim alus report to clive on the 24th of January : -- i write expressly to my people to go and take they -lrb- the french -rrb- and they go immediately and find they ready to fight on both side there be cannon and _ jenjall _ -lrb- 145 -rrb- a _ nulla _ -lrb- 146 -rrb- be between they which the french crost and advance upon my people fight with great intrepidity : but luckily three or four of they be kill they retire into they fort -lrb- 147 -rrb- -rrb- the moor see from my maneuver how important it be for they to seize the ground which i have intend to clear and contrary to my expectation establish themselves on it the same evening without my be able to hinder they keep themselves always well hide behind the bamboo where they have nothing to fear from my artillery and still less from my musketry like I they work at night and have as many prisoner or other workman at they command as they want i see with regret next morning the progress which they have make opposite I i could not dislodge they without risk everything weak as i be i think it wiser not to hazard anything more in sortie but to hold myself always on the defensive sheikh faiz ullum -lrb- that be the name of the moorish general -rrb- send I one of he man next day with a present and proposal of peace the first condition of which be of course that i should quit he country and as since the dry weather have set in a very large and dangerous bank have form in the river seven or eight league below I he offer I one or two thousand workman to assist in make a passage for my boat the shocking treachery use by the moor be well know to I i refuse to accept he offer except on he furnish I with hostage for he good faith he first propose himself but with such a strong escort that it be not difficult to see that it be a trap which he be set for I so as to seize and massacre we after many debate between we emissary he consent to come to my _ bajarow _ he and he servant and that all of they should serve as hostage until i be quite out of the domain of he master i loyally agree to this arrangement and make preparation in consequence but at 7 in the morning on the 23rd of January the day i expect the hostage i be awaken by a cannon-shot quickly follow by a second the ball of which pierce the _ rezaus _ -lrb- 148 -rrb- at the foot of my bed from side to side and make a great noise for a long time i have be accustom to sleep fully dress so i be able to go out quickly and give order in the entrenchment the treachery and perfidy of the enemy be too manifest nevertheless i forbid a single shot to be fire with musket or cannon and simply recommend my people to be on they guard on the land side the enemy keep up a continuous and very lively fire until 4 o'clock in the evening i consider that it would be useless for I to reply and wish to see how far they would push they insolence that day we pick up 40 cannon-ball and we whole loss be one boatman slightly wound in the leg from 4 o'clock till night the enemy 's fire be continue but at long interval it begin again the next morning i suffer this as on the previous day for a couple of hour at the end of which i fire several shot and silence it my firing seem to trouble the enemy more than i expect it would one of my boat be sink by a cannon-ball several be pierce through and my _ rezaus _ which use to serve I as a coat be much damage the succeed day pass much in the same manner until the 3rd of February when on the same bank and to the north above my fleet i see a new entrenchment which have be throw up during the precede night its battery enfiladed mine along they whole length it be necessary either to risk everything by make a sortie in order to destroy it or to arrange term i determine on the latter which appear to I all the more necessary as i be begin to be in want of everything and as i have just receive letter which deprive I of all hope of the arrival of we force in bengal until April or may i therefore inform sheikh faiz ullum that i be ready to enter upon negotiation and the same day he send I some of he people with whom i agree to leave my entrenchment and go down the river i consent to do this without hostage but that it might be do in security i promise they a sum of money for themselves as well as for they general this arrangement be agree to by sheikh faiz ullum he send I word that in order that he might not appear to betray he master it would be necessary for I next morning to open the fiercest fire possible on he camp that he would reply that on both side it should be with the intention of do as little hurt as possible that i should pretend it be to force he to give I a passport which he would send I in the evening and that i should then send he the money i have promise all these precaution be only to assist he rascality and they appear to I all the more surprising as he have already repeatedly inform I that he have he master 's permission to give I a passport and to let I go where i pleased but of what be these moor not capable without be blind to the continuance of he perfidy i flattered myself that it might happen that he would not trouble I on my march when he have receive my money however this might be my cannon fire from 10 in the morning till 3 in the evening we people perceive that the enemy be firing in earnest do not spare they any more than they spare we and that which be at first on we side only a pretence finally become serious at 4 o'clock i receive a envoy who bring I the passport and to whom i pay the money he assure I that i might embark my artillery the next morning and set out the day after without the slightest apprehension of be interfere with i take my precaution and in fear of treachery keep on shore my two swedish gun at last at seven in the morning my boat start have on board only the sick and helpless and i set out by land with my two gun and the rest of my troop at the head of which i put myself this triumph of time and treachery be report by sheikh faiz ullum 's master kasim alus to clive on the 14th of February : -lrb- 149 -rrb- -- i before write you that i have send force to fight the french that they have a fort and strong intrenchment and that we have a battle with they ever since i write you last we have be fight my people have behave well and i make no doubt but you have hear it from other people god know what pain and trouble i have take in this affair the french be shut up in they fort and undergo much fatigue by always fight and likewise be in want of provision be oblige to run away in they boat by night and go towards the dinajpur country my people be always ready to fight follow they they can go no other way but through the dinajpur country i have therefore write expressly to the rajah to stop the passage about this time though courtin do not mention it till later he begin to see what the inevitable end must be he could not cut he way through to join law and with the whole country in arm against he he be too weak to hold out for any length of time accordingly he send messenger secretly to mr luke scrafton at murshidabad it be scrafton as i have say above who write to courtin for assistance when the nawab of dacca want to take they factory and imprison the english courtin now write to he to save he from fall into the hand of the native and on the 18th of February scrafton write to the select committee at calcutta for the necessary permission -lrb- 150 -rrb- we now rejoin courtin : -- what be my surprise at the end of a hour and a half to see that we be follow by a body of four or five hundred man with two gun draw by ox i pretend not to notice and continue my march but at 3 o'clock in the afternoon see this troop approach within range of my piece i point they at the moor and put my force in a position of defense they rascality follow its usual course and they send I word that i have nothing to fear that they would not march so close to I any more and that they follow I only to preserve the peace and to hinder my people especially the straggler from commit any disorder i receive this excuse for what it be worth and pretend to be content with it see clearly that they be look for a opportunity to surprise and destroy we several accident happen to the boat of the rearguard prevent my troop and myself from rejoin the main body of the fleet till far on in the night i find it anchor in the most disadvantageous position possible and in the morning i see at a distance of one-eighth of a league the same body of troops that have follow I the day before establish and settle itself a moment later i learn that sheikh faiz ullum be on the opposite bank with he army and he artillery that he intend to wait for I in a narrow place call choquova -lrb- 151 -rrb- at the foot of which my boat must pass and that he be diligently make entrenchment there my embarrassment be then extreme i find myself surround on all side i be without any provision destitute of the most necessary article of life in this perplexity i see only the most cruel alternative either to surrender or to fight to the death so as to perish with we arm in we hand the latter appear to be less dreadful than the former after repeat consultation we determine it would be best to risk the passage of the fleet by choquova we think that possibly we should find provision there and that certainly the position could not be worse -lrb- for defense -rrb- than that in which we then find ourselves the passage be carry out in three hour ' time without confusion or disorder by means of my swedish gun on the boat which lead the van what be we delight to find not only a better position than that which we have quit but one that be almost completely entrench by nature and have village full of rice to the right and left of it next day i collect provision in abundance clear the country round for a quarter of a league and do my best to ameliorate my condition the enemy be disconcert by my boldness they pretend as usual in order to deceive I the more easily that they be not surprise at my march they fear rightly that if i commence new entrenchment all they trouble would begin again besides i have completely protect myself from the possibility of surprise _ pourparler _ for a accommodation be renew and last three day at the end of which it be agree that i should continue my march that two hostage should be give I for my safety and that the army with its gun should retire from choquova and should be send a long way ahead across country and as at half a league from this place the river be no longer navigable because of the bank which have form in it i should be supply with people to facilitate my passage thou wilt notice my dear wife that in all the negotiation i have for various reason and on several occasion propose to suspend all hostility until a answer could be receive from jafar all khan and the english to whom i say i would write to come to some accommodation with they offer to send my letter open this be repeatedly refuse but the refusal do not prevent my ask for the honor of war my letter be despatch secretly by my own messenger at last on the 23rd i quitted though with regret -lrb- always expect treachery -rrb- my new position and approach the shallow or bank mention it be night when i arrive in spite of this i could understand from the dreadful noise make by the water that i should have difficulty in traverse this dangerous passage even with the assistance promise I i be only too well convinced of the truth of this when day break and i see that i have again be betray there be nothing to be see of the work which the moor have engage to do to lessen the difficulty of the passage however i do not hesitate to put out with my lighter boat firmly resolve if they arrive safely to sacrifice the larger with all that be upon they to my safety and thus to effect my retreat during the night with the exception of two which be lose they all arrive safely during this piece of work which take up the whole day i dissimulated my intention in the presence of my hostage merely let they see i be somewhat surprised to find that contrary to the promise give there be no workman but that the army which ought to have be withdraw be still close to we they excuse be vague and unsatisfactory one of they who no doubt know the enemy 's plan ask permission to go to they camp promise to come back the next day though he demand accord with my design i agree to it only after much persuasion warn he not to break he _ parole _ to return the next morning very early this he swear to do as a rule these people think nothing of a oath i do not intend to wait for he which he comrade clearly perceive for see that he himself have be sacrifice by he master 's perfidy he approve of the resolution i have take to set out by night and swear that he have act in good faith and be ignorant of the treachery that have be concoct ` you can ' he say to I ` have my throat cut you would be justify in do so but i will not quit you even if you give I permission if i go to my own people they would say that i have disclose to you the trick which you have yourself discover and would certainly show I less mercy than i have experience from you ' after this i contented myself with have he closely watch order be give to the remain boat to start by night i mount on horseback to carry certain necessaries to my detachment on land which be already a little in advance and have cross a small river with the gun i have only three black with I and none of we know the way the night be dark and we wander from it i narrowly escape be drown with my horse and at last we lose ourselves entirely if we have be meet by any horseman nothing would have be easier than for they to capture I we arm and cartridge be all soak with water luckily i hear we drum beat and this tell we in what direction we could safely go my intention be to march by land with my troops and gun they object to this as i be wet to the skin and have a cold on the chest which hardly allow I to speak so i go back to the boat though with much regret and resolve to manage so as not to lose sight of my detachment i be in constant anxiety about the latter till 8 o'clock the next day when we all come together except one soldier topass who by he own fault have remain on a big boat which we have abandon and a _ manjhus _ -lrb- 152 -rrb- who be drown in one of the two little one which have sink find myself in the territory of the raja of dinajpur i imagine i have nothing to do with any one except he and that sheikh faiz ullum and he army would not think of follow I through a country which though tributary to the nawab of bengal still in no way belong to faiz ullum 's master the hostage who remain with I and to whom i speak about the matter -lrb- 153 -rrb- do not altogether dissuade I from this idea but counsel I to continue my march and to get farther away which i do till 6 o'clock in the evening what be my surprise when at 9 o'clock my scout report that the enemy be pursue I and be not more than a league away at the most i could not advance during the night for fear of run on the bank or shallows with which the river be fill and which might cause the loss of my boat and of my people accordingly i do not set out till the morning and always remain myself in the rear -lrb- of the fleet -rrb- i have stop to wait for my land detachment and the gun and be at some distance from the rest of my little fleet when about half-past nine i hear several musket shot fire in a instant i be surround by the enemy m chevalier who conduct the land detachment fortunately perceive my situation and see my danger bring up the two gun and fire about 20 shot which disengage I and give I time to regain my boat by swift rowing i have with I only pedro and the moorish hostage mention before then i land with mm brayer gourlade and in general every one who be strong enough to defend himself at the same time i order the boat to go on in this skirmish we loss be only one man slightly wound in the ear by a musket-ball my little fleet _ en route _ we march by land on the bank opposite to that on which be the main body of the enemy who have only cavalry which we do not trouble ourselves about it be not the same however with the boat at the end of a hour the boatman abandon they in a sudden panic and hurry tumultuously to join I when my people be collect i would have try to go and recapture my boat which the enemy have not delay to seize but not only would this have be a rash undertaking with so small a force against 3000 man but also there be a little river which form a island between my boat and I and so prevent the passage of my gun this determine I to abandon the boat and to retreat to dinajpur where i hope to find a asylum with the raja whilst i wait for a reply to my letter to jafar all khan and the english we march till 1 o'clock in the afternoon without be harass or disquiet -- no doubt because during this time sheikh faiz ullum and he people be occupy in plunder the boat we be now not very far from dinajpur when we meet a body of the raja 's cavalry the commander of which beg I to take another road so as not to pass through he town accordingly he give I a guide with whom we march till half-past five when we arrive at a great _ gunge _ -lrb- market place -rrb- at the extremity of dinajpur there they lodge we in a great thatched building the want of provision have cause we to suffer very much in this retreat this be the battle of cantanagar kasim alus describe it as follow to clive : -- my people and the french have a battle and the latter finding themselves much beat they run away and leave they boat they go to oppoor and beg protection of the kajah 's people bahadur sing come and tell my people to go a little further off and they would deliver they up but they put we off from day to day -lrb- 154 -rrb- about the time he be write this clive be write to say that he have receive courtin 's offer of surrender and that kasim alus be to cease hostility and allow the french to come to he with they boat and necessaries kasim alus have receive order to the same effect from mr scrafton who inform he he be send a officer to accept they surrender this do not however prevent kasim alus from try to get hold of they which account for the follow letter from raja ram nath to clive : -lrb- 155 -rrb- -- the french be now come from another country by boat to go towards muxadavad and kasim alus khan 's people have follow they out of he own country into mine they have leave they boat among kasim alus khan 's people and be now travel to jangepor -lrb- tangepur -rrb- when i hear this i send people with all expedition to look after they and i now hear that they have surround they the french want the nawab 's and you order and _ call for justice _ -lrb- 156 -rrb- from you they have hoist the nawab 's -lrb- 157 -rrb- and you color have put on you cloath -lrb- -rrb- and want to go to muxadavad kasim alus khan 's people want to carry they to rungpore but they refuse to go and say that if one of we be take they will destroy themselves -lrb- 158 -rrb- i be a poor zemindar who pay revenue -lrb- 159 -rrb- and ready to obey you order if the rungpore people should take they by force and they should kill themselves it would be a troublesome affair to return to courtin 's letter the raja of dinajpur do not fail to be embarrass by the favor which he have show to we fear be the only motive which influence he he send word to I to depart by night under a escort of 200 of he people who would conduct I to murshidabad i be very nearly accept he suggestion but the hunger and thirst from which we suffer greatly prevent I so i postpone give he a final answer till the next morning and then after full reflection decide not to move from the place to which i have be conduct until i receive a answer to the letter send to murshidabad i think this all the wiser as i be inform that nothing would induce my enemy to approach or attack I in my asylum -lrb- 160 -rrb- the place be so retired and so well provide with storehouse that i find there a greater appearance of security than in the open country or the escort offer by the raja as he man be subordinate to the same prince as the people who compose the army of sheikh faiz ullum and be likely enough to abandon I or to join my enemy in overwhelming I my conjecture be well found as several day after this same raja prompt by sheikh faiz ullum send I word that he could not answer for what might happen to I if i be attack that he troops be subject to murshidabad like those of kasim all khan could not support I nor fire on the latter finally he send a certain priest of he faith a grave man who come to suggest to we that we best course be to leave dinajpur and gain the open country otherwise we be lose he say that he know for certain that if i be so obstinate as to persist in wish to remain there order have be give to attack we cut we throat and send we head to murshidabad this person wish to terrify we so as to rid the raja of we as he be die with fright lest war should be make in the very heart of he town i reply that i be resolve to defend myself against any one who attack I to set fire to everything i find within my reach to kill as many people as i could and to die on my gun when i have use up all my ammunition that this be also the intention of my companion who prefer to die thus like brave man rather than to be expose to the ignominy and indignity that we should undergo if we allow ourselves to be make prisoner by the people of kasim all khan the timid raja threaten by both party find himself in the utmost embarrassment for sheikh faiz ullum at the gate of he town put as it be he country under contribution and demand from he with all imaginable insolence that he should deliver we up to he a thing which the raja find difficult to do some day pass in this way during which we have frequent alarm but the letter i receive from murshidabad fill every one with perplexity the english send I people on they own account one of my private friend -lrb- 161 -rrb- whom i have be so fortunate as to oblige on a similar occasion write I not to trouble myself about my boat or my effect but to come at once to he and he would see that they restore or pay for my property and that they give I all that i might need the order receive by sheikh faiz ullum and the raja at the same time order the one to leave I in peace and the other to furnish I with everything i want this put my mind in a condition of serenity to which it have long be a stranger and throw my enemy into much confusion they propose that i should resume possession of my boat i know with absolute certainty that they have be half loot still i accept they on condition they be bring to dinajpur they do not wish to do this but next morning after reflection they consent when in my turn i decline and ask only for provision and other thing necessary for my journey this they have the harshness to refuse doubtless because they think that i be destitute of everything would have to go down by whatever route they please i would not trust they in anything fear treachery at last without linen without clothes except what we have on we body on the 1st of march the seventeenth day after we retreat -lrb- 162 -rrb- we set out with we arm and we two swedish gun to go to murshidabad to the english from whom i have demand the honor of war we learn from the correspondence between mr scrafton and clive that drake the cowardly governor of calcutta very naturally could not understand what be mean by this claim to the honor of war -lrb- 163 -rrb- my gun be conduct by land by a small detachment the command of which i give to m chevalier and we embark on some small boat belong to the raja in which we have hardly room to move i be not yet at the end of my trouble for on the 3rd of march after dinner as i be get back into my boat one of the boatman wish to put down a gun manage to let it off and send a bullet through my left shoulder it pass through the clavicle between the sinew and the bone luckily the blow be break by a button which the bullet first strike still it pass almost completely through the shoulder and lodge under the skin which have to be open behind the shoulder to extract it and also the wad however unfortunate this wound be i ought to be very thankful to god that it be so safely direct and for the further good fortune of find with one of my people sufficient ointment for the surgeon who be quite destitute of all necessaries to dress my shoulder until the ninth day after when we arrive at murshidabad -lrb- 164 -rrb- this wound cause I much suffering for the first few day but thanks to the lord in thirty-two or thirty-three day it be quite heal and without any bad effect we rest ourselves from we fatigue till the 20th at my friend 's house when with he concurrence and in response to they offer i go to the dutch gentleman at cossimbazar where m vernet they chief and a old friend of mine receive we with the greatest kindness it be from they settlement that i write to thee my dear wife until the ship sail for england i shall continue to write daily and tell thee everything that be of interest -lrb- 165 -rrb- August 10 1758 my dear wife i resume my narrative to tell thee that my boat have be restore by the english as well as all the goods that have not be plunder by sheikh faiz ullum and he people except the munitions of war still so much of the merchandise goods and silver have disappear that i be ruin for ever unless the english who have promise to cause everything to be restore be able to make the moor give they up the english have at length decide on we fate in a way altogether honorable to we we be not prisoner of war and so we be not subject to exchange but we be bind by certain condition which they think necessary to they security and which only do I honor what have flatter I even more be that the two swedish gun which i have with I on my campaign have actually be give to I as a present by the commander of the english troops who be also governor of calcutta with the most complimentary expression courtin have write to clive ask permission to go down to pondicherry clive reply on the 15th of July 1758 grant permission he letter conclude : -- i be at this moment send a order to the captain commandant of we troops to restore to you you two gun i be charm at this opportunity of show you my appreciation of the way in which you have always behave to the english and my own regard for you merit -lrb- 166 -rrb- courtin continue : -- save from so many peril and sufficiently fortunate to have win such sensible mark of distinction from we enemy ought not this my dear wife to make I hope that the gentleman of the french company will do they utmost to procure I some military honor in order to prove to the english that my nation be as ready as theirs to recognize my service -lrb- 167 -rrb- now my dear wife i must end this letter so that it may be ready for despatch for fear of its be lose i will send in the packet another letter for thee do not disquiet thyself regard my health thanks to god i be now actually pretty well i dare not talk to thee of the possibility of we meeting circumstance be not favourable for thee to make another voyage to the indy that must depend upon event thy health peace and wish which in spite of my tender longing for thee will always be my guide if the event of war have not be doubly disastrous to I thou shouldst have receive some small remittance which i have send and of which i have advise thee in duplicate and triplicate if the decree of the lord after my have endure so many misfortune and suffering have also ordain my death before i be in a position to provide what concern thee have i not a right to hope that all my friend will use they influence to induce the company not to abandon one who will be the widow of two man who have serve it well and with all imaginable disinterestedness for the rest i repeat that thanks to god i be fairly well i kiss thee etc etc one would be glad to be assure that courtin re-establish he fortune if he be as i suppose the jacque ignace courtin who be afterwards _ conseiller au conseil des indes _ we may be satisfy he do so but french east indium company record be a hopeless chaos at the present moment and all that one can extract from the english record be evidence of still further suffering from murshidabad or cossimbazar courtin go down to chandernagore whence the majority of the french inhabitant have already be send to the madras coast the fort have be blow up and the private house be under sentence of destruction for the english have determine to destroy the town partly in revenge for the behavior of lally who act under instruction from the french east indium company have show great severity to the english in southern indium partly because they do not think themselves strong enough to garrison chandernagore as well as calcutta and fear the moor would occupy it if they do not place troops there and partly because they dread its restoration to france -- which actually happen -- when peace be make at any rate courtin find the remnant of he countryman in despair and in 1759 he write a letter -lrb- 168 -rrb- to clive and the council of calcutta from which i quote one or two paragraph : -- with the most bitter grief i have receive advice of the sentence you have pass on the french settlement at chandernagore by which all the building as well of the company as of private person be to be utterly demolish humane and compassionate as you be sir you would be sensibly affect -- be you eye witness to it as mine have be -- by the distress to which this order have reduce the heart of those unhappy inhabitant who remain in that unfortunate place particularly if you know that there be nothing leave to the majority of they beyond these house on whose destruction you have resolve if i may believe what i hear the motive which incite you be that of reprisal for what have happen at cuddalore and madra : it do not become I to criticize either the conduct of m lally we general who by all account be a man very much to be respect by I or you reason which you suppose sufficient grant the latter to be so permit I sir to address myself to you generosity and humanity and those admirable quality so universally esteem by mankind will encourage I to take the liberty to make certain representation all upbraiding be odious and nothing be more just than the french proverb which say to remind a person of favor do he cancel the obligation god forbid sir i should be guilty of this to you or you nation by remind you for a moment that these house now condemn by you serve you as a asylum in 1756 and that the owner whom you be now reduce to the greatest distress and be plunge into despair assist you to the utmost of they power and alleviate you misfortune as much as they be able but what be i say you nation be too polish to need remind of what be just therefore excuse my say that this reason alone be sufficient to cancel the law of retaliation which you have resolve to execute and to make you revoke a order which i be sure you could not have give without much uneasiness of mind i cast myself at you foot implore with the most ardent prayer that compassion which i flatter myself i perceive in you heart for these poor creature whom you can not without remorse render miserable if you really sir think i too have have the happiness to be of some use to you and you nation whilst chief at dacca and that i have render you some service i only beg that you would recollect they for one moment and let they induce you to grant the favor i request for my poor countryman i shall then regard it as the most happy incident in my life and shall think myself ten thousand time more indebted to you if sir you have absolutely imperative reason for reprisal change if you please the object of they i offer myself a willing victim if there must be one and if blood be necessary i should think myself too happy to offer mine a sacrifice but as these barbarous method be not make use of in nation so civilized as ours i have one last offer to make which be to ransom and buy all the private house at chandernagore for which i will enter into whatever engagement you please and will give you the best security in my power the last word seem to imply that courtin have recover he property at least to a great extent but he pathetic appeal be useless in face of national necessity and so far be chandernagore desolate that in November of the same year we read that the english army under colonel forde be ambush by the dutch garrison of chinsurah amongst the building and ruin of chandernagore from chandernagore courtin go to pondicherry where he become a member of the superior council he be one of the chief of the faction oppose to lally who contemptuously mention a print memorial of he adventure which courtin prepared probably for presentation to the director of the french east indium company -lrb- 169 -rrb- when in January 1761 lally determine to capitulate courtin be send to the english commander on the part of the council still later we find he name attach to a petition date August 3 1762 present to the king against lally -lrb- 170 -rrb- this show that courtin have arrive in france so that he elevation to the council of the company be by no means improbable to any one who have live long in indium it seem unnatural that in old day the small colony of european settle there should have be incite to mutual conflict and mutual ruin owe to quarrel which originate in far-off europe and _ which be decide without any reference to the wish or interest of european live in the colony _ the british settlement alone have successfully survive the struggle the least we can do be to acknowledge the merit whilst we commiserate the suffering of those other gallant man who strive they best to win the great prize for they own countryman of the french especially it would appear that they writer have notice only those like dupleix bussy and lally who command army in glorious campaign that somehow always end to the advantage of the british and have utterly forget the civilian who really keep the game go and who would have be twice as formidable to they enemy if the military have be subordinate to they the curse of the french east indium company be militarism whilst fortunately for the english we greatest military hero in indium lord clive be so clear-minded that he could write : -- i have the liberty of a englishman so strongly implant in my nature that i would have the civil all in all in all time and in all place case of immediate danger except how much might have be achieve by man like renault law and courtin if they have have a adequate military force at they disposal they see as clearly as do the english that bengal be the heart of indium and they see the english denude madra of troops to defend bengal whilst they themselves be leave by the french commander in a state of hopeless impotence on the other hand owe to the english company 's insistence that military domination should be the exception and not the rule british civilian and british soldier have almost always work together harmoniously it be this union of force which give we bengal in the time of which i have be write and to the same source of power we owe the gradual building up of the great empire which now dominate the whole of indium footnote : -lrb- footnote 122 : probably portuguese half-caste -rrb- -lrb- footnote 123 : matchlock man consultation of the dacca council 27th June 1756 madras select
