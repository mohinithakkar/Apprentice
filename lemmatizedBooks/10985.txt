seven year of age by samuel wilderspin inventor of the system of infant training whoso shall receive one such little child in my name receiveth I _ matt _ xviii 5 take heed that ye despise not one of these little one _ matt _ xvii 10 eighth edition carefully revise 1852 preface in again present this volume to the world i trust i feel thankful to god for the favor with which the infant system have be receive and for all the aid i have enjoy in my course of labor have the measure i originate for the development of the infant mind and the improvement of the moral character be sanction at first as many now think they should have be they progress would undoubtedly have be far greater but when i consider what have be accomplish under the divine benediction and amid greater difficulty than ever beset the path of a individual similarly occupy i know not how to express the gratitude of which i be conscious it seem proper and even necessary to remark that the system explain in this volume be the result of many year of labor thousand of child have be attentively observe and for the necessity that arise in they instruction provision have be make other have doubtless reach some of the conclusion at which i have arrive but this be only another instance of the coincidence in judgment and effort often discoverable in person far apart whose attention have be direct to similiar subject but with the exception of the elliptical plan devise by dr gilchrist i be not aware that i owe a idea or contrivance to any individual whatever upward of twenty-five thousand child have be now under my own care in various part of the unite kingdom whose age have not exceed six year myself my daughter and my agent have organize many score of school and thus i have have opportunity of study the infant mind and heart such as none of my contemporary have ever possess still i be aware i have much to learn i be far less satisfied with the extent of my knowledge and far less confident of its perfection and completeness now than i be in the earlier part of my course the whole energy of my mind however have be throw upon the subject and the whole of my time for the third of a century have be zealously devote to it i trust the volume will contain knowledge of a more plain simple and practical character than be elsewhere to be find : -- perhaps it may not be presumption to say than _ can _ elsewhere be find should i have the pleasure to labor for year to come i trust i shall have much more to communicate on the subject two edition of this work in its former state have be print in german and it have also be reprint in america i have however feel it due to the friend of education to make this volume as complete as possible and though still occasionally engage in superintend and organize school i have feel it necessary to revise this eighth edition very carefully throughout and commence it with a new and additional chapter _ moor cottage westgate common wakefield nov 1552 _ a few testimonial to the infant system it be say that we be aim at carry education too far that we be draw it out to a extravagant length and that not satisfy with dispense education to child also have attain what in former time be think a proper age we be now anxious to educate mere infant incapable of receive benefit from such instruction this objection may be answer in two way in the first place it should be observe that the objection come from those very person who object to education be give to child when they arrive at a more advanced period on the ground that they parent then begin to find they useful in labor and consequently can not spare so much of they time as might be requisite : surely that the education of the child should commence at that time when they labor can be of value to they parent but the other answer in my opinion be still more decisive : it be find even at the early age of seven or eight that child be not void of those propensity which be the forerunner of vice and i can give no better illustration of this than the fact of a child only eight year old be convict of a capital offence at we tribunal of justice when therefore i find that at this early period of life these habit of vice be form it seem to I that we ought to begin still earlier to store they mind with such taste and to instruct they in such a manner as to exclude the admission of those practise that lead to such early crime and depravity a noble friend have most justly state that it be not with the experience of yesterday that we come arm to the contest : it be not a speculation that we be bring forward to you notice but a experiment ' -- _ the lord chancellor _ in leave poor child to the care of they parent neglect be the least that happen it too frequently occur that they be turn over to delegate where they meet with the worst treatment so that we do not in fact come so much into contact with the parent themselves as with those delegate who be so utterly unfit for the office they undertake infant school however have completely succeed not only in the negative plan they have in view of keep the child out of vice and mischief but even to the extent of engraft in they mind at a early age those principle of virtue which capacitate they for receive a further stage of instruction at a more advanced school and finally as they approach manhood to be ripen into the noblest sentiment of probity and integrity -- _ the marquis of lansdowne _ i be a zealous friend upon conviction to infant school for the child of the poor no person who have not himself watch they can form a adequate action of what these institution when judiciously conduct may effect in form the temper and habit of young child in give they not so much actual knowledge as that which at they age be more important the habit and faculty of acquire it and it correct those moral defect which neglect or injudicious treatment would soon confirm and render incurable the early age at which child be take out of we national school be a additional reason for commence a regular and systematic discipline of they mind and will as soon as they be capable of profit by it and that be at the very earliest opening of the understanding and at the first manifestation of a corrupt nature in the shape of a childish petulance and waywardness -- _ the bishop of london _ the claim of this institution be of such a nature that they require no recommendation but a full statement of they the foundation of its happy result have be point out to exist in the principle of policy and of religion paramount to all policy -- a religion that appeal to every feeling of human nature he would recommend this charity as one less attend with perplexity in its operation or doubt as to its utility than many which though establish with the best possible motive frequently fail in effect the good propose but in this the most acute opponent could not discover any mischief that would arise from its success -- _ sir jame mackintosh _ i have always think that that man that would be the greatest benefactor to he country who do most for the suppression of crime this i be sorry to say we legislature have neglect in a great degree while they have readily employ themselves in provide for its punishment those acquaint with we prison must know that those find to have sink deepest into vice and crime be person who have never receive any education moral or religious in the refuge for the destitute a exact account be keep and it be find that of the great mass of culprit send there by the magistrate on account of they youth two-third be the child of parent who have no opportunity of educate they by this institution they would at once promote virtue and prevent vice -- _ dr lushington _ the real fact be that the character of all mankind be form very early -- much earlier than might be suppose : at the age of two or three year disposition be find in child of a description the most objectionable in these school the principle of mutual kindness and assistance be carry as far as could well be conceive and it be most delightful to regard the conduct of the child towards each other instead of opposition they display mutual good-will inculcate to the greatest degree so as to destroy in the mind of the child that selfishness which be the bane of we nature such effect appear almost to realize the golden age for the child appear always happy and never so happy as when attend the school -- _ w smith esq mp _ i feel have witness the happy effect produce by these school a warm zeal in support of such institution we can not begin too soon to impress religion principle on the mind of the young it be a affect consideration that while great statesman have be busy in they closet on some fine scheme or speculation they have neglect these salutary principle which the almighty have give to mankind it be remarkable how eagerly the young mind receive the history of the bible and how well they be fit to work on they disposition and when i consider the miserable state of the poor i can not but feel that the rich be in some degree the author of it in have neglect to afford they the means of education -- _ w wilberforce esq _ i be much delighted with what i have see and hear i confess i entertain doubt of the practicability of the infant school system but these doubt have this day be remove if in _ one month _ so much can be do what might not be expect from further training i now doubt no longer and anticipate from the extension of such school a vast improvement in the moral and religion of the humble class i conclude with move a vote of thanks to mr wilderspin -- _ lord chief justice clerk _ sir john sinclair rise and in address mr wilderspin say that he be astonish with the result of five week training in these perfect infant he have never see a greater prodigy he too have have he prejudice -- he doubt of the possibility of infant education but these doubt have now vanish and for ever the arrangement for bodily exercise connect with mental and moral improvement especially delighted he he be amuse as well as instruct by the well-applied admixture of divert expedient to keep the child alive and alert it be ` seria mixta jocis ' but there be practical sense in the seemingly most frivolous part of the plan he trust that the time be not far distant when there should be many such institution he call on all present to join he in return cordial thanks to mr wilderspin -- _ scotsman _ the grand secret of the improvement find to be derive from these establishment be they constant tendency to remove evil example and misery from the little creature during almost the whole of they wake hour consider how a child belong to one of these pass he day as soon as he be up the indispensable condition and the only one of he admission to the school that of clean face and hand be enforce and the mother in order to be relieve of the care of he during the day be oblige to have he wash he then leave the abode of filth and intemperance and squalid poverty and ill-temper for a clean airy place pleasant in summer warm and dry in winter and where he see not a face that be not light up with the smile of kindness towards he he whole day be pass in amusing exercise or interesting instruction and he return at evening-tide fatigue and ready for he

\* \* \* \* how come you to think of the infant school system of teaching -- be a question that i have often be ask and my friend think it advisable that it should in part at least be answer i proceed therefore in compliance with they wish to give some little of the require information in this place as perhaps it may throw light upon or explain more clearly the fundamental principle lay down and advocate throughout this volume in few word then i would reply -- _ circumstance _ force I to it bear a only child under peculiar circumstance and live in a isolate neighborhood i have no childish companion from infancy i be consequently throw much on my own resource and early become a _ thinker _ and in some measure a contriver too i beheld a beautiful world around I full of everything to admire and to win attention as soon as i could think at all i see that there must be a maker governor and protector of this world such thing as have life win my admiration and thus i become very fond of animal flower and fruit stone and mineral i also soon learn to observe and to mark they difference this lead to enquiry as to how they come -- where from -- who make they my mother tell I they come from god that he make they and all thing that i saw and also that he make herself and I from that moment i never doubt he wonderful existence i could not nor do i have at that age any correct idea of god but i soon learn to have elevated notion of he work and through they i be lead to adore something invisible -- something i be convince of within but could not see my mother to my knowledge never deceive I or tell I a untruth : therefore i believe she implicitly and to this day i never doubt so much for the implant a early _ faith _ in the unseen but the beautiful world and the thing in it which i saw and with which i come in contact oh how wonderful they appear to I they be my companion other child be strange to I and they be not nigh either to help or to thwart I my mother be my oracle during the first six year of childhood resolve my difficulty and answer my question i be happy -- very happy and still look back to those day with indescribable pleasure and satisfaction i have no task i be not pester with _ ab c _ nor _ ab eb ib _ from _ thing _ my parent chiefly teach I my first lesson and they have be as durable as life for day and week do i study such lesson my parent wait till i ask for information and when it be require it be never deny the world and the wonder in it form as it be a heaven to I i be tell i give but little trouble at this age in the beautiful field and wild coppice about hornsey as yet unencroached upon by suburban extension and by the side of the then solitary bank of the new river i be always to be find in cold and wet weather i have a stock of similar lesson in my home small live animal be my constant companion they teach I that love beget love i do love and delight in they and when they die i mourn they loss every day bring I new information which my parent perfect at length the alphabet be master and afterwards spell reading and so forth my mind _ be thus previously fill with idea _ the acquirement of word and abstract term become less irksome and i can not remember that thus far it cost I any trouble much less pain information of every kind fit for childhood then really give I pleasure no doubt i be greatly indebted to my parent for they judicious management my father always in the evening take great pain to explain thing to I he nurture but never cram he know when to teach and when to let alone unfortunately through very peculiar circumstance i be remove from the immediate care and superintendence of both parent rather early in life and at a age the most dangerous be leave to grapple nearly alone with the wide world and the being in it with little of either parental guidance it be then i see the immense importance and advantage of early impression to I they be of incalculable benefit and no doubt lead when i become a man to the thought which end in the development and practical working of the infant system and method of education school for infant then exist but what be they simply dame-school with the hornbook for boy and girl and perhaps a little sewing for the latter they sign be -- child teach to read and work here and they furniture the cap and bell the rod in pickle and a corner for dunce the finishing stroke be see in the parlor of the inn or the farm-house in the shape of needlework as a samplar -- lydium languish she work do at -- school in the year of we lord 1809 such be the school in country place then in existence the little one do nothing in after-life i think a remedy be require and might be find and therefore set about work it out how it be do shall be hereafter explain i know my own infant state have be a happy one and i wonder to see child cry to go to school when learn have be such a delight to I but i soon cease to wonder when i be send there myself at my first school i can truly say i learn nothing except it be that i have especially the sense of feeling i often have rap with the cane on the head across the shoulder and on the hand and i find it be mainly for not learn what the teacher have _ forget to teach I _ the term use be master and mistress and they be tolerably appropriate as far as i be concern for to I both become object of terror so much so that for the first time in my life i really fret when the hour of teaching come my parent be not long in perceive this although i do not complain they tell I it be for my good that i should go to school and i thoroughly believe they yet i could not understand why it should be associate with so much dislike and pain on my part when my first school -- the beautiful world of nature have be so lovely and my first teacher have always increase the delight by remove my difficulty and this so much so that i now long for evening to come to have fresh light and instruction give my father now decide that i should not go to school and he become my teacher as before the world be my great book i be delighted with robinson crusoe and this work become my companion and to which be add the pilgrim 's progress after these my great favorite be buffon 's natural history i use to go alone take a volume at a time to read amidst the pleasant country around but most frequently in the quiet nook and retreat of hornsey wood it seem however that i be always watch and superintend by my mother during these reading and rural ramble for whenever danger be near she generally appear but seldom otherwise so that i have perfect freedom in these matter i have every reason to believe that the first seven year of my life lay the basis of all i know that be worth know and lead to the formation of my character and future career in life of my schooling afterwards it be unnecessary to say much as it be the usual routine such as other have but it never satisfy I and i even then see error throughout the whole and this strengthen my first impression and tend to mature the after-thought in I that something want do and _ must be do _ it be not my intention in this introductory chapter to write a auto-biography but my object be simply to show how one impression follow another in my case and what lead to it to point out briefly the various plan and invention i have recourse to in carry out my view and intention and finally to allude to they propagation through the country personally by myself on purpose to show in conclusion that although infant education have be extensively adopt and many of its principle be base on nature have be apply with great success to older child yet especially in the case of infant that strict adherence to nature and simplicity which be so fundamental and so requisite have be often overlook and in some case totally discard it will i trust appear from what have be already say that even from early childhood i both see and feel that there be a period in human life and that the most important period as experience have prove to my full satisfaction not legislate for that be not duly provide with suitable and appropriate method of education to see this be one thing to provide a remedy for it and to _ invent plan _ for carry out that remedy be another the system of bell and of lancaster be then commence operation but be quite unsuitable for child under seven year of age at least and therefore take little or no cognizance of that early period which i have be inwardly convince be of such eminent importance i be destine for business and serve the usual apprenticeship to become qualify for it and also continue in it for a short period on my own account even at this time the thought ever haunt I as to what should be do for young child at length the germ be develop at one of the Sunday school which be then rise into general notice for year i attend one of these in london and here circumstance again befriend I regard the matter so frequently in my thought the teacher mostly prefer have a class to superintend that know something and i be then a junior it fall to my lot to have a class that know little or nothing i mean nothing that it be the object of the sunday-school to teach it soon appear clear to I that such a class require different treatment to those more advanced and especially the _ young _ child nobody want this class it be always to let if i do not take it the result be i always have it other look to the post of honor the bible-class i soon find that to talk to such child as i have to teach in the manner the other do to the older and more advanced child be useless and thus i be force to simplify my mode of teaching to suit they state of apprehension and now and then even to amuse they this succeed so well that in the end my class become the popular class and i become still further convinced of the desirableness of a _ especial plan for teach the very young _ i however still think that the alphabet should be teach first with the usual thing in they order at length shortly after my marriage which be rather early in life a opportunity present itself for try a experiment on a larger scale from have explain my view on early education to a friend i be solicit to take the superintendence of a asylum for young child about to be form in a populous part of london have thus a opportunity of carry out my wish thought and feeling in a way that i could not have anticipate i give up my connexion with business and devoted myself to the object great and unforseen difficulty however have to be encounter the first week be dreadful i begin with too many child and we have six whom the mother afterwards confess they send to _ wean _ these not only cry themselves but set all the other cry also and we regret have begin the experiment at length drive almost to despair it become evident that something new must be do to still the tumult as a expedient i elevate a cap on a pole which immediately attract they attention and occasion silence thus i obtain a clue to guide I and my mind instantly perceive one of the most fundamental principle in infant teaching in fact of most teaching and which long experience have prove true and that be to appeal to the sens of the child after this every day develop something new to I the child become happy beyond my expectation and my course onward be gradually progressive child and teacher become happy together difficulty vanish as we proceed and at length my wife and i make up we mind to devote we whole life to the perfecting of we plan and the carry they out extensively the novelty of the thing draw number of visitor to a district where the carriage of the nobility and gentry have not be see before but the labor to we be so greatly increase by this that my wife sink under it and i be leave with four young child to prosecute my plan alone in the world from the day i catch the idea that a great secret in teach the young be to teach through the _ sens _ the various implement now in such general use in infant school be step by step invent by I object of all kind be introduce and oral lesson give upon they to teach they quality and property and amongst the various visitor most frequently present at such time be the gentleman who have acquire fame by publish lesson on object which little work have elsewhere be highly commend by I albeit it come forth into the world several year after the period i now speak of to give such lesson i find it requisite to have the child altogether so as better to attract they attention simultaneously this be first attempt by place they at one end of the room but it be find inconvenient then parallel line be chalk across the floor and they sit down in order on these but though attention be gain the posture be unsuitable cord be then stretch across to keep they in proper rank and various experiment try with seat until they end in the construction of a permanently fix gallery of regularly ascend seat this implement or structure have now come into almost universal use in infant school and in fact they be consider incomplete without one and also they be in much request in school for child of every age to give a idea of number through the eye i have recourse at first to button string on string across a frame and this lead to the substitution of wooden ball on wire and other improvement through experience until the arithmeticon hereafter describe be fully form it have be find a useful instrument the credit of contrive it have be impugn by like it to the roman abacus and chinese swanpan but be those instrument like in structure or design especially to teach the multiplication table if not they be no more similar than a hawk to a hand-saw the former i have never see and the first time i see one of the chinese instrument be some five or six year ago in the museum at hull the clapping of hand the moving of arm march in order and various other motion all of which be now become the especial characteristic of a infant-school be gradually introduce as circumstance or nature dictate partly to obtain simultaneous action and obedience and partly to provide that physical exercise which being so young perpetually require and which they be constantly take when leave free and unrestrained it be not requisite to make mention here of the swing -- the play grounds -- the flower border -- and various other matter which be fully treat of in the follow portion of this work further than to add that they be now generally adopt in school and especially in some of the principal training establishment in the british empire as these plan and instrument be use by a certain religious infant-school society which profess to have import its system from switzerland where such thing never have they origin i feel it necessary most emphatically to repeat that they be entirely of my own invention after the severe bereavement mention above i still persevere in my favorite study and learn more from my own child than i do before have to act in the double capacity of father and mother i be well aware of the loss my child sustain by the above calamity in the matter of training nothing can replace a good mother -- and such indeed she eminently be i feel the heavy stroke more severely and my child do also but i console myself with the reflection that my loss be she gain and that she have live to witness fruit of she unparalleled labor to the thorough abandonment of self and the glory of she maker inasmuch as ye have do it unto one of these little one ye have do it unto I night and day when i have time to think such promise as these cheer and sustain I in do what i could for my own motherless child and more and more cement my affection on the child of other and finally enable I to mature my plan and give I strength and courage to carry they out first in the village and place near london and ultimately single-handed and alone through more than a quarter of a century in many of the chief city town and village of the unite kingdom simply to state this fact be all that be requisite here to answer my present purpose and to enlarge more upon it be needless as a full detail of the whole career be give in my early discipline illustrate or the infant system progress and successful third edition publish in 1840 and to which much more would require add to bring it down to the present time if a further edition should be call for that prejudice should assail I and objection be start as i come more out into the world be to be expect i know my own intention but the world do not and i come in for a full share of obloquy and persecution this do I much good and be a preparatory discipline to make I careless of the opinion of mankind in the matter so long as i feel that i be in the right and have the approval of my own conscience the more i be oppose the more be my energy light up and strengthen opposition always sharpen my faculty instead of overcome and depress I the whole gradually prosper from the first under every disadvantage and notwithstanding the strenuous effort of the short-sighted and bigoted these thing lay my first patron prostrate and the society of great name which follow be soon dissolve every effort be make by the enemy of true training and education to crush the thing in the bud and not only the thing but also the man who develop it and work it out thank god these inimical aim do not succeed though worldly patron fail i have one patron who never desert I but who uphold and encourage I from first to last until the end be gain not however all that be aim at but much of it and the rest will follow or i be greatly mistaken i have in various place see thing that i earnestly contend for but which be reject at the time at length establish and they value see look at the school in existence now bad as some of they be and compare they with those which exist a third of a century ago and it will be find that they have progress and it may safely be anticipate that they will still further progress for there be much need of it the system pourtray in this book be intend to act on all the faculty of a child especially the highest and to strengthen they at the time the mere animal part of he nature be weak the exist school be not find fit to take we child when they leave we the dull monotonous sleepy heavy system pursue be quite unadapted to advance such pupil at this point of the history much damage be do to we plan the essence or kernel be omit and the mere shell retain to make infant school harmonise with the exist one instead of the contrary there be and be however two great exception to this rule the model school at dublin under the government board of education and the glasgow training school for scotland at dublin all be progression the infant department be the best in europe -- i believe the best in the world the other department be equally good in most thing and be well manage as far as regard a good secular education be give and better i think than any similar institution in england at glasgow the same master whom i teach still exist i have not see the school for many year but i hear from those who have be train there that nothing can work better the glasgow committee with mr stow at they head deserve the thanks of the whole community for have apply the principle on which the infant school system be base to juvenile and carry out and prove the practicability of it for the public good i tell they this in lecture at glasgow long ago and exhibit before they child to prove the truth i promulgate both there and in other part of scotland to convince a doubt and cautious public that my view be practicable i may add in pass that i find the scotch take nothing on trust they would listen to my lecture but it always end in my be oblige to prove it with child to david stow much credit be due for have write useful book and perform useful work i be not the man to deprive he of this he just due but i have such faith in the honor of he countryman in general that i believe the time be not far distant when some one of they will give to I that credit which be fairly and justly due to I with respect to the educational movement in scotland no class of man be better able to appreciate and understand the principle on which a system of true education should be base than scotchman and hence though cautious in take up new thing or new view of thing they can do justice to and appreciate that which be worthy of they attention at the time i have be speak of there be no lesson publish suitable for we i search the print shop in the metropolis and with the aid of drawing from friend supply this deficiency next i have suitable lesson print to accompany they and also spell lesson of such word as could be _ act _ and _ explain _ then follow suitable reading lesson print of object and the simple form of geometry when a demand be create for all these the publishing trade take they up and thus the numerous excellent plate and lesson now publish for the purpose of teaching have they first origin i ant thoroughly convince that the first seven year of a child 's life be the _ golden period _ and if i can induce mankind generally to think with I and to act on the principle humbly lay open in the succeed chapter of this book i may feel some consolation that i have not live in vain sure i be that if the world will only give man a fair chance and train he from the beginning with care with prudence with caution with circumspection with freedom and above all with _ love _ he will bear such fruit under the blessing of god as will make even this world as a paradise from childhood up to age have this truth be perfect and strengthen in I and i have no more doubt that it be a truth than i have of my own existence who can look upon a child without admire it without love it with my feeling it be impossible when i compare the reveal will of god -- the scripture with he other great book the book of nature which i read so early in life and read with delight to this present hour i see the one illustrate the other i see that the _ best _ ground produce the _ rankest weed _ -- but not if cultivate what do not care do for all thing in nature why not then for man let he run wild through neglect and undoubtedly he produce weed but this to my mind be a argument in he favor and shew the ground be capable of produce rich fruit when we study the true nature of he mind with the same assiduity as we now do study the nature of he body then will mankind see it in this light begin at the right end and cultivate from the first the beautiful faculty of he own species i say beautiful and be not the bud faculty of childhood both beautiful and lovely feed my lamb saith the lord jesus but reader be they all duly feed in this rich wealthy and christian country how many on the contrary be feed with evil influence street association and be thus poison at every pore until they being be thoroughly contaminate through neglect public and private and when not orphan even parental neglect also and then after have increase we county rate enlarged we prison and build union workhouse -lrb- with respect to moral and training for the young i say pest-house -rrb- we add ragged school we allow they to become contaminate and when that be accomplish we go to work to undo what have be do if this do not succeed we punish by law the poor neglect being for take the poison we really offer they oh rare consistency in this boast age of light and science and learn let we therefore first seek a education worthy of the name and then find the best means of carry it out what exist at present be fundamentally defective especially by begin too late and as regard the plan and principle lay down for infant in many case much have be merely travesty and many of the most essential part entirely set aside or overlook the amount of solid information that may be give to a infant by a wise and judicious mother during the first two year only would appear to many person astonishing i have as clear a recollection of what my mother teach I at two year old as i have of that which she teach I at the age of six the fact crowd upon I so fast that i scarcely know where to stop those lesson be the germ of the invention and babyism -- the hand-clapping arm-twisting and the like -- with which the infant be so delighted in they school and which at the time they be develop about a third of a century since be scout and the inventor look upon as a good natured simpleton or a well-meaning fool i have a rather vivid recollection of this fact but in the end as we proceed many who come to sneer go away with very different feeling the plan be for infant for infant they answer well but i wish i could say that no excresence have grow upon they now the end to be answer in infant education as intend by I be as follow first to feed the child 's faculty with suitable food second -- to simplify and explain everything so as to adapt it properly to those faculty third not to overdo anything either by give too much instruction or instruction beyond they year and thus over-excite the brain and injure the faculty and fourth ever to blend both exercise and amusement with instruction at due interval which be readily effect by a moderate amount of singing alternate with the usual motion and evolution in the schoolroom and the unfettered freedom of the play-ground if these rule be attend to the following result be certain -- a higher state of physical mental and moral health physical health be essential to mental vigor if it be to come to manhood if the physical mental moral and spiritual constitution be properly act upon fed and train it add to the happiness of the child but if this be not do it become miserable and as a consequence restless troublesome and mischievous such fact be make very evident to I by the infant under my care in the earlier part of my career and also have be fully confirm throughout it and they have force I as it be to that more lively interesting and amusing mode of instruction which i have through life endeavor to propagate i find child to be highly delighted with picture and object-lesson hence they value and high importance be so strongly insist on in all my book and the best method of use they distinctly lay down the trouble of rightly use such lesson have cause they to be almost entirely lay aside in very many exist infant school and in too many instance the mere learning and repeat of sound by rote or what may very properly be call the parrot system have be introduce in they place but i yet hope that the good sense of the public will in the end remedy such defect in such case the memory be the only faculty exercise and that at the expense of those that be higher where this be persist in the infant system be render nugatory and my labor be in vain it therefore can not be too strongly insist on and too frequently repeat that one of its most fundamental principle as regard the unfold properly and easily of the intellectual faculty be to communicate _ notion _ and _ idea _ rather than word and sound or at least to let they be do together as before state the gallery have its origin in my desire to teach the child simultaneously it enable a teacher more readily to secure they full attention in all oral lesson and establish a sympathy between they more real fact may be teach child simultaneously by the master than can be teach by all the monitor in a school the little infant should always sit at the bottom and by no means be confine to another room they can see and hear all that be go on and understand it far more than you would suppose though they can not yet tell all they learn and know but when the power of speech come they will surprise you with what they have learn it be therefore a great error to separate child and cut they off from the advantage of all object-lesson and gallery-teaching because they be the youngest they learn more through sympathy and communion with they five or six year elder than the most clever adult can teach they a infant-school be in many respects a community in a state of nature what one do the other almost involuntarily learn the merest infant be not a exception to this rule and therefore the separation in many infant-school of the child invariably into two class sometimes in two room be a great mistake and can only arise from ignorance of the law under which the young mind unfold itself and a misunderstanding of the first principle of infant-teaching perhaps one reason that infant-school teaching have not be keep up to its proper point and true standing be the desire to make a striking shew before the visitor in a school i fear the grounds for this opinion be not slight perhaps nothing have lead more to the multiplication of singing even to the injury of the child the ease with which they learn a metrical piece by _ rote _ and the readiness with which they acquire a tune to it be surprising and as the exhibition of such attainment form a striking sinew in many case little else be teach they but to a sensible and think mind one single piece _ understand _ that be one where clear idea be annex to the word in the mind of the child be worth a hundred where this be not the case intellectual improvement and moral training be not thus easily exhibit especially the latter but on dilligent attention to these the real and permanent utility of the school depend many thing have be teach most unsuitable for young child and that simplicity which be so absolutely requisite both as regard matter and language seriously depart from let but the great principle of teaching through the sens be bear distinctly in mind and of give idea in preference to sound and it will have a strong tendency to put a end to the evil complain of how much may be teach by the simplest object such as a stone form -- weight -- hardness color sound and numerous other quality and property all of which must be clearly understand because they be demonstrate by the sight and other sens once give to the mind a store of clear idea in regular and natural order and a series of word that be distinct and definite in meaning and you have lay a firm foundation whereon to exercise the higher faculty of reflection and reasoning still more be it of paramount importance to educate and bring out the moral faculty to cultivate the sense of right and wrong to enlighten and strengthen the young conscience to teach the love of good and the hatred of evil and to strive to bring the whole be under the new commandment of christ that ye love one another the golden rule to do unto other as ye would that they should do unto you be one of the most powerful precept that can be apply to awaken just moral feeling and innumerable instance must occur in the varied event which happen in a school to bring it home powerfully to the heart and illustrate it appropriately perhaps in nothing have that simplicity of teaching so requisite for the young and so earnestly contend for by I throughout be so much disregard neglect and prevert as in the matter of religion i teach from the first by means of picture properly select scriptural truth and fact history and parable and also suitable text and simple hymn and prayer be add this surely be enough for _ infant _ i think so then and i think so still for a overdo always end in a undoing and the mind of a child should never be cram with that which it can not understand to the neglect of that which it may i have open school for many sect and party and have be sorry to find they so prone to bind the grevious burden of they own peculiar dogma on the feeble mind of little child to the neglect of the weightier matter of the law justice mercy and the love of god i hope a time will come when the distinct precept of christ in this respect will be more faithfully regard the religion for infant should be a simple trust in the love and kindness of god we savior a desire of grace and strength from he and a aim to live thereby in love and duty to they parent and teacher and in kindness and affection with they brother sister and schoolfellow such thing as these they young mind may apprehend feel and apply and thus be strengthen and benefit but scholastic subtelty and controvert dogma such as the grey-headed be perpetually dispute about surely should never be teach to infant by any one who have carefully consider the subject and properly study the nature of the infant mind in all probability advance year will prevent I in future from personally labor much in the cause and from personally overcome objection by present publicly fact that can not be refute it be out of my power now to employ agent and pay they i can not take infant by sea and land to convince unbeliever and silence gainsayer neither circumstance nor remaining strength will allow I to repeat these thing i must trust then to my pen to the thinker amongst we and above all to the good providence of god for further success in behalf of the rise generation those who doubt what i assert about child should recollect one fact -- twenty-seven thousand have pass through my hand and be for a short time under my training and have then be examine by I to convince a doubt public on the spot where they happen to be in each town and country all this for the period of one-third of a century ought not this to entitle I as respects the education of child to say such a thing be right or even such a thing be wrong the abuse of a plan be no argument against its use that it have be abused i be well aware -- that the _ parrot-system _ have be revive and also apply in infant-school it be never intend to injure the young brain by over-excite it or to fill the memory with useless rubbish yet this be do i can not help it i have do and will do my best to prevent such a violation of the very first principle of infant teaching to conclude there be much to be thankful for since the infant-system be evolve a very great improvement have take place in the character of school-book and also in print the graphic illustration and the simplicity of style on a variety of subject be admirable the same may be say with respect to nursery book i see a great improvement in all these this be comforting to one situate as i be and lead I to hope much from the future i trust the intellectual character of the age will advance and not only the intellectual but also the moral and spiritual and that truth and justice religion and piety may be establish amongst we for all generation chapter ii juvenile delinquency _ teacher of theft -- child

of regret as well as of astonishment to the reflect and benevolent that notwithstanding the numerous institution which exist in this country for the education and improvement of the poor and in defiance of the endeavor of we magistracy and police establishment crime should rather increase than diminish many person have be induce to conclude from this fact that we Sunday parochial and national school as well as we bible society and institution of a similar nature be of little or no use absurd as the inference be i have know more than one or two person draw it not consider that although these means may be insufficient to counteract the cause of crime or to prevent all its evil effect yet nevertheless they must certainly check its progress -- that if there be many offender despite of these institution there would doubtless be many more be they not in existence and hence to revile or neglect they be unworthy of good sense or good feeling it be not my purpose in the present chapter to dwell on the commission of crime generally but on juvenile delinquency in particular and on this only so far as regard the case of young child i will therefore make public a collection of fact some of which be obtain at considerable personal hazard and inconvenience which will place it in a clear yet painful light it be say that in the year 1819 the number of boy in london alone who procure a considerable part of they subsistence by pocket-picking and thieve in every possible form be estimate at from eleven to fifteen hundred one man who live in wentworth-street near spitalfield have forty boy in training to steal and pick pocket who be pay for they exertion with a part of the plunder fortunately however for the public this notable tutor of thief be himself convict of theft and transport this system of tutorage be by no means uncommon nor be it confine to the male sex i remember read some time back in the police report of a woman who have entrap _ eight or ten child _ from they parent have train they up and send they out thieve nor be it until one of these infantile depredator be take in the act of steal that this be make known and the child restore to they home here we see eight or ten child probably from the neglect of they parent entice away no doubt by the promise of a few cake or of some other trifling reward and in imminent danger of become confirm thief from which they be rescue by this providential discovery of they situation and we know not how many child may have be lead to evil practice in like manner i will give another instance which occur at the office at queen square -- a female apparently no more than nineteen year of age name jane smith and a child just turn of five year old name mary ann ranniford be put to the bar before edward markland esq the magistrate charge with circulate counterfeit coin in westminster and the county of surrey to a vast extent it appear that the elder prisoner have long be know to be a common utterer of base coin in which she deal very largely with those individual who be agent in london to the manufacturer of the spurious commodity in birmingham she have be once or twice before charge with the offence and therefore she become so notorious that she be necessitate to leave off put the bad money away herself but so determine be she to keep up the traffic that she be in the habit of employ child of tender year to pass the counterfeit money on one occasion two bow street officer observe she at she old trade in company with the child ranniford the officer keep a strict eye upon she movement and see she several time pass something to the little girl and she by the direction of she instructor go into different shop -lrb- such as hosier where she purchase ball of worst pastry-cook tobacconist and fruiterer -rrb- where she pass the bad money and receive in return goods and change on the other side of the bridge the patrole see the prisoner smith deliver something to the child and point out the shop of mr isaac a fruiterer in bridge street westminster the child go in and ask for a juicy lemon and give a counterfeit shilling in payment mr isaac have no suspicion from the tender age of the utterer and its respectable appearance that the money be bad and be about to give change when one of the officer enter and take the deluded child into custody whilst he companion secure the elder prisoner -lrb- smith -rrb- and on search she pocket he find twelve bad shilling some parcel of snuff several ball of cotton and worst and other trifling article which the child have purchase in the course of the day the officer who have secure they learn from the child that she parent live in cross street east lane walworth and that smith have take she out for a walk the patrol instantly communicate the circumstance to the child 's parent who be hard-working honest people and they feeling on hearing that they infant have be seduce into the commission of such a crime can be more easily conceive than describe they state that the woman smith have formerly live in the same street and be frequently give half-penny and cake to the child who would in consequence follow she anywhere some time since she remove to lock 's square lock 's field and they -lrb- the parent -rrb- have not see she for some time on the day refer to the child be play in the street and not find she come home they become alarmed and go everywhere break heart in quest of she but they could hear no tiding of she till the sad news be bring they by the officer the poor mother be now in attendance and she feeling be dreadfully affect and excite the commiseration of all present the prisoner smith make no defense and hold she head down during the examination the child stand by she and take no notice of the proceedings and they be both fully commit for trial the mother on see she infant consign to prison become quite frantic and weep hysterically and have it it not be for the gaoler she would have inflict some violence upon the woman smith for seduce she infant fact of this kind be sufficient to shew the utility indeed i may say the most absolute necessity of provide some means far very far more efficient than those at present in existence for the protection and improvement of the infant poor that they may not thus fall into the hand of evil and design wretch who make a living by encourage the child of the poor to commit crime of the produce of which they themselves take the greatest part the younger the child be the better they suit the purpose of such miscreant because if child be detect in any dishonest act they know well that few person will do more than give the child or child a tap on the head and send they about they business the tenth part of the crime commit by these juvenile offender never come under public view because should any person be rob by a child and detect he in the act he be silence by the by-stander with this remark -- oh he be but a child let he go this time perhaps the poor thing have do it from necessity be in want of bread thus the delinquent be almost sure to escape and instead of be punish be not unfrequently reward for the adventure as be the case in the follow instance have have occasion to walk through shoreditch some time since i see a number of person collect together round a little boy who it appear have steal a brass weight from the shop of a grocer the shopman state that three boy come into the shop for half-an-ounce of candied horehound and that while he be get down the glass which contain it one of they contrived to purloin the weight in question have some suspicion of the boy from the circumstance of have recently lose a number of brass weight he keep he eye on they when he see one put he hand into a box that be on the counter take out the largest weight and then run out of the shop follow by the other two the boy who steal it slip the weight into the hand of one of the other but the shopman have observe this maneuver follow the boy who have the weight who be the youngest of the three could not run very fast he find himself closely pursue throw the weight into the road and when he be take declare that it be not he who take it the man wish to take the child back to the shop in order that he master might do with he as he think proper but the by-stander with a charitable _ zeal _ which evince little _ knowledge _ prevent he one man in particular seem to interest himself much in the boy 's behalf state that he know the child very well and that he have neither father nor mother the child immediately take up this plea and add that he have have no victuals all day the individual before mention then give he a penny and he example be follow by many more till i think the boy have obtain nearly a shilling i put several question to he but be check by this fellow who tell I that as i have give the child nothing i have no right to ask so much and after a great deal of abuse he end by tell I that if i do not take myself off he would give I something for myself feel however a great desire to sift further into the matter i feign to withdraw but keep my eye upon the boy and follow he for nearly two hour until i see he join two other boy one of whom i have not see before and who have a bag with something very heavy in it which i have every reason to believe be weight or something which they have obtain in a similar manner wish to ascertain the fact i approach they but they no sooner perceive I than the little fellow who have be the principal actor in the affair call out _ nose nose _ -- a signal-word no doubt agree upon amongst they -- when they all run down some obscure alley i follow but be knock down as if by accident by two ill-looking fellow who continue to detain I with apology till the boy have get safely away i have little doubt that this be a instance of that organize system of depredation of which i have before speak and that the man who take so active a part at the first be at the bottom of the business and in fact the tutor and employer of the predatory urchin he activity in prevent the boy from be take back to the shop -- he anxiety to promote a subscription for the boy -- and lastly he threat of personal violence if i interfere in the matter by continue to question the child -- all these circumstance confirm I in the opinion it be only by the knowledge of this fact -- the association of infant offender with those of maturer and hardened habit -- that we can account for such case as the follow -- on the 17th of July 1823 a child _ only seven year old _ be bring before the magistrate at lambeth street office charge with frequently rob he mother and be order to be lock up all night in the gaol-room in the evening however when he mother return he force he way out of the room and behave with such violence that the attendant be oblige to iron both he hand and leg there can be no doubt that this child have be for a long time under the instruction and evil influence of some old and hardened offender he must indeed have undergo much training before he could have arrive at such a pitch of hardihood as to make it necessary to handcuff and fetter a child of so tender a age and to enable he to hold even the magistrate officer and he own parent at defiance the follow case afford further proof of the same lamentable truth the first be extract from a morning paper of the 20th of September 1824 a little boy not more than _ six year of age _ be bring before the lord mayor at the mansion house on Saturday the 18th instant have be find in a warehouse where he have secrete himself for the purpose of thieve at a late hour on Friday night a watchman be go he round when on try a warehouse in which there be much valuable property to see whether it be safe he hear the little prisoner cry the person who have the care of the warehouse be rouse and he be take out in he fright he acknowledge that a man have take he from he mother and induce he upon a promise of reward to steal into the warehouse upon a concerted signal he be to act as direct by the fellow on the outside but become terrify at be confine so long in the dark he have cry out and discover himself he mother come forward and receive a good character as the wife of a hard-working man the lord mayor give she son up to she with a injunction to act carefully and strictly with he there be reason to believe he say that several considerable robbery have be recently commit by means of child like the prisoner who steal in and remain conceal until midnight when they give admission to the robber the police should have they eye upon he the other instance be from a report of one of the session in london : -- william hart a urchin _ seven year of age _ be indict for steal twenty-two shilling in money number from the person of mary conner the prosecutrix state that on the day name in the indictment she take twenty-five shilling to get something out of pledge but as there be a crowd in mary-le-bone assemble to witness a fight she be induce to join the mob while stand there she feel something move in she pocket and put she hand outside she clothes she lay hold of what prove to be the hand of the prisoner which she hold until she have give he a slap on the face and then she let he go but on feeling in she pocket she discover that the theft have actually be commit and that only three shilling be leave a constable take the urchin into custody and accuse he of rob she of twenty-two shilling the prisoner say ' i have twenty-two shilling in my pocket but it be my mother 's money she get so drunk she give I she money to take care of ' the officer state to the same effect as the prosecutrix and add that _ in a secret pocket in he jacket he find fourteen shilling and sixpence it be the practice of gang of pickpocket to have a child like this to commit the robbery and hand the plunder to they _ witness go to he parent who say he have be absent seven week and they would have nothing to do with he mr baron garrow in feeling term lament that a child of such tender year should be so depraved he add ' i suppose gentleman i need only to ask you to deliver you verdict ' he lordship then observe that he would consult with he learn brother as to the best manner of dispose of the prisoner they at length decide that although it might seem harsh the court would record against he fourteen year ' transportation and no doubt government would place he in some school if he behave well there the sentence might not be carry into full effect i remember a query be once put to I by a person who visit the spitalfield infant school at the time it be under my management : how can you account for the fact that notwithstanding there be so many old and experienced thief detect convict and send out of the country every session we can not perceive any dimunition of the number of such character but that other seem always to supply they place the foregoing instance of the systematize instruction of young delinquent by old adept in the art of pilfer afford i think a satisfactory answer the interrogatory the dexterity of experienced thief shew that no small degree of care and attention be bestow on they tuition the first task of novice i have be inform be to go in company of three or fours through the respectable street and square of the metropolis and with a old knife or a similar instrument to wrench off the brass-work usually place over the key-hole of the area-gates & c which they sell at the marine store-shop and they be say sometimes to realize three or four shilling a day by this mean wish to be satisfy on the point i have walk round many of the square in town and in more than a solitary experiment have find that _ not one gate in ten _ have any brass-work over the key-hole it have moreover be evidently wrench off -- a small piece of the brass still remain on many of the gate have practice this branch of the profession a considerable time and become adept in its execution the next step i have be inform be to steal the handle and brass knocker from door which be do by take out the screw with a small screw-driver : these be disposed of in the same manner as the former thing till the young pilferer be progressively qualify for steal brass weight & c and at length become expert thief the following fact will shew what extensive depredation young child be capable of commit i have insert the whole as it appear in the public papers : -- _ union hall _ _ shop lifting _ -- yesterday two little girl sister very neatly dress _ one nine _ and the _ other seven year of age _ be put to the bar charge by mr cornell linen-draper of high street newington with have steal a piece of print calico from the corner of he shop mr cornell state that the child come to he shop yesterday morning and while he be engage with he customer at the further end of the shop he happen to cast he eye where the prisoner be and observe the oldest roll up a large piece of print calico and put it into a basket which she little sister carry : the witness immediately advance to she and ask if she have take any thing from off the counter but she positively assert that she have not however on search she basket the calico be find together with a piece of muslin which mr cornell identify as belong to he and to have be take in the above way mr allen question the eldest girl about the robbery but she positively deny any knowledge as to how or in what manner the calico and muslin have get into she basket frequently appeal to she little sister to confirm the truth of what she declare when ask if she have ever be charge with any offence she reply ' o yes sir some time back i be accuse of steal a watch from a house but i do not do it ' the magistrate observe that the father should be make acquaint with the circumstance and in the mean time give the gaoler instruction that the two little delinquent should be take care of hall the officer state that he have information that there be a quantity of goods which have be steal by the prisoner conceal in a certain desk in the house of the father and that a great deal of steal property would in all probability be find there if a search warrant be grant as the two unfortunate child be believe to be most extensive depredator mr allen immediately grant the warrant and hall accompany by mr cornell proceed to the residence of the father of the child who be a auctioneer and appraiser at 12 lyon street newington hall return in half a hour with the father in he custody and produce a great quantity of black silk handkerchief which he have find on the premise but the desk which have be speak of by he informer as contain steal property he have find quite empty the father when question by the witness as to whether he have any duplicate of property in he possession positively deny that fact at the office he be search and about fifty duplicate be find in he pocket most of which be for silk handkerchief and shawl there be also a few ring for the possession of which the prisoner could not satisfactorily account he be ask why he have assure the officer he have no duplicate he reply that he have not say so but mr cornell who be present during the search aver that the prisoner have most positively declare that he have not a pawnbroker 's duplicate in he possession mr watt a linen-draper of harper street kent road state that he attend in consequence of see the police report in the newspaper describe the two child he immediately recognize the two little girl as have frequently call at he shop for trifling article and add that he have be rob of a variety of silk handkerchief and shawl and he have no doubt but that the prisoner be the thief it be they practice he say to go into a shop and call for a quarter of a yard of muslin and while the shopkeeper be engage the eldest would very dexterously slip whatever article be nearest to she little sister who be train to the business and would thrust the steal property into a basket which she always carry for that purpose mr watt identify the silk handkerchief as he property and say that they have be steal in the above manner by the prisoner the father be ask where he have get the handkerchief he reply that he have buy they from a pedlar for half-a-crown a piece at he door however he eldest daughter contradict he by acknowledge that she sister have steal they from the shop of mr watt he become dreadfully agitate and then say -- ` what could i say surely i be not to criminate my own child ' mr allen observe that there be a clear case against the two child but after consult with the other magistrate he be of opinion that the youngest child should be give up into the charge of the parish officer of newington as she be too young to go into a prison and desire that the other girl should be remand in order to have some of the pledge goods produce the father be commit in default of bail for receive steal goods the child have since be find guilty the prosecutor state that the family consist of five child _ not one of whom could read or write _ another very cruel practice of these young delinquent be to go into some chandler shop as slily as possible and take the first opportunity of steal the till with its contents there be always some older thief ready to take charge of it as soon as the child remove it from the shop -lrb- a -rrb- many a poor woman have have to lament the loss of she till with its contents take by a child perhaps scarcely six year of age there be always a plan lay down for the child to act upon should he be unable to obtain possession of the till himself he be instruct to pretend that he have miss he way and to inquire for some street near the spot or he will address she with please ma'am can you tell I what it be o'clock the unsuspecting woman with the greatest kindness possible shew the child the street he inquire for or leave the shop to ascertain the hour and for she civility she be sure to find herself rob when she return by some of the child 's companion should he be detect in actual possession of the property he be instruct to act he part in the most artful manner by pretend that some man send he into the shop to take it who tell he that he would give he sixpence to buy cake -lrb- footnote a : so complete be the science of pilfer render by its perpetrator that they have even a peculiar vocabulary of they own render they conversation to those who may chance to overhear they as mysterious and incomprehensible as though they be converse in a foreign tongue for instance the scutcheon they steal from the key hole be call _ porcupine _ brass weight _ luey _ while purloin the contents of a till be call _ take the ding _ in short they have a peculiar name for almost every thing -rrb- it be not uncommon for these young offender to stop child whom they may meet in the street unprotected and either by artifice or violence take from they they hat necklace & c thus initiate themselves as it be into the desperate crime of assault and highway robbery young as the subject of the foregoing narration mostly be i have little doubt they pupilage commence at a much earlier age they could not otherwise have attain so much proficiency in the practice of crime and hardihood on detection however possible it maybe think to reclaim child of so tender a age i be convince that thief of more advanced year become so thoroughly pervert in they will and understanding as to be incapable of perceive the disgrace of they conduct or the enormity of the offence i be once tell by a old thief that thieve be he profession and he have therefore a right to follow it and i could plainly discover from further conversation with he that he have establish in himself a opinion that thieve be no harm provide he use no violence to the person he seem indeed to have no other idea of the rights of property than that describe as the maxim of a celebrated scottish outlaw -- that they should take who have the power and they should keep who can when this most lamentable state be reach it be to be fear all mode of punishment as corrective be useless and the only thing leave be to prevent further depredation by banishment the incorrigibility which a child may attain who have once associate with thief at a early age be apparent from the follow fact richard leworthy aged fourteen be indict for steal five sovereign the property of william newl he master the prosecutor state that he reside in the commercial road and be by business a tailor the prisoner have be he apprentice for four month up to the 28th of August when he commit the robbery on that day he give he five pound to take to mr well of bishopsgate street to discharge a bill he never go nor do he return home he do not hear of he for three week when he find he at windsor and apprehend he the prisoner admit have apply the money to he own use he be find at a public house and say he have spend all he money except one shilling and six penny a shopman in the service of mr well state that in August last the witness owe he master a sum of money he know the prisoner he do not bring money to they shop either on or since the 28th of August the prisoner make no defense but call he master who say he receive he from the refuge for the destitute and have a good character with he he would not take he back again mr wontner state that he have receive two communication from the rev mr crosby the chaplain of the institution state they would not interfere on he behalf the jury return a verdict of _ guilty _ mr justice park observe that the best course would be to send he out of the country here we see that notwithstanding the discipline he have undergo and the instruction he have receive during he confinement in the establishment of the refuge for the destitute he have not be more than four month from that place before he fall into he old habit it be moreover to be remark that such have be he conduct during he confinement that the director of the establishment think themselves war rant in give a good character with he they be probably little surprised on hearing of this relapse on the part of the boy -- experience have doubtless teach they it be no uncommon thing and we plainly see they be convince that all further attempt at reclaim he be useless the facility with which property maybe dispose of should be mention as a powerful inducement to crime the follow case suggest it to the mind : thoma jackson a mere child not more than nine year of age be charge some time ago at the town hall with commit a burglary on the premise of mr jame whitelock a master builder griffith 's rent st thoma 's southwark mr whitelock it appear reside in a old mansion formerly a inn which he have divide into two separate tenement occupy one part himself and let the other to the parent of the prisoner in this division he have deposit building material to a considerable amount one hundred weight of which in iron holdfast hinge nail clamp & c he miss one day on enter the room the door of which have be block by a large copper and the partition door force the character of the prisoner being of the worst description he be apprehend when he confess he have take all the property and disposed of it to a woman name priscillum fletcher the keeper of a marine store 34 jame street the receiver who be _ the last of the family that have not be either hang or transport _ refuse to swear to the prisoner though she admit she believe he be the person she buy the property produce from at the rate of one penny for each three pound it be prove to be worth three half-penny per pound alderman jj smith regret that the deficiency of evidence prevent he send the young delinquent for trial and thereby rescue he from a ignominious death and tell mr priscillum who be all modesty that he be convinced she have perjure herself -- and not to exult at she own escape from transportation a reward he could not help consider she richly merit and which in due season she would doubtless receive the hardened child laugh during the hearing and on be sentence by the oath of the officer as a reputed thief spit at he accuser and exclaim as he be take from the bar to be convey to brixton -- be this all i 'll torment you yet to add one more case i may state that at the exeter session some time since two child be convict who it be believe be not above ten year of age previously to this they have be convict of felony and have suffer six month imprisonment at bodmin and it appear that two year before they start alone from bristol on this circuit of youthful depredation have collect the foregoing instance of juvenile delinquency and present they to the public i can not refrain from adduce a few other case which come under my own observation whilst conduct the spitalfield ' infant school several instance of dishonesty in the child occur on one occasion the mother herself come to complain of a little boy not more than four year old on the follow grounds she state that be oblige to be out at work all day as well as she husband she be under the necessity of leave the child by themselves she have three besides the little boy of whom she be complain have to pay she rent she put eighteen-penny for that purpose in a cup at the top of a cupboard on step home to give the child they dinner she find the boy at the cupboard mount on a chair which again be place on the top of a table on look for the money she find four-penny already go one penny of this she find in he pocket the rest he have divide amongst the other child that they might not tell of he after this relation i keep a strict watch on the child and three or four day afterwards the child detect he open my desk and take half-penny out of it they inform I of this and while they be bring he up to I the half-penny drop out of he hand i detect he in many other very bad action but have reason to hope that by suitable discipline and instruction he be effectually cure of he sad propensity about the same time i observe two little child very near the school-house in close conversation and from they frequently look at a fruit-stall that be near i feel inclined to watch they have previously hear from some of the pupil that they have frequently see child in the neighborhood steal oyster and other thing i accordingly place myself in a convenient situation and have not long to wait for the moment they see there be no one pass they go up to the stall the eldest walking alongside the other apparently to prevent he be see whilst the little one snatch a orange and convey it under he pinafore with all the dexterity of a experienced thief the youngest of these child be not four year old and the eldest apparently not above five there be reason to believe this be not the first time they have be guilty of steal though perhaps unknown to they parent as i have find to be the case in other instance another little boy in the school whose mother keep a little shop frequently bring money with he -- as much as three-penny at a time on question the child how he come by it he always say that he mother give it to he and i think there be no reason to doubt he word for there be something so prepossessing in he appearance that at the time i could not doubt the truth of he story but find that the child spend a great deal of money in fruit cake & c and still have some remain i find it advisable to see the mother and to my astonishment find it all a fiction for she have not give he any and we be both at a loss to conceive how he obtain it the child tell _ I _ he mother give it to he and he tell he _ mother _ that it be give to he at school but when he be confront with we both not a word would he say it be evident therefore that he have obtain it by some unfair means and we both determine to suspend we judgment and to keep a strict eye on he in future nothing however transpire for some time -- i follow he home several time but see nothing amiss at length i receive notice from the mother that she have detect take money out of the till in she little shop it then come out that there be some boy in the neighborhood who act as banker to he and for every two penny which he receive he be allow one penny for take care of it it seem that the child be afraid to bring any more money to school on account of be so closely question as to where he obtain it and this probably induce he to give more to the boy than he otherwise would have do suffice it however to say that both child at length be find out and the mother declare that the child conduct she to some old board in the wash-house and underneath they there be upward of a shilling which he have pilfer at various time the reader may remember too that during the autumn of 1833 a boy of _ fourteen committed suicide _ and that another of the same age be convict of the dreadful crime of _ murder _ it appear he know a boy a little younger than himself who be go to a distance with some money and have take a pocket-knife with he he way-lay he and threaten to murder he the poor little victim kneel down -- offer he he money he knife and all he have and say he would love he all the day of he life if he would spare he and never tell what have happen but the pathetic and forcible appeal which would have melt many a ruffian-heart be vain : -- the little monster stab he in the throat and then rob he on he trial he discover no feeling and he even hear he sentence with the utmost indifference and without a tear it would have be easy to multiply case of juvenile delinquency both those which have be bring under the cognizance of the law and those which have come to my own knowledge but i think enough have be relate to shew how early child may and do become depraved i have purposely give most of they with as few remark of my own as possible that they may plead they own cause with the reader and excite a desire in he bosom to enter with I in the next chapter on a inquiry into the cause of such early depravity since the above incident and fact be observe and report from the public print be record general attention have be draw more fully to the very great increase of ignorance demoralization and crime amongst the lower class both old and young these thing call on we most loudly for active effort and exertion and it become the patriot and philanthropist but especially the christian to look around to think and to consider what effectual means may be find and what efficient plan may be adopt to strike the evil fatally at its root and cause it to wither away if these thing be not do the moral pestilence must increase and eventually deprive we of all that be dear to we as man and citizen chapter iii cause of early crime _ degrade condition of parent -- dreadful effect of drunkenness -- neglect of child inevitable and wilful -- the tutorship of wicked companion -- trick of pantomime injurious -- mischief arise from send child to pawnbroker -- fair demoralize -- all kind of beg to be repress _ \* \* \* \* \* why thus surprise to see the infant race tread the path of vice they eye can trace they _ parent _ ' footstep in the way they go : what shame what fear then can they young heart know \* \* \* \* \* appalling as the _ effect _ of juvenile delinquency be i think we may discover a principal cause of they in the present condition and habit of the adult part of the labor class we shall find very frequently that infant crime be the only natural produce of evil by the infallible means of precept and example i do not intend to assert that the majority of parent amongst the poor actually encourage they child in the commission of theft we may indeed fear that some do as in the instance of the two little girl detect in shop-lifting whose case be detail in the precede chapter but still i should hope that such fact be not frequent if however they do not give they positive encouragement in pilfer the example they set be often calculate to deprave the heart of the child and amongst other evil consequence to induce dishonesty whilst in other case we find that from peculiar circumstance the child be deprive during the whole day of the controle presence of a parent and be expose to all the poisonous contamination which the street of large city afford and hence appear another cause of evil here child come in contact with maturer vice and be often draw by its influence from the path of innocence as we have already see in many instance what resistance can the infant make to the insidious serpent which thus as it be steal into its cradle and infuse they poison into its soul the guardian of its helplessness be heedless or unconscious of its danger and alas it have not the fabled strength of the infant hercule to crush its venomous assailant surely such a view of the frequent origin of crime must awaken we commiseration for its miserable victim and excite in we a desire to become the defender of the unprotected it will however be say by some where be the natural guardian of the child where be its parent be we to encourage they neglect of duty by become they substitute it be they business to look after they child and not ours frequently have i hear such sentiment put forth and sometimes by person in whom i know they be rather owe to a want of reflection than of philanthropy but a want of thought or of feel it must certainly be because on no principle of reason or humanity can we make the unnatural conduct of father and mother a plea for withhold we protection and assistance from the helpless object of they cruelty and neglect if we do so we not only neglect we duty towards such child but permit the growth and extension of the evil we must recollect that they will not merely play they own wicked part during they life but will also become model to the next generation it should be remember here that i be treat of a evil which extend itself to all class of society i be appeal to the prudence of man that they may for they own sake investigate its cause i shall hereafter appeal to they as philanthropist and still more urgently as christian that they may examine the merit of the remedy i shall propose the culpability of many parent be beyond dispute they not only omit to set they child good example and give they good advice but on the contrary instil into they mind the first rudiment of wickedness and lead they into the path of vice they home present scene which human nature shudder at and which it be impossible truly to describe there be parent who work at home have every opportunity of train up they child in the way they should go if they be incline so to do instead of this we often find in the case of the father that they be so lose to every principle of humanity that as soon as they receive they wages they leave they home and hasten with eager step to the public house nor do they re-pass its accursed threshold till the vice-fattening landlord have receive the greater part of the money which should support they half-fed half-clothed wife and child and till they have qualify themselves by intoxication to act worse than brute on they return home to man of this description it matter not whether or not they child be prove themselves skilful imitator of they evil example -- they may curse and swear lie and steal -- so long as they can enjoy the society of they pot companion it be to they a matter of total indifference during my superintendence of the first school i have a painful facility of examine these matter frequently when i have inquire the cause of the wretched plight in which some of the child be send to the school -- perhaps with scarcely a shoe to they foot sometimes altogether without -- i have hear from they mother the most heart-rending recital of the husband 's misconduct one family in particular i remember consist of seven child two of whom be in the school four of they be support entirely by the exertion of the mother who declare to I that she do not receive a shilling from they father for a month together all the money he get he keep to spend at the public-house and he family for what he care might go naked or starve he be not only a great drunkard but a reprobate into the bargain beating and abuse the poor woman who thus endeavor to support he child by she labor the evil do not always stop here drive to the extreme of wretchedness by she husband 's conduct the woman sometimes take to drink likewise and the poor babe be ten thousand time more pitiable than orphan i have witness the revolting sight of a child lead home both father and mother from the public-house in a disgusting state of intoxication with tear and entreaty i have see the poor infant vainly endeavor to restrain they from increase they drunkenness by go into the house on they way home they have shake off the clinging child who in the greatest anxiety wait without to resume its painful task know all the time perhaps that whilst its parent be thus throw away they money there be not so much as a crust of bread to appease its hunger at home let it not be think that this be a overcharge picture of fact it be but a faint a very faint and imperfect sketch of reality which defy exaggeration case of such depravity on the part of mother i with much pleasure confess to be comparatively rare maternal affection be the preventive but what let I ask can be hope of the child of such parent what be they character likely to become under such tuition with such example before they eye need they leave they home to seek contamination or to learn to do evil and here i must say if i be ask to point out in the metropolis or any large city the greatest nuisance the worst bane of society the most successful promoter of vice -- i should without a moment 's hesitation point to the first public-house or spirit dealer 's that meet my view nor can i in speaking of the cause of juvenile delinquency omit to say i think these house indirectly a very great cause of it why i think so my reader will readily conceive from what i have already say i be sure that satan have no temple in which he be so devoutly worship or so highly honor as the ale-house -- no priest be so devoted as its landlord -- no follower be so zealous in he behalf as its frequenter let any one in the evening visit the home of the labor class in a poor neighborhood and he will find in many case a barely-furnished room a numerous family of small child -- perhaps forget the pang of hunger in the obliviousness of sleep -- a wife with care-worn feature sit in solitary wretchedness ruminate on want she know not how to supply -- namely clothes and food for she child on the morrow and on debt which she have no means of discharging but where be he who should be share she care bidding she be of good cheer and devise with she some means of alleviate they mutual distress where be the father of the sleep babe the husband of the watchful wife go to the public-house you will see he there with a host of he companion of like character and circumstance smoking drinking singing blaspheme gambling -- ruin he health spend he money as jovial as though he have no wretched wife no starve babe at home and as lavish of money which should procure they food as the man who be thrive on he excess could wish he to be i never look on a public-house without consider it as the abode of the evil genius of the neighborhood the despoiler of industry the destroyer of domestic comfort and heartily do i wish that some means could be devise for abolish these resort of wickedness that some legislative enactment may render it unlawful for any one to keep such place with respect to a peculiar sort of beverage it have be declare to be illegal to afford its purchaser accommodation for drink it on the premise why not extend it to other liquor i know this would be pronounce a infringement on english liberty the worst of man would raise this outcry against the measure but surely it should rather be call a preventive of english licentiousness all good man would consider it as such i would not rob the labourer of he daily allowance of a beverage which be believe by many to be of essential service when take in moderation but i would have he drink it at home that he wife and child may participate in he enjoyment perhaps it will be say a man closely confine to labor all day need some relaxation from domestic care -- that this can only be find in change of scene and in social company i will concede this the plea of health though often speciously advance can not be deny but be it necessary for he health that this change of scene should be find in a close tap-room within a few yard of he home where he drink to a ruinous excess till a late hour -- breathe all the while a hot atmosphere of tobacco-smoke be it not possible to obtain the change of scene and the relaxation of social converse by mutual visit amongst friend similarly situate -- by a ramble to the suburb -- or in case where the daily occupation afford too little opportunity for exercise be there not place establish for gymnastic exercise -- and might not other be form for the like purpose certain i be that the abolition of public-house in large city as place of daily resort for the adult labor poor would be attend with the most salutary consequence i know of nothing that must so certainly tend to they improvement both in character and circumstance no man can witness the scene and doings of many person who attend the new beer-house without pain and regret that ever a act of parliament be pass to legalize such place i have visit some hundred of such throughout the country and can positively assert that the demoralising tendency of too many be awful we magistrate must be more careful in grant licence or the effort of the wise and good will be neutralize by the evil concoct at such place the old inkeeper have a character and capital at stake the new beerhouse-keeper i should say a majority of they at least have neither and consequently be less cautious have less to lose whatever the end of the legislature might have be in enable the poor to procure a good and cheap article more easily to be drunk on or off the premise the thing have not answer the end and no one can deny who will take the trouble to visit such place in different county that the _ act _ have be a miserable failure and have be the fruitful source of crime and immorality what a lesson be this for speculative short sighted legislator another measure should then be adopt i would say -- destroy the facility of spirit-drinking by lay on a heavy duty it be in vain that interested sophistry would plead its benefit in particular case -- such for instance as the ludicrous plea of the needfulness of dram for market-woman on wet and frosty morning -lrb- a -rrb- set these specious benefit against the dreadful result to man 's health and pocket from the present low price of spirit and they consequent enormous consumption and then let common sense and honesty deliver its judgment i have speak thus candidly and at length upon the subject in the present chapter though somewhat out of place because my feeling would not allow I to be less plain or more brief or to postpone the matter to a more convenient season perhaps in talking of legislative alteration i have be wander upon forbid ground if so in return to my proper path i will comfort myself with this thought : -- the progress of improvement however slow be sure and it be certainly advance in this country i require no other assurance than the establishment of infant school and mechanic 's -lrb- footnote a : some conception of the fearful height which drunkenness have attain may be gather from the fact that in 1829 the quantity of distilled spirit on which the duty be pay in the three kingdom amount to 23000000 of gallon to form a due estimate however of the actual consumption a immense quantity must be add obtain by smuggling of the rum import for home consumption allow for that re-export the quantity be 5000000 of gallon of brandy and other article import 1500000 gallon make a total with the omission of all on which the duty be evade of 30000000 of gallon of ardent spirit consume in the year five million of revenue grow out of this but it cost the people 15000000_l _ sterling a which would have pay half-a-year 's interest of the national debt -rrb- no person say sir astley cooper have greater hostility to dram drinking than myself insomuch that i never suffer any ardent spirit in my house -- think _ they evil spirit _ -- and if the poor could witness the white liver the dropsy the shattered nervous system which i love see as the consequence of drinking they would be aware that _ spirit _ and _ poison _ be synonymous term institution it _ will _ advance and what the legislature may never be able to accomplish the spirit of improvement eventually will but have consider those case in which wilful neglect and bad example may be charge upon the parent we should not forget to tell those who object to we interference in the duty of a child 's natural protector that it be not in every instance from _ wilful _ neglect on they part that they child be leave unprotected in the street the circumstance of the labor class be such in many case that they be compel to leave they child either wholly unprotected or in the charge of some one who frequently become a betrayer instead of a defender the father perhaps go to he daily labor in the morning before the child be out of bed and do not return till they be in bed again at night the mother go out in like manner the earnings of the husband be insufficient for the maintenance of the family and the child be intrust throughout the day to the care of some girl whose parent be as poor as themselves and be glad to let she earn something towards she support number of little girl thus go out before they be twelve year old and teach the little child all they know -- commonly to be deceitful and not unfrequently to be dishonest the parent careless or unsuspecting only make inquiry when they return home if the child have be good and quiet and of course receive a answer in the affirmative in the course of a few year the evil consequence begin to show themselves and then the good folk wonder how or when the seed of such depravity could have be sow many i know will be incline to smile at the insignificancy of the cause point out i can only say it be from such spring however regard that the great stream of vice be supply and what we laugh at now for its insignificant origin will hereafter in its maturity laugh at we for we impotence in vainly endeavor to stem it what be parent to do with they child situate as those be of whom we have just speak and very many be so situate be it possible for they to perform they duty as protector of they child it require all they time to labor for they support and they therefore leave they unavoidably either in such hand as we have describe or to take care of themselves to range the street and form such association as may there happen to fall in they way they get into company with older delinquent and become first they instrument and then they associate till at length they find they way into a gaol this be no delusive way of accounting for the matter -- it be a solution which experience and observation have teach and establish i have trace the progress of delinquency in actual life from its earliest stage -- from the little tremble pilferer of the apple-stall not more than four or five year old to the confirm thief of nine or ten year -- who have be in gaol three or four time and be as proud of he dexterity in thieve and hardihood under punishment as he could have be of the most virtuous accomplishment or the most become fortitude the infant thief conscious of shame and tremble with fear will tell you on detection that tommy or billy some older associate set he to do it you let he go : he join he companion who laugh at the story he tell ridicule he for he fear praise he for he dexterity and rejoice in he escape it will be very easy to imagine how under a course of such treatment the young offender so soon dismiss both shame and fear and learn to forget everything but the gain and glory of he crime it be no small matter of credit with older thief -- -lrb- by older thief i still mean boy of nine or ten year old -rrb- -- to have under they tuition two or three pupil i have see in my walk as many as seven or eight sally forth from the alley in the neighborhood of spitalfield under the command as it be of a leader a boy perhaps not more than nine or ten year old i have watch they plan and have notice that it be usual to send first the youngest boy to attempt the theft -- perhaps the object to be obtain be only a bun from the open window of a pastry-cook 's shop if he fail another be send whilst the rest be lurk at the corner of some court ready to flee in case they companion be detect and i have sometimes see that after all the rest have fail either from want of skill or the too great vigilance of the shop-keeper the boy who act as leader have start out and by a display of superior dexterity would have carry off the prize have it not happen that some one be thus purposely watch he conduct when detect if a old offender he will either look you in tire face with the greatest effrontery and a expression of defiance or he will feign to cry and tell you he be hungry have no father nor mother & c though frequently on further inquiry i have find the whole story to be false alas there be _ one _ class of child with whom i know not how to deal i mean those without the natural protector the man can for a more trifle get rid of all responsibility though in general most able to bear it the woman have the dead weight which often prove the destruction of she offspring and herself suicide and murder be the first-fruits frequently to she but she love she offspring and perhaps he who deceive she and for both they sake fight the battle against fearful odds for a few year at least she will not last long at length she sink she die where oh where be the guardian for she child reader there be many thousand of such what become of they but there be other mother of this class more ignorant have less of feeling no education no training they advance from bad to worse until they have five or six child here be circumstance for child to come into the world grievously against they what become of these to avoid painful detail i will answer the question they become a pest to society each a demoralizer of other live upon the public -- as tramp beg impostor thief teacher of thief and _ cost the country more than five time they number bear under other and better circumstance _ god grant that spiritual light philosophical light and scientific light unite may enable we to find the remedy the two grand cause of juvenile delinquency we have see then to be the evil example of parent themselves and the bad association which child form at a early age when through neglect they be suffer to be in the street in the first instance the parent of the child be wholly without excuse in the second though in some case we may blame they in other we can not justly do so but must admit as a exculpation the unfortunate circumstance of they condition in life it would be easy to shew by a multitude of instance the evil effect produce on child of a tender age by street association but i think enough have be say to convince every reflect mind that it be highly necessary that we should interfere in behalf of child so situated and i shall conclude the present chapter by some remark on the various habit and practice of the poor class which have at least a injurious tendency on the character of the rise generation as child be such imitative being i can not help make a few observation on the trick which be usually introduce into we _ pantomime _ it be well know that those of the clown form a principal part of the entertainment it be also equally well know that the pantomime be particularly design to amuse child for which reason they be generally represent during the christmas holiday if however they be merely intend to _ amuse _ they they who have introduce they have perhaps gain they object but what kind of _ instruction _ they afford i shall here attempt to shew i do not recollect to have see a pantomime myself without _ pilfer _ be introduce under every possible form such as shop lifting pick pocket & c & c can it then be for a moment suppose improbable that child after have witness these exhibition should endeavor to put the thing into practice whenever a opportunity offer and try whether they can not take a handkerchief from a gentleman 's pocket with the same ease and dexterity as the clown in the play do or if unsuccessful in this part of the business that they should try they prowess in carry off a shoulder of mutton from a butcher 's shop -- a loaf from a baker -- or lighter article from the pastry-cool fruiterer or linen-draper for have see the dexterity of the clown in these case they will not be at a loss for method to accomplish by sleight of hand they several purpose in my humble opinion child can not go to a better place for instruction in these matter or to a place more calculate to teach they the art of pilfer to perfection than to the theater when pantomime be perform to say that the person who write and introduce these piece be in want of _ sense _ may not be true but i must charge they with a want of sufficient thought right feeling and principle in not calculate on they baneful effect on the rise generation for whose amusement it appear they be chiefly produce many unfortunate person who have hear sentence of death pass upon they or who be now suffer under the law in various way have have to lament that the _ first seed of vice be sow in they mind while view the pilfer trick of clown in pantomime _ alas too little do we calculate on the direful effect of this species of amusement on the future character of the young we first permit they mind to be poison by offer they the draught and then punish they by law for take it do not the wide world afford a variety of material sufficient for virtuous imitation without descend to that which be vicious it be much easier to make a pail of pure water foul than it be to make a pail of foul water pure it must not be suppose that i wish to sweep off every kind of amusement from the juvenile part of society but i do wish to sweep off all that have a pernicious tendency the limit which i have prescribe to myself will not allow I to enter more at large into this subject otherwise i could produce a number of fact which would prove most unquestionably the propriety of discontinue these exhibition a conversation which i once hear between some boy who be play at what be call _ pitch-in-the-hole _ will prove the truth of my assertion bill say one of the boy to the other when do you go to the play last on Monday night be the reply do you see the new pantomime -- yes well do you see any fun -- yes i believe i do too i see the clown _ bone _ a whole _ hank _ of sausage and put they into he pocket and then pour the gravy in after they you would have split you side with laughing have you be there ab and cd be with I and they laugh as much as i do and what do you think ab do the next night -- how should i know -- why reply the other he and cd _ bone _ about two pound of sausage from a pork shop and we have they for supper this conversation i hear from a window which look into a ruinous place where boy assemble to toss up for money and other game this fact alone without record any more be sufficient to show the evil of which i have be speak and i do most sincerely hope that those person who have any influence over the stage will use they utmost endeavor speedily to expunge every thing thus calculate to promote evil inclination in the mind of child and vicious habit in the life of man it be not impossible that scenic exhibition might be make a most powerful means of instruction to the young and tend to promote virtue and happiness as well as be a means of rational amusement but as they now exist they extirpation be desirable as i have have much experience from be bring up in london i be perfectly aware of the evil impression and dangerous temptation that the child of the poor be liable to fall into and therefore most solemnly affirm that nothing in my view would give so much happiness to the community at large as the take care of the affection of the infant child of the poor there be moreover a practice very prevalent among the poor which do greater mischief than the people be generally aware of and that be send they child to the _ pawnbroker _ it be well know that many person send child scarcely seven year of age to these people with pledge of various sort a thing that can not be too severely condemn i know a instance of a little boy find a shawl in the street and be in the habit of go to the pawnbroker 's for he mother instead of take the shawl home to he parent he actually pawn it and spend all the money which might never have be know by he parent have not the mother find the duplicate in he pocket it be evident then that many parent have no one but themselves to blame for the misconduct of they child for have this child not be accustom to go to such a place _ for he parent _ he would never have think of go there _ for himself _ and the shawl most likely would have be carry home to _ they _ indeed there be no know where such a system will end for if the child be suffer to go to such place they may in time pledge that which do not belong to they and so easy be the way of turn any article into money that we find most young thief of both sex when apprehend have some duplicate about they those person therefore who take pledge of child -lrb- contrary to the act of parliament whether they know it or not -rrb- ought to be severely reprimand for i be persuade that such conduct be productive of very great mischief indeed take child to _ fair _ be another thing which be also productive of much harm at the commencement of the first school seventy or eighty child be frequently absent whenever there be a fair near london but the parent be afterwards cure of this and we seldom have above twenty absentee at fair-time several of the child have tell I that they parent wish to take they but they request to be permit to come to school instead indeed the parent find that they can enjoy themselves better without they child be very willing to leave they at school it be a difficult matter to persuade grown person of the impropriety of attend fair who have be accustom to it when child but child be easily persuade from it for if they be properly entertain at school they will not have the least desire to go to such place i can not quit this subject without relate one or two more very bad habit to which child be addict and which be perhaps fit subject for the consideration of the _ mendicity society _ as it be the object of that society to clear the street of beggar it would be well if they would put a stop to those juvenile beggar many of whom be child of respectable parent who assemble together to build what they call a grotto to the great annoyance of all passenger in the street however desirous person may be of encouraging ingenuity in child i think it be do they much harm to give they money when they ask for it in this way indeed it would appear that some of the child have learn the art of beg so well that they be able to vie with the most experienced mendicant lady in particular be very much annoy by child get before they and ask for money nor will they take the answer give they but put they hat up to the lady ' face say please ma'am remember the grotto and when tell by the party that they have no money to give they will still continue to follow and be as importunate as any common beggar however innocent and trifling this may appear to some i be incline to believe that such practice tend to evil for they teach child to be mean and may cause some of they to choose beg rather than work i think that the best way to stop this species of beg be never to give they any thing a fact which come under my own observation will shew that the practice may be productive of mischief a foreign gentleman walk up old street road be surround by three or four boy say please sir remember the grotto -- go away be the reply i will give you none to this follow do pray sir remember the grotto no i tell you i will give you nothing do sir only once a-year at length i believe he put something into one of they hat and thus get rid of they but he have scarcely go 200 yard before he come to another grotto and out sally three more boy with the same importunate request : he reply i will give you nothing plague have you and you grotto the boy however persevere till the gentleman have lose all patience give one of they a gentle tap to get out of the way but the boy be on the side of the foot-path fall into the mud which have be scrape off the road and in this pickle follow the gentleman bellow out that man knock I down in the mud and i have do nothing to he in consequence a number of person soon collect who insult the gentleman very much and he would certainly have be roughly handle have he not give the boy something as a recompence he then call a coach declare he could not walk the street of london in safety those who know what mischief have arise from very trifling cause will of course perceive the necessity of check this grow evil for this man go away with very unfavourable impression concern we country and would no doubt prejudice many against we and make they suppose we be worse than we be nearly ally to this be pray remember poor guy faux which not only teach child the art of beg but be frequently the means of they become dishonest for i have know child break down fence and water-spout and in short any thing that they could lay they hand upon in order to make a bonfire to the great danger of the inhabitant near it without produce one good effect yet how easily might this practice be put down the ill effect of it be so self-evident that there can be no need for further enlargement i also disapprove of child go about beg at christmas this practice be calculate to instil into the child 's mind a principle of meanness not become the english character and the money they get seldom if ever do they any good if person choose to give child any thing at this time of the year there can be no objection to it but i dislike child go about to ask for money like common beggar it can not be proper and should be generally discountenance all these thing to some man may appear trifling but to I and other they be of consequence for if we mean to improve the general character of the labor population there be nothing like begin in time and we should amongst other thing get rid of all mean and improper custom before conclude this chapter i would hint to traveller not to give child money for run after a coach i have see child of both sex run until they breath fail and completely exhaust drop down on the grass merely because some injudicious person have throw halfpenny to they i have also see little boy turn over and over before the horse for the purpose of get money to the danger of they own life and of the passenger and i recollect a instance of one boy be in consequence kill on the spot in some county child will in spring and summer run after a carriage with flower upon a long stick thrust it in the coach or the face of the traveller beg halfpenny which habit have be teach they by the same injudicious mean the most virtuous and pious of man on look back to they early life have almost invariably confess that they owe the first seed of what be excellent in they to the blessing of god on the instruction and example of they parent and those around they in the year of they childhood reflection like these ought to make we humble and thankful for the advantage we have enjoy and cause we to look with a eye of pity charity and commiseration on the vice and delinquency of the poor rather than to judge they with harsh and cruel severity have we be in they place might not -- would not -- we character and conduct have be as theirs -- still further ought not such thought as these to touch we heart with deep compassion for they and excite we

archbishop tillotson _ \* \* \* \* \* have bring the prevalency of juvenile delinquency immediately before the eye of my reader by various example in the second chapter and in the third exhibit a few of the cause of it i shall now proceed to point out what in my humble opinion appear to be the only efficient remedy namely the education of the infant poor it may not be amiss however to glance at the means which have heretofore be employ and find though productive of some good inefficient for the end propose as preventive i may notice the numerous national and Sunday school tract society & c establish throughout the kingdom these have doubtless much good effect and deserve the zealous support of every one who have at heart the welfare of society in general and the improvement of the labor class in particular many have be pluck as brand from the burning by these institution which be a blessing to the object of they benevolence and a honor to they conductor and supporter that Sunday school be not wholly efficient in conjunction with other institution to accomplish the end desire be to be attribute on the one hand to the small portion of time in which they salutary influence be exert and on the other to they not admit child at a sufficiently early age at the period usually assign for they entrance they have not only acquire many evil habit but they affection have become so thoroughly pervert as to offer great and in some case insuperable obstacle to the corrective effort of they teacher each child bring into the school some portion of acquire evil make when unite a formidable aggregate and afford every facility for mutual contamination add to this the counteract effect which the bad example they meet with in the course of six day must have upon the good they hear on the seventh and it will be see how little comparatively be really practicable i do not say this to dishearten those who be engage in this labor of love or to abate the zeal of its promoter at the same time that they experience confirm the truth of my observation -- and i know they would candidly confess that it do so -- they must have many gratifying instance of a contrary nature in child who from evil habit have be win to a love of goodness and religion shewn not merely in a punctual attendance at they school but in that good-will toward they fellow-scholar and grateful love to they teacher which be the only infallible sign of a change in the affection these thing encourage they in spite of many difficulty and mortification to persevere in well do and may the god of love bless they labor with a increase of fruitfulness it be only my purpose here to state that the most likely human means to produce such a increase be the establishment of infant school -- school design particularly for the cultivation of the affection -- for prepare the heart to receive that wisdom which teach we to love god supremely and to love we neighbor as ourselves as to the system of instruction pursue in Sunday school as well as other free school it be indeed my opinion that some alteration for the better might be make but as i intend to speak of this matter in a future place i shall say no more on the subject at present but pass on to notice prison discipline -- which be i fear entitle to any term but that of a _ remedy _ that the end of punishment should be the prevention of future crime rather than the gratification of vindictive feeling -- whether those of state or of injured individual -- but few will venture to deny and yet how little calculated be the punishment usually inflict on young offender in this country to answer that end they be shut up in a prison in company with other thief perhaps older and more experienced than themselves and all that be want to complete they education in dishonesty be here attain previously to they confinement within the wall of one of these place in spite of the assertion of they harden associate that it be nothing to fear it be probable dread or apprehension hang over they mind the last vestige of shame have not be banish by a public appearance as criminal -- and this properly take advantage of might have make they reformation possible but have encounter the object of they fear and endure the shame of a trial -- shame and fear be alike go for ever and when once they find they way into those sink of iniquity there be very little hope of amendment from that period a prison have not the least terror for they be a place of idleness while there it call forth the evil inclination of its inmate and as they have opportunity of indulge those inclination it not only lose all its utility but become incalculably injurious i hear a boy who have be confine in newgate say that he do not care any thing about it that he companion supply he with plenty of victuals that there be some good fun to be see there and that most likely he should soon be there again which prove too true for he be shortly after take up again for steal two piece of print calico and transport this with a multitude of similar fact will shew that there be few who do not become more depraved and leave such place worse than when they enter they a gentleman who visit newgate inform I that he have be very much surprise at find so many child there some of whom be iron and on he inquire the cause of such severity towards child so young he be tell by one of the turnkey that _ he have snuck more trouble with they than he have with old offender _ this fact have be verify by the chief officer of the wakefield model prison -- the boy give most trouble in the matter of treat juvenile as delinquent i be sure we be wrong i have see both the magistrate and the judge insult on the bench by juvenile bring before they and taunt with the following : you can do no more you with the big wig i wish you may sit there until i come out and in the month of may 1852 the magistrate of wakefield be insult by a boy 15 year old who have be take up as a impostor with he arm double in a sling and shamming to be deaf and dumb -- a healthy strong youth able and fit for work -- and when ask why he do not work answer because he could get more by he own method hear this ye indiscriminate alms-giver and further when expostulate with by the magistrate for the sin and wickedness of pretend to be lame & c he laugh at they outright for be so silly as to suppose that he should not _ live well if he could _ when tell he should be commit for three month he have the impudence to tell the court that he would do the same again when he come out clap he hat on in open defiance and shout that be all you can do the chairman express sorrow that he could not order a whipping but the prisoner laugh at he and say i be too old for that such thing be not know in my younger day i be afraid we have err in this matter a little wholesome correction do wonder in such matter it at least make the party civil and i think deter from crime i be fearful that in this age mankind aim in some thing to be more perfect than the great ruler of the universe to the bad habit of a prison and the association with guilt must be add the deplorably unprovided state in which at the termination of they period of imprisonment they be send forth into society what friend have they but they former companion what habitation but they former resort of iniquity what means of procure a livelihood but they former evil practice we accordingly find that it be not unfrequently the case with these young offender that scarcely a day elapse after they liberation before they find themselves again in custody and within the wall of a prison one can not indeed view the exertion make by the society for the improvement of prison discipline in this respect without feeling of gratitude to those who take a active part in it -lrb- a -rrb- neither should we forget to return thanks to the author of all good that he should have encourage the heart of person to venture even they life to improve the condition of the prisoner in newgate and elsewhere -- that even female be find who conquer the timidity and diffidence of they sex have visit these abode of vice and misery for the purpose of ameliorate the condition of they inhabitant there have be man claim to be consider wise man who have ridicule the exertion of these daughter of philanthropy and have make they object of ridicule but happily they be impervious to the shaft of folly and as heedless of the unjust censure as they be undesirous of the applause of man they aim be the good of they fellow-creature -- they reward the pleasure of do good and the approbation of he who be goodness itself that they well-meant and praiseworthy exertion be not more successful can only be account for by the awfully depraved affection which habitual vice produce when every principle of action which should be subservient to virtue become actively employ in the cause of wickedness for whatever may be the impulse which first induce offender to do wrong they become in course of time so totally lose to all sense of what be good as to glory in they shame whether it maybe possible to devise any plan of prison discipline sufficient to remedy the evil i can not pretend to say and i shall only repeat the burthen of my song -- _ educate and protect the infant poor _ and it will be find that _ to prevent _ be not only better but easier than to _ cure _ -lrb- footnote a : i will make a short extract from one of its report to shew that the chief end they have in view be the prevention of crime they state that in the course of they visit to the gaol in the metropolis the committee very frequently meet with destitute boy who on they discharge from confinement literally know not where to lay they head to assist such friendless outcast have be the practice of the society and to render this relief more efficacious a temporary refuge have be establish for such as be dispose to abandon they vicious course this asylum have be instrumental in afford assistance to a considerable number of distressed youth who but for this seasonable aid must have resort to criminal practice for support on admission into this establishment the boy be instruct in moral and religious duty subject to habit of order and industry and after a time be place in situation which afford a reasonable prospect of they become honest and useful member of society to extend these object and to render its exertion more widely beneficial the society solicit the aid of public benevolence its expense be unavoidably serious and its fund be at present very low but it be trust that pecuniary support will not be withhold when it be consider that on the liberality with which this appeal be answer depend in a great measure the success of the society 's object -- the reformation of the vicious and the prevention of crime -rrb- that this remedy be effectual experience have teach I and many other and experience be a guide on whom we may safely rely it have show I that by take child at a early age out of the reach of contamination in the street and remove they in a great measure from the no less baneful influence of evil example at home we may lay such a foundation of virtue as be not likely to be shake nor do i think it difficult to show the reason of this it be confess on all hand that we first impression be the most powerful both as to they immediate effect and future influence that they not only form the character of we childhood but that of we maturer year as the mind of a child expand it search for new object of employment or gratification and this be the time when the young fall a easy prey to those who make a business of entrap they into the path of dishonesty and then of urge they to crime of deeper dye what then but a most salutary result can ensue from place a child in a situation where its first impression will be those of the beauty of goodness -- where its first feeling of happiness will consist in the receive and cherish kind ness towards its little neighbor in after year and in school for older child it be reckon a unavoidable evil that they should be congregate together in number not so in the infant school it be there make use of as a means of develop and exercise those kindly feeling which must conduce to the individual and general comfort not only there but in society generally it be not merely by instruct they in _ maxim _ of honesty that we seek to provide against the evil but by the surer way of exciting that feeling of love towards each other -- towards every one -- which when find in activity must not only prevent dishonesty but every other species of selfishness consider the difference of the case in the one case we behold a child associate in happy communion with a society -- a little world -- of its own age and feeling -- continually prove the possibility of give and impart happiness by receive and exercise kindness to its companion -- secure from every danger -- supply with a constant variety of amusement which be at the same time instruction and all this under the care of a master or mistress act the part not of a petulant school-dame or a stern pedagogue but of a kind and judicious parent in the case of the child not thus befriend we see it either expose to the dangerous association of the street or to the bad example of its parent to they unkindness and severity or misguided indulgence and present moreover with every facility as well as every temptation to do wrong now be it to be wonder at that in the former case kind obedient honest character should be the result and in the latter such as we have in we precede example exhibit reason tell we such a consequence be likely and experience have shew we that it really happen i could enumerate a thousand case of honest principle in the infant who have be under my own care but i can only mention one or two circumstance illustrative of the matter i once have for example two little boy to travel with I they assistance be extremely valuable in organize school they be often invite to accompany I at dinner the guest generally give they present i have watch they under many tempting circumstance and never find they steal it be my firm conviction that dishonesty be chiefly the effect of neglect no child can be _ bear _ a _ thief _ in the strict sense of the term in many school too there be fruit-tree plant in the play-ground to which the child will not do the least injury nor will they touch the fruit flower in pot such as geranium auricula and other plant be place in the middle of the play-ground without the least danger of be injure such be they respect to private property another instance particularly excited my notice amongst the child in the first establishment in london they be permit to bring they dinner with they and there be box in the school to put they in every child in the school have access to these box for they be never lock and yet i never know a child to lose he dinner or any part of it notwithstanding many of the child to my knowledge have be keep extremely short of food i have know a instance of a slice of bread and butter be leave in the box for several week by some child that could not eat it but none of the other child would dare to touch it i have find in the box two or three piece of bread as hard as possible and as a proof that many be hungry and that it do not remain there because they could not eat it but out of pure honesty i have offer it to some of the child and they have eat it in that state cold potato piece of fat & c be not unacceptable to they when give but sooner than take any thing without leave they have actually leave it to spoil these be fact which shew that notwithstanding all the disadvantage to which the poor child be expose they character may be so far form as to produce the effect above describe would you take a piece of bread out of this box that do not belong to you say i to the child one day no sir reply a little girl of four year old why not because say the child it would be thieve well but suppose no one saw you before i could speak another word a number of the child answer god can see everything that we do yes add another little boy if you steal a cherry or a piece of pencil it be wicked to be sure add another it be wicked to steal any thing i can not do better than introduce in this place the opinion of judge bosanquet on the subject of the education of the infant poor and some valuable hint will likewise be find in he remark on prison discipline it be a extract from a charge to the jury deliver at the gloucester assize for April 1823 gentleman i have reason to believe that the offence for trial on this occasion be rather less than usual at this season and to whatever the diminution of crime may be ascribe i can not forbear earnestly to press upon you attention a constant perseverance in two thing _ which above all other be calculate to diminish crime _ -- the first be a unremitted attention to the education of the child of the poor and of all class of society in the principle of true morality and sound religion the next be the constant and regular employment of such person as may be sentence to imprisonment in such labor as may be adapt to they respective age and condition i believe that these observation may be consider as quite superfluous in this county and therefore i have take the liberty of use the word perseverance because i believe you attention be already strongly draw to that subject and it require no exhortation of mine to induce you attention to it i be not quite sure whether in the gaol for this city the same means be provide for the employment of those person sentence to term of imprisonment which be provide in the gaol for the county the magistrate for the city be equally desirous of promote the education of all the poor under they care i have no doubt and i do hope and trust if the means of labor have not be provide in they gaol that no time will be lose in provide those means by which imprisonment may be make a real punishment by which offender may be reform during they imprisonment and by which the idle and dissolute may be prevent from any inclination to return there -lrb- a -rrb- -lrb- footnote a : from the time the judge refer to make the above remark other judge down to the present time have add similar sentiment from 1823 until 1852 proof upon proof have be add to show we the advantage of early training and though much have be cram and not training still the result have be good what would they have be have the schooling give really be _ training _ and what if the training of child have be study as _ art _ if the public look on the teacher as artist and treat they with the consideration they deserve anticipation can not be too sanguine in estimate the result that must accrue to society from a system of spiritual intellectual and moral culture become universal and work out by mind who will i be sure hereafter be able fully to develope from study and practice of the _ art _ of teach the great principle of spiritual truth intellectual vigor and the moral strength of the come generation which have be allow to remain in a state of torpor in the present -rrb- i have hitherto only be consider the _ prudential _ motive which should induce we to promote the education of the poor i have show that it will be for the benefit of society inasmuch as it be likely to decrease the number of those who transgress its law -- that it will prove a greater security to we person and property than law or prison afford but there be other motive which if these selfish one be wholly want might be sufficient to advocate in every humane heart the same course of conduct if the duty of promote honesty amongst the labor class do not exist that of increase happiness and piety amongst they would not be the less imperative that there be much room for a augmentation of both few i think will be incline to deny the less so in proportion as they have have the greater opportunity of ascertain they actual condition let we now for a few moment consider how great a blessing a infant school be even when regard as a mere asylum to take charge of the child 's bodily welfare i have mention before that the poor be unable to take that care of they child which they tender age require on account of they occupation and have shew that it be almost certain that the child of such person will learn every species of vice but there be other kind of danger which more immediately affect the body and be the cause of more accident than people in general imagine i shall here notice some of the most prominent and hope to be able to convince the unprejudiced mind that it would be a charity to take charge of the infant poor even leave the idea of they learn any thing good at school entirely out of the question and surely those person who disapprove of educate the poor at all will see the propriety of keep if possible they child safe from accident and preserve the life of many little one who would otherwise be lose to they country from they fall a prey to surround danger it be well know that many poor people be oblige to live in garret three or four story high with a family of six or seven child and it will not appear improbable that when the child be leave by themselves they should frequently meet with accident by tumble down stair some break they back other they leg or arm and to this cause alone perhaps may be trace a vast number of the cripple that daily appear as mendicant in we street when the poor parent return from they daily labor they sometimes have the mortification of find that one or probably two of they child be go to a hospital which of course make they unhappy and unfit they for go through they daily labor this dead weight which be continually on the mind of parent be frequently the cause of they be unable to please they employer and the consequence sometimes be they be throw out of work altogether whereas if they be certain that they child be take care of they would proceed with they daily labor cheerfully and be enable to give more satisfaction to they employer than they otherwise can do other parent i have know who when oblige to go out have lock they child in a room to prevent they from get into the street or fall down stair and who have take every precaution as they imagine to protect they child but the little creature perhaps after fret and cry for hour at be thus confine have venture to get up to the window in order to see what be pass in the street when one over-reach itself have fall out and be kill on the spot a gentleman say at a public meeting at exeter when refer to this subject i have myself twice in my life nearly occasion the death of child in one instance a child leave to itself run out of the hedge by the road-side i be fortunately able to stop and find the child unconscious of its escape raise its hand to the rein of the horse and on another occasion my horse throw a child down and i have but just time to pull up and prevent the wheel from pass over the infant 's head and it be state in a bristol paper that in the short space of _ one fortnight seven _ child be take to the infirmary of that city so dreadfully burnt that four of they die numerous case of this kind be to be find in the public print and hundred of such accident occur which be not notice in the papers at all many child again stroll into the field fall into pond and ditch and be drown so numerous indeed be the danger which surround the infant poor as to make a forcible appeal to the heart of the pious and humane and to call loudly on they to unite in rescue this hitherto neglect part of the rise generation from the evil to which they be expose it be much to be regret that those person who most need employment should be the last to procure it but such be the fact for there be so many obstacle throw in the way of married person and especially those with a family that many be tempt to deny that they have any child for fear they should lose they situation though it be certainly a additional stimulus to a servant to behave orderly when he know that he have other to look to he for support shall i close this appeal for the necessity of educate the infant poor by another and weightier argument they be _ responsible _ and _ immortal _ being it may be think that i should have give this plea the precedence of every other i do not because i feel more anxious to make good my ground with the prudent and the philanthropic -- to show they that self-interest and humanity demand we exertion in this cause i know that when i come to urge such effort upon the attention of the christian i could not possibly fail no one who be a sincere follower of he who say suffer little child to come unto I and forbid they not for of such be the kingdom no one who profess to abide by the maxim of he whose commandment be love thy neighbor as thyself can turn a deaf ear to the entreaty of those who be necessitous and suffer thousand there be among those of whom we have be speak who be bring up in as great ignorance of god and religion as though they have be bear in a country where the light of revelation have never shine -- where the glad tiding of salvation have never be proclaim with example of evil continually before they eye both at home and abroad we see and hear its consequence daily in the wickedness with which we street abound and in the lisped blasphemy and profanity of those who learn to curse and swear before they can well walk whilst i be at lincoln i be shock beyond measure by the horrid language of the boy to such a pitch have the evil come that the magistrate be determine to fine all the man who be bring before they for profane swearing and i have the satisfaction of hearing that four man have be fine whilst i be there what a blessing it would be if other magistrate throughout the kingdom would follow they example any person who have be accustom to walk the street of london must have hear how frequently child take the name of the almighty in vain seldom or ever mention it but to confirm some oath i have see boy play at marble top and other game and who on a dispute arise about some frivolous thing would call upon the supreme be to strike they deaf dumb or blind nay even dead if what they say be not true when nevertheless i have be satisfy from have observe the origin of the dispute that the party use the expression have be tell a falsehood indeed so common be this kind of language in the street that it often pass without notice i be incline to think that child accustom to use such expression on every trifling occasion will when they grow to riper year pay very little respect to the sanctity of a oath it be perhaps one of the reason why we hear of so much perjury in the present day at all event little child can not avoid hear such expression not only from those who be rather older than themselves but i be sorry to say even from they parent i have know repeat instance of this kind many little one when they first come to we school make use of dreadful expression and when tell that it be wrong will say that they do not know it be so other with the greatest simplicity have declare that they have hear they father or mother say the same word hence i have have much difficulty in persuade they that it be wrong for they very naturally think that if they parent make use of such language they might do the same how great be the necessity of good example and do parent generally consider how apt child be to receive impression and to become imitator both in they word and action they would be more cautious than they be there be many parent who make use of very bad expression themselves who would correct they child for use the same -- as a proof of this i will mention one circumstance out of many other that take place in the school i superintend many year since we have a little girl there five year old who be so fond of the school that she frequently stop after the usual hour to play with my child and some other who choose to stay in the play-ground many of they would stop till eight or nine o'clock at night to which i have no objection provide they parent approve of it and they do not get into mischief it be desirable to keep they out of the street as much as possible it happen however one day that some of the child offend this child and she call they by dreadful name such as i can not repeat and of course the other be terrify and tell I of they immediately i be soon satisfied that the child be ignorant of the meaning of what she say for as a excuse for she conduct she declare that she hear she father and mother use the same word i tell the child that notwithstanding she parent might have do so it be very wicked and that i could not let she stay another time to play if ever she do so again have send for the mother i inform she of the expression the child have use but do not tell she what she have mention relative to she parent for if i have she would have beat she most unmercifully the mother after have hear I relate the circumstance immediately fly into a passion with the child and declare that she would skin she alive -lrb- this be she expression -rrb- and i have much difficulty to restrain she from correct the child in the school have pacify she a little i inquire where the child could have hear such wicked expression she say she could not tell i then tell she i hope the child do not learn they of she or she father to this she make no answer but i could perceive that she stand self-convicted and have say what i conceive necessary upon the occasion i dismiss she observe that it be useless for lady and gentleman to establish school for the education of the infant poor if the parent do not assist by set they a good example i be happy to state that the advice i give she be not throw away as i never know the child guilty of say a bad word afterwards and the mother soon bring I another child of two year and a half old and say she should be very glad if i would take it into the school and that she wish a blessing might always attend the gentleman who support the institution she also request I to take a opportunity of speak a few word to she husband for she be thankful for what have be say to she and here i would observe that although it be most undoubtedly true that the good teach to child in we infant school be greatly counteract by the conduct they witness on they return home yet we occasionally see that these little child by the blessing of god be make the means of reform they own parent what a gratifying fact it be that the adult and hardened sinner may be turn from he evil way -- from death unto life -- by a infant 's precept or example nor be it only in profane expression that we see the influence of evil some child i have know in the same neighborhood who even beat they parent there be a poor widow very near the school who be frequently to be see with she face dreadfully bruise by blow from she own son he have be take before a magistrate and imprison for three month but it do he no good for he afterwards beat he mother as much as ever and the poor woman have it in contemplation to get the miscreant send out of the country one Sunday i remember to have see a boy under twelve year of age take up a large stone to throw at he mother : he have do something wrong in the house and the mother follow he into the street with a small cane to correct he for it but he tell he mother that if she dare to approach he he would knock she down the mother retire and the boy go where he please these and many similar scene i have witness and i be afraid that many such character have be so completely form as to be past reformation so essential be it to embrace the first opportunity of impress on the infant mind the principle of duty and virtue i be aware that many excellent institution be in existence for the spread of the gospel amongst the ignorant and depraved at home as well as abroad but i must here again advert to the readier reception of religious truth in infancy than by the adult and confirm sinner i would not say to those who be engage in the painful task -- painful because so often unsuccessful -- forego you labor but i would call upon all who have at heart the everlasting welfare of the soul of man to exert themselves that the rise generation may not likewise grow up into that state of perverseness -- that they may not in future year prove themselves to be a generation which like the adder turneth a deaf ear to the charmer charm he ever so wisely i be satisfy from the experience i have have that a amount of good be attainable from early and judicious culture which far very far surpass all that have heretofore be accomplish and on which not a few be even unprepared to calculate it be a christian-like wish express by king george iii that every child in he dominion should be able to read the bible and from the increase facility of do so from gratuitous education the number of those who can not be much less than formerly but in many case the necessitous circumstance of the parent prevent they from allow they child except during they infant year the advantage of instruction even though it cost they nothing the time for the child of the poor to receive instruction be between the age of two and eight after that period many be send out to work or detain at home for they then become useful to they parent and can not be send to school there be many little girl who have leave the infant school go out to work for a shill a week and the mother have declare to I when i have endeavor to persuade they to send they to the national school for at least one year that they could not do it for they be so poor that every shilling be a great help they have however promise I that they would send they to the Sunday school this may account in some measure for there be so many more boy than girl in almost every school in london and chew that great good have be do and be do by those valuable institution -lrb- a -rrb- -lrb- footnote a : it be to be observe here that the child do not come to or school on sunday but many of they between five and six year old who have brother and sister in the national school go with they to church and other of the same age go to a Sunday school in the neighborhood in short i may venture to say that almost all the child that be able go either to a Sunday school or to church : but to take they all in a body at the early age that they be admit into a infant school to any place of worship and to keep they there for two or three hour with a hope to profit they and not to disturb the congregation be accord to my view injurious if not impracticable -rrb- many of my reader who have be in the habit of notice and pity the poor may think the detail into which i have enter superfluous but i can assure they the want of information on the subject be but too general and be sufficient to account for the indifference which have so long be exhibit the objection that education be altogether improper for poor people be not quite obsolete there be not want person who still entertain the most dreadful apprehension of the _ march of intellect _ as it have be term who see no alternative but that it must over-turn every thing that be establish and subvert the whole order of society i would willingly impart comfort to the mind of those who be afflict with such nervous tremor but i fear if the demonstration of experience have not quiet they the voice of reason never will it can not fail to remind we of the apprehension of the popish clergy in former time who decry the art of printing then recently introduce as a branch of the black art which if encourage must eventually demolish the social fabric and introduce civil war and discord into every country time that test of truth have shew we how groundless they apprehension be instead of injure that fabric it have strengthen its foundation so that it can not be shake and have surround it with defence which bid defiance to assault oh that the time be come when every heart be imbue with truly christian principle would see that the noblest and highest object that could be set before we would be to rear up the mind of the young in knowledge virtue and piety to train they to intelligence and usefulness in this life and for happiness and immortality in the life to come on such labor the blessing of god would inevitably rest and he promise of they success be positive and unconditional train up a child in the way he should go and when he be old he will not depart from it to the furtherance of the infant system i have devote for many year my utmost energy and resource and to it i purpose to give they so long as i be permit by the gracious providence of god i shall be happy to render it any aid either by supply information to those who need it or by personal exertion the expense of so do be defray on application to my publisher 22 portugal street lincoln 's inn london or to myself ' at moor cottage wakefield in order to urge the necessity and explain the design of infant school i have for some year be accustom to deliver a course of lecture of which the follow be a outline : -- first lecture -- affect state of the child of the poor -- lamentable condition of young delinquent -- what be the cause -- the question answer -- bodily and mental injury now sustain by child of all rank describe and prevent -- what be the best remedy for exist evil -- answer give -- origin and history of the infant system -- its progress in scotland where it might least have be expect -- what be the objection to the system -- practical refutation of they -- mode of instruction : the alphabet spelling reading arithmetic -- moral cultivation enforce and the means explain second lecture -- a play-ground make not only delightful but _ mentally and morally _ improving -- the class-room adapt to produce and confirm religious impression -- music its application to improve the feeling and memory -- representation of natural object and scriptural subject -- variety and extent of information attainable -- lie dishonesty injustice and cruelty correct third lecture -- new plan of reward and punishment -- influence of fear and love -- great difference in the result -- infant system more fully explain -- appeal to conscience -- emulation unnecessary -- elliptical plan of teaching describe -- trial by jury -- effect of sympathy -- infant the instrument of improve one another fourth lecture -- method of teach the element of grammar geography and geometry -- gallery describe and its application to many useful purpose -- qualification of instructor -- injury sustain from they deficiency and error -- the system contrast with former method -- ultimate effect of its diffusion -- servant prepare to become blessing to family -- hint to parent and the application of the whole system to child of every grade these lecture i be ready to deliver wherever it may be deem desirable and to follow up the effect by the organization of school the necessary apparatus may be obtain of myself chapter v principle of infant education _ moral treatment -- importance of exercise -- play-ground indispensable -- the education of nature and human education should be join -- mental development child should think for themselves -- intellectual food adapt for child -- a

that disposition and those habit that may enable he to attain any part of knowledge he shall stand in need of in the future coarse of he life -- _ locke _ when the obligation of morality be teach let the sanction of christianity never be forget by which it will be shewn not that they give lustre and strength to each other : religion will appear to be the voice of reason and morality the will of god -- _ johnson _ \* \* \* \* \* when agesilaus king of sparta be ask what should boy be teach he answer what they ought to do when they become man such a declaration be worthy of later time since the most intelligent now admit that the great end of all education be the formation of solid useful and virtuous character this work should be doubtless commence at the earliest possible period to it the system explain in this volume be consider to be adapt and the principle on which it proceed be now to be illustrated and here it ought to be particularly observe that nothing be admissible except what be appropriate to the state of infancy calculate to exercise the physical energy and likely by they invigoration to lay the basis of a sound and powerful intellect and yet all this be too often forget look at the infant the very embody of vivacity and activity and its confinement to a particular posture or the requirement of a peculiar expression of countenance be manifestly unnatural a inactive and healthy child under six year of age be never see whatever compel it to be otherwise consequently produce what be artificial in character a parent or a teacher may keep he child quiet and in what he term order but it do not follow that this be a good preparation for after year on the contrary bondage may issue in excess the feeling and propensity which instead of be correct be unduly restrain will be manifest in some other way and under less favourable circumstance and frequently the reaction will be violent in maturity hence the system now recommend be expressly one for _ infant _ adapt to they just as they be and wholly design to repress what be evil and to cherish what be good accordingly the utmost attention be give to the cheerfulness and happiness of those on whom it act instruction in read arithmetic geometry and various other thing be make exceedingly amusing smile countenance and sparkling eye be observable all around when it be communicate and what be dull and soporific accord to the old plan be now insinuate so agreeably that the child while literally at play be acquire a large amount of valuable knowledge at play he see nature 's book that world of beauty : he love to look into it there be no flogging to induce he to do it all be enquiry and anxiety on he part what be this what be that what be it for how do it come with numerous other question of similar import oh that we have teacher to teach more out of this divine book oh that we have a public who would encourage and cherish they for so do what bless result even have i see by one 's be able to answer such enquiry the absurd notion that child can only be teach in a room must be explode i have do more in one hour in the garden in the lane and in the field to cherish and satisfy the bud faculty of childhood than could have be do in a room for month oh mankind have yet something to learn about teaching child see how they catch at truth through the medium of live thing see how it germinate in they by so do the teacher may forget they do not this i have prove hundred of time music have prove a most important auxiliary for this purpose and a stranger would be astonish at the hilarity and delight with which much be rehearse with a full perception of its meaning when in any other way it would be irksome and unintelligible these attainment moreover be accompany by various movement and evolution which exercise the limb the joint the muscle in addition to which set time be appoint every morning and afternoon for its exclusive enjoyment the conduct of inferior animal when young show the propriety of give exercise to child every other creature make use of its organ of motion as soon as possible and many of they when under no necessity of move in quest of food can not be restrain without force such be the case with the calf the lamb and many more if these creature be not permit to frisk about at pleasure they would soon die or become diseased the same inclination appear very early in the human species but as they be not able to take exercise themselves it be the business of they parent and nurse to give it they this may be do in various way and the method include in the system be shewn in other part of this work it be to be regret that man should be so inattentive to this matter they negligence be one reason why female know so little of it woman will always be desirous to excel in such accomplishment as recommend they to the other sex but man generally avoid even the slightest acquaintance with the affair of the nursery and many would reckon it a affront be they suppose to know any thing of they not so however with the kennel or the stable a gentleman of the first rank who be not ashamed to give direction concern the management of he dog or horse would blush be he surprise in perform the same office for that be who be to be the heir of he fortune and perhaps the future hope of he country argument to show the importance of exercise might be draw from every part of the animal economy without it the circulation of the blood can not be properly carry on nor the different secretion duly perform neither can the fluid be properly prepare nor the solid render firm or strong the action of the heart the motion of the lung and all the vital function be greatly assist by exercise but to point out the manner in which these effect be produce would lead we beyond the present subject we shall therefore only add that when exercise be neglect none of the animal function can be duly perform and when this be the case the whole constitution must go to wreck healthy parent wholesome food and suitable clothing will avail little where it be disregard sufficient exercise will supply many defect in nursing but nothing can compensate for its want a good constitution ought certainly to be we first object in the management of child it lay a foundation for they be useful and happy in life and whoever neglect it not only fail in he duty to he offspring but to society while this be forget let we not complain of weak and thoughtless child or of weak and thoughtless servant for the former be so from the neglect of they parent and the public and the latter from not have be teach to think at all -- and yet the very person that object to the education of the poor be the first to complain of they servant a notion that habit of industry must be establish have however be the means i regret to state of a sad perversion of the system in these respects the time allow for amusement and exercise have be in some case very much abridged that the child might learn and practice sew knit plaiting & c now no one can be more disposed to the encouragement of industrious habit than myself but i would say not at the expense of health which i be certain in these case it must be deprive the child of they amusement and they will soon cease to be the lively happy being we have hitherto see they and will become the sickly inanimate creature we have be accustom to behold and pity under the confinement and restraint of the dame 's school i do not scruple to affirm that if the _ play-grounds _ of infant school be cut off from the system -- they will from that moment cease to be a blessing to the country nothing have give I greater pain than to witness the thorough neglect of play-ground attendance on the part of teacher and the public the former leave the child to themselves at the very time they attendance be most desirable and when if duly watch the child will give they _ lesson _ yes such lesson as no book can give and such lesson as every efficient teacher _ must _ learn or efficiency be out of the question the public be too fond of hear task and memory work and such book-learning as be teach in school with the singing and the amusing indoor work to the detriment and neglect of the moral and physical outdoor work again and again i say the outdoor training tell most upon the moral and the formation of character the first faculty which develop themselves in childhood be those of observation the infant who be two month old will notice a light candle immediately that sense be gratify it seek to please another that of _ touch _ and every mother know if not prevent it will put its hand in the flame the next effort be to examine other object : these it will seize if it can and after have examine one it will put it aside to observe another on its be able to move about it seek object within its reach and wish to gratify the sense of taste apply every thing to the mouth by this it distinguish the bitter from the sweet and on see what be sweet a second time will point to it and wish to obtain it whilst what be bitter will not be desire the _ mental _ part of the system should now be advert to hence it have be well remark from the time that child begin to use they hand nature direct they to handle every thing over and over to look at it while they handle it and to put it into various position and at various distance from the eye we be apt to excuse this as a childish diversion because they must be do something and have not reason to entertain themselves in a more manly way but if we think more justly we shall find that they be engage in the most serious and important study and if they have all the reason of a philosopher they could not be more properly employ for it be this childish employment that enable they to make the proper use of they eye they be thereby every day acquire habit of perception which be of greater importance than any thing we can teach they the original perception which nature give they be few and insufficient for the purpose of life and therefore she make they capable of many more perception by habit and to complete she work she have give they a unwearied assiduity in apply to the exercise by which those perception be acquire such be the education which nature give she child and we may add that another part of she discipline be that by the course of thing child must exert all they muscular force and employ all they ingenuity in order to gratify they curiosity and satisfy they little appetite what they desire be only to be obtain at the cost of labor patience and many disappointment by the exercise of the body and mind necessary for satisfy they desire they acquire agility strength and dexterity in they motion as well as constitutional health and vigor they learn to bear pain without dejection and disappointment without despondency the education of nature be most perfect in savage who have no other tutor and we see that in the quickness of all they sens in the agility of they motion in the hardiness of they constitution and in they ability to bear hunger thirst pain and disappointment they commonly far exceed civilized nation on this account a most ingenious writer seem to prefer savage to social life but it be the intention of nature that human education should assist to form the man and she have fit we for it by the natural principle of imitation and belief which discover themselves almost in infancy as well as by other which be of later growth when the education which we receive from man do not give scope to that of nature it be erroneous in its means and its tendency and enervate both the body and the mind nature have she way of rear man as she have of heal they malady the art of education be to follow she dictate and the art of education be equally to obey she law the ancient inhabitant of the baleare follow nature in they manner of teach they child to be good archer when they hang they dinner aloft by a thread and leave they to bring it down : by they skill in the use of the bow the education of nature without any more human care than be necessary to preserve life make a savage human education join to that of nature may make a good citizen a skilful artizan or a well-bred man but a higher power be want in order to produce a bacon or a newton the error of the _ past _ system -lrb- for such i hope i may venture to call it -rrb- as to _ mental development _ be that the inferior power of the mind be call into activity in preference to its higher faculty the effort be to exercise the memory and store it with information which owe to the inactivity of the understanding and the judgment be seldom or never of use to adopt the opinion of other be think quite enough without the child be trouble to think for itself and to form a opinion of its own but this be not as it should be such a system be neither likely to produce great nor wise man and be much better adapt to parrot than child hence the first thing attempt in a infant school be to set the child think -- to induce they to examine compare and judge in reference to all those matter which they dawn intellect be capable of master it be of no use to tell a child in the first place _ what it should think _ -- this be at once induce mental indolence which be but too generally prevalent among adult owe to this erroneous method have be adopt by those who have the charge of they early year be a child leave to its own resource to discover and judge of thing exclusively by itself though the opposite evil would be the consequence namely a state of comparative ignorance yet i be doubtful whether it would be greater or more lamentable than that issue from the injudicious system of give child dogma instead of problem the opinion of other instead of elicit they own in the one case we should find a mind uninformed and uncultivated but of a vigorous and masculine character grasp the little knowledge it possess with the power and right of a conqueror in the other a memory occupy by a useless heap of notion -- without a single opinion or idea it could call its own -- and a understanding indolent and narrow and from long-indulged inactivity almost incapable of exertion as the fundamental principle of the system i would therefore say let the _ child think for themselves _ if they arrive at erroneous conclusion assist they in attain the truth but let they with such assistance arrive at it by they own exertion little good will be do if you say to a child -- _ that _ be wrong _ this _ be right unless you enable it to perceive the error of the one and the truth of the other it be not only due to the child as a rational be that you should act so but it be essentially necessary to the development of its intellectual faculty it be not more ridiculous for a master in teaching arithmetic to give he pupil the problem and answer without instruct he in the method of work the question than it be for a person to give a child result of reasoning without show how the truth be arrive at but some perhaps will be ready to exclaim surely the teacher should not withhold the benefit of he knowledge and experience -- the child will have time enough to examine the merit of he information when he grow older and be more competent to do so to this i answer : in the first place nothing should be submit to the child which it be not fully competent to understand to give the child task or subject too difficult for its mental power be a violation of nature and as foolish and detrimental as though you be to place a hundred pound weight on its shoulder when it be incapable of support ten the teacher 's experience can only be of service to the child so far as it be applicable to its own state and as to postpone the period when it be to think for itself there be certainly no occasion for it nature have provide food adapt to the power of the infant 's stomach and those who would rightly conduct the work of education should imitate she in provide its intellectual food that this may be do i be attempt to shew in theory in the page of this work and that it answer equally well in practice any one who have a doubt may assure himself by visit any school conduct upon the plan here lay down the charge have be bring against the system that we be not sufficiently anxious to teach the child to read now though i may venture to say that under no other plan do the child acquire a knowledge of alphabetical character and the formation of word so soon as under the present yet i be quite ready to concede that i consider they learning to read a secondary object to that of teach they to examine and find out the nature and property of thing of which word be but the _ sign _ it be with _ thing _ and not _ word _ merely we wish to make we child acquaint if they first learn the nature and property of a object there be no fear of they afterwards inquire its name but we too frequently find that have acquire _ name _ they be indifferent to and forgetful of the object represent let child see and observe a object and be teach the name of it at the same time and then both be indelibly fix on the memory a infant at home be perpetually run around and look at all thing and hear person speak about they it soon become acquaint with they name and property and then from time to time speak about they ah exclaim papa or mama what a old-fashioned child that be one would wonder where it get such notion a little thought and reflection would soon tell where and this think properly carry out would display a important fundamental principle in teach the young mind we first endeavor be therefore to excite a spirit of inquiry -- to foster that curiosity which be so natural to young child : till this be properly do you information will not be well receive and it be most likely soon to be forget but have once make they inquisitive you be more likely to tire of communicate than they be of receive the skilful teacher will indeed rather leave they with a appetite still craving than satiate they by repletion i have frequently find the most beneficial result arise from the sudden cessation of a lesson or a lecture on a interesting topic the child have look for its renewal with the utmost impatience ponder over what they have already hear and anticipate what be yet to come with the greatest interest give a child a _ task _ and you impose a burthen on he -- permit he to learn something and you confer a favor have excite a spirit of inquiry the next endeavor be to direct it to proper object these of course will be thing which relate to the sens of the child the nature and property of body which may be ascertain by the application of those sens & c have induce it to examine for itself you be now to elicit its idea of each object respectively and have teach it to use its reason and judgment freely and to express its own notion fearlessly and candidly -- you be to attempt the correction of what be erroneous by put forth you own view in as simple a way as possible : not so as to induce the child to give up its own opinion and adopt yours but in such a way as to direct it to the attainment of truth to induce a comparison between its thought and yours and thus to discover its own error the power of observation will speedily be improve under such a course of instruction and in all the subsequent stage of existence will not fail to constitute a independent and shrewd observer but some may think we be strain the child 's faculty by the plan recommend -- overstep nature 's law -- and that the result must be detrimental to the child both in mind and body so far however be this from be true that we have take nature for we guide we deprecate strongly most strongly that unnatural system which give child task so far beyond they power and for which they infantile faculty be not qualify -- we would lead they on in the path which nature have mark out -- step by step -- take care that one thing should be thoroughly master before another be attempt the mental power of child be far stronger than be generally suppose no one who look back to he early childhood can fail of recollect that at time he thought would even then reach the very limit of human thought all the power of mind that be exercise in after-life display themselves in infancy and therefore they all ought to be quietly and easily bring into exercise this maybe do by any object -- even a toy be we to tie up several of we member so as to prevent they use and at the same time exercise strongly those at liberty bodily distortion must result if we in teach exercise the memory alone and that merely with a knowledge of word and not of thing a absolute mental distortion must result and the higher power of reflection judgment and reason will remain weak feeble and deficient from want of exercise when all the power of the mind be bring out into harmonious action the acquirement of knowledge be come pleasurable knowledge be the proper aliment to expand and enlarge the mind as natural food be for the growth of the body and when such as be proper to the age and character of the recipient be select the one will be receive with as much pleasure as the other as the due exercise of every bodily power cause it to become strong healthy and vigorous so the right and proper use of every mental faculty will in the end occasion it to become active free and powerful as soon as the child enter the school he be under command he be require to occupy certain place to go through various motion and to attend to diversified instruction at the sound of a foot or the raising of a hand from this course no departure be allow at first it be the work of sympathy and imitation but afterwards it become a matter of principle thus then the native reluctance of the infant mind to obey be overcome and a solid basis lay for future effort so far however the discipline be general to be particular the individual character must be minutely observe the movement of the child when unrestrained must be diligently watch its predominant quality ascertain and such a mode of treatment adopt as sound judgment of character may dictate wherever this be forget some evil will arise the order which be give to any other power than those of sympathy and imitation be not likely to be obey by the untrained babe the fact be that as yet it have no other means of obedience and for this on higher principle we must wait till nature furnish instrument and opportunity for they exercise when however success be gain thus far the way be prepare for further development and culture and the power of observation and discrimination then gradually task will accomplish all that be desire thus the infant sit or rise repeat or be silent at first because those about he do so afterwards he perceive a reason for do so : for example that when in the gallery he can see what he could not any where else and therefore that he must march thither and then he judge that one thing be wrong because the do it be forbid and that another be right because it be command or because the one make he happy and the other the contrary under the old system of education i must candidly say _ moral _ treatment have be often altogether omit and still more frequently have it be erroneous and consequently inefficient let I ask -- would it promote a child 's health to teach it to repeat certain maxim on the benefit result from exercise the answer be obvious neither can it be of any service to the moral health of the child to teach it to repeat the best maxim of virtue unless we have take care to urge the practical observance of those precept and yet this have rarely be the case how frequently do we hear person remark on the ill conduct of child it be surprising they should do so -- they have be teach better thing very likely and they may have all the golden rule of virtue allude to carefully store up in they memory but they be like the hoard treasure of the miser the disposition to use they be want it be this which we must strive to produce and promote in the child indeed if we can but be the instrument of exciting a love of goodness it will not err nor lack the knowledge how to do good even though we be to forget to give it any rule or maxim it be to the heart we must turn we attention in the moral treatment of child we must carefully endeavor to elicit and train out the moral feeling implant within and to awaken the conscience to the approval of good and the dislike and detestation of evil another grand object of the master or mistress of a infant school be therefore to win they love by banish all slavish fear they be to be invite to regard they teacher as one who be desirous of promote they happiness by the most affectionate means -- not only by kind word but by kind action one of which influence a child more than a volume of word word appeal only to the understanding and frequently pass away as empty sound but kind action operate on the heart and like the genial light and warmth of spring that dispel the gloom which have cover the face of nature during the chilly season of winter they disperse the mist which cold and severe treatment have engender in the moral atmosphere the fundamental principle of the infant school system be _ love _ nor should any other be substitute for it except when absolutely necessary let the child see that you love they and _ love _ will beget love both toward they teacher and each other without the aid of example nothing can be do it be by this magnetic power alone that sympathetic feeling can be awaken it act as a talisman on the inmost feeling of the soul and excite they to activity which should be the constant aim of all person engage in the important work of education as we find that vicious principle be strengthen by habit and good principle proportionally weaken so on the contrary immoral disposition be weaken by the better feeling be bring into action the great defect in the human character be _ selfishness _ and to remove or lessen this be the great desideratum of moral culture how happy be mankind if instead of each one living for himself they live really for one another the perfection of moral excellence can not be better describe than as the attainment of that state in which we should love we neighbor as ourselves the prevalence of self-love will be very obvious to the observant master or mistress in the conduct of the child under they care and it be this feeling that they must be ever strive to check or eradicate nor need they despair of meeting with some degree of success the child may be bring to feel that to impart happiness be to receive it -- that be kind to they little schoolfellow they not only secure a return of kindness but actually receive a personal gratification from so do and that there be more pleasure in forgive a injury than in resent it some i know will be apt to say -- that after all thus be nothing but _ selfishness _ or _ self-love _ it be a old matter of dispute and i leave those to quarrel over it who please every one know and feel the difference between that which we call _ selfishness _ and that which be comprehensively term by the lip of divine truth the _ love of we neighbor _ if it must be call self-love i can only say that it be the proper direction of the feeling which be to be seek in the work of moral culture it will be necessary not only to observe the child 's conduct under the restraint of school observation and discipline but at those time when it think itself at liberty to indulge its feeling unnoticed the evil propensity of we nature have all the wiliness of the serpent and lurk in they secret place watch for a favourable opportunity of exercise and display for the purpose of observation the _ play-ground _ will afford every facility and be on this account as well as because it afford exercise and amusement to the child a indispensable appendage to a infant school here the child will show its character in its true light here may be see what effect the education of child have produce for if they be fond of fight and quarrel here it will be apparent if they be artful here they will seek to practice they cunning and this will give the master a opportunity of apply the proper remedy whereas if they be keep in school -lrb- which they must be if there be no play-ground -rrb- these evil inclination will not manifest themselves until they go into the street and consequently the antidote will not be apply i have see many child behave very orderly in the school but the moment they enter the play-ground they manifest they selfishness to such a degree that they would wish all the rest of the child to be subservient to they and on they refuse to let they bear rule they would begin to use force in order to compel they compliance this be conduct that ought to be check -- and what time so proper as the first stage of infancy to take another case a quarrel like this may arise : a boy have six gooseberry another boy come and ask for one by a little solicitation he obtain it : -- he wish another -- but the boy who have they say he can not spare any more he have only five and can not part with another the second boy however dun he he even act the hypocrite and put into play many of the worst artifice of human nature which we so often see in daily practice and he gain he end but he be not yet satisfied he wish another the first boy however will on no account give he more he again try all he art but in vain see he can not by art or entreaty gain another he have recourse to violence he snatch one out of he companion 's hand and run off with it the first boy be irritated at such conduct he pursue the fugitive overtake he and give he a blow on the face the second boy be as great a coward as he be a thief he come up and make he complaint to the master the master then have a trial by jury he do not knock one head against the other accord to the old custom but he hear both plaintiff and defendant and have get the fact he submit to the child themselves whether it be right in the one boy to take with violence what be not he own and shew they which be the more to blame then they decide on the sentence perhaps some one suggest that it should be the utmost infliction allowable a slight pat on the hand while a tender-hearted girl say please sir give it he very softly but the issue be a marked distinction between right and wrong -- appropriate expression of pleasure and disapprobation : -- and on the spot a kissing and be friend i be indeed so firmly convince from the experience i have have of the utility of a play-ground from the above reason and other elsewhere mention that i scruple not to say a infant school be of little if any service without one where the play-ground be ornament with flower fruit-tree & c -lrb- and i would recommend this plan to be invariably adopt -rrb- it not only afford the teacher a opportunity of communicate much knowledge to the child and of trace every thing up to the great first cause but it become the means of establish principle of honesty they should not on any account be allow to pluck the fruit or flower every thing should be consider as sacred and be thus early accustomed to honesty temptation in after-life will be deprive of they power it be distressing to all lover of child to see what havoc be make by they in plantation near london and even grow person be not entirely free from this fault for not content with a proper foot-path they must walk on a man 's plantation pull up that which can be of no use and thereby injure the property of they neighbor these thing ought not to be nor do i think they would be so common if they be notice a little more in the education of child it have be too much the practice with many to consider that the business of a school consist merely in teaching child they letter but i be of opinion that the formation of character while there be of the greatest importance not only to the child but to society at large how can we account for the strict honesty of the laplander who can leave they property in the wood and in they hut without the least fear of its be steal or injure while we with ten time the advantage can not consider we property safe with the aid of lock and bolt brick wall and even watchman and police-officer besides there must be some cause for all this and perhaps the principal one be defective education and the total neglect of the moral of the infant poor at a time when they first impression should be take especial care of _ for conscience if not lull to sleep but call into vigorous action will prove stronger than brick wall bolt or lock and i be satisfied that i could have take the whole of the child under my care in the first infant ' school into any gentleman 's plantation without they do the least injury whatever and this i could now do in any similar circumstance _ i will mention however one fact one day while i be walk in the play-ground i see at one end of it about twenty child apparently argue a subject _ pro _ and _ con _ from the attitude of several of the orator i judge it be about something that appear to they of considerable importance i wish to know the subject of debate but be satisfy that if i approach the child it might put a end to the matter altogether some of the bystander see I look very attentively at the principal actor and as i suppose suggest to the party the propriety of retire to some other spot for immediately afterwards they all go behind a partition which afford I a opportunity of distinctly hear all that pass without be observe by they i soon find that the subject of debate be a _ song _ it seem that one of the child have bring a song to the school which some of the monitor have read and have decide that it be a improper thing for the child to have in he possession one of they have take it from the owner and destroy it the aggrieved party have complain to some of the other child who say that it be _ thieve _ for one child to take any thing from another child without he consent the boy nettle at be call a thief defend himself by say that he as a monitor have a right to take away from any of he class any thing that be calculate to do they harm and be it seem back in this opinion by many other on the other hand it be contend that no such right exist and it be doubtful to I for a considerable time on which side the strength of the argument lay at last one of the child observe to the following effect : -- you should have take it to _ master _ because he would know if it be bad better than you this be a convincing argument and to my great delight the boy reply -- how much do the song cost the reply be a half-penny here then take it say the child i have one give I to-day so now remember i have pay you for it but if you bring any more song to school i will tell master this seem to give general satisfaction to the whole party who immediately disperse to they several amusement a struggle like this between the principle of _ duty and honesty _ among child so very young must prove highly interesting to all who love they and exemplify beyond a doubt the immense advantage of early instruction another thing to be notice be a regard for _ truth _ nothing be so delightful as this there be no conversation so agreeable as that of the man of integrity who hear without any design to betray and speak without any intention to deceive and this admit we should strive to the utmost to induce child to remember it but we success in a great measure will depend on the means we employ many child be frighten into falsehood by the injudicious method of those who have the care of they i have know a mother promise a child forgiveness if it would speak the truth and after have obtain confession she have break she engagement a child once treat in this manner will naturally be guard against a similar deception i have know other who would pretend not to punish the child for confession but for first deny it and afterwards confess i think that child should not be punish on any account after have be promise forgiveness truth be of too great importance to be thus trifle with and we can not wonder if it be lightly esteem by child after the example be set by they parent have have several thousand child under my care i have have favourable opportunity of observe the bias of the infant mind and i must say that i have not find they so inclined to evil and falsehood as i have previously imagine when morality be advert to in this volume let it never be forget that by it be mean the pure and perfect morality of the sacred scripture from this source alone the great truth and precept can be derive for regulate the conscience and improve the heart the infant system however would aim to steer perfectly clear of the more remote theological opinion entertain by christian of different denomination with these little child can have nothing to do and institution for they express benefit should receive the support of all what kind of religious doctrine and faith infant ought to be teach i will not here determine but leave it for consideration in a future chapter devote more expressly to that subject it must be the wish of all true christian that they should be teach the fundamental truth of the everlasting gospel but it be much to be lament that what be the fundamental truth of the gospel be so frequently a debatable point with such controversial topic infant have nothing to do and to teach such matter would rather be sowing seed for future scepticism than lay a solid basis for pure and undefiled religion in all thing but more especially in religion as be the subject of the highest importance the purest simplest and most unadulterated truth should be teach the bible contain ample and abundant store of such simple truth most admirably suit to infant capacity in text precept parable and history the pious and judicious mother or teacher can be at no loss for a proper selection many beautiful and simple prayer be to be find in the church of england prayer-book which i think can not be mend and which i have find quite suitable to the infant mind several of the collect for simplicity of language and rich fulness of divine truth can not be surpass simple hymn for instruction and devotion be also requisite and i have endeavor to provide such as these in a _ manual _ recently publish in connexion with a friend and which may be bad through the publisher of this work chapter vi requisite for a infant school _ the master and mistress should reside on the premise -- interior arrangement -- a school and its furniture -- lesson-post and lesson -- the younger child should not be separate from the older -- play-ground arrangement -- rotatory swing -- its management and advantage _ \* \* \* \* \* wisdom seek the most desirable end in the use of the most appropriate means \* \* \* \* \* i shall now lay before my reader a account of the thing necessary for the establishment of a infant school previously to present they with the detail of the plan to be pursue in it in the first place it be necessary to provide a airy and spacious apartment with a dry and if possible a large play-ground attach to it the plot of ground i conceive should not be less than 50 foot wide and 100 foot long but if the ground be 150 or 200 foot long it would be so much the better as this would allow 100 or 150 foot for a play-ground which be of such importance that i consider the system would be very defective without it for reason which will be speak of hereafter there should likewise be a room about fifteen foot square for the purpose of teach the child in class which may be form at one end of the large room : this be absolutely necessary as the master and mistress should live on the premise a small house contain three or four room should be provide for they the reason for they living on the premise be that the child should be allow to bring they dinner with they as this will keep they out of the street and indeed of those who do go home to dinner many will return in a very short time and if there be no person on the premise to take care of they they will be lose and not only so but strange boy will come in from the street and do a great deal of mischief if no one be there to prevent it the portion of sitting-room that i have allow for each child be twelve inch the scholar should sit all round the school room with they back against the wall double seat should be round the side of the school like the two first seat in the gallery a school accord to the engraved plan will be find large enough for all the purpose of a infant school but if it be wish to be more commodious it may be of the same length as the plan and instead of twenty-two foot may be make thirty foot wide this will hold as many child as ought to be collect together in one place and as many as any man and woman can possibly do justice to if it be any longer it will be difficult for all the child to hear the master a oblong building be the cheapest on account of the roof economy have be study in the plan give without any thing be add that be unnecessary this of course be a matter of opinion and may be act upon or not just as it suit those who may choose to build the master 's house in the plan it will be see project a little into the play-ground to afford he the opportunity of see the child at play while he be at dinner that he may notice any improper conduct on the part of the child and mention it when the account of the day be make up as child be very apt to get into danger even when at school it become expedient to exercise the utmost vigilance in order to prevent the possibility of accident for where two hundred child be assemble together the eldest not seven year of age it be most certain that if there be danger some will get into for this reason all the door on the premise should be so secure that the child can not swing they backwards and forwards if they be not they will get they finger pinch or greater accident may occur the form also should be so place that the child may not be likely to fall over they every thing in short should be put out of the way that will be likely to occasion any danger the seat should not be more than nine inch high and for the smaller child six inch and should be eleven or twelve inch wide and fix all round to the wall the master 's desk should be place at the end of the school where the class-room be by this mean he will be able to see the face of all the child and they can see he which be absolutely necessary they may then be govern by a motion of he hand the _ furniture _ necessary for the school consist of a desk for the master seat for the child lesson-stand stool for the monitor slate and pencil picture and lesson on scriptural subject picture and lesson on natural history alphabet and spelling lesson brass letter and figure with board for they geometrical figure & c and the transposition-frame or arithmeticon as it have be call to these may add little book & c the particular use of these article will be shewn in the succeed page the following be a representation of a lesson-post the _ lesson _ paste on wood to render they sufficiently stiff be put into the groove of the lesson-post and can then be place in any position which be most convenient and adjust to any height as the master may see proper -lrb- illustration : _ a b _ be a slip of wood with a groove in it fix to the post by means of the screw _ c _ and _ d _ on which slip be two block _ e _ and _ f _ the bottom one _ f _ be fix with a groove in the upper side for the lower edge of the board _ g h _ to rest in the upper block _ e _ have a groove in the lower side for the upper edge of the board _ g h _ to rest in and rise and fall accord to the width of the board on the slip _ a b _ -- instead of be make with foot the lesson post be generally and perhaps better fix into the floor of the school-room and should be very slight and 4 foot 4 inch in height -rrb- the follow lesson-post have be find to answer better than the precede one and be fix in a socket which prevent the necessity of the cross-bar foot at bottom and possess this advantage that it may be take out when do with and hang up by the side of the wall so as to allow the area of the room to be quite clear of any incumbrance and to be use for any other purpose no 2 be the socket which should be let into the floor and screw fast to the side of a joist so as to keep it perfectly steady the socket be to be open at bottom so as to let the dust pass through : and no 1 be a plate to fit over the socket to come flush with the floor to be put over it when the lesson-post be take out to prevent too much dust from get into the socket the little nich represent in plate one be too small for the pupil to get they finger into so as to pull up the plate but wide enough to allow the teacher to put a very narrow key in when he desire to pull up the plate to put the lesson-post in the socket no 3 be a front view of the lesson-post contain the slide nip the lesson between they the other figure represent a side view of the lesson post and the small figure at the left hand side represent the groove of the two slider to receive the lesson and the back part of it the dovetail to clip which come down behind the post these be place parallel in double row down the school at equal distance exactly opposite each other and flatten brass or iron be to be let into the floor opposite to the front of they as shewn in one of the engraving represent the area of the school and the child at they object lesson i have find by experience that this invention possess a decide advantage over the other as they always remain perpendicular and parallel to each other take up less room and be more easily put out of the way and the child can not knock they down they should be number in front as represent in the figure so that the teacher may always put the proper post in its own place -lrb- illustration -rrb- the arithmeticon of which a description will be give in a subsequent chapter be simple in its construction but as will be see hereafter may be variously and beneficially apply it be indeed indispensable in a infant school as it be useful for teach the first principle of grammar arithmetic and geometry the expense of furnish a large school be about # 16 that of a smaller one about # 10 i must here protest against a violation of the freedom of the infant mind a fold as it be call be erect in some school for the youngest of the child and thus they be cut off from the society of the rest from whom they would learn much more than they could from any teacher the monitor have charge of this class be also coop up in the same cage and therefore suffer the same privation the result of my own experience as well as that of other be that a child be decidedly incompetent to the duty of a monitor if he can not keep the youngest class in order without any such means i would therefore deprecate in the strongest term the separation refer to as not only altogether unnecessary but exceedingly injurious to have one hundred child or upward in a room however convenient in other respects and not to allow the child proper relaxation and exercise which they could not have without a play-ground would materially injure they health which be a thing in my humble opinion of the first importance i would rather see a school where they charge two-penny or three-pence per week for each child have a play-ground than one where the child have free admission without one for i think the former institution would do the most good the play ground likewise be one of the most useful part of the system it be there the child shew itself in its true character and thereby give the master a opportunity of nipping in the bud its evil propensity i be therefore most anxious to recommend that this necessary appendage to a infant school should not be dispense with i moreover observe that where there be a play-ground attach to the school instead of play in the street where scarcely anything but evil be before they eye the child will hasten to the school with they bread and butter in they hand in less than a quarter of a hour after they have leave it know that they have a opportunity of play there the remainder of they dinner-time so that they love the school and but rarely wish to be anywhere else the play-grounds of some school be pave with brick which i have find to answer very well as they absorb the rain so quickly that ten minute after a shower the place be dry enough for the child to play in which perhaps would not be the case with any other kind of pave they be commonly place flat on the ground but i should prefer they be put edge-way as they would last many year longer yet it would take nearly double the number of brick be they so place -lrb- a -rrb- if it be not pave the ground will be soft and the child will make themselves dirty it should be so manage that the water may be carry off for if there be any puddle the child will get into they some person have recommend a few cart-load of good iron-mould gravel there be a sort which will bind almost like a rock if well roll but the child be liable to dig hole if it be only gravel if this be notice in time it may be prevent but if they be suffer to proceed and no notice be take of it it will be very difficult to prevent they from continue the practice if money can be save by any plan perhaps it be as well to notice it but after have weigh the advantage and disadvantage of gravelling i be of opinion that brick be preferable i should also recommend that fruit-tree be plant in the center of the play-ground and likewise round the wall which will delight the child and teach they to respect private property if any person doubt the propriety of this plan i can only say we leave many play-grounds thus ornament : and instead of prove a temptation to the child it have so far become the means of confirm principle of honesty in they that they never touch a single flower or even a leaf in the garden there should also be a border of flower round the play-ground of such sort as will yield the most fragrance which will tend to counteract any disagreeable smell that may proceed from the child and thereby be conducive to they health as well as to that of those who have the charge of they they will besides afford the teacher a opportunity of give the child many useful lesson for the more he teach by thing and the less he teach by sign the better these thing need be no expense to the establishment except the purchase in the first instance for they will afford a agreeable occupation for the master before and after school-hour prepare he in some measure for the duty of the day and afford he a ample opportunity of instil a variety of idea into the mind of the child and of trace every thing up to the great first cause i have witness the good effect of these thing which make I desirous of humbly but earnestly recommend they to other -lrb- footnote a : in lancashire and other place where flagging be cheap it have be find decidedly better than any other plan allude to above the child will not hurt themselves more by fall on flag than they would on brick or pebble -rrb- with regard to the expense : if 200 child pay two-pence each per week -lrb- a -rrb- which be now the usual charge the annual receipt will be deduct four week for holiday about # 80 and if the deficiency be make up by subscription and donation from the friend of the system it may be easily adopt and all its advantage secure a village school might be furnish for half the money and support at less than half the expense i question whether it do not cost the country as much for every individual that be transport out of it as would support three infant school annually and secure good pay to the teacher with 200 infant in each school -lrb- footnote a : in some part of st gile 's wapping & c & c many of the parent be not able to pay and many that be would sooner let they child run the street than pay a penny yet the child of the latter person be the greater object of charity and it be the child of such person that chiefly fill we prison we want three class of infant school : one for the middle class who will pay for skilled mechanic who will pay 2_d _ or 3_d _ per week and for the poor and illiterate who will pay nothing -rrb- every year increase my conviction of the great importance of the play-ground and of the folly of some of my early view respect it find a great variety of lesson and object necessary to arrest the attention of child diversify as they be in disposition and taste it be suppose that a equal variety of toy be require for the play-ground a good supply of ball battledore shuttlecock top whip skipping-ropes hoop stick and wheelbarrow be therefore obtain and we flatter ourselves that this must produce universal happiness in thus however we be most grievously disappoint for the ball frequently bounce over the wall -- the player not be able to throw they with the precision of spartan child sometimes strike they comrade perhaps in the eye : if we could succeed in quiet the sufferer by a kiss and a sugar-plum the ear be as immediately afterwards salute with the cry of o my chin my chin from some hapless wight have be star-gazing and another anxious for as many stroke as possible mistaking that part for the bottom of he shuttlecock while this would be follow by o my leg from the untoward movement of a stick or a barrow in short such scene be insupportable and what with the accident that arise and the top without string and the string without top the hoop without stick and the stick without hoop the seizure of the favorite toy by one and the inability of another to get any thing it be evident that we be wrong but not so clear how we could do otherwise it then occur that we might provide some wood-brick about four inch long a inch and a half thick and two inch and a half wide and of these a thousand be obtain with these child be exceedingly amuse from the variety of form in which they may be place and of building which may be erect with they the play-ground should always be at the rear of the premise and as private as possible that both teacher and pupil be secure from annoyance of any kind the entrance should be only through the school and no other way this secure the flower the fruit and the moral training of the child -lrb- illustration -rrb- in addition to these all that be require be a rotatory swing of which the above be a representation to make one a pole eighteen or twenty foot long should be firmly fix in the ground : three foot of the but-end should be sink secure by sleeper to keep it steady : it should be at least three quarter of a yard in girth at bottom and taper gradually to the top to half that size a iron rim be to be drive on the head of the pole to keep it from splitting and then a spindle at least a inch in diameter with a shoulder be to be fix in it a iron wheel with four spoke turn up at the end like a hook to which four rope be to be fasten must then be make to revolve on the spindle as the rope reach the ground four child may take hold of they and run round until they bear the whole weight of the body on the arm and this exercise will be find to strengthen the muscle and give vigor to the whole frame in a large school there should be two swing of this kind -- one for the girl and the other for the boy the teacher must however be careful the first few week to train the child to look about they : this they be but little disposed to do hence the most impressive manner should be adopt and i will venture to say should any injury be sustain by the child the fault _ will not be theirs _ the effect of the instruction thus urge will be valuable in other case for a child thus teach to watch against accident will be careful in pass crossing and go through crowd street and thus be likely to escape many danger into which other fall this exercise may also be accompany by instruction as the child may repeat the cow or the sheep or any other lesson as the measure of the time during which four may have the swing it will moreover afford a opportunity for detect the selfishness of some child by they wish to keep the rope too long and the passion of other from the vehemence with which they will insist on they rights but as on such occasion both be to be forbid to swing any more that day they will soon learn to bear and forbear in the event of a child be throw down from stand in the way all the child should be place in the gallery and this one shewn they if it appear hurt all will pity it let then the question be put how do this happen and the answer will be perhaps please sir because he do not make use of he eye here then be full opportunity to inculcate caution and to inform and benefit the whole for example : the master may say how many sens have we the child will answer five _ master _ -- name they _ child _ -- hearing see smell tasting and feeling _ m _ where be the organ of sight _ c _ here -lrb- point to the eye -rrb- _ m _ look at this child and see if he have they -lrb- here a inspection will take place the sufferer will look sheepish and begin to perceive he have not make the best use of the sense of see whilst the singular observation of the child will sharpen he faculty and make such a impression as to cause he to be more cautious in future and many a scholar who be sit in judgment will profit by the circumstance -rrb- i have know the life of several child save by such simple lesson and they be of as much importance as any that be teach though i be not quite sure that all the teacher will think so too many to save trouble will find fault with the swing and i have know several instance where the swing have be take down in consequence we have find the swing answer in all three country it strengthen the muscle which in physical education be a matter of the highest importance it have be introduce into juvenile school with similar success and also in lady ' boarding-school i have personally inspect tine effect produce under all these circumstance and in every instance i have find the most beneficial effect produce provide the exercise be properly regulate and superintend it will not do therefore to have this important part of the system dispense with the teacher must be present at all the exercise in the play-ground or more properly speak the training-ground non-attention to this be a capital error and if persist in must be follow with dismissal chapter vii qualification of teacher _ teacher should practice what they teach -- necessity of patience -- mere automaton will not do for infant teacher -- disadvantage of use excessive restraint -- a master and mistress more efficient than two mistress -- objection to the sole government of female -- two frequent use of divine name should be avoid -- general observation _ \* \* \* \* \* -- such authority in shew when most severe and minist ` ring all its force be but the graver countenance of love whose favor like the cloud of spring may lower and utter now and then a awful voice but have a blessing in its darkest frown threat ` ning at once and nourish the plant -- _ thomson _ \* \* \* \* \* i enter on this chapter with a full recollection of the painful sense of incompetency i endure on become a teacher of babe and this i trust will enable I to offer any remark on the present subject with the humility that be desirable blended with the confidence of experience it be a very common idea that almost any person can educate little child and that it require little or no ability but it will be find on a enlighten and correct estimate of the work that this be a very great mistake : and i regret that this mistake have be make by those who profess to understand the system and who have write upon it but there be just this slight difference between theory and practice : theory suppose such and such thing to be correct which be my own case but twelve month only of practical effort very soon convinced I i be wrong how frequently for instance may we find child ten or twelve year of age who can not answer the most simple question and who nevertheless have be to school for several year to give the child correct notion be a part of education seldom think of : but if we really wish to form the character of the rise generation and to improve the condition of society generally the utmost attention must be give to this object little i should think need be say to prove that few idea be give in dame-school there may be a few as to which a exception should be make but generally speak where the child of mechanic be usually send before the age of seven year no such thing be think of the mind of a child be compare by mr locke to a sheet of blank paper and if it be the business of a tutor to inscribe valuable lesson on the mind it will require much patience gentleness perseverance self-possession energy knowledge of human nature and above all piety -- simple sincere and practical piety -- to accomplish so great a work with propriety and success whoever be in possession of these requisite with the addition of a lively temper pleasing countenance and some knowledge of music may be consider as a proper person to manage a infant school and whoever have charge of such a institution will find numerous opportunity of display each and all of these qualification it would be almost useless to attempt to cure the bad temper of child if the master should encourage and manifest such evil temper in he own conduct for child be not indifferent to what they see in other : they certainly take notice of all we movement and consequently the greatest caution be necessary it will be of little purpose to endeavor to inculcate suitable precept in the mind of the child unless they see they shine forth in the conduct of the teacher how strangely it would sound if when a teacher be explain to he pupil the sin of swearing a child should say please sir i hear you swear and it be just the same as to those fault which some may consider of minor importance -- such as the indulgence of angry passion -- in the presence of child it must always be understand that the essence of the plan be to allow the child to speak -- not what they do not feel and think which have be but too general -- but what they do think and feel this child will always do if rightly train yes with modesty and decorum but with power what will the old class of pedagogue say to this what allow pupil to tell you of you fault certainly they know they at least those commit in they presence they talk of they to themselves why not to we some of the best _ lesson _ i ever get be under similar circumstance person in such circumstance can not be too circumspect as every trifling fault will be magnify both by parent and child indeed character be of so much importance that the design of benevolent individual be very often frustrate by appoint improper person to fill such situation i have see more than once the interest of two hundred babe sacrifice to serve one individual and person have be choose merely because they have be unfortunate and to serve they they have be place in a situation disagreeable to themselves and unprofitable to the child it be one thing to possess certain information but it be another to be able to communicate that information to infant patience be a virtue absolutely indispensable as it will frequently take the master or mistress a whole hour to investigate a subject that may appear of little or no importance : such as one child accuse another of steal a trifle -- as a plum a cherry a button or any other thing of little value the complainant and defendant will expect justice do to they by the master or mistress and in order to do this much time and trouble will in some case be necessary should a hasty conclusion be form and the accuse be punish for what he have not be guilty of the child will be sensible that a injury have be do he feel dissatisfied with he tutor and consequently will not pay they the respect they ought to have besides it will frequently be find on examination that the accuser be really the most in fault and i think i have convince many child that this have be the case and they have retire satisfied with my decision for when a child be convince that justice will be do he he will open he case freely and boldly but if he have any idea that it will be otherwise he will keep one half of the fact in he own mind and will not reveal they i once form a hasty conclusion in the case of two child and happen to decide directly contrary to what i ought to have do the consequence be that the injured child endeavor to do that for himself which he find i have not do for he and plead he own cause with the opposite party in the play-ground but find that he could not prevail on he and be sensible that he have be wrong he be so much hurt that he bring he father the next day and we re-consider the case when it be find that the child be correct and that i be wrong here i find how necessary it be to exercise the utmost patience in order to enable I to judge rightly and to convince my little pupil that i have the greatest desire to do they justice i compare a infant school to a little commonwealth the head or governor of which be naturally the master a infant school master or mistress be not to consider anything relate to the rights of he little community as trifling or unimportant however justly it might be consider such in itself yet comparatively it be a matter of moment to the party concern and such therefore it should be esteem by he who be the arbitrator of they rights and the legislator and judge of the infant state he will have indeed to act the part of counsel judge and jury and although the child can not find word to plead they own cause yet by they look and gesture they will convince you that they know when you have rightly decide and it appear to I that the future conduct of the child in the world will depend in a great measure upon the correctness of the master 's decision one would suppose to hear the observation of some person that mere automaton would do for master and mistress by they the system be consider as every thing while the person who be to teach it have be consider as secondary object but a system however perfect in itself will be productive of little good unless it be commit to person possess of some degree of skill as the best watch will go wrong if not properly attend to we can not therefore be too circumspect in the choice of the person to whom we commit the care and education of the rise generation there be something so powerful in correctness of deportment that even infant respect it and this will operate more on they mind than many imagine it do not appear necessary to I that child should be keep under excessive restraint by they tutor they should rather be encourage to make they teacher they confidant for by this mean he will become acquaint with many thing the knowledge of which it be essential he should possess both as it regard himself and the welfare of he pupil if the child be enthral he will seek some other person to whom he may open he little mind and should that person be ill-dispose the most serious consequence will not unfrequently follow i know the source from whence all assistance be derive and i be teach to believe that such assistance will not be withhold from those who diligently seek it i be well aware that i shall have to render a account of my stewardship to the almighty for every child that may have be place under my care and i feel that to do so unblameably require much assistance from above let not those then who be similarly circumstance with myself think that i address they in the spirit of arrogance with a pre-conceived opinion of my own sufficiency i wish that all who teach may be more fit for the situation than i be i know many who be a honor to they profession as well as the situation they fill but i be sorry to say i think they do not all meet with the encouragement they merit it be not always those who do they duty the best that be most value but if a man 's conscience do not upbraid he he have in its approval a high reward and now as to a matter on which there be some difference of opinion _ viz _ whether woman be or be not as fit for conductor of infant school as man my decide opinion be that _ alone _ they be not there should be in every school a master and a mistress in the first place in a infant school the presence of the man as of a father in a family will insure a far greater degree of respect and attention on the part of the child this do not arise from the exercise of any greater degree of harshness or severity than a mother would be capable of use nor be it to be attribute as some suppose to the less frequent presence of the father in the case of many family but be rather to be account for by a intuitive perception of the greater firmness and determination of the character of the man to those who deny this i would give as a problem for solution a case by no means unfrequent and which most of my reader will have witness -- a family in which the mother -- by no means incur the charge of spoil the child by spare the rod -- be less heed less promptly obey in she command than a father who seldom or never make use of any such mean the mother scold threaten scourge and be at last reluctantly and imperfectly obey the father either with reference to he own command or second those of the mother _ speak _ and be instantly regard the idea of dispute he authority or neglect or disobey he law never once enter the mind of he child exactly the same be it in a infant school -- the presence of a man insure attention and gain respect from the child not only at first whilst the novelty of such control might be suppose to operate but permanently as i be sure all who have candidly examine the school where two woman preside and those conduct by a man and a woman must have see another objection to the sole government of female -lrb- i mean the class of female who be likely to accept such situation -rrb- in these school be they have not the physical strength nor at present intellectual power sufficient for the task in say thus i trust i shall not be suspect of wish to offend my fair countrywoman that they have not sufficient physical strength be the intention of nature that they be deficient in mental energy be the defect of education i trust therefore that no offence will be assume where no blame be attach it have be a point much dispute whether there be really a original and intrinsic difference in the mental power of the two sex and it have be of course differently decide by the respective disputant with this i shall have nothing to do but these thing be certain that the mind of _ both _ be capable of much greater activity and more important result than have be generally suppose and that whilst education have not do what it ought for man it have do far less for woman this it be then which afford a additional argument in my mind for a master and a mistress for let it not be imagine that i would dismiss woman altogether from the system -- that i think they useless or even dispensable in a infant school if indeed one or the other _ must _ be do without and i have my choice i should certainly give my voice for a woman but to carry the system into full effect require _ both _ there be ample opportunity for the office of maternal love of which man be at best but a poor imitator neither can it be deny that a active intelligent woman be a useful auxiliary to the labor of the man in the duty of the school the authoritative presence of the man be the more necessary in the infant system because one grand object be to rule without harshness and by that principle of love which be in no degree incompatible with the respect feel for a kind but judicious schoolmaster some child indeed so far as regard authority might be very well manage by a mistress only but then it must be recollect that a infant school exhibit every variety of temper and disposition and even be it otherwise the objection as to intellectual incompetence and physical strength before advert to would still hold good such indeed be the opinion of the unfitness of female for the occupation of teaching in scotland that in many place the very idea of it be scout the people of that country have scarcely hear of a _ school-mistress _ even for the youngest child and certain it be that education be much better conduct in scotland than in most other place if the mind of child be to be cultivate and a firm and decide tone give to they character say they what can be the use of send they to a school conduct by a woman only and i must candidly admit that i perfectly agree with they on this head and have therefore deem it my duty to be thus explicit on the matter -lrb- a -rrb- -lrb- footnote a : i be sorry to say that at this time the people of scotland have be lead into the same error of which i have complain i do hope they would never have allow themselves to be lead away from they old judicious and workable plan far the sake of party or fashion but so it be and it be much to be regret : however it be a consolation to know that it be not universal -rrb- one thing i must add by way of conclusion : to render any man or woman competent to discharge the duty of the situation efficiently the _ heart _ of the teacher must be in the school if there be not the zeal of the amateur the skill of the professor will be of little avail the maxim will apply to every species of occupation but it be peculiarly true as to that of a infant school teacher to those who can feel no other interest than that which the profit give to the employment it will soon become not only irksome but exceedingly distasteful but certain i be that it be possible to feel it to be what it be -- a employment not only most important but likewise most interesting it be one which a philosopher might choose for the study of the human character and a philanthropist for its improvement one word more and i have do i have see what i could have wish have be otherwise viz not sufficient discrimination use in give _ religious instruction _ improper time have be choose too much _ shew _ have be make of it too much freedom have be use with _ the divine name _ and i have sometimes be so shocked at the levity display as to have consider it little less than _ profanation _ i wish to lay the utmost stress on what have be state as a failure on the part of a master and mistress be most grievous and lamentable i have see school where little or nothing have be do because of the inefficiency of the teacher moral and religious qualification be confessedly of the first importance but those which be mental be to be highly estimate i differ with a gentleman who have write on this subject when he say that any clever boy who have be educate in a national school will accomplish the end because the system through which he have pass neither give a sufficient knowledge of _ thing _ nor of _ word _ nor do it sufficiently develop the faculty to prepare he for such a service one cause of failure in these respects have be undoubtedly the paltry remuneration which some receive and i would earnestly recommend the supporter and conductor of infant school to try the effect of liberality by all the means they can command person of talent ought to be find for this work and then they should be appropriately pay but if _ any _ be to be deem suitable and if the have they at a low rate be a special reason for they engagement it would be better at once to revert to the old system than to destroy by such mean the public confidence in the plan now suggest i entertain a full conviction that the infant system will flourish most where i once least expect its adoption : i mean in scotland because of the high importance attach to the essential qualification of teacher and because of the attention and kindness which they continually receive it be to be lament that most of the school connect with the established church be manage by woman only whilst the school connect with the dissenter be generally conduct by a man and woman the consequence be that the child educate under the dissenter will be better teach than those connect with the established church which be a error i should be glad to see remedy as soon as possible i have no need to speak in favor of infant school master as many of they have be the greatest enemy i ever have whilst on the contrary the mistress have generally be very friendly to I and not be subject to those petty jealousy which the master have too frequently evince nevertheless the subject treat of in this place involve a principle which can not be concede without do great injury to the infant system and on those grounds i advocate the necessity of a master in conjunction with the mistress many teacher and other person who have write on the subject have talk largely of make improvement whilst the hint give in this book have be entirely neglect as this be the first book that ever be write on the subject and the writer of it the first man that ever bring the thing practically to bear it sound a little odd that people should talk about improvement before they have point out the error of the original inventor other again have borrow largely from I and have neither have the good manners nor the common honesty to say from whence they get they information society have be form at the eleventh hour after the infant system have be twenty year in practice who puff off book write by some of they own member which do not contain the original idea whilst my book for some cause best know to themselves have never be recommend or indeed ever mention though i could take page after page from those modern writer on the subject and justly claim they as my own this be not what one ought to expect amongst people who call themselves christian : a truly good man be delighted to do justice to he fellow-men because in do so he never fail to obtain justice himself but there be some person whose mind be so truly selfish that they can not see how good can accrue to themselves if they do what be right to other : and i regret to say i have meet with not a few who have be engage in the art of teaching who have be guilty of the mean and contemptible conduct i have hint at above and it be to deter other from fall into the same error that i have venture to allude to this subject at all it would be invidious to mention name which i could very easily do and should this be persist in if i be spare i shall most certainly mention the party by name i would not be understand to say that no improvement can be make in the infant system : far from it no doubt it will be improve and that to a great extent but that will only be in process of time and by practical people who understand more of the nature of the infant mind than i do and may hereafter have greater experience than i have have but they must work hard for it as i have do and be doer as well as talker : and when i see such improvement make i trust the almighty will enable I to be the first to acknowledge they at present however though i have travel over a large space and visit many hundred school and also open many hundred and have not yet see the mighty improvement of which i have read so much and i do beg that those teacher who may be engage in the system will be kind enough to try my plan prior to introduce so many crotchet of they own they be to recollect we never intend to make prodigy of the little child it never be we object to teach they thing that be only fit for man and woman : the fact must never be lose sight of that they be infant and that as infant they must be treat it be very easy for any one to theorise and form scheme for the education of child and to introduce change which may appear beneficial fancy be very prolific and a number of book may easily be read and yet the right knowledge not be gain the chief book to be study be the infant mind itself consider as a great and wonderful work of the creator with a sincere desire to know all its faculty and power and the various simple law by which its operation be govern the teacher ought also to turn he thought within himself to study he own mind especially in he recollection of very early childhood and the mode by which knowledge be gradually acquire these thing carefully and dilligently do will give more information on the proper method of educate and develop the young mind than the perusal of a hundred volume this i have endeavor all my life to do and have have to deal with many thousand of child who have be to I a book for constant study from this extensive observation and experience all my plan have be form and my opinion derive if any one have do the same or more to he i will gladly concede but i be not aware that any one individual not even pestalozzus have run a similar career chapter viii hint for conduct a infant school _ classification -- get the child into order -- language -- lesson on object -- rule to be observe by parent -- daily routine of instruction -- open prayer and hymn -- object or develop lesson -- synopsis of a week 's instruction -- cleanliness -- never frighten child -- guard against forgetfulness -- observe punctuality -- be strictly accurate in you expression -- guard against the entrance of disease -- maxim for teacher -- resolution _ \* \* \* \* \* whate'er be best administer would be best -- _ pope _ \* \* \* \* \* have have considerable practice in teaching child in the various part of england scotland ireland and wale it may be necessary to give a few hint on the subject of organize a infant school i have generally find on open one that the child have no idea of act together in order therefore to gain this object it will be find necessary to have recourse to what we call _ manual lesson _ which consist in the child hold up they hand all at one time and put they down in the same manner throw the right or the left foot out put they hand together or behind they or rise from they seat all at one time clap hand which be a very good exercise hold up they hand and twirl the finger hold up the forefinger and bring it down on the palm in time to some tune imitate the action of saw wood and the sound produce by the action of the saw do this both way as it be do in the saw-pit with both hand and by the carpenter with the right imitate the cobbler mending shoe the carpenter plaining wood the tailor sewing and any other trade which be familiar and please to child this we do in the first instance because it be calculate to please the infant and be one grand step towards order after the first day or two the child will begin to act together and to know each other but until this be the case they will be frequently peevish and want to go home any method therefore that can be take at first to gratify they should be adopt for unless this can be do you may be sure they will cry have proceed thus far we have then to class they accord to they capacity and age and accord as they shew a aptitude in obey you several command those who obey they with the greatest readiness may be class together i have find it difficult at all time to keep up the attention of infant without give they something to do so that when they be say the table in arithmetic we always cause they to move either they hand or foot and sometimes to march round the school the best way we have yet discover be the put they hand one on the other every time they speak a sentence if they be march they may count one two three four five six & c have class they and find that each child know its own place in the school you may select one of the cleverest of each class for a monitor some of the child will learn many of the table sooner than the other in this case the teacher may avail himself of they assistance by cause each child to repeat what he know in a audible manner the other child repeat after he and perform the same evolution that he do and by this mean the rest will soon learn then the master may go on with something else take care to obtain as much assistance from the child as he can for he will find that unless he do so he will injure he lung and render himself unfit to keep up they attention and to carry on the business of the school when the child have learn to repeat several of the table and the monitor to excite they several class and keep they in tolerable order they may go on with the other part of the plan such as the spelling and reading picture lesson & c which will presently be describe but care must be take that in the beginning too much be not attempt the first week may be spend in get they in order without thinking of anything else and i should advise that not more than sixty child be then admit that they may be reduce to order in some measure before any more be receive as all that come after will quickly imitate they i should moreover advise visitor not to come for some time after a school be open for several reason first because the child must be allow time to learn and there will be nothing worth see secondly they take off the child 's attention and interfere with the master : and lastly they may go away dissatisfied and thereby injure the cause which they intend to promote in teaching infant to sing i have find it the best way to sing the psalm or hymn several time in the hearing of the child without they attempt to do so until they have some idea of the tune because if all the child be allow to attempt and none of they know it it prevent those who really wish to learn from catch the sound nothing however can be more ridiculous or absurd than the attempt at singing i have hear in some school and here i would caution teacher against too much singing and also against introduce it at improper time singing take much _ out _ of the teacher which will soon be feel in the chest and cause pain and weakness there and if persevere in premature _ death _ and with woman much sooner than man this be another reason why one of each sex should be employ in the work singing be a exhilarating and exciting lesson the child always like it : but even they be injure by the injudicious management of it and by have too much of it each day or the have two or even three exciting lesson at the same time for example : i have see child singing march and clap hand at the same time and they be prompt and lead by the teacher to do so here be three exciting lesson together which ought to be separate : the result be a waste of energy and strength on the part of teacher and child which be sometimes fatal to both the exciting lesson be intend to be judiciously blended with the drier yet necessary study if the latter be neglect and the former only retain no greater perversion of the plan could occur and a more fatal error could not be commit you must not expect order until you little officer be well drill which may be do by collect they together after the other child be go and instruct they in what they be to do every monitor should know he work and when you have teach he this you must require it to be do to get good order you must make every monitor answerable for the conduct of he class it be astonishing how some of the little fellow will strut about big with the importance of office and here i must remark it will require some caution to prevent they from take too much upon themselves so prone be we even in we earliest year to abuse the possession of power the way by which we teach the child hymn be to let one child stand in a place where he may be see by the rest with the book in he hand he then read one line and stop until all the child in the school have repeat it which they do simultaneously he then repeat another and so on successively until the hymn be finish this method be adopt with every thing that be to be commit to memory so that every child in the school have a equal chance of learn i have mention that the child should be class : in order to facilitate this there should be a board fasten to the wall perpendicularly the same width as the seat every fifteen foot all round the school this will separate one class from another and be the cause of the child know they class the sooner make every child hang he hat over where he sit in he own class as this will save much trouble have a place for every thing and every thing in its place this will bring the child into habit of order never do any thing for a child that he be able to do for himself but teach he to put he own hat and coat on and hang they up again when he come to school teach every child to help himself as soon as possible if one fall down and you know that he be able to get up himself never lift he up if you do he will always lie till you can give he you aid have a slate or a piece of paper properly rule hang over every class let every child 's name that be in the class be write on it with the name of the monitor teach the monitor the name as soon as you can and then he will tell you who be absent have a semicircle before every lesson and make the child keep they toe to the mark brass nail drive in the floor be the best or flat brass or iron let into the floor when a monitor be ask the child question let he place he stool in the center of the semicircle and the child stand around he let the monitor ask what question they please they will soon get fond of the process and they pupil will soon be equally fond of answer they suppose the monitor ask what do i sit on where be you toe what do you stand on what be before you what behind you let the monitor be instruct in give simple object lesson on any familiar substance such as a piece of wood of stone of iron of paper of bone of linen & c let they question they class as to the quality first and then the various use to which the object be apply these lesson will be of incalculable benefit to the child and give they a early desire to inquire into the nature quality and use of every natural object they come into contact with we will suppose the monitor hold in he hand a piece of leather he first ask what be this the child will simultaneously exclaim a piece of leather this be answer he will proceed to the quality and will have either from he class or by he own help the follow answer : it be dry it be smooth it be hard it be tough it be pliable it be opaque & c he will then question they as to its use and will ask what be make from leather a boot and shoe q what use be it of else a book be bind with it and so on through all its use he will then ask they how leather be make and give they information which he have himself previously receive from the teacher as to the mode of tanning leather and the various process which it go through indeed there be no end to the varied information which child may thus receive from simple natural object at first they will have no idea of this mode of exercise the think power but the teacher must encourage they in it and they will very speedily get fond of it and be able to give a answer immediately it be very please to witness this i have be much delighted at the question put and still more so at the answer give assemble all the very small child together as soon as you can : the first day or two they will want to sit with they brother or sister who be a little older than themselves but the sooner you can separate they the better as the elder child frequently plague the younger one and i have always find that the youngest one be the happiest by themselves in all case let teacher be careful to avoid the parrot system and to remember that while it be necessary to infuse a certain amount of information into the child 's mind it can only be make its own by draw it back again and get its own idea upon it -- this be call development which be a thing universally disregard in almost every school i have see and it be a general complaint make by almost every modern writer on education and many have object to the infant system on this account because the teacher of it be not acquaint with its end and essence the true infant system be a system of development no other system can be of lasting benefit to the country in general nor to the pupil in particular the genuine infant system be not subject to the fundamental error so much complain of it have be invent for the purpose of operate upon all the faculty and the machine must not be condemn merely because the teacher do not know how to work it but every committee and each individual in a committee appear to lose sight of these principle in order to try how much originality may be display and thus utility be sacrifice to novelty thus we may find as many infant system as there be day in the year and i have be make chargeable by certain writer for the error of other but these writer have not condescend to examine into the merit of the system for which i have be so many year a advocate but enough of this : we will now suppose that the little flock be bring by thus time into something like order we be next to consider the means of secure other object although the follow rule for this purpose be give it must not be suppose that they be present as a model not to be depart from if they can be improve so much the better but some such will be find indispensable \* \* \* \* \* rule _ to be observe by the parent of child admit into the -- infant school _ 1 parent be to send they child clean wash with they hair cut short and comb and they clothes well mend by half-past eight o'clock in the morning to remain till twelve 2 if any child be later in attendance than nine o'clock in the morning that child must be send back until the afternoon and in case of be later than two in the afternoon it will be send back for the day 3 parent may send they child 's dinner with they in the morning so that the child may be take care of the whole day to enable the mother to go out to work this can only be do where the teacher reside on the premise 4 if a child be absent for a length of time without a notice be send to the master or mistress assign a satisfactory reason for the absence such child will not be permit to return again to the school Saturday be a holyday -lrb- a -rrb- -lrb- footnote a : in ireland the school do not commence business till ten in the morning and the child remain till three and do not go home in the interval in scotland the rule be nearly similar -rrb- \*\*\* it be earnestly hope that parent will see they own interest as well as that of they child in strictly observe these rule and they be exhort to submit to they child be govern by the master and mistress to give they good instruction and advice to accustom they to family prayer but particularly to see that they repeat the lord 's prayer when they rise in the morning and when they retire to rest and assist in they learn the commandment and to set before they a good example for in so do they may humbly hope that the blessing of almighty god will rest upon they and they family for we be assure in the holy scripture that if we train up a child in the way he should go when he be old he will not depart from it prov xxii 6 therefore parent may be instrumental in the promotion of the welfare of they child in this life and of they eternal happiness in the world to come \* \* \* \* \* on each of these rule i will make a few remark _ first rule _ some parent be so habitually dirty that they would not wash they child from one week 's end to another unless require so to do and if it be do for they they will not be so thankful as when compel to do it themselves this i have find from experience _ second rule _ this have its advantage for it would not be right to punish the child when the fault rest with they parent consequently by send they home the real author of the evil be punish many parent have tell I that when they child be at home they employ themselves in sing the alphabet count pat they hand & c & c that it be impossible to keep a infant asleep that they be glad to get they out of the way and that they would take care that they should not be late again but there be no rule without a exception i have find that this have its disadvantage for some of the elder child when they want a half-holiday would take care to be late in order to find the door shut although they be send in proper time by they parent this when detect subject they to a pat on the hand which be the only corporeal punishment we have if this rule be not strictly enforce the child would be come at all hour of the day which would put the school into such disorder that we should never know when all the child have say they lesson _ third rule _ this be of great service to those parent who go out to work for by send they child 's dinner with they they be enable to attend to they employment in comfort and the child when properly discipline will be no additional trouble to the teacher for they will play about the play-ground while he take he dinner without do any mischief _ fourth rule _ many person will keep they child away for a month or two when nothing be the matter with they consequently the child will lose almost all they have learn at school besides this child be keep out who perhaps would attend regularly and we should never know how many child be in the establishment if therefore a parent do not attend to this rule the child 's name be strike off the book on the admission of every child the parent should be supply with a copy of the precede rule as this will prevent they from plead any excuse it should be fasten on pasteboard otherwise they will double it up and put it into they pocket and forget all about it but be on pasteboard they may hang it up in they dwelling the short exhortation that follow it be hope may have its use by remind the parent of they duty to co-operate with those person who have the welfare both of themselves and they child at heart the reason for the holiday of Saturday be first that the teacher require a rest the infant system be so laborious second that the school-room require to be thoroughly clean and thirdly that many of the mother be oblige to wash the child 's clothes on a Saturday because they have not a sufficient change and if they do not have the Saturday they will break the sabbath by wash they on Sunday i shall next speak of the _ daily routine _ of instruction if we would be successful in we labor we most ask for help -- we must solicit aid from that be who never yet deny it when sincerely and fervently implore a minister who desire to instruct he flock with effect never fail to commence he work with supplication and certainly every teacher must ask for help and instruct he pupil to do so too if he really wish to be successful if the wisest and best of man ask assistance from god to teach they fellow-men and feel and know it to be necessary so to do who would not ask assistance to instruct infant to lead they into virtue 's path and up to truth divine if we have only to educate the _ head _ prayer might be less necessary but the promoter of _ infant school _ want to affect the _ heart _ to operate upon the will and the conscience as well as on the understanding to make good man rather than learn man -- man of _ wisdom _ rather than man of _ knowledge _ : and he who have this work to accomplish should remember the savior 's declaration without I ye can do nothing whilst therefore i would avoid too frequent repetition of the divine name in tire presence of the child and never fail to let they know the difference between talk religion and do religion and in every case avoid the very appearance of the form without the essence i would in such case avoid long prayer and take care that what be say in they presence should be short and to the point keep in mind the scripture maxim to avoid long repetition as the heathen do who think they shall be hear for they much speaking and little child can not have the simple truth of the word pourtray to they in too simple a manner to use prayer with little child compose of hard word take from scholastic theology be contrary to common sense how be it possible that they can either understand or feel they to utter prayer before they in dull and melancholy tone and with grimace of countenance be calculate to give a false and gloomy impression of religion and have often do so i have know little child alarm and frighten at such thing for sound and appearance speak more strongly to they than word -- christ say of the pharisee they disfigure they face we savior 's direction be after this manner pray ye -- we father thus direct we to draw near to the most high god as a heavenly father rich in mercy to all they that call upon he true indeed it be that all have sin but a new and living way be provide whereby we may draw near with boldness to a throne of grace to obtain mercy and find grace to help in time of need cowper never pen a truer line than this true piety be cheerful as the day and such a impression of it should ever be give to the young the best prayer of a master for he child be the perpetual and strong desire of he heart for god 's blessing upon they which when genuine and sincere will without doubt be record on high and will also urge he on to a faithful and unceasing discharge of he duty towards they to possess this be indeed to pray without cease and will prevent a unnecessary multiplication of long prayer vain repetition and much speaking but to proceed the child be assemble should be desire to stand up and immediately afterwards to kneel down all close to they seat and as silently as possible : those who be not strong enough to kneel may be allow to sit down this be do a child be to be place in the center of the school and to repeat the follow prayer : -- o god we heavenly father thou art good to we : we would serve thee we have sin and do wrong many time jesus christ die on the cross for we forgive we sin for jesus ' sake may the holy spirit change we heart and make we to love god help we to-day to be good child and to do what be right keep we from wicked thought and bad temper make we try to learn all that we be teach keep we in health all the day we would always think of god and when we die may we go to heaven god bless we father and mother and sister and brother and we teacher and make we obedient and kind for jesus christ 's sake aman perhaps it would be better under all the circumstance to use a simple prayer out of the book of common prayer the child afterwards repeat the lord 's prayer and then sing a hymn for instance the following : when first the morning light we see and from we bed arise we to we god should thankful be who every want supplies 'twa god who make the brilliant sun that give all day its light and it be god who make the moon and star which shine at night the fish that in the water swim the beast upon the land be all create first by he and shew he mighty hand the food we eat the clothes we wear ` tis god alone can give and only by he love and care can little child live then let we ever caution take he holy law to keep and praise he from the time we wake until again we sleep immediately after this they proceed to they lesson which be fix to what be call lesson-post to each of these post there be a monitor who be provide with a piece of cane for a pointer this post be place opposite to he class and every class have one up to which the monitor bring the child three or four at a time accord to the number he have in he class we have fourteen class and sometimes more which be regularly number so that we have one hundred child move and say they lesson at one time when these be go through the child be supply with picture which they put on the post the same as the spelling and reading lesson but say they in a different manner we find that if a class always go through its lesson at one post it soon lose its attraction and consequently although we can not change they from post to post in the spelling and reading lesson because it would be useless to put a child to a reading post that do not know its letter yet we can do so in the picture lesson as the child be all alike in learn the object one child can learn a object as quick as another so that we may have many child that can tell the name of different subject and even the name of all the geometrical figure who do not know all the letter in the alphabet and i have have child whom one might think be complete blockhead on account of they not be able to learn the alphabet so quickly as some of the other child and yet those very child would learn thing which appear to I ten time more difficult this prove the necessity of variety and how difficult it be to legislate for child instead therefore of the child stand opposite they own post they go round from one to another repeat whatever they find at each post until they have be all round the school for instance at no 1 post there may be the follow object the horse the ass the zebra the cow the sheep the goat the spring antelope the cameleopard the camel the wild boar the rhinoceros the elephant the hippopotamus the lion the tiger the leopard the civet the weazel the great white bear the hyena the fox the greenland dog the hare the mole the squirrel the kangaroo the porcupine and the racoon before commence these lesson two boy be select by the master who perhaps be not monitor these two boy bring the child up to a chalk line that be make near no 1 post eight at a time one of the boy get eight child stand up ready always begin at one end of the school and take they to this chalk line whilst the other boy take they to no 1 post and deliver they up to the charge of no 1 monitor no 1 monitor then point to the different animal with a pointer until the name of every one that be on he plate have be repeat this do he deliver they to no 2 monitor who have a different picture at he post perhaps the following : the fishmonger mason hatter cooper butcher blacksmith fruiterer distiller grocer turner carpenter tallow-chandler milliner dyer druggist wheelwright shoemaker printer coach-maker bookseller bricklayer linen-draper cabinet-maker brewer painter bookbinder this do no 2 monitor deliver they over to no 3 monitor who may have a representation of the follow african costume : viz egyptian bey ashantee algerine copt woman mameluke native of morocco tibboo woman egyptian woman fellah bedouin arab turkish foot soldier maltese rosettan native of cairo turkish gentleman bosjesman native of coronna native of namacqua caffree native of tamaha native of ebo have repeat these no 3 monitor hand they over to no 4 who perhaps have a engraved clock face with hand compose of two piece of wood over which paper in the shape of clock hand have be paste he give the child a lesson from this object explain to they the difference between the minute and second-hand shew they they use and point out the dot which mark the minute and the figure which divide it into hour make they count the seconds and soon tell the hour no 4 then give the class to no 5 monitor who have at he post a representation of the mariner 's compass he explain its use shew they the cardinal point tell they how it be discover and then he will move the hand around begin at the north and make the child repeat as he move the hand north north-north-east north-east east-north-east east east-south-east south-east south-south-east south south-south west south-west west-south-west west west-north-west north-west north-north-west north the degree & c may be consider as go too far for infant we therefore reserve they until we treat of juvenile school we have not think it necessary to name all the point of the compass but have

not stay in one place longer than while it give they food for themselves and they horse of which they have a great many horse be wild in tartary the reader will at once perceive what a feast be afford to the young mind in these object lesson the object be accurately copy from nature and the costume from the best source so that the infant mind be expand by view a proper representation of the real thing through the fit organ the eye it be astonishing what infant will learn through the sense of see and it be remarkable that we system of education for young and old should not have be found on a knowledge of the high importance of this medium for communication and information the youngest child may learn to distinguish one object from another to a endless variety and i could produce child who could point I out a thousand object if i call they by they proper name who perhaps could not themselves name twenty of the object out of the thousand by this it will be see we first give they the object and language itself follow in due course whenever a clear idea or notion be give to the mind by a picture or object it be then easy to impart the information that be naturally connect with it and this will then be most strongly retain accord to the law of association which be one of the most important principle to be keep in view in impart instruction to both young and old lead on from _ something know _ to _ something unknown _ be a golden rule -- a most valuable axiom that all teacher should ever bear constantly in mind what important lesson may be give in a field wood or forest how much better be the thing itself for a lesson than the representation of it and what a class of teacher be want for this work yet sure i be that in due time the great god will raise such up from amongst he people to the glory of he name and the benefit of succeed generation may greater mind than the humble writer of this be call to work in this bless vineyard for the good of the species and for the diminution of crime and oh may they be able to dive into the recess of the wonderful work of god to grapple with the difficulty therein find and bring to light some of the hidden mystery for the instruction of mankind when this book be first write thirty-two year ago some of the idea be universally scout yet i have live to see the day that the very man who sneer at the view first make know in this book adopt precisely the same principle and even go much further that i ever intend or even think suitable for infant mind and quietly puff this off as a new discovery in infant training so much the better portion of the public will hear they and they would not listen to I and if the end be answer it be of little consequence through what mean that end be gain it be satisfactory to know that the principle first develop in the infant plan be find equally applicable to older child and i have have the pleasure of see those principle carry out in many school throughout the country too numerous to mention individually it will be see from what have be say that the plan of the child march from one post to the other be the very thing for infant as exercise and develop they locomotive power a thing exceedingly desirable for young child the great error of the old infant system or in other word the dame-school plan be the keep the pupil rivet to they seat here they be march from one place to another and get ting food for every sense take as another example the picture of the trade the monitor say to he little pupil as they come up what do a fishmonger sell the

put cover on book these lesson be all supply by I more explanation in this place may be unnecessary but as a further guide to teacher of infant school i subjoin a synopsis of a week 's course of instruction which have be adopt in many school \* \* \* \* \* synopsis of a week 's instruction time -- _ morning _ school to assemble at nine o'clock and to leave at twelve _ afternoon _ school to

wish any particular lesson to be go through and the child appear dispose the master be not bind to adhere to the above rule neither at any other time if the child appear particularly disincline \* \* \* \* \* there be a few other matter on which before conclude this chapter i must speak as claim the attention of infant school conductor first attend to cleanliness although we have refer to this before yet as it be of considerable importance not only to the child but to those around they it may not be amiss to take up a little more of the reader 's time and to state the different plan that have be devise in order to make the child as clean as possible in one case a trough be erect and a pipe provide to convey the water into it but before it have be up a month it be find that instead of answer the end intend it have quite a contrary effect for the child dabble in the trough and make themselves ten time worse than they be by wet themselves from head to foot besides which it frequently cause they to take cold of which the parent complain some take they child away without notice other come and give the master what they call _ a good set down _ it be therefore think necessary to forbid the child wash themselves and to wash all that come dirty but it be soon find that the dirty child increase so fast that it require one person 's time to attend to they besides which it have another bad effect it encourage the parent in laziness and they tell I when i complain of they send the child to school dirty that indeed they have no time to wash they child there be a trough in the school for that purpose and the person who have charge of the school be pay for it and ought to do it in consequence of this the trough be take away and it be represent to the parent that it be they duty to keep they child clean that unless they do so they would be send home to be wash and if they persist in send they without be wash there would be no alternative left but to dismiss they from the school altogether this offend some of the parent and they take they child out of the school but many afterwards petition to have they readmit i mention this merely to prevent other who may be concern in the establishment of infant school from incur a unnecessary expense and to shew that the parent will value the school equally as well if you make they wash they child as if you do it for they the plan that we have act upon to enforce cleanliness be as follow : as soon as the child be assemble in the school the monitor cause they to hold out they hand with they head up they then inspect they hand and they face and all those who be dirty be desire to stand out to be examine by the master who will easily perceive whether they have be wash that morning if not they be send home to be wash and if the mother have any sense of propriety she will take care that it shall not often occur but it may be find that some have be wash and be play with the dirt when come to school which some child be very apt to do in this case they have a pat on the hand which generally cure they there be much trouble at first to keep the child quite clean some of they parent be habitually dirty and in such case the child will be like they these will therefore require more trouble than other but they will soon acquire cleanly habit and with proper management become as cleanly as any of the other child as soon as a child be take into the school the monitor show he a certain place and explain to he that when he want to go into the yard he be to ask he and he will accompany he there of course there be separate accommodation for each sex and such prudential arrangement make as the case require but which it be unnecessary further to particularize -lrb- a -rrb- -lrb- footnote a : this be a subject of the highest importance in moral training and deserve the serious attention of committee as well as teacher : inattention to these matter may demoralize every child that enter the school in many school throughout the country i have see great want of attention to this subject the seat be too high the circular hole too large cause fear on the part of the infant and also bad habit the seat should be the same height as the seat in the school -- six inch and nine inch high the diameter of the hole seven inch and nine inch -- the teacher should constantly visit these place inculcate habit of delicacy and cleanliness such habit form in childhood be never forget superfine dressy teacher will be too proud and too high to attend to these thing -- but the judicious mother or matron will at once see they importance and act accordingly -- as the twig be bent the tree 's inclined -rrb- 2 never frighten child it be common for many person to threaten to put child into the black hole or to call the sweep to take they away in he bag when they do not behave as they ought but the ill effect of this mode of proceeding may be perceive from the follow fact i know a child who have be to one of those school where the child of mechanic be usually send call dame ' school which be keep by a elderly woman who it seem have put this child into the coal-hole and tell he that unless he be a good boy the black man would come and take he away this so frightened the child that he fall into a violent fit and never afterwards could bear the sight of this woman on the mother get the child admit into we school she desire I to be very gentle with he relate to I all the above story except that the child have have a fit about a fortnight after the admission of the child he come run one day into the school exclaim i 'll be a good boy master master i 'll be a good boy as soon as he catch sight of I he cling round and grasp I with such violence that i really think the child be mad in a few minute after this he go into strong convulsion and be such a dreadful spectacle that i think the child would die in my arm in this state he remain for about twenty minute and i fully expect he would be carry out of the school a corpse i send for the mother but on she arrival i perceive she be less alarmed than myself she immediately say the child be in a fit and that i have frighten he into it i tell she that she be mistake that the child have only just enter the school and i be ignorant of the cause of he fright but several of my little scholar soon set the matter to rest by state the particulars of the fright which they observe when come to school it seem that a man be in the street who sweep chimney with a machine and just as the little fellow pass he he call out sweep this so alarmed the child that he think the man be go to take he and be affect by he fear in the way i have state the child however get better and the mother hearing what the child say begged my pardon for have accuse I wrongfully and then tell I the whole particulars of he first fright and the woman and the coal-hole i have the greatest difficulty imaginable to persuade he that a sweep be a human being and that he love little child as much as other person after some time the child get somewhat the better of he fear but not wholly so he have but one fit afterwards this shew how improper it be to confine child by themselves or to threaten they in the manner describe many person continue nervous all they life through such treatment and be so materially injure that they be frighten at they own shadow it be also productive of much mischief to talk of mystery ghost and hobgoblin before child which many person be too apt to do some deal so much in the marvellous that i really believe they frighten many child out of they sens i recollect when i be a child hearing such story till i have actually be afraid to look behind I how many person be frighten at such a little creature as a mouse because the nature of that little creature have not be explain to they in they infancy indeed child should have all thing shew they if possible that they be likely to meet with : and above all it should be impress upon they mind that if they meet with no injury from the live it be most certain the dead will never hurt they and that he who fear god need have no other fear it be also common with many person to put a disobedient child into a room by itself i can not approve of this method as the child be frequently frighten into quietness without improve he temper in the least if it be day time it be not so bad but if it be dark the consequence be often serious and materially injure the constitution of the child the more i reflect upon this subject the more do i see its impropriety i would rather use the rod in moderation and mercy i be sure it be better for the disobedient and unruly child and more accord to the dealings of the creator with we all i can truly say my punishment which have not be slight have do I good as child we can not see these thing as man and thinker we can yea and kiss the rod 3 guard against forgetfulness the circumstance i be about to mention shew how necessary it be to teach by example as well as precept many of the child be in the habit of bring marble top whistle and other toy to the school which often cause much disturbance for they would play with they instead of attend to they lesson and i find it necessary to forbid the child from bring anything of the kind after give notice therefore two or three time in the school i tell they that if any of they bring such thing they would be take away from they in consequence of this several thing fall into my hand which i do not always think of return and among other thing a whistle belong to a little boy the child ask I for it as he be go home but have several visitor at the time put he off tell he not to plague I and he go home i have forget the circumstance altogether but it appear the child have not for some time after while i be lecture the child upon the necessity of tell truth and on the wickedness of steal the little fellow approach I and say _ please sir you steal my whistle _ steal you whistle say i do i not give it you again no teacher i ask you for it and you would not give it to I i stand self-convicted be accuse in the middle of my lecture before all the child and really at a loss to know what excuse to make for i have mislay the whistle and could not return it to the child i immediately give the child a halfpenny and say all i could to persuade the child that it be not my intention to keep it however i be satisfied that this trifling mistake of mine do more harm than i be able to repair during some time for if we wish to teach child to be honest we should never take anything from they without return it again indeed person have charge of child can never be too cautious and should not on any account whatever break a promise for experience have teach I that most child have good memory and if you once promise a thing and do not perform it they will pay very little attention to what you say afterwards 4 observe punctuality a little girl whose mother be dead be often absent from school she be never at a loss for excuse but from they frequency i be at last induce to suspect they truth none of the child know where she reside so i be oblige to send the eldest boy in the school home with she to ascertain whether or not she story be true i give the boy positive direction to make haste back but much to my surprise i see no more of he for six hour when he return he tell I that the little girl refuse to shew he where she live and have take he so far that he at last determine to leave she but could not find he way back sooner in the evening i go myself accord to the direction i have enter in the admission-book but find that the family be remove and the person in the house could not tell I where they have go to reside i see nothing of the child for the five following day when a woman who have the care of she and she little brother in arm come to inquire the reason why the girl come home at such irregular hour state that sometimes she come home at half-past eleven at other time not till two and sometimes at three in the afternoon : in short often a hour after school be over i tell she that the child be frequently absent and that it be five day since i have see she the woman appear quite surprised and tell I that she have always send the child to school at the regular time that when she come home before the usual hour she say she governess have send all the child home a little sooner and if she come home after the time then she say that there have be some lady visit the school and that the child have be keep for they inspection here i must acknowledge that i have frequently detain child a little while after school-hour when we have have visitor but since it furnish the child with a excuse for go home late i think it would be better to discontinue the practice and would hint to those lady and gentleman who feel inclined to visit such school that they should come between the hour of nine and twelve in the forenoon or two and four in the afternoon i have only to observe that the child i have be speak of come to the school very regularly afterwards there be another subject too important to be pass without notice i mean the punctual attendance of the pupil if the teacher be firm and determine to secure this _ it can be do _ in ireland where the value of time and punctuality be least understand the thing be accomplish -- whilst no better lesson can be give to those who have to work for they daily bread than punctuality if a child can not attend school at nine how can it attend work at six in the morning be firm and the object be gain 5 be strictly accurate in you expression one day when the child be assemble in the gallery have none of they usual lesson at hand i take from my pocket a piece of paper and promise they that if they would answer I every question i put concern the paper i would at last make a paper boat i proceed in the follow manner : what be this what color what be its use how make what make of & c these question be answer accord to they different view and have fold the paper into a variety of form and obtain they idea upon such form i proceed to fulfil my promise of form it into the shape of a boat but the child see I at a loss exclaim please sir you can not do it which prove the fact as i have forget the plan and be oblige to make the confession then sir rejoin one of the boy you should not have promise in the course of my observation i have frequently enjoin the child to make every possible use of they think power but it appear i have at the same time forget to make use of my own and consequently have be betray into a promise which i be not able to perform i remember some other instance : one of the child happen to kick another the injure party complain to the person who then have the charge of the school say please sir this boy kick I it be time for the child to leave school the master wave he hand towards the gate through which the child pass thoughtlessly say at the same time kick away mean that the complainant be to take no more notice of the affair but go home the complainant however return to the other child begin kick he and receive some kick himself a friend be present and see two child kick each other he very naturally inquire the reason please sir reply the child master tell we master tell you say the gentleman that can not be i 'll ask he he accordingly inquire into the truth of the affair and receive for answer certainly not yes say the child you do sir do not i tell you just now that a boy kick I yes say the master you do then please sir say the child you tell I to go and kick away the master immediately recollect that he have say so this fact shew how improper it be to say one thing to a child and mean another these child be under the influence of obedience _ and in the light of truth _ and be in that light they could see from no other and very naturally conclude the master mean what he have say one day some visitor request i would call out a class of the child to be examine have do so i ask the visitor in what they would wish the child to be examine at the same time state that they might hear the child examine in natural history scriptural history arithmetic spelling geography or geometry they choose the latter and i procede to examine the child accordingly begin with straight line have continue this examination for about half a hour we proceed to enter into particulars respect triangle and have discourse on the difference between isosceles triangle and scalene triangle i observe that a acute isosceles triangle have all its angle acute and proceed to observe that a right-angled scalene triangle have all its angle acute the child immediately begin to laugh for which i be at a loss to account and tell they of the impropriety of laugh at I one of the child immediately reply please sir do you know what we be laugh at i reply in the negative then sir say the boy i will tell you please sir you have make a blunder i think i have not proceed to defend myself when the child reply please sir you convict yourself i reply how so why say the child you say a right-angled triangle have one right angle and that all its angle be acute if it have one right angle how can all its angle be acute i soon perceive the child be right and that i be wrong here then the reader may perceive the fruit of teach the child to think inasmuch as it be shewn that child of six year of age and under be able to refute they tutor if child have be teach to think many year ago error would have be much more easily detect and its baneful influence would not have have that effect upon society which at this day unfortunately we be oblige to witness at another time i be lecture the child in the gallery on the subject of cruelty to animal when one of the little child observe please sir my big brother catch the poor fly and then stick a pin through they and make they draw the pin along the table this afford I a excellent opportunity of appeal to they feeling on the enormity of this offence and among other thing i observe that if the poor fly have be gifted with the power of speech like they own it probably would have exclaim _ while dead _ as follow : -- you naughty child how can you think of torture I so be there not room in the world for you and I do i ever do you any harm do it do you any good to put I in such pain why do you do it you be big enough to know better how would you like a man to run a piece of wire through you body and make you draw thing about would you not cry at the pain go then you wicked boy and learn to leave off such cruel action have finish one of the child reply how can any thing speak if it be dead why say i suppose it could speak you mean to say sir be the rejoinder _ die _ instead of _ dead _ it will of course be understand that in this case i purposely misuse a word and the child be teach to think easily detect it 6 watch against the entrance of disease it may probably be consider presumption in I to speak of the disease of child as this more properly belong to the faculty but let it be observe that my pretension be not to cure the disease that child be subject to but only to prevent those which be infectious from spread i have find that child between the age of two and seven year be subject to the measles hoop cough fever ophthalmia ringworm scald-head and in very poor neighborhood the itch -- and small-pox this last be very rare owe to the great encouragement give to vaccination and be it not for the obstinacy of many of the poor i believe it would be totally extirpate during the whole of the time i superintend a school i hear of only three child die of it and those have never be vaccinate i always make a point of inquire on the admission of a child whether this operation have be perform and if not i strongly recommend that it should be if parent speak the truth i have but few child in the school who have not be vaccinate : this account therefore for have lose but three child through the small-pox the measles however i consider a very dangerous disorder and we lose a great many child by it besides two of my own it be precede by a violent cough the child 's eye appear watery and it will also be sick as soon as these symptom be perceive i would immediately send the child home and desire the parent to keep it there for a few day in order to ascertain if it have the measles and if so it must be prohibit from return to school until well this caution be absolutely necessary as some parent be so careless that they will send they child when the measles be thick out upon they the same may be say with respect to other disease for unless the person who have charge of the school attend to these thing the parent will be glad to get they child out of the way and will send they though much afflict without consider the ill-effect that may be produce in the school whether such conduct in the parent proceeds from ignorance or not i be not able to say but this i know that i have have many parent offer child for admission with all the disease i have mention and who manifest no disposition to inform I of it the number of child who may be sick from time to time may be average at from twenty to thirty-five out of two hundred we have never have less than twenty absent on account of illness and once or twice we have as many as fifty soon after i first take charge of the establishment i find that there be five or six child in the school who have the measles the consequence be that it contaminate the whole school and about eight child die one of my own being of that number this induce I to be very cautious in future and i make a point of walk round the school twice every day in order to inspect the child and after the adoption of this plan we do not have the measles in the school the hooping-cough be know of course by the child hooping but i consider it the safest plan to send all child home that have any kind of cough this will cause the mother to come and inquire the reason why the child be send home and it can be ascertain from she whether the child have have the hooping-cough or not with respect to fever i generally find the child appear chilly and cold and not unfrequently they be sick i do not however feel myself competent to describe the early symptom of this disorder but the best way to prevent its gain ground in the school be to send all the child home who appear the least indispose as to the ophthalmia i can describe the symptom of that disease have have it myself together with the whole of my family it generally come in the left eye first and cause a sensation as if something be in the eye which prick and shoot and produce great pain : the white of the eye will appear red or what be usually call blood-shot this if not speedily attend to will cause blindness i have have several child that have be blind with it for several day in the morning the patient be not able to unclose they eye for some time after they be awake as soon as i observe these appearance i immediately send the child home for i have ascertain beyond a doubt that the disease be contagious and if a child be suffer to remain with it in the school the infection will speedily spread among the child as child be frequently apt to burn or scald themselves i will here insert a method for adoption in such case it be very simple yet infallible at least i have never know it to fail it be no other than the application of common write ink one of my own child burn its hand dreadfully and be cure by immediately wash it all over with that liquid several child burn they hand against the pipe that be connect with the stove in the school-room and be cure by the same mean one boy in particular take hold of a hot cinder that fall from the fire and it quite singe he hand i apply ink to it and it be cure in a very short time let any one therefore who may happen to receive a burn apply ink to it immediately and he will soon witness the good effect of the application thirty-three year ' experience have prove to I that _ stove _ in any school be a nuisance : the common fire place be better than heating with hot air hot water or stove of any description that i have yet see the grate be low as at railway station be a improvement and answer well have theorist see the white face dull eyed child that i have see where stove be use and feel the head ache which i have feel they would soon banish they from every school 7 never correct a child in anger 8 never overlook a fault 9 in all thing set before the child a example worthy of imitation \* \* \* \* \* i should recommend the adoption of the follow resolution of a intelligent and zealous committee and that a copy of they be send to each master and mistress that as this infant school be establish for the express purpose of carry into the fullest effect the system of mr wilderspin which the committee be convince be practicable and excellent the master be desire to make himself perfectly acquaint with it in its physical mental and moral bearing by a study of mr wilderspin 's work on the subject and particularly of the last and most complete edition that the rule as print be strictly adhere to by the master that child who be ill have hooping-cough ringworm or other contagious disease be refuse admission until perfectly restore that the business of the school begin precisely at the time appoint and that during the shortest day the signal for leave school be not give till four o'clock precisely that except during the time give accord to the system to play the whole be occupy by the mistress as well as the master in the instruction of the child and that the plan lay down in mr wilderspin 's book be follow as nearly as possible so that the apparatus already provide may be gradually bring into action and the child have all the advantage of the system the master and mistress so divide they labor that all the child may be occupy that the master and mistress pay the utmost attention to the child learn to read that when a child be absent a week the master state the cause to the treasurer to prevent mistake as to the payment and that when a child decline attend or be exclude immediate notice be give to the secretary of the lady ' committee that the master be desire to go on with the business of the school when visitor who be member of the committee be present and only to pay particular attention to those who may be stranger and who require information that all application from the master be make to the committee through the secretary that all order from the committee to the teacher be convey through the same channel chapter ix gallery teaching -- moral and religious instruction _ original intention of the gallery -- what lesson be adapt for it -- its misapplication -- selection of teacher -- observation -- gallery lesson a a feather -- a spider -- a

moral culture -- anecdote -- simpson on moral education -- observation -- hint to teacher _ there be no part of the infant system which have be more misunderstand than the system of give lesson in the gallery and hence i have think it necessary to devote a larger space to the subject than i do in the former edition of this work the gallery be originally intend by I to give the child such lesson as appeal directly to the sens either orally or by representative object : thus the teaching arithmetic by the frame and ball inasmuch as it appeal to the eye as well as to the understanding be suitable for a gallery lesson the same observation hold good with respect to a scripture picture or the representation of a animal a tree or any object that can be present to the eye we have also find it very useful in teach the catechism or anything that be to be commit to memory and this part of we plan have prove so useful and successful that it have be adopt in many school for older child of both sex i mean in the normal school of glasgow and edinburgh the corporation school of liverpool and the government model school at dublin in the two latter the arrangement both in the fitting up of the play-grounds gallery and school-room be make under my especial inspection and i have no doubt that the use of the gallery when it become more generally know in large school will become universal the teach should see the face of the teacher in these lesson and the teacher should see the face of the teach : it establish a sympathy between both to the advantage of each the face be the index to the mind and at time shew the intention even without word some animal can read this index : the horse the dog the elephant and many of the higher order of animal child can always read the countenance of the sincere the wise and the good yea mere infant can reader do not smile be this the time and place i could demonstrate these opinion by _ fact _ this be not a book for controversy and metaphysical disquisition but for use to teacher when the child and teacher see each other as in the gallery the effect be highly beneficial this may be prove by any teacher as to the cause for this effect it would be out of place to argue it here i therefore simply state it be true sympathy be a power destine to be of use in teaching and hereafter will be better understand many friend to infant education and casual visitor have find these erection in infant school have conclude that the child should always be sit on they which be a fatal error and deprive the child of that part of the system which legislate for the exercise of they locomotive power such as the spelling and reading lesson and the method of teaching object lesson as describe in another part of this work : the consequence have be that the school have become mere parrot-school and the child be restless and inattentive and this have not be the only evil that have attend a misapplication of the gallery for the teacher for want of know the system properly have be at a loss how to occupy the time of the child and score of teacher have ruin they own constitution and also the constitution of some of the child by the perpetual talking and singing which i be sorry to say too many consider to be the sum total of the system : and i may state here that the child should never be more than one hour at a time or at most two hour during the day in the gallery all beyond this be injurious to the teacher and doubly so to the little pupil the forenoon be always the best time for gallery lesson the teacher 's mind be more clear and the mind of the child be more receptive after the child have take they dinner they should be entertain with the object lesson a small portion of spelling and reading and the rest of the afternoon should be devote to moral and physical teaching in the play-ground if the weather will at all permit it the more you rob you child of they physical education to shew off they intellectual acquirement the more injury you do they health and you own and in the effort to do too much you violate the law of nature defeat you own object and make the school a hot-bed of precocity instead of a rational infant ' school for the training and educate infant i have be blame by writer on the infant system for that which i never do and never recommend i have be make answerable for the error and mis-conception of other who have not trouble themselves to read my writings and in they anxiety to produce something new and original have stray from the very essential part of the plan and on this account i be charge by several writer with be unacquainted with the philosophy of my own system i think three-and-thirty year ago that if i could arrest public attention to the subject it be as much as could be expect i know very well at that time that a dry philosophical detail would neither be receive or read my object be to appeal to the sens of the public by do the thing in every town where practicable by this method i succeed where the other would have fail but it by no means follow that i be unacquainted with the philosophy of my own plan merely because i prefer the do of the thing to the write about it believe however that the time have now arrive and that the public mind be better prepared than it be then i have think i might venture to go a little more into detail in order to remove some well found objection which but for this reason would not have exist the infant mind like a tender plant require to be handle and deal with carefully for if it be force and injudiciously treat during the first seven year of its existence it will affect its whole constitution as long as it live afterwards there be hundred of person who will not believe this and those person will employ mere boy and girl to teach infant let they do so if they please i simply protest against it and merely give it as my opinion that it be highly improper to do so if ever infant school be to become real blessing to the country they must be place under the care of wise discreet and experienced person for no other will be fit or able to develop and cultivate the infant faculty aright i have feel it necessary to make these remark because in different part of the country i have find mere child employ as school-master and school-mistress to the great detriment of the young commit to they charge and the dishonor of the country that permit it no wise man would put a mere child to break he colt none but a foolish one would employ a inexperienced boy to break in he dog even the poultry and pig would be attend by a person who know something about they but almost any creature who can read and write and be acquaint with the first rule of arithmetic be too frequently think a fit and proper person to superintend infant i know many instance of discard servant totally unfit make teacher of infant merely to put they in place to the destruction of the highest and most noble of god 's creature which i contend infant be to expect that such person can give gallery lesson as they ought to be give be expect what will never nor can take place the public must possess different view of the subject more rational idea on the art of teaching must be entertain and greater remuneration must be give to teacher and greater effort make to train and educate they to fit they for the office before any very beneficial result can be see and it be to produce such result and a better tone of feeling on the subject that i have thus venture to give my opinion more in detail efficient gallery lesson -- efficient teacher must be make they do not at present exist in large number and can only be make by a suitable reward be hold out to they and by they be place under the superintendence of experienced person acquaint with the art the art of teaching be no mean art and must sooner or later take its proper rank amongst the other science it be a science which require deep study and knowledge of human character and be only to be learn like all other science by much perseverance and practice in another work on the education of older child i have give some specimen of gallery lesson in this i shall endeavor to give a few specimen of what i think useful lesson for infant and shall also try to clothe they in language suit to the infant apprehension and i sincerely hope they may shew in a plain manner the method of give this species of instruction to the child and that teacher who be before ignorant of it may be benefit thereby i shall not pretend to give my opinion as to whether i have succeed but will leave this point entirely to the judgment and candor of my reader for i know by experience that it be a very difficult thing to put practice into theory and although this may seem paradoxical yet i have no doubt that many have experience the very same result when try to explain theoretically on paper what they have with ease practice a thousand time these oral lesson on real object ought to be give in pure simple and plain language level to the understanding and capacity of child it may be well at time to use word of a more difficult or scientific character but these should always have the proper explanation give the word use most frequently in common life in ordinary and proper conversation ought to be most strongly impressed on they memory it may perhaps be retort on I -- why then teach the difficult and scientific name of geometrical figure the answer be very simple most of they have no other and where they have i always give they also as sloping slanting inclined for oblique the geometrical figure be the element of all form and the simplest object which can be present to the young i have find they always learn with the greatest ease and pleasure pestalozzus i have understand be lead to the use of they by observe the want of the young mind in a similar manner that i be myself this be therefore one of the many coincidence in thought and discovery by mind wholly independent of each other which have be direct to the same subject this be a evitable result if two man look at the moon both must see that it be round bright and mottled and if two mind far apart turn they attention to similar subject the probability be that they view will coincide the most powerful mind will of course make the deepest and simplest discovery object lesson should be give chiefly on such thing as fall under more constant observation and be daily come before the sight and then useful knowledge will be accumulate and frequently reimpress upon the memory by the see of the object gallery lesson on a feather we will suppose the child all properly seat the little girl on one side of the gallery and the little boy on the other as represent on the plan-plate if the morning be fine and clear a lesson may be give on a object that the child be not frequently in the habit of see but should the weather be hazy and the atmosphere heavy then a lesson must be give on some object which they all frequently see say for example a feather the feather must be hold up in the hand or place in a small niche on the top of a pointer so that every child will see it and it must be move about in various direction to arrest they attention the first lesson should be pure development which be to get every idea from the child relative to the object before you explain to they yours as for example what be this the universal shout will be a feather you may then ask they what be its use some little creature will say to blow about other will say to cover bird other will say to stuff pillow and bed to sleep upon have get all the information out of they you can in they own simple language you have act accord to nature 's law and it be now you turn to infuse additional information into they mind and give they the benefit of you superior knowledge which may be do as follow : -- you have tell I that feather be useful to cover bird it be for this that they be make by god they keep the bird warm just in the same way as you clothes keep you from be cold and as the poor bird can not make themselves clothes as man can god have give they feather that they may not be cold when the bad weather come the feather be useful to the bird also in fly the long feather in a bird 's wing keep he in the air which he could not fly through if he be cover with any thing else because feather be very light seven of the large feather out of the great eagle 's wing would not weigh more than two halfpenny the wing of a bird make he able to fly and the tail guide he through the air just as you may see the man steer boat with the rudder and if you pull the feather off he tail he would not be able to fly near so straight or fast as when they be on when the rain fall on the feather they be never soak through with it as a piece of rag would be if you throw water on it because they be cover with a sort of oil which do not let in the water if you ever look at a duck dive into the water you can see it when it come up quite dry but if you dip you head into the water it would wet it all over when little bird such as the sparrow and canary come out of the egg they have no feather on but the old one cover they with they wing to keep the cold away and the feather soon grow and then they can fly away and find food and make nest for themselves but large bird such as the goose turkey hen and duck have a sort of soft down on they when they come out of the shell and little duck will go and swim as soon as they be hatch as i suppose some of you have see some bird ' feather be much prettier than other : the goose have not such pretty feather as the swan nor the swan as the peacock but we must not think ill of the goose for this for its flesh be better to eat than either the peacock or swan i be sure many of you little child like roast goose the peacock have very pretty feather indeed and so have the pheasant and the drake and the cock but some bird that live in country many hundred mile away from this have much prettier than any bird that live in this country this feather that we have for we lesson be the feather of a goose it be not very pretty but if we examine it well we shall find it be very curious and all the man in the world could not make one like it goose feather be the most useful the small one make stuff for pillow and bed and the large one make pen to write with bird change they feather often they drop off and they get new one this be call moulting have thus give the child as much information on the subject as they will be likely to be able to digest properly you may then get it back from they by question and answer as for instance q what have we be talk about a bird ' feather q do they do the bird any good a yes keep they warm q what more good a make they able to fly q who give the bird feather to make they warm a god q be feather very heavy a no very light q what be the reason that they be very light a that they may fly easily q what part of the body do a bird fly with a its wing q be no other part useful in fly a yes q do you remember what part a its tail q of what use be its tail a to guide it q what do you mean by guide it a turn it any way it want to go q what be the reason that bird ' feather do not get all full of wet when the rain fall on they a because there be a oily juice that make the rain fall off q when little bird such as sparrow and robin come out of the egg have they get feather a no they be naked q be they very long naked a no in a few day the feather grow q be it not curious that the cold do not kill the little bird while they be naked a so it would only the old one sit over they and keep they warm q be duck and turkey and hen naked when the come out of the shell a no q what be they cover with a a sort of down q do you know of any bird that have very pretty feather a yes the peacock q be it prettier than the goose a yes q be it so useful a no q what do the goose feather make a the feather in the quill make pelt q what do the small one make a they make stuff for pillow and bed q where do the prettiest bird live a in very warm place far away from this q do the same feather always remain on a bird a no they drop off and new one come q what be this call a moult such lesson as this will never be forget by the little one they will learn to adore the great god at the sight of any thing he have make it be hope they learn to love to read nature 's book when they grow older as every correct notion obtain by a child through a natural object which it be frequently accustom to meet with can never be entirely efface and what be more it prepare the way at some future time for a larger amount of knowledge as to god 's reveal will a spider a living specimen of which may be easily procure may be make a very instructive gallery lesson it may prevent the fear and foolish prejudice against ugly yet harmless insect which often remain through life part of a bush may be procure with a real web and spider upon it so that its beautiful and highly curious web may be also exhibit to the child its use may be also point out and a short history of the little animal 's habit may be give but not before they opinion have be take on the object which may be do in a similar manner as that which we point out in the former lesson and then the teacher may proceed thus : you have tell I that this little creature be call a spider and some of you think it very ugly and say you be afraid of it but sensible child will not be frighten at a spider because they will remember that they be very harmless little thing and have not get a sting as the wasp and bee have they be very ugly to be sure but every ugly insect be not to be call a nasty creature for some be very useful notwithstanding they not be as handsome as other and spider be very useful too although very few people know how to make use of they but they little think that the poor little insect which they brush off the wall and trample under they foot can tell they what weather they be go to have as sure and surer than a weather-glass when the weather be go to be fine it peep its head out of its hole and stretch out its leg and the farther its leg and head be out the longer will the fine weather stay when the weather be go to be very bad it go farther back and when very dreadful and stormy weather be go to come it turn its back to the door of its hole and its head inside in winter when frost and snow be go to commence they make they web very fast and by this you may know the frosty weather be come so you see child that spider may be useful to know what kind of weather we shall have spider be very cunning they live on fly but they could never catch they only they be able to weave a strong web which they do in a place where the fly often come and when a poor fly get into the web the spider run out and soon kill it and then drag it up to he den where he eat it at he ease and hide the wing and skin that the other fly may not see they but if a enemy stronger than itself come to he web the spider remain in he hole till the danger be all over some spider that live in country far away be a great deal larger and uglier than we spider but we need not be ever afraid of a spider because they can neither bite nor sting we and be very curious insect q what have i be tell you about a the spider q be you afraid of it a no you tell we it would do we no harm q be spider very ugly a they be q should we think badly of they for this a no q who make the spider a god q do he not make every animal whether handsome or ugly a yes q can spider be of use a they will tell we what weather we be go to have q when it be go to be fine what do they do a they put they leg and head out of they hole q when it be go to be bad weather what do they do a they turn they head round and go into they hole q when the weather be go to be very cold and frosty what do they do a they build they web very fast q what do they live upon a fly q how do they catch they a by make web q when a fly get into they web what do they do a they kill it and eat it q be the spider in other country larger than ours a yes in some place they be much larger and uglier q who teach the spider to make its web a god q could any man in the world make a spider 's web a no no one could do it the teacher may then add thus : -- thus you see little child that every living thing have some merit of its own and can do many thing which we can not do although god have give we the means to become so much wiser than they and be sure you be not frighten at they nor put they to unnecessary pain some other day i will tell you what be the shape of the spider 's web and shew you what a number of regular figure the spider 's web be compose of almost every object however simple it may be will form a instructive gallery lesson thus for example you may take a piece of bog-turf and after submit it to the inspection of the infant you may inquire what be this if it be in a country where turf be use a general exclamation will inform you of its name if not you may find a better and more familiar object for you lesson when you have get the name you may then ask its use and will soon find that the child be well acquaint with they you may then proceed to give you own information on the subject in something like the follow word take care that you use no word that the child do not themselves understand or that you have not explain to they little child look at what i hold you have tell I it be a piece of bog-turf and it be use to make fire in ireland turf be more use to make fire than coal because it be very plentiful there and many of the poor people in ireland build they house of it and when they keep they well mend and cover they be very warm and comfortable and they burn good turf fire in they turf house but some of they be lazy and do not keep they turf house mend so the rain come in and they be very miserable and so will all idle lazy people be i hope no little child here will be lazy now i will tell you where they get all this turf they dig it out of the bog there be bog in england they call they moss or fen and in scotland there be bog but the bog in ireland be much more plentiful some of they be so very large that you can not see across they and a great many bird live amongst they such as wild duck and goose and crane and heron and snipe all of which i will tell you about some other time those great bog be very wild lonesome dreary place no person can live on they because they be so wet and soft and they be full of great deep hole with water in they which be call bog hole and if any person fall in they would be drown sometimes in the middle of this great bog you will see a pretty green island where the land be firm and strong and the grass be nice and sweet so that the poor people make a dry path across the wet bog to these island that they may drive they cow and goat and horse to feed there and some of these island be very pretty place and look so green in the center of the black bog those bog which be now such wet black nasty place be once forest of great tree as large as any you child ever see and pretty bright river run through those forest and nice bird sing in the branch and great stag eat the grass underneath we will read about the stag at some other time this be many hundred year ago and there be very few people live then in ireland and by degree when the tree get very old they begin to fall down into the river and stop they up so that the water could not flow on and the river overflow all the nice forest and the tree all fall so that when some hundred year pass they be all down and the branch rot and the grass and clay become wet like sponge and the whole of the nice shady forest of great tree become what we call bog and the remains of those pretty branch and leave where the bird use to sing so sweetly have become turf like this piece which we have for a lesson and when man be cut this turf out they often find the great trunk of those tree that many hundred year ago be so green and beautiful quite black and ugly but still so hard that they can scarcely be cut and these old tree be call bog-oak and the cabinet-maker buy they and make they into beautiful chair and table and press and many other thing and they be quite black and when polish you little child might see you face in they thus you see my little child that there be nothing which god have make which be not very wonderful and curious even this piece of bog-turf which you would not have hear about if you do not come to the infant school to learn about so many useful and curious thing this will perhaps be enough of information for one lesson and have thus infuse it in a agreeable form into they mind you may proceed in the manner before mention to get it back from they in order to impress it more firmly on they understanding and if this be always do in the proper manner they will become as familiar with the subject and learn it as quickly as they would the tissue of nonsense contain in the common nursery tale of jack and jill or the old woman and she silver penny whose only usefulness consist in they ability to amuse but from which no instruction can be possibly draw beside which they form in the child 's mind the germ of that passion for light reading which afterwards in many instance prevent a application to any thing solid or instructive be in themselves the foundation stone on which a huge and useless mass of fiction be pile in after year the philosophical mind will at once perceive the advantage of we system of amusement mingle with instruction and perceive that upon its simple basis a noble structure may be afterwards raise and mind well store with useful lore and capable of discerning evil in whatever shape it present itself and extract honey from every object will be farm which when they become numerous will cause a glorious change in the moral world the first germ of which will be trace to the properly manage gallery lesson of a infant school have ask the child if they be tire the teacher if he receive a answer in the negative may thus proceed : -- q what have we be hear about a turf q what be the use of turf a to make fire q what other use be sometimes make of it a to build house q where do they build turf house a in ireland q be they not very cold q no if they be keep mend they be not q what do you call people when they like to sleep in the cold rather than mend they house a lazy q be it bad to be lazy a yes very bad q what do we call it besides be lazy q be idle q be idle people very happy a no they be always miserable q right and i hope no little child will be ever idle they should always try to be useful and do all they can to help they friend now tell I where be the turf get from a from bog q what be they call in england a moss and fen q be the bog in england larger than in ireland a no the irish bog be the largest q what animal live in the bog a some sort of bird q do man and woman live in they a no q why not a they be too wet and soft q what very dangerous place be in some part of they a bog-holes q what be they a deep hole full of water q what do i tell you be in some part of these bog a nice green island q be they of any use a yes the people put cow and horse to feed on they q how do they get across the bog a they make a kind of rough road over to they q what do they cut the turf with a a sort of spade with two side q what be this call a a slane q when the turf be cut what do they do next a put it in heap to dry q what be those great bog many hundred year ago a beautiful forest of fine large tree q what flow through those forest a nice bright river q what sing in the tree a pretty bird q what eat the grass a fine large stag and deer q how do those beautiful place become ugly black wet bog a the tree when they get old fall into the river and stop they up q what do this cause a the water flow over the bank q what harm do this do a it make all the nice grass wet and marshy q what more a it rot the root of the tree q what happen then a they all fall down q in some hundred year what do all those forest become a great bog q be any of the trunk or body of those old tree ever find a yes many hundred be yet far under the bog q be they of any use a yes they be useful to make chair table and press q what color be they a as black as a piece of coal q when they be polish do they look nice a yes so bright you can see you face in they q what be this wood call a bog-oak q will you all try to remember this lesson a we will teacher that be right for little child should always remember the pretty thing that they teacher take such trouble to tell they in place where coal be most burn a piece of it may be make the medium of a very useful and instructive lesson be so familiar a object they attention will be arrest by its be make the subject of a lesson and they curiosity arouse to know every thing about it when the teacher ask what be this the simultaneous shout of a piece of coal will convince he that he have arrest they attention and a few question will exhaust they stock of information on the subject -- they will tell he its use be to make fire to boil up they dinner & c & c he may then proceed as follow : -- you see little child this piece of coal look at it attentively it be black and shine and you all know will burn very quickly the place from whence all coal be bring be call _ coal mine _ the man who dig it out of the ground and the ship that carry it over the sea be call collier and the place where the coal be get be call a colliery the coal mine be deep hole make very far under the ground in order to get at the coal some of they go under the sea the collier live a great part of they life in those dark hole in order to get we coal to make we fire to dress we food and very often be kill either by the fall in of the roof from above or from a sort of air call fire-damp which if touch with any fire will blow up like gunpowder and will kill any person that be near it the poor collier be also often smother by the bad air that be in those damp dark hole so you see little child what danger they go through in order to get we coal which we could very badly do without how very good god be to we he make this coal under the earth that we might have nice fire to dress we food and warm ourselves by in cold weather we should be very thankful to he for all he great blessing and should never do anything to make he angry with we he be very sorry when he see a little child naughty because he have do every thing to make we happy and we never can be so if we be naughty and bad bad boy and girl be never happy and god do not love they when they be so and it be very sad to make god angry with we coal be very useful for other thing besides make fire to dress we food and to warm we many thing that be very useful could not be make without it the gas that light the street be make from coal and when the gas be take from it what be leave be call coke which make a very bright warm fire the teacher that properly enter into the spirit of these lesson may find in the simplest object a never-ending source of pleasure and instruction for he infant pupil no person who be not qualify to give proper and really useful gallery lesson be by any means fit for a teacher of infant to learn the mere routine of a infant school be not very difficult but this will be of no avail if the teacher have not qualification of a much higher order which will enable he continually to pour instruction clothe in simple language into the mind of he pupil simplicity be the life and soul of gallery teaching without this the breath be waste and time be spend in vain to teach infant we must reduce we language to they tender capacity and become in idea and word one of themselves have give the child you information on a piece of coal you now proceed to get it back as follow q little child what have we be speak about a about coal q what color be it a black q be it anything besides a yes shine q what be the place call from whence coal be get a coal-mine q what be the man that dig it out of the ground and the ship that carry it over the sea call a collier q what be the place call where the coal pit be make a a colliery q what be coal pit a deep hole dig to get at the coal q be the collier in danger down in these deep pit a they be q from what a from fire-damp q what be it a a sort of air that blow up like gun-powder q from what more be they in danger a the roof fall in q from what more a from bad air which often smother they q what be make from coal to light the street a gas q what be coal call after the gas have be take from it a coke q do coke make a good fire a yes very bright and strong q who make the coal a god q what should we be to he for it a very thankful q how can we shew we be thankful a by be very good q be god glad to see a child naughty a no he be very sorry q do he love naughty child a no he do not q be naughty child happy a no very unhappy thus every lesson may be make not only a vehicle for convey instruction but also of instil into the infant mind a reverence a sense of gratitude and love towards that great be who call we all into existence this should be never lose sight of in give the child those primary sentiment reverence and gratitude towards its god you lay a basis on which doctrinal religion may be afterwards build with more advantage the child thus early train in such feeling convey in a manner so admirably adapt to its tender mind can scarcely fail unless it possess a heart of great natural depravity of become a good man and it be thus that infant school may become a great and lasting blessing to the country but where this be overlook -- where the vital principle of the infant system be reject and the mere mechanical part alone retain as to any great and lasting benefit it will be a complete and unhappy failure that the grand object of the infant system may be accomplish namely of raise up a generation superior to the last both in religious moral and intellectual acquirement a immense caution and great experience in the selection of teacher be require till proper teacher be universally provide the infant system will never be really successful : success do not merely consist in universal adoption and extension if it do it would be now really so but another thing be want before it can be call successful that be it must be understand none can understand it but thinker and deep thinker and thinker in the right direction merely to glance around and gather scrap of knowledge from the various ology in existence which the march of intellect have bring into be and which be unknown to we forefather and then to force they on the young memory at random may be to teach what be not before teach but it be not to display any _ new method of teach any more efficient way of communicate knowledge _ those who would truly understand the infant system must think for themselves and observe the workings of the young mind mark the intellectual principle which first develope themselves strive to understand the simple law of mental action and all this that they may know how to teach in accordance with they when this be fairly do perhaps the whole that be record in this book may be think more valuable than it be at present and be find a not unworthy subject to devote a whole life to become acquaint with and elucidate both practically and theoretically other then will perhaps not be quite so audacious in unjust plagiarism when columbus have make the egg stand on a end all other could then do it when he have discover america every one say they might have do it also all great and important truth be simple and when present to the mind although unknown before seem as if they have be well know there be such a accurate consistency between the mind and they this lead I to suppose that there be simple and useful truth in my volume as every one seem to take they for they own i can only say that they have cost _ I _ many and many a hour of close observation and deep and independent thinking i have devote my whole life for the good of other and have injure myself and family that i might do so to rescue little child from vice and misery and to have they place under physical intellectual moral and religious discipline have be the delight of my heart and the object of my life after this labor to have my invention pirate my plan make use of in part and in the rest speak against to have other to reap the field that i have sow and at the same time traduce and injure I to be thus thrust out as it be from my rightful employment and leave in comparative obscurity as old age begin to draw on require a spirit stronger than that of man and a heart more than human not to feel it and feel it deeply i care little for myself but regret most to see spurious system of infant education palm upon the public by ignorant person and thus deprive they of a great benefit which they might possess fact record in scripture may be give orally as gallery lesson take care to exhibit some picture represent the subject propose for the lesson -- take for example the finding of mose -- which represent the daughter of pharaoh come down to bathe with she maiden and also the infant mose in the ark cradle or boat which be make for the purpose the subject be then to be propound to the child as follow and the teacher be to take care to repeat it clearly and distinctly in short sentence and to be careful that all the pupil repeat it as distinctly after he by thus mean the essence of the story be infuse into the mind of the child with the addition of they be teach to repeat all the word distinctly and properly which will assist they pronunciation very much when they begin to read the lesson describe in another part of this work and the daughter of pharaoh come down to wash herself at the river and she maiden walk along by the river 's side and when she see the ark among the flag she send she maid to fetch it and when she have open it she see the child and behold the babe weep and she have compassion on he and say this be one of the hebrew ' child then say he sister to pharaoh 's daughter shall i go and call to thee a nurse

volume and have they properly illustrate by color plate by this method the child become acquaint with the very letter of scripture write story often leave very wrong impression and the history of david and goliah have be give in a infant school so that it would make a excellent counterpart to jack the giant killer surely such thing ought never to be abundance of historical portion full of moral and religious instruction and such as be calculate from they simplicity and beauty to deeply impress the mind of child can be select from both testament but the miracle and parable of we savior constitute the richest store moral training one of the grand aim of the infant system be intend to improve the system of moral training the great deficiency in we system of education with respect to moral training be truly lamentable from the highest down to the lowest school in the land there be room for immense improvement in this matter it be hardly possible to visit a school and witness proper effort make on this important subject and never will education produce the glorious effect anticipate from it until this subject be legislate for and well understand by the public and i pray to god that he will enable I to use argument in this chapter to prove effective in the mind of my reader so as to induce they to co-operate with I to produce another state of thing in these day there be much say about education it have at last arrest the attention of parliament and through they the government and as it should be through the government the sovereign thus be truly encouraging and will act as a stimulus to practical man to develop a system workable in all its part and thus carry out the view and benevolent intention of the legislature infant education however must be the basis this be begin at the right end if error be commit here the superstructure be of little avail the foundation of moral training must be lay in infancy it can not be begin too soon and be almost always commence too late mere infant can understand the do as they would be do by no child like to be deprive of its play-thing he little toy or any thing which he consider he property he will always punish the aggressor if he can and if he can not he will cry or put himself in a passion or seek aid from he parent or any other source where he think he may get justice do to he little child have beautiful idea on this subject and would have if properly train correct notion as to the rights of property to teach they to respect the property of other and even to respect themselves be far preferable to cram they memory with good rule in theory this be the old plan we have proof that it have not work well the new plan must operate upon the will it must influence the heart of the child this be the scripture plan which continually refer to the heart and not so much to the head every opportunity must be allow the child to develop its character to do this it must be associate with its fellow if the child be a solitary be he faculty can not be draw out it be in society only they can be beneficially act upon and it be in the company of its fellow that it will shew its true character and disposition hence the necessity of moral training there should be temptation place within reach of the child such as fruit flower and shrub the child teach to respect these will set due bound to he desire garden will cease to be rob hedge will not be break down turnip and potato will not be steal to the extent which be but too prevalent in the present day and i be perfectly convince that every pound the country spend in promote a rightly direct education will be save in the punishment of crime which in a political point of view be quite sufficient to induce the country to call for a properly direct system of national education which must ultimately be base on the oracle of eternal truth if these end could be obtain by theory we have plenty of that in these day all the writer on education tell we that such and such thing should be do but most of they that i have read forget to tell we how to do it they complain of the school already in existence they complain of the teacher they complain of the apathy upon the subject all of which be very easy and i regret to say there be but too much cause for all these complaint but this will not remedy the evil we must have new plan for moral training teacher must have greater encouragement hold out to they they must take they proper rank in society which i contend be next to the clergy and until these thing take place we may go on complain as talented man will sooner devote themselves to any profession rather than to the art of teaching we will now endeavor to show how these thing be to be remedy so far as moral training be applicable to infant from twelve month old to six or seven year in another part of this work we have shew what may and ought to be do in the play-ground in this chapter we will endeavor to shew what may be do to this end in the school-room in the page on gallery teaching we have give specimen of lesson on natural object and scriptural subject moral training may receive considerable aid from gallery teaching also the child must not only be continually tell what they ought to do but as often what they ought not to do they must be tell that they be not to fight and the reason must be give they must be tell that they be not to throw stone and also tell the consequence they must be tell not to strike each other with stick they must be tell not to play in the dirt they must be train in cleanly and delicate habit they must not only be tell all these thing but they must be watch in they private hour they must be encourage to assist and love each other and it must _ be prove _ to they that this be the way to advance they own individual happiness it be self-love that be the cause of half we misery child can not be tell this too soon it must be explain _ and prove _ to they that evil sooner or latter bring its own punishment and that goodness as assuredly bring its own reward opportunity will be continually develop themselves for give moral training to the child the judicious teacher will seize these as they occur and always make the best of they for the good of the child a school be a family upon a large scale nay ` tis a commonwealth and no day will pass without fact shew themselves to enable the teacher to give sound moral instruction it be true we want a better race of teacher but we must have a better sort of school first for it be only from these that a better race of teacher can be supply the well trained infant of this generation will make the efficient teacher of the next we will suppose the child to be seat in the gallery the door of the school close and every thing snug and quiet _ the teacher must be alone _ and there must be nothing to distract the child 's attention he must then bring out he store of fact which he have note down as they occur he make he selection accord to circumstance accord to the state of he own mind not forget the state of mind that the child may be in and especially the state of the weather the follow little ditty may then be repeat the subject be on cruelty to animal i 'll never hurt my little dog but stroke and pat he head i love to see he wag he tail i like to see he feed poor little thing how very good and very useful too and do you know that he will mind what he be bid to do then i will never hurt my dog nor ever give he pain but i will always treat he kind and he will love again if the child do not appear so bright as the teacher should desire the before-mentioned ditty after it have be repeat may be sing but the tune must be such as would be likely to operate upon the moral feeling great caution and circumspection be necessary in select proper time for child and this must be guide by the subject treat of if the subject be exhilarating a lively tune must be select if the subject be serious a corresponding tune must also be choose but if the subject be intend to operate upon the feeling what be usually call _ a love tune _ will be the most desirable the tune have be sing and the feeling operate upon as desire the teacher may entertain the little pupil with some one of the numerous story write about the dog but before he do this he must exhaust so much of the subject as appear in the before-mentioned ditty by question and answer similar to the other lesson mention before something like the following : -- little child you have just sing that you would never hurt a little dog can you tell I why not some of the child will be sure to say please sir because he have get the sense of feeling teacher right a little dog have get the same sense of feeling as you little child have and when it be hurt how do it shew that it have get the sense of feeling child please sir it will cry out teacher yes it can only tell we it be hurt by do so a poor dog can not speak and so we should never hurt it have a little fly the sense of feeling child yes sir teacher right again and so have every creature that god give life to and we should never give any of they unnecessary pain in the song that we have just sing you say you would stroke and pat the little dog 's head what would you do this for child please sir the little dog like it and he be not afraid of we when we do it but love we teacher so he do and will always love those that be kind to he no one but a very bad boy would be unkind to a dog you tell I little child that a poor little dog cry out when it be hurt now when he be pleased what do he do please sir he wag he tail and he eye look very bright teacher so he do which be the same as if he say how happy i be to be with such good child who do not beat I as some wicked boy and girl would but love I and pat my head and feed I for you little child you have say you like to see you little dog fed and remember any of you that have a little dog or who may have one when you get older and larger that it be very cruel not to see it feed every day the poor dog can not ask for its dinner as a little child can and that be the very reason why we should always remember to give it to he will you all remember this child yes sir we will teacher you sing in you song that the dog be very useful tell I how child please sir he will mind the house and bark when any one come to steal anything teacher yes you see how sensible the little dog be he know what a wicked thing it be to be a thief and so he bark when he see one how else be a little dog useful child please sir they often lead poor blind people about teacher so they do and good faithful guide they be when they see any danger they will lead they master out of it and they will bring he safely through the crowded street and when they go home the poor blind man divide he bit of bread with he good dog and dog be useful in other way they catch hare and rabbit for they master and do many other thing you say also that the dog mind what he be bid to do do you not child yes sir and they will often go back a long way for any thing they be bid or stay all day mind they master 's coat while he be at work teacher right and little child when they will not do as they be desire be not so good as a little dog and should take example by one do you remember what you say the dog would do if you treat he kindly child please sir that he would love we again teacher right when we love any thing a dog or a horse or a little lamb it will love we again for you know little child that love make love and if you all love one another and be kind to one another and never beat or strike each other with any thing then you will all be very happy no little child in the world will be more happy or have prettier smile face than you will have for when we look kind and pleasant we always look pretty but when we look cross and angry then we look ugly and frightful remember then never be cruel to a dog or any thing else but think of this lesson and the pretty song we sing now little child shall i tell you a story a real true story about a very cruel boy if the child say yes the follow may be relate a poor little dog be once go along the street of a town and a carriage which be come up the street very fast run over it and the poor thing be very nearly kill but it have still strength to crawl over to a house where a boy be stand at the door and it begin to whine and look up in the boy 's face as if to say you see how much i be hurt so please take I in and try and cure I but the boy be a very cruel boy and have no pity on the poor dog but take a large pot of boiling water and throw it over the poor wounded little dog so that it die soon after in very dreadful pain but the chief governor of the place that be the person whom the king have put there to punish wicked people hear of what a cruel thing this bad boy have do so he bring he up to the market place and he make a man take off this cruel boy 's clothes and lash he on the bare back before all the people of the town in order that he might know a little of the pain that the poor dog have feel from this story little child you may learn that you must not begin to be cruel if you do the habit will grow up with you as it do with this bigger boy and will never leave you even when you be man such lesson as these give at proper time and when the infant mind be in a fit state to receive they will do more to prevent what you wish to avoid than any thing which could be possibly do at a more advanced age this be indeed moral training and when such be give generally in infant school we may look forward to a generation very superior to the present in the genuine part of christianity and in every moral and social virtue the beneficial result of moral training have be practically show in every infant school where the subject have be properly understand and carry out and numerous anecdote illustrative of its beneficial effect might be here introduce which would convince those who have any doubt on the subject of the good effect of exercise kindness and consideration for other in opposition to reckless mischief hardheartedness and cruelty vice which render the lower order dangerous and formidable but as a complete collection of such anecdote would form in themselves a volume we will for the present lay before we reader a few take at random to illustrate the subject they be from the appendix of the first report of the edinburgh infant school society the model school of which be organize by the author of this book two of the child brother about five and four year of age come one morning late into school be to go to they seat without censure if they could give a account of what they have be do which should be declare satisfactory by the whole school who should decide they state separately that they have be contemplate the proceedings of a large caterpillar and notice the different position of its body as it cross they path that it be now horizontal and now perpendicular and presently curved and finally incline when it escape into a tree the master then ask they abruptly why do you not kill it the child stare _ could _ you have kill it ask the teacher yes but that would have be cruel and naughty and a sin against god the little moralist be acquit by acclamation have infant as they be manifest a character which be it universal in the juvenile population would in another generation reduce we moral code to a mass of waste paper in one grand department of its bulk this anecdote illustrate the good effect of inculcate into the infant mind a abhorrence of cruelty to animal which be too often a seed sown in the young heart which go on increase daily with the growth of the child until a fearful career of crime be end by murder and its necessary expiation on the scaffold how many man who have suffer death for murder could date they first step towards it from the time when in infancy they tortured a fly or spin a cock-chaffer the teacher mention to the child one day that he have be occupy about a boy and a girl who have no father or mother and whose grandfather and grandmother who take care of they be bed-rid and in great poverty the boy be seven year of age too old for the infant school but some gentleman he say be exert themselves to get the boy into one of the hospital here he purposely stop to try the sympathy of he audience for the girl he be not disappointed several little voice call out at once ' _ oh master _ what for no the lassie too ' he assure they the girl be to come to the infant school and to be board there which intelligence be receive with loud plaudit here we see the seed of philanthropy sown in the young mind begin even in infancy to burst and blossom forth give promise in after year of a glorious and abundant harvest the germ of love and mercy be in every breast and can not fail to be develop if early call into action and by the blessing of almighty god who be the great first cause of all good result the day be fast approach yea be now at hand when the fierce passion the love of self the long catalogue of debase crime which have so long disgraced human nature will give way before a golden age of true christianity when man will not be array against he fellow-men but all will go hand in hand together in the bond of love seek to do good and to accomplish the purpose for which they be create by a all-wise and all-benevolent god the follow anecdote illustrate the subject still further : -- one day when the child be in the play-ground four boy occupy the boy ' circular swing while a stranger gentleman be look on with the teacher conscious of be look at the little fellow be wheeling round with more than usual swiftness and dexterity when a little creature of two or three year make a sudden dart forward into they very orbit and in a instant must have be knock down with great force with a presence of mind and consideration and with a mechanical skill -- which to admire most we know not one of the boy about five year old use the instant of time in which the singular movement be practicable throw he whole body into a horizontal position and go clear over the infant 's head but this be not all in the same well employ instant it occur to he that that movement be not enough to save the little intruder as he himself be to be follow as quick as think by the next swinger for this he provide by drop he own foot to the ground and stop the whole machine the instant he have clear the child 's head the spectator of this admirable specimen of intellect and good feeling which be all necessarily the thought and act of a moment have he hand instinctively in he pocket for a shilling but be stop by the teacher who disown all inferior motive for act of kindness and justice the little hero however have he reward for the incident be relate by the teacher in a full school in the presence of the stranger and be receive with several round of hearty applause we will quote another anecdote illustrative of the good effect of exercise the kindly feeling jj accuse h of have eat up jj 's dinner it be prove by several witness that h not only appropriate the dinner but use force : the charge be prove to the satisfaction of the _ jury _ -lrb- the whole school -rrb- the same tribunal be request by the teacher to decide what should be the consequence to the convict one orator rise and suggest that as h have not yet eat he own dinner he ought to give it to jj this motion for the child always welcome any reasonable substitute for corporal punishment be carry by acclamation when one o'clock come and the dinner be hand over _ coram publico _ to jj h be observe by he to be in tear and linger near he _ own _ dinner they be by this time nearly do but the teacher be watch the result the tear be too much for jj who go to h throw he arm round he neck tell he not to cry but to sit down and take half this invitation be of course accept by h who manifest a great inferiority of character to the other and furnish a example of the blindness of the unjust to the justice of retribution which they always feel to mere revenge and cruelty he could not bear to see jj even share _ he _ dinner and tell he with bitterness that he would tell he mother weel weel say the generous child i 'll gin y have a ' back again of course the teacher interfere to prevent this gross injustice and in the afternoon make they school-fellow perfectly aware of the part each have act it be not easy to render a character like h liberal but a long course of such practice for precept be impotent in such case might modify what in after life would have turn out a selfish unjust and unsocial character this selfish principle it be the great object of moral training to combat against we may trace almost all the misery in the world to it and until it cease to exist to the extent which it now do little can be do to accomplish any good or great purpose but lesson like the above and receive into the infant mind when in a receptive state will if proper advantage be take of they occurrence prove in the hand of the almighty a powerful engine for the removal of selfishness and we know of no method so effectual to accomplish this object as the draw infant into society which be do only in infant school the following anecdote bearing on the same subject come under the observation of the author of this work very early in he labor for the extension of he system he give it here in the same word as he communicate it to a friend at the time of its occurrence a few day since i go to the boston street school the child be in the gallery and the moment i enter they rise to receive I when the school be over the child come around I as they usually do say when will you come again and so on i tell they i could not tell but that i would come as soon as i could this answer would not satisfy they and i talk to they until near six o'clock in the evening one little girl about four year old keep look stedfastly at I the whole time not let a single word or gesture escape she notice at last i finish my observation and desire the child to go the infant in question immediately take hold of my hand and say we shall never see you any more you must come home with I i reply what do you want I to go home for the child answer i have nothing to give you but if you will come home mother will give you some tea i pat the child on the head tell it i could not go the child go home as i think and i remain some time talk to one of the lady of the committee on walk down the street i see the same child cry bitterly and surround by many other child on inquire the cause i receive for answer _ you would not come home to tea _ if only one half the invitation that be give amongst _ man _ be give with as much sincerity and disinterestedness as be manifest by this _ infant _ i be much mistaken if we should not see a very different state of _ society _ moral education write mr simpson in he philosophy of education embrace both the animal and moral impulse it regulate the former and strengthen the latter whenever gluttony indelicacy violence cruelty greediness cowardice pride insolence vanity or any mode of selfishness shew themselves in the individual under training one and all must be repress with the most watchful solicitude and the most skilful treatment repression may at first fail to be accomplish unless by severity but the instructor sufficiently enlighten in the faculty will in the first practicable moment drop the coercive system and awaken and appeal powerfully to the higher faculty of conscience and benevolence and to the power of reflection : this do with kindness in other word with a marked manifestation of benevolence itself will operate with a power the extent of which in education be yet to a very limited extent estimate in the very exercise of the superior faculty the inferior be indirectly acquire a habit of restraint and regulation for it be morally impossible to cultivate the superior faculty without a simultaneous though indirect regulation of the inferior it be indeed a melancholy truth that moral training be yet to a very limited extent estimate and this be mainly owe to its not be understand by the generality of those select for the office of teacher of infant nor can it be expect that person of sufficient intellect and talent to comprehend and carry out this great object can be procure until a sufficient remuneration be hold out to they to make it worth they while to devote they whole energy to the subject it be a fatal error to suppose that mere girl take perhaps from some laborious occupation and whose sum total of education consist of reading and writing can carry out view which it require a philosophical mind well store with liberal idea and general knowledge to effect they may be able to instruct the child in the mere mechanical part of the system and as long as they confine themselves to this they will go on capitally but no further than this can they go and though the child may appear to a casual visitor to be very nicely instruct and very wonderful little creature on a closer examination they will be find mere automaton and then without a think on the subject the system will be blame without once consider that the most perfect figure of mechanism will not work properly in any hand except those that thoroughly understand it enough may have now be say on this subject and my earnest prayer be that by god 's help these remark may produce beneficial result and if my endeavor to make the subject of moral instruction more easily understand and to demonstrate its importance as clearly as possible be successful the result will soon shew I that the hard labor of three-and-thirty year have not be entirely in vain and this will be to I a greater reward than all the praise distinction and honor that it be in man 's power to confer whenever a infant be detect in any of those animal impulse to regulate which be the great end of moral training a gallery lesson should be immediately give have a tendency to excite a abhorrence of the fault on the mind of all the child a opportunity of this description should never be let pass these be the very best time to implant virtuous and moral sentiment in the mind of the young pupil these be the golden opportunity of bring into action the higher faculty of conscience and benevolence and the power of reflection if a instance of the too prevalent cruelty of the young to animal be detect which often occur from mere thoughtlessness it may be prevent from again occur by a few lesson like the one which we have give as a specimen the same means may be take for crush the rudiment of gluttony violence pride deceit or any other vice the gallery be the proper place for these lesson and after the matter have be thoroughly _ sift _ in the play-ground or wherever else it have occur the child should then be march to the gallery to receive a proper instruction on the subject cruelty on the part of boy be too prevalent it be energy enterprise and high animal spirit not legislate for on the part of parent and teacher which descend to cruelty first to animal then to all which have life that can not defend itself child soon learn to distinguish those child and animal who can and will resent cruelty from those who will not and therefore speculate on the result accordingly and become self-taught up to this point a child should never be without a kind and wise guide at this period that which in itself descend to evil for the want of a moral guide may be turn to good the faculty mention can not be extinguish but can be regulate this be the office of the teacher too frequently we try to crush the power that early want training and regulate the same power which run to vice may be train to virtue but the activity can not and ought not to be keep too much in abeyance child be not naturally cruel although they differ much in the propensity to annoy and reduce animal and each other under they individual control the passive submit at once but the energetic will not it be then that the active assailant learn a important lesson which can only be learn in society and which to he be of great importance the difficulty on the part of the teacher be to know when to interfere and when to let alone i have often err by interference of this i be quite satisfied the anxiety to prevent evil have cause I to interfere too soon by not give time to the pupil fully to develop he act i hope other will profit from this it require much practice and long study of different temperament in child to know when to let alone and when to interfere but certain it be that the moral faculty can and must be develop in any system worthy of the name of education other vice beside cruelty be to be find in child moral training apply to these and none be leave to run they own course why should they what be school for but to form the virtuous character -- the be who can command self control -- the orderly character the good citizen and the be who fear and love god end less than these can not be worthy of the effort of the philanthropist and the truly religious man there be another idea which have long be in my mind and which i hope some day to see carry into practice viz a religious service adapt for child in we various place of worship no accurate observer of the young in church during divine service can have fail to witness the inattention of the number of child who be assemble on such occasion the service be too long and inappropriate for they as be also the sermon it be address to adult and sometimes the term use by the preacher be greek to half the adult in agricultural district man can not be too simple with the young and illiterate there be much room for improvement in these thing and with regard to the young i can answer for they that if they be address in proper language which they can understand and be supply with proper religious food for the understanding suitable to its state of receptivity and if i may say digestive power they as a body will shew we a example which will surprise many with regard to the church there might be take from the prayer book a simple service adapt to the purpose i be certain i could do it with ease as i know what be adapt for child or at least i ought to do the next point all the preacher should be man of peculiar temperament and great simplicity of manner i do not care how learn they be the more learn the better but it need not be in language but in spiritual thing there be thousand of passage in the holy word which be adapt and i think intend for the purpose and there be many man now live who be able to do the thing and more will be raise up one thing however must not be forget they must be _ man advance _ in life not _ lad _ to teach natural thing properly to child require more knowledge than the generality of the public suppose the younger the child be the more knowledge it require on the part of the instructor but to teach spiritual thing properly to child man can not know too much provide they have the power to simplify that knowledge and reduce it to practice a evening service will not do for child it must be either in the morning or the middle of the day so fully be i impressed with the importance of this idea that i be determine shortly to take means to carry it out chapter x reward and punishment _ necessity of some punishment -- reward to monitor -- trial by jury -- illustrative case -- necessity of firmness -- anecdote -- play the truant -- its evil -- mean for prevention -- device for punishment -- sympathy encourage -- evil of expel child -- case of hartly -- difficulty of legislating for reward and punishment -- badge of distinction not necessary _ \* \* \* \* \* how do the deity deal with he creature on this momentous question this be the question which every thinker -- and every religious man must ask himself and then act accordingly \* \* \* \* \* as man come into the world with a propensity to do that which be forbid it have be find necessary at all time to enact law to govern and even to punish he when he act contrary to they and who will deny the man a just reward who have do any act whereby he fellow-man have be benefit the hope of reward sweeten labor if then reward and punishment be necessary to make _ man _ active and to keep they in order how can it be expect that child can be govern without some kind of punishment i be aware that i be take the unpopular side of the question by become a advocate for punishment but notwithstanding this i must say that i think no school in england have ever be govern without it and that the many theory usher into the world on this subject have not be exactly act upon and since this be write i be in a position to state the same with regard to both scotland and ireland indeed it appear to I that while man continue to be imperfect being it be not possible that either they or they offspring can be govern without some degree of punishment i admit that it should be administer with great prudence and never employ but as a last resource and i be sorry to say that it have descend to brutality in some school which perhaps be one reason why so many person set they face against it altogether i might write as other have do by state that i have bring up a family of my own without ever have strike even once any of my child but then this be no argument for the general conducting of a school in school child be spoil before they come to you in a family the judicious parent begin at the begin the case therefore entirely differ the first thing that appear to I necessary be to find out if possible the real disposition and temper of a child in order to be able to manage it with good effect i will allow that it be possible to govern some child without corporal punishment for i have have some under my charge whom i never have occasion to punish to whom a word be quite sufficient and who if i only look displeased would burst into tear but i have have other quite the reverse you might talk to they till you be tired and it would produce no more effect half a hour afterwards than if they have not be speak to at all indeed child 's disposition be as various as they face no two be alike consequently what will do for one child will not do for another and hence the impropriety of have a invariable mode of punishment what should we think of a medical man who be to prescribe for every constitution in the same manner the first thing a skilful physician do be to ascertain the constitution of the patient and then he prescribe accordingly and nothing be more necessary for those who have charge of little child than to ascertain they real character rave do this they will be able should a child offend to apply some appropriate antidote to begin with reward : to the monitor i have generally allow one penny a week each as i find much difficulty in procure monitor for whatever honor be attach to the office child of five year old could not exactly comprehend they they could much more easily perceive the use of a penny and as a proof how much they value the penny a week above all the honor that could be bestow i always have a good supply of monitor after this remuneration be adopt before this time they use to say please sir may i sit down i do not like to be a monitor perhaps i might prevail on some to hold the office a little longer by explain to they what a honorable office it be : but after all i find that the penny a week speak more powerfully than i do and the child would say to each other i like to be a monitor now for i have a penny last Saturday and master say we be to have a penny every week do not you wish you be a monitor yes i do and master say if i be a good boy i shall be a monitor by and bye and then i shall have a penny i think they richly deserve it some kind of reward i consider necessary but what kind of reward must of course rest entirely with the promoter of the different school -lrb- a -rrb- -lrb- footnote a : in many of the infant school i hull visit i find the spelling and reading very much neglect that neither the monitor nor child look at the lesson but merely say they by rote if the monitor be punish for inattention they wish to give up the office because there be no reward attach to it but if there be a reward attach to it of any kind the child have sense enough to see that the thing be fairly balanced for if they be reward for do they duty they see no injustice in be punish for neglect it -rrb- perhaps nothing would tend more to the order and efficient conducting of a infant school than the plan of give reward to the monitor from the part they take in teaching and superintend other it seem due to they -- for the labourer be worthy of he hire if we be to make use of monitor at all i be now convince that they _ must _ be reward parent do not like they child to work for nothing and when they become useful they be take away entirely unless reward the training system use monitor only in that which be purely mechanical or to infuse into the external memory that which be to be learn by rote singly or simultaneously by the pupil such as chapter out of the scripture catechism creed poetry psalm hymn prayer and commandment and whatever be -lrb- as it be call -rrb- to be learn by heart but to develope the faculty of the pupil -- to really teach religion moral intellectual or anything which apply to the interior of the pupil they be useless a most important means of discipline appear in what we term trial by jury which be compose of all the child in the school it have be already state that the play-ground be the scene for the full development of character and consequently the spot where circumstance occur which demand this peculiar treatment it should also be particularly observe that it be next to prayer in solemnity and should only be adopt on extraordinary occasion any levity manifest either by the teacher or the pupil will be fatal to the effect but to illustrate it i will state a fact in the play-ground of a infant school there be a early dwarf cherry-tree which from its situation have fruit while other tree have only flower it become therefore a object of general attention and ordinarily call forth a variety of important observation now it happen that two child one five year of age and the other not quite three enter the school in the autumn and on the return of spring they have have only a winter 's training be charm by this object and in consequence fall into temptation accustom to watch new scholar narrowly i particularly observe they when i mark the elder one anxiously intently and wishfully gaze on the fruit and especially on one amazingly large cherry pendent from a single shoot while thus absorb the younger child be attract to the spot and imitate he example the former then ask if he do not think it a large one and the reply be of course in the affirmative have thus address the power of observation the next appeal be to the taste by the inquiry be not it a nice one the answer to which be yes then follow the observation it be quite soft when the young one be thus excite by the touch of the other touch it also this act he subsequently repeat by desire of the elder who have charge he to hold it tight strike he hand and thus detach the cherry i now withdraw to some distance and it be evident that the little one be distressed by what he have do as he do not eat it but begin to cry faintly on which the elder take the cherry out of he hand and eat it this increase the cry when on approach he run up to I say that the other take my cherry the little one continue to cry the other state that he see he take it to which i reply we will try he by and bye as soon therefore as the proper time arrive the bell be ring prior to which however i be apprise of the loss by several child and when all be seat in the gallery i proceed as follow now little child i want you to use all you faculty to look at I attentively and to think of what i be about to say for i be go to tell you a tale of two little boy once on a time they be amusing themselves with a great many other child in a play-ground where there be a great many flower and some fruit tree but before i go on let I ask you be it right to take the flower or fruit which belong to other to which the general reply be no with the exception of the culprit i then describe they age state that one boy be five year old and the other three that the former be look at one of he master 's fine cherry which be grow against the wall and that the latter approach and look at it too on which several exclaimed please sir you big cherry be go which cause a inspection of each other ' countenance to this i reply i be sorry for it but let I finish my tale now child while they be both look at the cherry the older one ask the younger if it be not large to which he reply ` yes ' he then inquire whether it be not nice when he again answer ` yes ' afterwards be tell he have touch it himself first to touch it because it be soft and the little boy unfortunately do so on which the big one pull he arm and the cherry come off in he hand while this be proceed the two delinquent sit very demurely conscious that they be pourtray though all the rest be ignorant of the fact i then say which do you think the worst of these boy when several answer the biggest be the worst on inquire why the reply be because he tell the little one to take it while other say because he pull he arm i add i have not tell you the whole tale yet but i be glad to see that you know right from wrong and presently you will be still better prepare to judge when the big boy have tell the little one to take the cherry he then rob he of it and immediately betray he by tell the master now which do you think be the worst when a great number of voice vociferate the big one i then inquire if they think we have such child in we school the general reply be ` no ' but the scrutiny among themselves be redouble to this i rejoin i be sorry to say such child be now sit among you in the gallery at this crisis the little one burst into tear on which the child say please sir that be one of they for he face be so red and he cry i answer i be sorry it be so and call the culprit down with come here my dear and sit by the side of I until we examine into it this be follow by the outcry please sir we have find the other he hang he head down and he face look so white this child be then call down in the same mild manner to sit on the other side of I i then tell they that they would find when they become man and woman that in we court of law witness of what be do be call and as the elder boy have see the young one take the cherry it be necessary and desireable to hear what he have to say on be desire to stand up i therefore say do you see he take the cherry to which he promptly reply yes the next inquiry be what do he do with it to this he be silent on which the little one not be able to contain himself call out he take it from I and eat it all eye be now turn to the big one and all feel convinced that he be the most guilty whilst the confidence of the little one increase by the prospect of have justice do he as he previously fear that be accuse by the elder one he should be condemn without ceremony finding that the elder one have no more to say it only remain to hear the defense of the young one who sensible of have do what be wrong say in broken accent he tell I to take it -- he hit my hand -- and he eat the cherry to which it be necessary to give the admonition that he never ought to do wrong though require to do so by other and that such a defense would avail he nothing be he a man both the child be now exceedingly distressed and hence this be the time to appeal to the rest as to the measure of the punishment that be due the general opinion be that the eldest should be punish but no one mention that the young one should even have a pat on the hand the next thing be to appeal to the higher faculty of the little culprit who see that he have thus far get off require to be soften down in reference to the other though he have betray he while the best way of operate on the elder be a display of love on the part of the younger he be therefore ask if he would forgive the other and shake hand with he which he immediately do to the evident delight and satisfaction of all the child while the countenance of the elder show that he feel himself unworthy of the treatment he receive i then inflict the sentence which have be pronounce -- two pat of the hand which the girl ask might be soft one and send he to he seat while i conclude the whole with some appropriate exhortation it be please to add that the elder prove one of the most useful monitor i ever have -lrb- a -rrb- -lrb- footnote a : this mode of treatment have succeed in a number of instance several first-rate writer on education have try it and have find it work well it be one of the most effective method to operate upon the mind of young child that i have be able to discover : i have try the plan with older child with great success reader can teacher who be mere boy and girl act thus in such a case -rrb- should any person be dispose to object to such a process they may be remind that the infant system deal with child as rational creature and be design to prepare they for future life i have see numerous instance of its beneficial effect these have induce I to pursue the plan and in the strongest term to recommend it to other in all case the matter should be state to the child simply calmly and slowly and they will seldom if ever come to a wrong conclusion a manual trade or a business which require dexterity can never be learn from book alone or properly understand from mere precept all must be acquire by practice and then the knowledge of it become as it be a part of we very selve the same apply to the precept of morality if they be merely commit to memory by rote they will often lie there cold and inactive and not unfrequently tend even to harden the feeling but when they be bring out into actual practice and make to bear upon the conscience of the culprit and on the moral feeling of all the child through he they be see in a new and convincing light and learn with a power that will impress they indelibly on the memory nathan say unto david thou art the man the most effectual teaching of a christian parent be not at the time of the mere infusion of moral truth into a child 's mind but in the example he give in he life and the direction he give accord to it to he child when he walk by the way and when he sit in the house such should be the teaching aim at in every infant school how wise be the dealings of the creator with we on the subject of reward what be ever yet do good who do not feel within a certain reward who feel most of the influence of the holy spirit the passer by -- or the good samaritan nay who feel the greatest reward in he own breast the samaritan himself or the man who fall amongst thief i think the samaritan throughout all creation we see reward for assiduity the early crow get the worm the cautious animal escape he enemy the good man enjoy the most happiness out of goodness happiness can not be find -- virtue bring its own reward obedience to the natural law do the same so do obedience to the spiritual law bring such reward as my pen can not describe but i doubt not many have feel they the whole system of society appear to I to depend upon this stimulant who would wish to be the head of the church and take the additional responsibilite and labor attach to they without reward who would accept the office the weighty office of be she majesty 's minister without reward i might go on in this strain of reasoning and prove that reward be found in knowledge of human nature but i be content to skew we have some ground for they they be useful if not essential in the right management of the young but like every thing else require to be manage judiciously it appear to I that the argument to the contrary would be untenable i should like to see the man who would invest he capital in railway -- electric telegraph steam ship and in business of any kind without hope of reward pooh it be the mainspring of human action the incentive to public service it rest not in this world but follow we to the next well do good and faithful servant enter into the joy of thy lord ah but this refer to man not to child what be child but man in embryo why be unjust to they and just to man i say reward be necessary in a sound system of education to little child if judiciously select and properly apply they will be find incentive to action and add greatly to the pleasure of learn in my other work for the education of older child this subject be treat of more at length as applicable to they with regard to punishment they be various and must be adapt to the disposition of the child the only corporal punishment that we inflict be a pat on the hand which be very of great service in flagrant case of misconduct for instance i have see one child bite another 's arm until it have almost make its tooth meet i should suppose few person be prepare to say such a child should not be punish for it i have see other who when they first come to school would begin to scream as if they be be punish as soon as they mother bring they to the door while the mother continue to threaten the child without ever put one threat into execution the origin of all this noise have be perhaps because the child have demand a half-penny as the condition of come to school and the mother probably have not have one to give he but have actually be oblige to borrow one in order to induce he to come in at the school door thus the child have come off conqueror and set it down as a maxim that for the future he may do just as he please with he mother i have sometimes make my appearance at this time to know what all the noise be about when the mother have enter into a lamentable tale tell I what trouble she have have with the child and that he would not come to school without have a half-penny each time but the moment the child have see I all have be as quiet as possible i have desire he to give I the half-penny which he have do directly i have return it to the mother and the child have go into school as quietly as any child could do i have have other who would throw they victuals into the dirt and then lie down in it themselves and refuse to rise up cry i will go home i want to go into the field i will have a half-penny the mother have answer well my dear you shall have a half-penny if you will stay at school no i want to go and play with billy or tommy and the mother at length have take the churl home again and thus feed he vanity and nurse he pride till he have completely master she so that she have be glad to apply to the school again and beg that i would take he in hand at another time a girl come with a pillow she have insist on have it for a doll but so far from contribute to she happiness it have a contrary effect nevertheless the parent for want of that firmness so necessary in the management of child have allow she to bring it to school and on she journey she cry all the way to the amusement of the looker on when i remonstrate with the mother she reply what could i do she would not come without it the child however give it up to I without any trouble and the over _ indulgent mother _ take it back with she numerous have be the instance of a similar kind and all far the want of firmness the master of a infant school whenever opportunity occur should feel it incumbent upon he to urge the parent to make a due use of judicious parental authority this be the very foundation of all social order rule and government and to relax it be to loosen the very keystone of society he ought also perpetually to inculcate obedience to they parent upon the child as be one of they first and most important duty some have object to we school that they be calculate to loosen the tie and the authority between parent and child but if these precept be carefully attend to the result will be precisely the reverse it be however necessary to state in the three case just notice that in each the child have be previously conquer by I and young as they be they know quite well that although such conduct as they exhibit gain the end they have in view with the parent similar conduct would not succeed with I it be little short of cruelty to let any child have its own way in such matter they will always try hard to get the tipper hand not know but that such conduct add to they own happiness when once conquer and proof be afford that it do not then the child be always thankful for the discipline at all event i have never find it otherwise many i may say numerous case have occur of worse kind than the above such as child insist on bring something from home as the bellows tong poker the mother 's bonnet father 's hat & c as the condition of come to school which the simple parent have comply with rather than adopt the require firmness which be essential in matter of this kind more infant know quite well the weak and the strong point of a parent 's character they all be excellent judge on this subject i find it necessary under such circumstance to enter into a kind of agreement with the mother that she should not interfere in any respect whatever : that on such condition and such only could the child be admit observe that i should act towards it as if it be my own but that it must and should be obedient to I to which the mother have consent and the child have be take in again and strange to say in less than a fortnight have be as good and have behave as orderly as any child in the school but i should deem myself guilty of duplicity and deceit be i to say that such child in all case could be manage without corporal punishment as it appear to I that this in moderation have be the mode of correct refractory child from the earliest age for it be expressly say in the scripture _ he that spareth he rod hateth he son but he that loveth he chasteneth he betime _ and again _ he that knoweth he lord 's will and doeth it not shall be beat with many stripe _ there be certainly something very please in the sound that several hundred infant child may be well manage keep in good order and correct of they bad habit without _ any sort _ of punishment but as i have not be able to attain to that state of perfection in the art of teaching i shall lay before the reader what mode of punishment i have adopt and the success that attend they if punishment be judiciously and justly apply when offence require they from the earliest period of life they will soon cease to be want we can not form a more important association in the young mind than one between pain and moral evil and this judicious correction will effect it should not be give in anger or it will have the appearance of revenge but if administer calmly and with feeling of sorrow and regret it will soon exercise a mighty moral influence the providence of god apply to we the correction of sickness pain and sorrow to withdraw we from evil and thus in he moral government as well as in he word he command we to use the rod but always for good and never in anger or cruelty recent event have prove to I that there be a mawkish sentimentality but too prevalent on this subject abroad which interfere greatly with moral training the proper freedom of the school-master and even with the administration of public justice the first offence deserving punishment which i shall notice be play the truant and i trust i may be permit to state that notwithstanding the child be so very young they frequently at first stay away from the school unknown to they parent nor be this to be wonder at when we consider how they have be permit to range the street and get acquaint with other child in similar circumstance when this be the case they can not be bring into order in a moment it be a work of time and require much patience and perseverance to accomplish it effectually it be well know that when we accustom ourselves to particular company and form acquaintance it be no easy matter to give they up and it be a maxim that a man be either better or worse for the company he keep just so it be with child they form very early attachment and frequently with child whose parent will not send they to school and care not where they be so long as they keep out of they way hence such child will persuade other to accompany they and of course they will be absent from school but as night approach the child will begin to think of the consequence and mention it to he companion who will instruct he how to deceive both he teacher and he parent and perhaps bring he through he trouble this will give he fresh confidence and finding himself successful there will be little difficulty in persuade he to accompany they a second time i have have child absent from school two or three half-day in a week and sometimes whole day who have bring I such rational and plausible excuse as completely to put I off my guard but who have be find out by they parent from have stay out till seven or eight o'clock at night the parent have apply at the school to know why they keep the child so late add have then in form I that they have be absent all day thus the whole plot have be develop it have be find that the child be send to school at eight o'clock in the morning and have they dinner give they to eat at school but instead of come they have get into company with they older companion who in many case i have find be train they up for every species of vice some of they have be cure of truant playing by corporal punishment when all other means i could devise have fail other by mean the most simple such as cause the child to hold a broom for a give time the most powerful punishment i have yet discover be to insist on the child sit still without move hand or foot for a give time say half a hour at most long punishment always have the tendency to harden the child he soon get contented in he situation and you defeat you own object by keep a strict eye upon they it will be remark they soon begin to form a attachment with some of they own school-fellow and ultimately become as fond of they new companion they book and they school as they be before of they old companion and the street i need scarcely observe how strong we attachment form in early year at school be and i doubt not but many who read this have find a valuable and real friend in a school-fellow for whom they would do any thing within they power there be several child in the school who have contract some very bad habit entirely by they be accustom to run about the street and one boy in particular only five year of age be so frequently absent and bring such reasonable excuse for he be so that it be some time before i detect he i think it best to see he mother and therefore send the boy to tell she that i wish she to come the boy soon return say he mother be not at home the follow morning he be absent again and i send another boy to know the reason when the mother wait on I immediately and assure I that she have send the child to school i then produce the slate which i keep for that purpose and inform she how many day and half-day she child have be absent during the last month when she again assure I that she have never keep the child at home for a single half-day nor have he ever tell she that i want to see she at the same time observe that be must have be decoy away by some of the child in the neighborhood she regret that she could not afford to send he to school before add _ that the infant school be a bless institution and one she think much want in the neighborhood _ i need scarcely add that both the father and mother lose no time in search for they child and after several hour they find he in the nearest fruit-market with several child pretty well store with apple & c which they have no doubt steal from the fruit-baskets continually place there they bring he to the school and inform I they have give he a good flogging which i find to be correct from the mark that be on the child this they say they have no doubt would cure he but he be not so soon conquer for the very next day he be absent again and after the parent have try every experiment they could think of in vain they deliver he over to I tell I i might do what i think proper i try every means i could devise with as little success except keep he at school after school hour for i have a great disinclination to convert the school into a prison as my object be if possible to cause the child to love the school and i know i could not take a more effectual method of cause they to dislike it than by keep they there against they will at last i try this experiment but to as little purpose as the other and i be about to exclude the child altogether as incorrigible but unwilling that it should be say a child five year old have master we i at last hit upon a expedient which have the desire effect the plan i adopt be to put he on a elevated situation within sight of all the child so secure that he could not hurt himself i believe it be the force of _ ridicule _ that effect the cure this i have never try before and i must say i be extremely glad to witness it i never know he absent without leave afterwards and what be more surprising he appear to be very fond of the school and become a very good child be not this then a brand pluck from the fire i have be advise to dismiss twenty such child rather than retain they by the above means but if there be more joy in heaven over one sinner that repenteth than over ninety and nine just person who need no repentance ought not such a feeling to be encourage on earth particularly when it can be do by means that be not injurious to the orderly but on the contrary productive of the best effect the child just mention afterwards go into the national school with several other who have be nearly as bad as himself but they scarcely ever fail to come and see I when they have a half holiday and the master of the school tell I that not one of they have ever be absent without leave and that he have no fault to find with they i have further to observe that the moment i perceive a bad effect produce by any method of punishment it be relinquish but i feel it my duty here to caution the reader against the too frequent practice of many to object it may cost a man many year to find out what may be desirable and workable but to become a objector require no thought accordingly the most thoughtless be generally the greatest objector i believe that there be not a child in the school who would not have be delighted _ to carry the broom _ if i have call it play the other child might have laugh as long as they please for he would have laugh as heartily as any of they and as soon as he have do i should have have a dozen applicant with please sir may i please sir may i but it be call a _ punishment _ and hence i have no application whatever they all dread it as much as they would a flogging i be aware that this plan of punishment may appear ridiculous and perhaps it would be so to use it for older child but with such young child i have find it to answer well and therefore i have no wish to dispense with it i would however have care take not to encourage the child to ridicule each other while undergo this or any other punishment except in extraordinary case such as the one i have mention on the contrary we should encourage they to sympathize with and comfort a child as soon as the punishment be over and i can truly add that i do not recollect a single instance when any child have be undergo the broom punishment but some of the other have come and attempt to beg he off with please sir may he sit down now and when ask the reason why they wish the little delinquent to be forgive they have answer may be sir he will be a good boy they request have be comply with and the culprit forgive and what have i see follow why that which have teach I a important lesson and convinced I that _ child can operate on each other 's mind and be the means of produce very often better effect than adult people can _ i have see they clasp the child round the neck take he by the hand lead he about the play-ground comfort he in every possible way wipe he eye with they pinafore and ask he if he be not sorry for what he have do the answer have be yes and they have fly to I with master he say he be sorry for it and that he will not do it again in short they have do that which i could not do -- they have so win the child over by kindness that it have cause the offender not only to be fond of they but equally as fond of he master and the school to these thing i attribute the reclaim of the child i have mention and so far from punishment be productive of the _ worst effect _ i have find it productive of the best the ill effect of expel child as incorrigible may be see in the case of hartley who be execute some year back he confess before he execution that he have be concern in several murder and upward of two hundred burglary and by the newspaper account we learn that he be dismiss from school at nine year of age there be no school master who would be trouble with he when find himself at liberty he immediately become a robber hartley 's father -lrb- the account proceeds -rrb- formerly keep the sir john falstaff inn at hull in yorkshire he be put to school in that neighborhood but he conduct at school be so marked with depravity and so continually do he play the truant that he be dismiss as unmanageable he then although only nine year of age begin with pilfering and rob garden and orchard till he friend be oblige to send he to sea he soon contrived to run away from the ship in which he have be place and have regain the land pursue he old habit and get connect with many of the principal thief in london with whom he commence business regularly as a house-breaker which be almost always he line of robbery should not every means have be resort to with this child before proceed to the dangerous mode of expulsion for it be not the whole who need a physician but those who be sick and i strongly suspect that if judicious punishment have be resort to it would have have the desire effect i can only say that there never be a child expel from the infant school under my care as incorrigible in conclusion i have to observe that the broom punishment be only for extraordinary occasion and i think we be justified in have recourse to any means that be consistent with duty and humanity in preference to turn a child out into the wide world of all the difficulty i ever have to encounter to legislate for reward and punishment give I the most trouble how often have i see one child laugh at that which would make another child cry if any department in teaching require knowledge of character more than another it be this many a fine child 's spirit be break through the ignorance of teacher and parent in this particular but for I to lay down _ invariable rule _ to manage _ every child _ would be like a person undertake to describe a voyage to the moon every person 's own good sense must decide for they accord to character and circumstance and as to reward the same discrimination must be use one child will set much value on a little book whilst another will destroy it in a day and though the book might be worth the sixpence a half-penny worth of what _ they _ call good stuff would be much more valuable i have have more business do sometimes for a plum than for a sixpenny book it be never necessary to give the child badge of _ distinction _ and to allow it as many order and degree as a austrian field-marshal cross at the button hole and bit of ribbon on the shoulder be unnecessary they throw a apple of discord between the young creature who have sense enough to see that these thing be frequently give away with a wonderous lack of discrimination and sometimes to please parent more than reward merit a carraway comfit put into the mouth of a infant will do more good than all the badge of distinction that i have mention as a reward but with respect to punishment more will be say on it in my larger work when we come to treat of national education each creation of the most high be truly wonderful and worthy of we constant study we may learn lesson of the truest wisdom from the meanest leaf or insect if we would regard it as one of he work but how much more may be learn and what a amount of useful instruction may be gain by a study of the finite mind the highest work in creation many have turn they attention to mineral plant and animal and thus add to we store of knowledge if equal attention have be pay to the young mind to mark the gradual germination of its intellectual and moral power how much more accurate would we knowledge be of the proper method of deal with it both in instruction direction and punishment thus to study it have be the aim of my life and i have make observation on thousand of child when this great and live book be more constantly read the contents of this humble volume may have a better chance of be appreciate and the utter absurdity of many thing palm upon the public for the education of infant make glaringly manifest chapter xi language _ mean for convey instruction -- method of teach the alphabet in connection with object -- spelling -- reading -- develop lesson -- read lesson in natural history -- the arithmeticon -- brass letter -- they use _ \* \* \* \* \* without thing word accumulate by misery in the memory have far better die than drag out a miserable existence in the dark without word theirs stay and support thing unaccountably disappear out of the storehouse and may be lose for ever but bind _ a thing with a word _ a strong link stronger than any steel and softer than any silk and the captive remain for ever happy in its bright prison-house -- _ wilson _ \* \* \* \* \* the sens of child have reveal every object in its true light they next desire to know its name and then express they perception in word this you have to gratify and from the time you tell they the name of a object it be the representative of the thing in the mind of the child if the object be not present but you mention the name this suggest it to the infant mind have this be more frequently think of by instructor we should have find they less eager to make the child acquaint with the name of thing of which it have no knowledge or perception sound and sign which give rise to no idea in the mind because the child have never see or know the thing represent be of no use and can only burden the memory it be therefore the object of we system to give the child a knowledge of thing and then a knowledge of the word which represent those thing these remark not only apply to the name of visible thing but more particularly to those which be abstract if i would say shew a child _ a horse _ before you tell it the name of the animal still more would i urge it on the teacher to let a child see what love kindness religion & c be before it be tell what name to designate those principle by if we ignorance as to material thing be the result of instruct the child in name instead of enable they to become acquaint with thing so on the other hand i believe we may account in the same way to some extent for _ virtue _ be so frequently a mere word a empty sound amongst man instead of a active principle we next endeavor be to teach the child to express they thought upon thing and if they be not check by injudicious treatment they will have some on every subject we first teach they to express _ they notion _ we then tell they ours and truth will prevail even in the mind of child on this plan it will operate by its own strength not by the power of coercion which render even truth disagreeable and repulsive the child will adopt it from choice in preference to error and it will be firmly establish in they mind it will no doubt be perceive that for the promotion of the course here recommend it will be advisable to connect with we _ alphabetical and reading lesson _ as much information as we possibly can by so do the tedium of the task to the child will be considerably lessen as well as much knowledge attain the means of do this in a variety of way will no doubt suggest themselves to the intelligent teacher but as a illustration of what we mean the follow conversational plan may not be useless we have twenty-six card and each card have on it one letter of the alphabet and some object in nature the first for instance have the letter a on the top and a apple paint on the bottom the child be desire to go into the gallery which be form of seat one above the other at one end of the school the master place himself before the child so that they can see he and he they and be thus situated proceeds in the follow manner : -- a q where be i a opposite to we q what be on the right

many of the child will be able to spell this or many of the subsequent word or give such answer as we have put down but _ some _ among the older or more acute of they will soon be able to do so and thus become instructor to the rest it may be proper to mention also that the information in natural history & c & c display in some of the answer be the result of the instruction in natural history which the child simultaneously receive and which be speak of in a subsequent chapter mr golt 's simple arrangement of the alphabet i much approve of and no doubt it will come into general use -rrb- b

adapt to the large room where the child may be teach all together but it be necessary to change the scene even in this for however novel and please a thing may be at first if it be not manage with prudence it will soon lose its effect it be here to be observe that the mode of teaching describe be not practice every day but only twice or thrice a week the child will take care that the teacher do not altogether forget to teach they in any way that they have be accustom to after let the above plan lie by for a day or two some of the child will come to the teacher and say please sir may we say the picture alphabet up in the gallery if the other child overhear the question it will go through the school like lightning : oh yes -- yes -- yes sir if you please do let we say the letter in the gallery thus a desire be create in the child 's mind and it be then especially that they may be teach with good effect _ another plan _ which we adopt be in practice almost every day but it be better adapt to what be call the class-room : we have the alphabet print in large letter both in roman and italic character on one sheet of paper : this paper be paste on a board or on pasteboard and place against the wall the whole class then stand around it but instead of one of the monitor point to the letter the master or mistress do it so that the child not only obtain instruction from each other but every child have a lesson from the master or mistress twice every day before they go to the reading lesson they have the sound of all the word in spelling : thus the sound of a -- ball call fall wall then the reading-lesson be full of word of the same sound in like manner they proceed with other letter as i -- the sound of which they learn from such word as five drive strive until by a series of lesson they become acquaint with all the sound and be able to read any common book i have observe in some instance the most deplorable laxity in this particular case have occur in which child have be for two year at school and yet scarcely know the whole alphabet and i have know other to be four year in a infant school without be able to read i hesitate not to say that the fault rest exclusively with the teacher who find this department of they work more troublesome than other which be attractive to visitor have sometimes neglect it and even throw it entirely aside affirm that reading be not a part of the infant system at all such a declaration be however only to be account for from the most lamentable ignorance preverseness or both have it be true we should not have have a single infant school in scotland and throughout that country the child read delightfully the great importance of full instruction in reading will be apparent from the follow consideration 1 if the parent do not find the child learn to read they will discontinue send they this they consider essential and nothing else will be deem by they a adequate substitute 2 child can not make desirable progress in other school which they may enter unless they obtain a ability to read at least simple lesson 3 neglect in this respect impede the progress of the infant system such a obstacle ought not to exist and should at once be remove 4 in manufacture district child go to work very soon and if they be not able to read before there be reason to fear they will not afterwards acquire the power but if they have this Sunday school may supply other deficiency 5 want of ability to read prevent of course a knowledge of the word of god to prevent this evil i have arrange a series denominate develop lesson the great object of which be to induce child to think and reflect on what they see they be thus form : at the top be a colored picture or series of color picture of insect quadruped and general object for instance there be one contain the poplar hawk-moth and wasp the lesson be as follow : the wasp can sting and fly as well as the moth which do not sting i hope no wasp will sting I he be small but the hawk-moth be large the moth eat leaf but the wasp love sweet thing and make a round nest if boy take the nest they may be sting : the fish like the wasp-grub on this question be propose : which sting which be small and which large which eat leaf which make a round nest & c & c to take another instance there be a figure of a italian to which be append the following : the italian have get a flask of oil and a fish in he hand and something else in he hand which the little child who read this must find out any child can tell who make use of the sense of see in italy they make a good deal of wine big grape grow there that they make it with italian can sing very well and so can little child when they be teach question be likewise propose on this as before of these lesson however there be a great variety all school should possess they : they will effectually prevent the evil allude to by check the apathy of child in learn to read and call the teacher 's power into full exercise they be equally adapt to spelling and reading i will give several specimen of read lesson in natural history each of which have a large well-engraved and color plate at the top copy from nature the eagle how glad some poor child would be if they could read about the eagle he be a big strong bird and have such great wing and such long sharp claw that he can dig they into the lamb hare rabbit and other animal and thus fly away with they to feed he young one and to eat they himself eagle make such a large nest on the side of some high rock where nobody can get at it there use to be eagle in wale and there be some now in scotland but very few in england for they do not like to be where there be many people _ the almighty give man dominion over the bird of the air _ as well as over the other animal and as he give man power to _ think _ if the eagle become troublesome man catch they though they can fly so high and as the eagle know this he like to keep out of we way and go into part of the world where there be not so many people there be many sort of eagle : the black eagle the sea eagle the bald eagle and other they have all strong bill bent down in front and strong claw this bird be mention in the bible question be propose after this be read and thus the examination proceeds : -- q what be that a a eagle q what sort of a bird be he a he be big and strong q what be those a he feather q what else be they call a he plumage q be the eagle a small bird a no very large q be he claw long and sharp a yes q what animal could he carry away a a lamb a hare a rabbit or other small animal q what do he do with those a feed he young one q where do the eagle make he nest a on the side of some rock q why do he make it there a that no one may get at it q use there to be eagle in wale a yes q where be there a few still a in england scotland and ireland q why be they not as plentiful as they be a because they do not like to be where many man live q do the almighty give man dominion over the bird of the air a yes q what other power do he give man a power to think q as man can think when the eagle become troublesome what do they do a they catch they q and what do the eagle that be not catch do a they go to place where man be not so plenty q be there many different kind of eagle a yes q name some a the black eagle the bald eagle the sea eagle and other the vulture the vulture be like the eagle in size and some of its habit but it be so very different from it in many way that there be little danger of confuse the two together : the greatest distinction between they be that the head of the vulture be either quite naked or cover only with a short down while the eagle 's be well feathered this be the chief difference in appearance but in they habit there be a much greater instead of fly over hill and valley in pursuit of living game the vulture only search for dead carcass which they prefer although they may have be a long time dead and therefore very bad and smell very offensively they generally live in very warm country and be useful in clear away those dead carcass which but for they would cause many dreadful disease in some country indeed on account of this the inhabitant will not allow any one to injure they and they be call for this reason scavenger which mean that they do the business for which scavenger be employ vulture be very greedy and ravenous they will often eat so much that they be not able to move or fly but sit quite stupidly and insensible one of they will often at a single meal devour the entire body of a albatross -lrb- bone and all -rrb- which be a bird nearly as large as the vulture itself they will smell a dead carcass at a very great distance and will soon surround and devour it vulture lay two egg at a time and only once a year : they build they nest on the same kind of place as eagle do so that it be very hard to find they what do the vulture resemble the eagle in a in size and in some of its habit q in what do it differ from the eagle a in have a neck and head either naked or cover with short down q what be the difference in the manner in which they feed a the eagle seek its food over hill and valley and live entirely on prey which he take alive while the vulture seek out dead and putrid carcass q for what reason do you suppose be the vulture 's neck not cover with feather as the eagle 's be a if they have feather on they neck like eagle and hawk they would soon become clot with blood q why would this happen a because they be continually plunge they neck into decayed flesh and bloody carcass q how do vulture sit a in a dull mopee manner q where do they generally sit a on tall dead tree q do they continue thus long a yes for several hour q what be the cause of they thus sit so dull and inactive a the great quantity of food they have eat q be there any description of vulture form a exception to the general character of those bird a yes that particular kind call the snake eater q where be this bird a native of a of africa q why be it call the snake eater a on account of its singular manner of destroy serpent on which it feed q describe the manner in which this bird kill its prey a he wait until the serpent raise its head and then strike he with he wing and repeat the blow until the serpent be kill q what do the native of asia and africa call the vulture a the scavenger q why a because they be so useful in eat dead carcass q how be this useful a it clear the ground of they otherwise in those warm place they would be the cause of much disease q what do this shew we a that the good god have create nothing without its use q what be the largest bird of the vulture kind a the great condor of south america q what do its wing often measure from tip to tip a twelve foot when spread out q how do the native of south america often catch the vulture a the dead carcass of a cow or horse be set for a bait on which they feed so ravenously that they become stupid and be easily take the crocodile i hope you will not put you dirty hand on this picture of the crocodile the live one have hard scale on they back and such a many tooth that they could bite a man 's leg off but there be none in we land only young one that sailor bring home with they the crocodile can run fast those be best off who be out of he way he live by the water he go much in it and he can swim well young one come out of egg which the old one lay in the sand some beast eat the egg or else there would be too many crocodile the crocodile can run fast if he run straight and those who wish to get out of he way run zigzag and he take some time to turn the poor black man know this and can get out of he way but some of they can fight and kill he on the land or in the water i think the crocodile be mention in _ scripture _ ask you teacher what scripture mean when you learn geography you will know where many of the place be that be mention in the bible and you will see where the river nile be there be such a many crocodile on the bank of that river that the people be afraid to go alone what a many wonderful animal we great creator have make how humble and thankful we should be to see so many great wonder q what have crocodile on they back a hard scale q have they many tooth a yes a great many q could they bite off a man 's leg a they could q be there any in we country a none wild but a few that sailor bring in ship q can the crocodile run fast a yes q where do he live a in the water q what do they young one come out of a out of egg which the old one lay in the sand q how do people run that wish to get out of the crocodile 's way a zigzag like the wave line in we lesson q what do some man do a fight and kill they in the water q where do most of those animal live a in the river nile q where be this river a in egypt the spelling lesson contain word capable of explanation such as white black round square other be class as fleet ship brig sloop & c and other be in contrast as hot cold dark light wet dry & c in this department we use the tablet place beneath the arithmeticon the invention and improvement of which be describe in the volume entitle early discipline illustrate or the infant system successful and progress a clear idea of the whole apparatus be give by the wood-cut on the next page and it ought certainly to be find in every infant school the sense of sight be then bring into full action to aid the mind and that with result which would not easily be conceive we shall take another opportunity of explain the use of the upper part of the apparatus the lower demand we present attention -lrb- illustration -rrb- to use the _ tablet _ let the following thing be observe it be suppose the child know well there be twenty-six letter in the alphabet that twenty be call consonant and that six be vowel we take first one perpendicular row of letter in the figure now point to d and say what be that ' and the answer will be d ask be it a vowel or consonant and they will reply a consonant but ask why do you know it be d and the answer will probably be it be so because it be hide the circular part of the letter and ask what be the position of the other part and they will say have previously learn the element of form which will shortly be explain a perpendicular line hide that and ask they what the other part be tell they to bend one of they fore-finger in the same form and they will say a curved line if they be then ask how they may know it be d they will say because it be make of a perpendicular line and have a curved line behind further information may then be give turn the d letter up thus -lrb- illustration : the character d turn on its side -rrb- and say i want to teach you the difference between concave and convex : the under part of the curve be concave and the upper part of it be convex then say i shall now take the letter away and wish you to shew I concave and convex on one of you finger when they will bend the forefinger and point they both out on it go on with the other letter in the same way : shew they the vowel after the consonant and analyze each one for example a be form of two inclined line and a horizontal line to join they in the center and the top of that letter be a acute angle and be a line place at the bottom it would be a triangle a brass letter may be moreover shewn to be a substance : its property may be describe as hard smooth bright & c and its come from the mineral kingdom may be notice and thus the instruction may be indefinitely vary the _ power _ of letter may then be point out ask they to spell m r and they will give you the sound of r or something like it and so in reference to other letter but place the a against the m as it appear in the figure and you may teach they to say a m be and thus all the way down the left side of the row of consonant if then you carry the vowel down on the other side of they you will change the lesson and by such means go on almost _ ad infinitum _ double row of consonant may be place with a vowel between they and when well practice in this they will ask for the vowel to be omit that they may supply it which they will do very readily and with great pleasure while there be a tasking of the mind which can not but prove beneficial again turn the frame with the ball round so that the wire be perpendicular instead of horizontal raise a ball gently and say to ascend ascend ascend let it fall gently say to descend descend descend with a little explanation these word will then be understand and other may be teach in the same way to fall fall fall to rise rise rise to go go go will readily occur and other will easily be supply by the ingenuity of the instructor the frame may also be apply to _ grammar _ it be to be use as follow : -- move one of the ball to a part of the frame distinct from the rest the child will then repeat there _ it _ be there _ it _ be apply you finger to the ball and set it run round the child will immediately change from say there _ it _ be to there _ it _ go there _ it _ go when they have repeat there it go long enough to impress it on they memory stop the ball the child will probably say now _ it _ stop now _ it _ stop when that be the case move another ball to it and then explain to the child the difference between singular and plural desire they to call out there _ they _ be there _ they _ be and when they have do that as long as may be proper set both ball move and it be likely they will call out there _ they _ go there _ they _ go i do not particularize further because i know that good teacher will at once see the principle aim at and supply the other requisite lesson : the object of this book be rather to shew the principle of the thing than to go into detail chapter xii arithmetic _ the arithmeticon -- how apply -- numeration -- addition -- subtraction -- multiplication -- division -- fraction -- arithmetical table -- arithmetical song -- observation _ \* \* \* \* \* in arithmetic as in every other branch of education the principal object should be to preserve the understanding from implicit belief to invigorate its power and to induce the laudable ambition of progressive improvement -- _ edgeworth _ \* \* \* \* \* the advantage of a knowledge of arithmetic have never be dispute its universal application to the business of life render it a important acquisition to all rank and condition of man the practicability of impart the rudiment of arithmetic to very young child have be satisfactorily shew by the infant-school system and it have be find likewise that it be the readiest and surest way of develop the think faculty of the infant mind since the most complicated and difficult question of arithmetic as well as the most simple be all solvable by the same rule and on the same principle it be of the utmost importance to give child a clear insight into the primary principle of number for this purpose we take care to shew they by visible object that all number be combination of unity and that all change of number must arise either from add to or take from a certain stated number after this or rather perhaps i should say in conjunction with this instruction we exhibit to the child the _ sign _ of number and make they acquaint with they various combination and lastly we bring they to the abstract consideration of number or what may be term _ mental arithmetic _ if you reverse this which have generally be the system of instruction pursue -- if you set a child to learn its multiplication penny and other table before you have shew it by _ reality _ the combination of unity which these table express in word -- you be render the whole abstruse difficult and uninteresting and in short be give it knowledge which it be unable to apply as far as regard the general principle of numerical tuition it may be sufficient to state that we should begin with unity and proceed very gradually by slow and sure step through the simplest form of combination to the more comprehensive trace and retrace you first step -- the child can never be too thoroughly familiar with the first principle or fact of number we have various way of teaching arithmetic in use in the school i shall speak of they all begin with a description of the arithmeticon which be of great utility -lrb- illustration -rrb- i have think it necessary in this edition to give the original woodcut of the arithmeticon which it will be see contain twelve wire with one ball on the first wire two on the second and so progress up to twelve the improvement be that each wire should contain twelve ball so that the whole of the multiplication table may be do by it up to 12 time 12 be 144 the next step be have the ball paint black and white alternately to assist the sense of see it be certain that a uneducated eye can not distinguish the combination of color any more than a uneducated ear can distinguish the combination of sound so far the thing succeed with respect to the sense of see but there be yet another thing to be legislate for and that be to prevent the child 's attention be draw off from the object to which it be to be direct viz the smaller number of ball as separate from the greater this object could only be attain by invent a board to slide in and hide the greater number from they view and so far we succeed in gain they undivided attention to the ball we think necessary to move out time and experience only could shew that there be another thing want and that be a tablet as represent in the second woodcut which have a tendency to teach the child the difference between real number and representative character therefore the necessity of brass figure as represent on the tablet hence the child would call figure seven no 1 it be but one object and each figure they would only count as one thus make 937 which be the representative character only three which be the real fact there be only three object it be therefore find necessary to teach the child that the figure seven would represent 7 one 7 ten 7 hundred 7 thousand or 7 million accord to where it might be place in connection with the other figure and as this have already be describe i feel it unnecessary to enlarge upon the subject -lrb- illustration -rrb- the arithmeticon it will be see that on the twelve parallel wire there be 144 ball alternately black and white by these the element of arithmetic may be teach as follow : -- _ numeration _ -- take one ball from the lowest wire and say unit _ one _ two from the next and say ten _ two _ three from the third and say hundred _ three _ four from the fourth and say thousand _ four _ five from the fifth and say ten of thousand _ five _ six from the sixth and say hundred of thousand _ six _ seven from the seventh and say million _ seven _ eight from the eighth and say ten of million _ eight _ nine from the ninth and say hundred of million _ nine _ ten from the tenth and say thousand of million _ ten _ eleven from the eleventh and say ten of thousand of million _ eleven _ twelve from the twelfth and say hundred of thousand of million _ twelve _ the tablet beneath the ball have six space for the insertion of brass letter and figure a box of which accompany the frame suppose then the only figure insert be the 7 in the second space from the top : now be the child ask what it be they would all say without instruction it be one if however you tell they that a object of such a form stand instead of seven one and place seven ball together on a wire they will at once see the use and power of the number place a 3 next the seven merely ask what it be and they will reply we do not know but if you put out three ball on a wire they will say instantly o it be three one or three and that they may have the proper name they may be tell that they have before they _ figure 7 _ and _ figure 3 _ put a 9 to these figure and they attention will be arrest : say do you think you can tell I what this be and while you be speak move the ball gently out and as soon as they see they they will immediately cry out nine and in this way they may acquire a knowledge of all the figure separately then you may proceed thus : unit 7 ten 3 place three ball on the top wire and seven on the second and say thirty-seven as you point to the figure and thirty-seven as you point to the ball then go on unit 7 ten 3 hundred 9 place nine ball on the top wire three on the second and seven on the third and say point to each nine hundred and thirty-seven and so onward to assist the understanding and exercise the judgment slide a figure in the frame and say figure 8 q what be this a no 8 q if no 1 be put on the left side of the 8 what will it be a 81 q if the 1 be put on the right side then what will it be a 18 q if the figure 4 be put before the 1 then what will the number be a 418 q shift the figure 4 and put it on the left side of the 8 then ask the child to tell the number the answer be 184 the teacher can keep add and shift as he please accord to the capacity of he pupil take care to explain as he go on and to satisfy himself that he little flock perfectly understand he suppose figure 5476953821 be in the frame then let the child begin at the left hand say unit ten hundred thousand ten of thousand hundred of thousand million ten of million hundred of million thousand of million after which begin at the right side and they will say five thousand four hundred and seventy-six million nine hundred and fifty-three thousand eight hundred and twenty-one if the child be practice in this way they will soon learn numeration the frame be employ for this purpose long before its application to other be perceive but at length i find we might proceed to _ addition _ -- we proceed as follow : -- 1 and 2 be 3 and 3 be 6 and 4 be 10 and 5 be 15 and 6 be 21 and 7 be 28 and 8 be 36 and 9 be 45 and 10 be 55 and 11 be 66 and 12 be 78 then the master may exercise they backwards say 12 and 11 be 23 and 10 be 33 and 9 be 42 and 8 be 50 and 7 be 57 and 6 be 63 and 5 be 68 and 4 be 72 and 3 be 75 and 2 be 77 and 1 be 78 and so on in great variety again : place seven ball on one wire and two on the next and ask they how many 7 and 2 be to this they will soon answer nine : then put the brass figure 9 on the tablet beneath and they will see how the amount be mark : then take eight ball and three when they will see that eight and three be eleven explain to they that they can not put underneath two figure one which mean 11 but they must put 1 under the 8 and carry 1 to the 4 when you must place one ball under the four and ask they what that make they will say five proceed by say how much be five and nine put out the proper number of ball and they will say five and nine be fourteen put a four underneath and tell they as there be no figure to put the 1 under it must be place next to it : hence they see that 937 add to 482 make a total of 1419 _ subtraction _ may be teach in as many way by this instrument thus : take 1 from 1 nothing remain move the first ball at the same time to the other end of the frame then remove one from the second wire and say take one from 2 the child will instantly perceive that only 1 remain then 1 from 3 and 2 remain 1 from 4 3 remain 1 from 5 4 remain 1 from 6 5 remain 1 from 7 6 remain 1 from 8 7 remain 1 from 9 8 remain 1 from 10 9 remain 1 from 11 10 remain 1 from 12 11 remain then the ball may be work backwards begin at the wire contain 12 ball say take 2 from 12 10 remain 2 from 11 9 remain 2 from 10 8 remain 2 from 9 7 remain 2 from 8 6 remain 2 from 7 5 remain 2 from 6 4 remain 2 from 5 3 remain 2 from 4 2 remain 2 from 3 1 remain the brass figure should be use for the remainder in each case say then can you take 8 from 3 as you point to the figure and they will say yes but skew they 3 ball on a wire and ask they to deduct 8 from they when they will perceive they error explain that in such a case they must _ borrow _ one then say take 8 from 13 place 12 ball on the top wire borrow one from the second and take away eight and they will see the remainder be five and so on through the sum and other of the same kind in _ multiplication _ the lesson be perform as follow the teacher move the first ball and immediately after the two ball on the second wire place they underneath the first say at the same time twice one be two which the child will readily perceive we next remove the two ball on the second wire for a multiplier and then remove two ball from the third wire place they exactly under the first two which form a square and then say twice two be four which every child will discern for himself as he plainly perceive there be no more we then move three on the third wire and place three from the fourth wire underneath they say twice three be six remove the four on the fourth wire and four on the fifth place they as before and say twice four be eight remove five from the fifth wire and five from the sixth wire underneath they say twice five be ten remove six from the sixth wire and six from the seventh wire underneath they and say twice six be twelve remove seven from the seventh wire and seven from the eighth wire underneath they say twice seven be fourteen remove eight from the eighth wire and eight from the ninth say twice eight be sixteen remove nine on the ninth wire and nine on the tenth wire say twice nine be eighteen remove ten on the tenth wire and ten on the eleventh underneath they say twice ten be twenty remove eleven on the eleventh wire and eleven on the twelfth say twice eleven be twenty-two remove one from the tenth wire to add to the eleven on the eleventh wire afterwards the remain ball on the twelfth wire say twice twelve be twenty-four next proceed backwards say 12 time 2 be 24 11 time 2 be 22 10 time 2 be 20 & c for _ division _ suppose you take from the 144 ball gather together at one end one from each row and place the 12 at the other end thus make a perpendicular row of one : then make four perpendicular row of three each and the child will see there be 4 3 's in 12 divide the 12 into six parcel and they will see there be 6 2 's in 12 leave only two out and they will see at you direction that 2 be the sixth part of 12 take away one of these and they will see one be the twelfth part of 12 and that 12 1 's be twelve to explain the state of the frame as it appear in the cut we must first suppose that the twenty-four ball which appear in four lot be gather together at the _ figure side _ : when the child will see there be three perpendicular 8 's and as easily that there be 8 horizontal 3 's if then the teacher wish they to tell how many 6 's there be in twenty-four he move they out as they appear in the cut and they see there be four and the same principle be act on throughout the only remain branch of numerical knowledge which consist in a ability to comprehend the power of number without either visible object or sign -- be impart as follow : _ addition _ one of the child be place before the gallery and repeat aloud in a kind of chaunt the whole of the school repeat after he one and one be two two and one be three three and one be four & c up to twelve two and two be four four and two be six six and two be eight & c to twenty-four three and three be six six and three be nine nine and three be twelve & c to thirty-six _ subtraction _ one from twelve leave eleven one from eleven leave ten & c two from twenty-four leave twenty-two two from twenty-two leave twenty & c _ multiplication _ twice one be two twice two be four & c & c three time three be nine three time four be twelve & c & c twelve time two be twenty-four eleven time two be twenty-two & c & c twelve time three be thirty-six eleven time three be thirty-three & c & c until the whole of the multiplication table be go through _ division _ there be twelve two in twenty-four -- there be eleven two in twenty-two & c & c there be twelve three in thirty-six & c there be twelve fours in forty-eight & c & c _ fraction _ two be the half -lrb- 1\/2 -rrb- of four third -lrb- 1\/3 -rrb- of six fourth -lrb- 1\/2 -rrb- of eight fifth -lrb- 1\/5 -rrb- of ten sixth -lrb- 1\/6 -rrb- of twelve seventh -lrb- 1\/7 -rrb- of fourteen twelfth -lrb- 1\/12 -rrb- of twenty-four two be the eleventh -lrb-

four time eight and three-eighth -lrb- 3\/8 -rrb- of eight in twenty-two be seven time three and one-third -lrb- 1\/3 -rrb- of three in thirty-four be four time eight and one-fourth -lrb- 1\/4 -rrb- of eight the table subjoin be repeat by the same method each section be a distinct lesson to give a idea to the reader the boy in the rostrum say ten shilling the half -lrb- 1\/2 -rrb- of a pound six shilling and eightpence one-third -lrb- 1\/3 -rrb- of a pound & c sixpence the half -lrb- 1\/2 -rrb- of a shilling & c always remember that whatever the boy say in the rostrum the other child must repeat after he but not till the monitor have end he sentence and before the monitor deliver the second sentence he wait till the child have conclude the first they wait for he and he for they this prevent confusion and be the means of enable person to understand perfectly what be go on in the school in a book lately publish which be a compilation by two london master it be state in the preface that they be at a loss for proper lesson : have they use those in existence i can not help think they be enough for the capacity of child under six year of age 254 arithmetical table numeration

_ the shape of the earth may be shew by a ball the surface by the outside its revolution on its axis by turn it round and the idea of day and night may be give by a ball and a candle in a dark-room as the construction and application of this instrument be the result of personal long-continued and anxious effort and as i have rarely see a pirate one make properly or understand i may express a hope that whenever it be wanted either for school or nursery application will be make for it to my depot i have only to add that a board be place at the back to keep the child from see the ball except as they be put out and that the brass figure at the side be intend to assist the master when he be call away so that he may see on return to the frame where he leave off the slightest glance at the wood-cut will shew how unjust the observation of the writer of school for the industrious class or the present state of education amongst the work people of england publish under the superintendance of the central society of education be where he say we be willing to assume that mr wilderspin have originate some improvement in the system of infant school education but mr wilderspin claim so much that many person have be lead to refuse he that degree of credit to which he be fairly entitle for example he claim a beneficial interest in a instrument call the arithmeticon of which he say he be the inventor this instrument be describe in a work on arithmetic publish by mr friend forty year ago the instrument be however of much older date it be the same in principle as the abacus of the roman and in its form resemble as nearly as possible the swanpan of the chinese of which there be a drawing in the encyclopedia brittanica mr wilderspin merely invent the name now i defy the writer of this to prove that the arithmeticon exist before i invent it i claim no more than what be my due the abacus of the roman be entirely different still more so be the chinese swanpan if any person will take the trouble to look into the encyclopedia britannica they will see the difference at once although i never hear of either until they be mention in the pamphlet refer to there be 144 ball on mine and it be properly simplify for infant with the addition of the tablet which explain the representative character as well as the real one which be the ball i have not yet hear what the central society have invent probably we shall soon hear of the mighty wonder perform by they from one end of the three kingdom to the other they whole account of the origin of the infant system be as partial and unjust as it possibly can be mr simpson whom they quote can tell they so as can also some of the committee of management whose name i see at the commencement of the work the central society seem to wish to pull I down as also do the other society to whom reference be make be the same page of which i complain and i distinctly charge both society with do I great injustice the society complain of my plan without know they the other adopt they without acknowledgment and both have spring up fungus-like after the infant system have be in existence many year and i have serve three apprenticeship to extend and promote it without receive subscription or any public aid whatever it be hard after a man have expend the essence of he constitution and spend he child 's property for the public good in induce people to establish school in the principal town in the three kingdom -- strike at the root of domestic happiness by personally visit each town do the thing instead of write about it -- that society of he own countryman should be so anxious to give the credit to foreigner verily it be most true that a prophet have no honor in he own country the first public honor i ever receive be at inverness in the highland of scotland the last be by the jew in london and i think there be a space of about twenty year between each chapter xiii form position and size _ method of instruction geometrical song -- anecdote -- size -- song measure -- observation _ \* \* \* \* \* geometry be eminently serviceable to improve and strengthen the intellectual faculty -- _ jone _ \* \* \* \* \* among the novel feature of the infant school system that of geometrical lesson be the most peculiar how it happen that a mode of instruction so evidently calculate for the infant mind be so long overlook i can not imagine and it be still more surprising that have be once think of there should be any doubt as to its utility certain it be that the various form of body be one of the first item of natural education and we can not err when tread in the step of nature it be undeniable that geometrical knowledge be of great service in many of the mechanic art and therefore proper to be teach child who be likely to be employ in some of those art but independently of this we can not adopt a better method of exciting and strengthen they power of observation i have see a thousand instance moreover in the conduct of the child which have assure I that it be a very please as well as useful branch of instruction the child be teach the first element of form and the term use to express the various figure of body find in its application to object around they a inexhaustible source of amusement street house room field pond plate dish table in short every thing they see call for observation and afford a opportunity for the application of they geometrical knowledge let it not then be say that it be beyond they capacity for it be the simplest and most comprehensible to they of all knowledge -- let it not be say that it be useless since its application to the useful art be great and indisputable nor be it to be assert that it be unplease to they since it have be shewn to add greatly to they happiness it be essential in this as in every other branch of education to begin with the first principle and proceed _ slowly _ to they application and the complicated form arise therefrom the next thing be to promote that application of which we have before speak to the various object around they it be this and this alone which form the distinction between a school lesson and practical knowledge and so far will the child be find from be averse from this exertion that it make the acquirement of knowledge a pleasure instead of a task with these prefatory remark i shall introduce a description of the method i have pursue and a few example of geometrical lesson we will suppose that the whole of the child be seat in the gallery and that the teacher -lrb- provide with a brass instrument form for the purpose which be merely a series of joint like those to a counting-house candlestick from which i borrow the idea -lrb- a -rrb- and which may be alter as require in a moment -rrb- point to a straight line ask what be this a a straight line q why do you not call it a crooked line a because it be not crooked but straight q what be these a curved line q what do curved line mean a when they be bent or crooked q what be these a parallel straight line q what do parallel mean a parallel means when they be equally distant from each other in every part q if any of you child be read a book that give a account of some town which have twelve street and it be say that the street be parallel would you understand what it mean a yes it would mean that the street be all the same way side by side like the line which we now see q what be those a diverge or converge straight line q what be the difference between diverge and converge line and parallel line a diverge or converge line be not at a equal distance from each other in every part but parallel line be q what do diverge mean a diverge means when they go from each other and they diverge at one end and converge at the other -lrb- b -rrb- q what do converge mean a converge means when they come towards each other q suppose the line be longer what would be the consequence a please sir if they be longer they would meet together at the end they converge q what would they form by meeting together a by meeting together they would form a angle q what kind of a angle a a acute angle q would they form a angle at the other end a no they would go further from each other q what be this a a perpendicular line q what do perpendicular mean a a line up straight like the stem of some tree q if you look you will see that one end of the line come on the middle of another line what do it form a the one which we now see form two right angle q i will make a straight line and one end of it shall lean on another straight line but instead of be upright like the perpendicular line you see that it be slope what do it form a one side of it be a acute angle and the other side be a obtuse angle q which side be the obtuse angle a that which be the most open q and which be the acute angle a that which be the least open q what do acute mean a when the angle be sharp q what do obtuse mean a when the angle be less sharp than the right angle q if i be to call any one of you a acute child would you know what i mean a yes sir one that look out sharp and try to think and pay attention to what be say to he and then you would say he be a acute child -lrb- footnote b : mr chamber have be good enough to call the instrument refer to a gonograph to that name i have no objection -rrb- -lrb- footnote b : desire the child to hold up two finger keep they apart and they will perceive they diverge at top and converge at bottom -rrb- _ equi-lateral triangle _ q what be this a a equi-lateral triangle q why be it call equi-lateral a because its side be all equal q how many side have it a three side q how many angle have it a three angle q what do you mean by angle a the space between two right line draw gradually nearer to each other till they meet in a point q and what do you call the point where the two line meet a the angular point q tell I why you call it a tri-angle a we call it a tri-angle because it have three angle q what do you mean by equal a when the three side be of the same length q have you any thing else to observe upon this a yes all its angle be acute _ isocele triangle _ q what be this a a acute-angled isocele triangle q what do acute mean a when the angle be sharp q why be it call a isoceles triangle a because only two of its side be equal q how many side have it a three the same as the other q be there any other kind of isocele triangle a yes there be right-angled and obtuse-angled -lrb- here the other triangle be to be shewn and the master must explain to the child the meaning of right-angled and obtuse-angled -rrb- _ scalene triangle _ q what be this a a acute-angled scalene triangle q why be it call a acute-angled scalene triangle a because all its angle be acute and its side be not equal q why be it call scalene a because it have all its side _ unequal _ q be there any other kind of scalene triangle a yes there be a right-angled scalene triangle which have one right angle q what else a a obtuse-angled scalene triangle which have one obtuse angle q can a acute triangle be a equi-lateral triangle a yes it may be equilateral isocele or scalene q can a right-angled triangle or a obtuse-angled triangle be a equilateral a no it must be either a isocele or a scalene triangle _ square _ q what be this a a square q why be it call a square a because all its angle be right angle and its side be equal q how many angle have it a four angle q what would it make if we draw a line from one angle to the opposite one a two right-angled isocele triangle q what would you call the line that we draw from one angle to the other a a diagonal q suppose we draw another line from the other two angle a then it would make four triangle _ pent-agon _ q what be this a a regular pentagon q why be it call a pentagon a because it have five side and five angle q why be it call regular a because its side and angle be equal q what do pentagon mean a a five-sided figure q be there any other kind of pentagon a yes irregular pentagon q what do irregular mean a when the side and angle be not equal _ hex-agon _ q what be this a a hexagon q why be it call a hexagon a because it have six side and six angle q what do hexagon mean a a six-sided figure q be there more than one sort of hexagon a yes there be regular and irregular q what be a regular hexagon a when the side and angle be all equal q what be a irregular hexagon a when the side and angle be not equal _ hept-agon _ q what be this a a regular heptagon q why be it call a heptagon a because it have seven side and seven angle q why be it call a regular heptagon a because its side and angle be equal q what do a heptagon mean a a seven-sided figure q what be a irregular heptagon a a seven-sided figure whose side be not equal _ oct-agon _ q what be this a a regular octagon q why be it call a regular octagon a because it have eight side and eight angle and they be all equal q what do a octagon mean a a eight-sided figure q what be a irregular octagon a a eight-sided figure whose side and angle be not all equal q what do a octave mean a eight note in music _ non-agon _ q what be this a a nonagon q why be it call a nonagon a because it have nine side and nine angle q what do a nonagon mean a a nine-sided figure q what be a irregular nonagon a a nine-sided figure whose side and angle be not equal _ dec-agon _ q what be this a a regular decagon q what do a decagon mean a a ten-sided figure q why be it call a decagon a because it have ten side and ten angle and there be both regular and irregular decagon _ rect-angle or oblong _ q what be this a a rectangle or oblong q how many side and angle have it a four the same as a square q what be the difference between a rectangle and a square a a rectangle have two long side and the other two be much shorter but a square have its side equal _ rhomb _ q what be this a a rhomb q what be the difference between a rhomb and a rectangle a

trapezoid _ q what be this a a trapezoid q how many side have it a four side and four angle it have only two of its angle equal which be opposite to each other _ tetragon _ q what do we call these figure that have four side a tetragon _ tetra _ mean four q be they call by another name a yes they be call quadrilateral or quadrangle q how many regular tetragon be among those we have mention a one that be the square all the other be irregular tetragon because they side and angle be not all equal q by what name would you call the whole of the figure on this board a polygon those that have they side and angle equal we would call regular polygon q what would you call those angle whose side be not equal a irregular polygon and the smallest number of side a polygon can have be three and the number of corner be always equal to the number of side _ ellipse or oval _ q what be this a a ellipse or a oval q what shape be the top or crown of my bat a circular q what shape be that part which come on my forehead and the back part of my head a oval the other polygon be teach the child in rotation in the same simple manner all tend to please and edify they the follow be sing : -- horizontal

slanting cross convex concave curve line convex concave curve line here be a wave line there be a angle here be a wave line there be a angle a ellipsis or a oval a semicircle half way round then a circle wheeling round some amusing circumstance have occur from the knowledge of form thus acquire d'ye ken mr wilderspin say a child at glasgow one day that we have a oblong table : it be make o ' deal four side four corner twa lang side and twa short ane corner mean angle and angle mean corner my brother ga'e himsel sic a clink o ' the eye against ane at hame but ye ken there be nane that could tell the shape o ' the thing that do it a little boy be watch he mother make pan-cake and wish they be all do when after various observation as to they comparative goodness with and without sugar he exclaim i wonder which be best _ elliptical _ pan-cake or _ circular _ one as this be greek to the mother she turn round with what d'ye say when the child repeat the observation bless the child say the astonished parent what odd thing ye be always say what can you mean by liptical pancake why you little fool do not you know they be make of flour and egg and do you not see I put the milk into the large pan and stir all up together yes say the little fellow i know what they be make of and i know what bread be make of but that be ` nt the shape indeed indeed mother they be _ elliptical pan-cake _ because they be make in a _ elliptical frying-pan _ a old soldier who lodge in the house be now call down by the mother and he decide that the child be right and far from be what in she surprize and alarm she take he to be on another occasion a little girl have be take to market by she mother where she be strike by the sight of the carcass of six sheep recently kill and say mother what be these the reply be dead sheep dead sheep do not bother they be suspend perpendicular and parallel rejoin the child what what be then the question why mother be the child 's answer do not you see they hang up that be suspend they be straight up that be perpendicular and they be at equal distance that be parallel on another occasion a child come cry to school at have be beat for contradict he father and begged of I to go to he father and explain which i do the man receive I kindly and tell I that he have beat the child for insist that the table which he point out be not _ round _ which he repeat be against all evidence of the sens that the child tell he that if it be round nothing would stand upon it which so enrage he that he thrash he as he deserve and send he off to school add to be thus contradict by a child so young be too bad the poor little fellow stand between we look the picture of innocence combine with oppression which he countenance fully develop but say not a word under the say table there happen to be a ball leave by a younger child i take it up and kindly ask the man the shape of it he instantly reply _ round _ then say i be that table the same shape as the ball the man think for a minute and then say it be _ round-flat _ i then explain the difference to he between the one and the other more accurately of course than the infant could and tell he as he himself see a distinction it be evident they be not both alike and tell he that the table be circular ah say be that be just what the little one say but i do not understand what circular mean but now i see he be right the little fellow be so pleased that he run to he father directly with delight the other could not resist the parental impulse but seize the boy and kiss he heartily the idea of _ size _ be necessary to a correct apprehension of object to talk of yard foot or inch to a child unless they be show be just as intelligible as mile league or degree let there then be two five-feet rod a black foot and a white foot alternately the bottom foot mark in inch and let there be a horizontal piece to slide up and down to make various height thus when the height of a lion or elephant & c & c be mention it may be show by the rod while the girth may be exhibit by a piece of _ cord _ which should always be ready long measure be teach as follow : take barley-corn of mod ` rate length and three you 'll find will make a inch twelve inch make a foot -- if strength permit i 'll leap it and not flinch three foot 's a yard as understand by those possess would with sense and soul five foot and half will make a rood and also make a perch or pole oh how pretty wond ` rously pretty every rule we learn at school be wondrously pretty forty such pole a furlong make and eight such furlong make a mile o'er hedge or ditch or sea or lake o'er railing fence or gate or stile three mile a league by sea or land and twenty league be one degree just four time ninety degree a band will make to gird the earth and sea oh how pretty & c but what be the girth of hell or heaven -lrb- no natural thought or eye can see -rrb- to neither girth or length be give ` tis without space -- immensity still shall the good and truly wise the seat of heaven with safety find because ` tis see with inward eye the first reside within they mind oh how pretty & c whatever can be shew by the rod should be and i entreat teacher not to neglect this part of they duty if the table be merely learn the child will be no wiser than before another anecdote may be add here to shew that child even under punishment may think of they position with advantage doctor j of manchester send two of he child to a infant school for the upper class and one of he little daughter have break some rule in conjunction with two other little lady in the same school two of the little folk be place one in each corner of the room and miss j be place in the center when the child come home in the evening doctor j enquire well mary how have you get on at school to day the reply be oh papa little miss -- and fanny -- and i be put out they be put in the corner and i in the middle of the room and there we all stand papa a complete _ triangle _ of dunce the worthy doctor take great pleasure in mention this anecdote in company as shew the effect of a judicious cultivation of the think faculty in my peregrination by sea and land with infant we have have some odd and amusing scene i sometimes have have infant at sea for several day and night to the great amusement of the sailor : i have see some of these fine fellow at time in fit of laughter at the odd word as they call they which the child use at other time i have see some of they in tear at the want of knowledge they see in themselves and when they hear the infant sing on deck and explain the odd word by thing in the ship the sailor be delighted to have the youngster in they berth and no nurse could take better care of they than these noble fellow do i could relate anecdote after anecdote to prove the utility of this part of we system but as it be now more generally in the training juvenile school and become better know it may not be necessary especially as the prejudice against it be give way and the public mind be better inform than it be on the subject and moreover it must be give more in detail in the larger work on juvenile training or national education chapter xiv geography _ its attraction for child -- sacred geography-geographical song -- and lesson on geography _ \* \* \* \* \* from sea to sea from realm to realm i rove -- _ tickell _ \* \* \* \* \* geography be to child a delightful study we give some idea of it at a early period in infant school by singing london be the capital the capital the capital london be the capital the capital of england and other capital in the same way and also by picture of the costume of the various people of the world to teach the four quarter of the globe we tell child the different point of the play-ground and then send they to the eastern western northern or southern quarter as we please a weathercock should also be place at the top of the school and every favourable day opportunity should be seize by the teacher to give practical instruction upon it -lrb- a -rrb- -lrb- footnote a : if the lesson be on object it will shew how child be teach the point of the compass with which we find they be very much delighted the best proof that can be give that it be not injurious to the faculty -rrb- sacred geography be of great importance and child be much pleased at find out the spot visit by we savior or the route of the apostle paul the earth the earth on which we all now live be call a globe -- its shape i 'll give if in you pocket you have a ball you have it be shape -- but that be not all for land and water it contain and presently i 'll give they name the quarter be call africa europe asia and america these contain strait ocean sea continent promontory island river gulf or bay isthmuss peninsula -- each divide or separate nation kingdom city state -- mountain forest hill and dale dreary desert rock and vale in forest desert bill and plain where foot have never tread there still in mighty power he reign a ever-present god the cardinal point the _ east _ be where the sun do rise each morning in the glorious sky full _ west _ he set or hide he head and point to we the time for bed he be in the _ south _ at dinner time the _ north _ be face to a line the above can be give as a gallery lesson and it will at once be see that it require explanation : the explanation be give by the teacher in the same way as we have hint at in former lesson though for the sake of those teacher who may not be competent to do it we subjoin the following : q little child what have we be sing about a the earth on which we live q what be the earth call a a globe q what be the shape of a globe a round like a orange q be the earth round like a orange a yes q do it always stand still a no it go round the sun q how often do it go round the sun in a year a once q do it go round anything else but the sun a yes round its own axis in the same way as you turn the ball round on the wire of the arithmeticon q what be these motion call a its motion round the sun be call its annual or yearly motion q what be its other motion call a its diurnal or daily motion q what be cause by its motion round the sun a the succession of summer winter spring and autumn which be call the four season be cause by this q what be cause by its daily motion round its own axis a day and night q into what two principal thing be this earth on which we live divide a into land and water q into how many great part be the globe divide a into five q which be they a europe asia africa america and australium q which part do you live in a in europe q we sing that those great part contain strait ocean sea continent promontory island river gulf or bay isthmuss peninsula q what be a strait a a narrow part of the sea join one great sea to another q what be a ocean a a very large sea q what be a gulf or bay a a part of the sea run a long way into the land q what be a continent a a very large tract of land q what do a continent contain a nation and kingdom such as england q what more a many city and town q what more a mountain q what be mountain a very high steep place q what more do a continent contain a forest hill desert and valley q what be a forest a many large tree grow over a great deal of the land be a forest q what be hill a part of the ground which rise higher than the rest q what be a desert a a part of the earth where nothing will grow and which be cover with hot sand q what be a valley a a part of the earth which be lower than the rest with hill at each side q who make all that we have be speak of a almighty god i can remember the time when no national school in england possess a _ map _ it be think dangerous to teach geography as in fact anything but cram the memory and reading and write with regard to the reading i will say nothing as to how much be understand explain then be out of the question what a change have i live to see chapter xv picture and conversation _ picture -- religious instruction -- specimen of picture lesson on scripture and natural history -- other means of religious instruction -- effect of religious instruction -- observation _ \* \* \* \* \* the parent of dr doddridge bring he up in the early knowledge of religion before he could read he mother teach he the history of the old and new testament by the assistance of some dutch tile in the chimney of the room where they usually sit and accompany she instruction with such wise and pious reflection as make strong and lasting impression upon he heart -- _ see he life _ -lrb- a -rrb- -lrb- footnote a : this give I the idea of introduce scripture picture for the infant and that they be successful can be vouch for by hundred of teacher besides myself -rrb- \* \* \* \* \* to give the child general information it have be find advisable to have recourse to picture of natural history such as of bird beast fish flower insect & c all of which tend to shew the glory of god and as color attract the attention of child as soon as any thing they eagerly inquire what such a thing be and this give the teacher a opportunity of instruct they to great advantage for when a child of he own free will eagerly desire to be inform he be sure to profit by the information then impart we use also picture of public building and of the different trade by the former the child acquire much information from the explanation which be give to they of the use of building in what year they be build & c whilst by the latter we be enable to find out the bias of a child 's inclination some would like to be shoemaker other builder other weaver other brewer & c in short it be both please and edify to hear the child give answer to the different question i remember one little boy who say he should like to be a doctor and when ask why he make choice of that profession in preference to any other he answer be because he should like to cure all the sick people if parent do but study the inclination of they child a little more i humbly conceive that there would be more eminent man in every profession than there be it be great imprudence to determine what business child shall be of before they temper and inclination be well know every one be best in he own profession -- and this should not be determine on rashly and carelessly but as it be possible that a person may be very clever in he business or profession and yet not be a christian it have be think necessary to direct the child 's attention particularly to the scripture many difficulty lie in we way the principal one arise not from they inability to read the bible nor from they inability to comprehend it but from the apathy of the heart to its divine principle and precept some parent indeed be quite delighted if they child can read a chapter or two in the bible and think that when they can do this they have arrive at the summit of knowledge without once consider whether they understand a single sentence of what they read or whether if they understand it they _ feel _ its truth and importance and how can it be expect that they should do either when no ground-work have be lay at the time when they receive they first impression and imbibe they first idea every one come into the world without idea yet with a capacity to receive knowledge of every kind and be therefore capable to a certain extent of become intelligent and wise a infant would take hold of the most poisonous reptile that might sting he to death in a instant or attempt to stroke the lion with as little fear as he would the lamb in short he be incapable of distinguish a friend from a foe and yet so wonderfully be man form by he adorable creator that he be capable of increase he knowledge and advance towards perfection to all eternity without ever be able to arrive at the summit i be the ardent friend of _ religious _ education but what i thus denominate i must proceed to explain because of the error that abound on this subject much that bear the name be altogether unworthy of it moral and religious sentiment may be write as copy summary of truth admirable in themselves may be deposit in the memory chapter after chapter too may be repeat by rote and yet after all the slightest salutary influence may not be exert on the mind or the heart these may resemble the way-side in the parable on which the fowl of the air devour the corn as soon as it be sow and hence those plan should be devise and pursue from which we may anticipate a harvest of real good on these however my limit will only allow a few hint as soon as possible i would have a distinction make between the form and power of religion between the grimace and long-facedness so injurious to multitude and that principle of supreme love to god which he alone can implant in the heart i would exhibit too that good will to man which the gospel urge and inspire which regard the human race apart from all the circumstance of clime color or grade and which have a special reference to those who be most necessitous and how can this be do more hopefully than by inculcate in dependence on the divine blessing the history sermon and parable of we lord jesus christ and by the simple affectionate and faithful illustration and enforcement of other part of holy writ the infant system therefore include a considerable number of scripture lesson of which the follow be specimen : joseph and he brethren the following method be adopt : -- the picture be suspend against the wall and one class of the child stand opposite to it the master repeat the follow passage : and joseph dream a dream and he tell it to he brethren and they hate he yet the more and he say unto they hear i pray you the dream which i have dream for behold we be bind sheaf in the field and lo my sheaf arise and also stand upright and behold you sheaf stand round abort and make obeisance to my sheaf the teacher be provide with a pointer will point to the picture and put the follow question or such as he may think better to the child : q what be this a joseph 's first dream q what be a dream a when you dream you see thing during the time of sleep q do any of you ever dream any thing here the child will repeat what they have dream perhaps something like the following : -- please sir once i dream i be in a garden q what do you see a i see flower and such nice apple q how do you know it be a dream a because when i awake i find i be in bed during this recital the child will listen very attentively for they be highly please to hear each other 's relation the master have satisfy himself that the child in some measure understand the nature of a dream he may proceed as follow : -- q what do joseph dream about first a he dream that he brother 's sheaf make obeisance to he sheaf q what be a sheaf a a bundle of corn q what do you understand by make obeisance a to bend you body which we call make a bow q what be bind sheaf a to bind they which they do with a band of twisted straw q how many brother have joseph a eleven q what be joseph 's father 's name a jacob he be also sometimes call israel master -- and it be further write concern joseph that he dream yet another dream and tell it to he brethren and say behold i have dream a dream more and behold the sun and moon and eleven star make obeisance to I q what do you understand by the sun a the sun be that bright object in the sky which shine in the day-time and which give we heat and light q who make the sun a almighty god q for what purpose do god make the sun a to warm and nourish the earth and every thing upon it q what do you mean by the earth a the ground on which we walk and on which the corn tree and flower grow q what be it that make they grow a the heat and light of the sun q do it require any thing else to make they grow a yes rain and the assistance of almighty god q what be the moon a that object which be place in the sky and shine in the night and appear larger than the star q what do you mean by the star a those bright object that appear in the sky at night q what be they a some of they be world and other be

thing a yes q be there any more thing that be wonderful to you a yes -- where'er we turn we wonder eye he power and skill we see wonder on wonder grandly rise and speak the deity q who be the deity a almighty god nothing can be a greater error than to allow the child to use the name of god on every trifling occasion whenever it be necessary it should in my opinion be commence with almighty first both by teacher and scholar i be convince from what i have see in many place that the frequent repetition of he holy name have a very injurious effect solomon 's wise judgment q what be this a a picture of solomon 's wise judgment q describe what you mean a two woman stand before king solomon q do the woman say any thing to the king when they come before he a yes one woman say o my lord i and this woman dwell in one house and i have a child there and this woman have a child also and this woman 's child die in the night q to whom do the woman speak when they say o my lord a to king solomon

time of we late sovereign it can easily be apply by the judicious teacher and make to bear upon present circumstance and i earnestly hope that she present gracious majesty may become patroness of infant education not infant education travesty but the thing itself -rrb- the nativity of jesus christ the picture be suspend as the other and a whole class be in the class-room put the pointer into one of the child 's hand and desire the child to find out the nativity of jesus christ the other child will be on the tip-toe of expectation to see whether the child make a mistake for should this be the case they know that one of they will have the same privilege of try to find it should the child happen to touch the wrong picture the teacher will have at least a dozen applicant say please sir may i please sir may i the teacher have select the child to make the next trial say one of the youngest of the applicant the child walk round the room with the pointer and put it on the right picture which will be always know by the other child call out that be the right that be the right to view the child 's sparkling eye who have find the picture and to see the pleasure beam forth in he countenance you might imagine that be conceive he have perform one of the greatest wonder of the age the child will then proceed to read what be print on the picture which be as follow : the nativity of we lord and savior jesus christ which be print at the top of the picture at the bottom be the follow word : and she bring forth she first-born son and wrap he in swaddle clothes and lay he in a manger because there be no room for they in the inn -- we then proceed to question they in the follow manner : -- q what do you mean by the nativity of jesus christ a the time he be bear q where be he bear a in bethlehem of judea q where do they lay he a in a manger q what be a manger a a thing that horse feed out of q what be the reason they put he there a because there be no room in the inn q

receive nothing except it be give we from heaven q what be travel in a bad road a be naughty child and not mind what be say to we and when we say bad word or steal any thing or take god 's name in vain q where will this road lead to a to eternal misery here we usually give a little advice accord to circumstance take care always to avoid long speech that will tend to stupify the child if they appear tire we stop but if not they repeat the follow hymn which i shall insert in full as i believe there be nothing in it that any christian would object to hark the sky with music sound heavenly glory beam around christ be bear the angel sing glory to the new-born king peace be come good-will appear sinner wipe away you tear god in human flesh to-day humbly in the manger lay shepherd tend flock by night hear the song and see the light take they reed and softest strain echo would through the happy plain mortal hail the glorious king richest incense cheerful bring praise and love emanuel 's name and he boundless grace proclaim the hymn be conclude we put the follow question to the child : q who be the new-born king a jesus christ q who be sinner a we and all man q what be flock a a number of sheep q what be shepherd a those who take care of the sheep q what be plain a where the sheep feed q who be mortal a we be mortal q who be the glorious king a jesus christ q what be mean by emanuel 's name a jesus christ here the teacher can inform the child that jesus christ be call by a variety of name in the bible and can repeat they to the child if he think proper for every correct idea respect the savior which he can instil into they mind will serve as a foundation for other idea and he will find that the more idea the child have the more ready they will be in answer he question for man be a progressive be he capacity for progression be he grand distinction above the brute lazarus raise from the dead the picture be suspend as before describe we proceed thus : -- q what be this a jesus christ raise lazarus from the dead q who be lazarus a a man who live in a town call bethany and a friend of christ 's q what be a town a a place where there be a great number of house and person live in they q what do you mean by a friend a a person that love you and do all the good he can for you to whom you ought to do the same in return q do jesus love lazarus a yes and he

jesus make unto they a he say this sickness be not unto death but for the glory of god q what do he mean by say so a he mean that lazarus should be raise again by the power of god and that the people

say master the jew of late seek to stone thee and goest thou thither again q what do jesus christ tell they a he tell they a great many thing and at last tell they plainly that lazarus be dead q how many day have lazarus lain in the grave before he be raise up a four q who go to meet jesus christ when she hear that he be come a martha but mary sit still in the house q do martha say anything to

loud voice lazarus come forth and he that be dead come forth bind hand and foot with grave clothes and he face be bind about with a napkin -- jesus saith unto they loose he and let he go and many of the jew which come to mary and have see these thing which jesus do believe on he q if we want any more information about lazarus and he sister where should we find it a in the bible q what part a the eleventh and twelfth chapter of john i have have child at the early age of four year ask I question that i could not possibly answer and among other thing the child have say when be examine at this picture that if jesus christ have cry softly lazarus come forth he would have come -- and when ask why they think so they have answer because god can do anything which be a convincing proof that child at a very early age have a idea of the omnipotence of the supreme be oh that man would praise the lord for he goodness to the child of man picture of the last supper q what be this a a picture of the last supper q what do you mean by the last supper a a sacrament institute by jesus christ himself q what do you understand by a sacrament a there be two sacrament baptism and the holy supper and they be both observe by true christian q we will speak about baptism presently but as we have the picture of the holy supper before as let I ask if it be call by any other name a yes it be say that jesus keep the passover with he disciple and when the even be come he sit down with they and as they do eat jesus take bread and bless it and brake it and give to he disciple say take eat this be my body q

that they ought to receive the truth of god into they understanding q what will be the effect of receive the truth of god into we understanding a it will expel or drive out all falsehood q what ought they to recollect when they eat the bread a they should recollect that they receive the love of god into they will and affection q what will be the effect of this a it will drive out all bad passion and evil desire for it be say he that eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood dwelleth in I and i in he -lrb- john vi 27 -rrb- q be any thing more to be understand by these thing a much more which we must endeavor to learn when we get older q how will you learn this a by read the bible and go to a place of worship -lrb- a -rrb- -lrb- footnote a : there be many more of similar lesson and if any thing more simple which accompany the picture and apparatus which i supply for infant school the profit from which will assist to enable I if i be bless with health and strength still further to extend the system -rrb- allow such thing as these to be bring before the infant mind : let the feeling of the heart as well as the power of the understanding be call into exercise let babe have the pure milk of the word before the strong meat let as little stress as possible be lay on the mere letter and as much as possible on the spirit of the truth let it be shewn that piety be not merely rational but in the highest degree practicable let this be do with diligence faith and prayer and i hesitate not to say that we shall have a increase of the religion of the _ heart _ religious instruction may be give in other way let the teacher take a flower or a insect and ask the child if they could make such a one and i never find one who would answer yes a microscope will increase the knowledge of its wonder the teacher may then make a needle the subject of remark the child will admit that it be smooth very smooth let he tell they it be the work of man and as such will appear imperfect in proportion as it be examine and shew they it through the microscope they will perceive it be rough and full of hole as a contrast let he take a bee obtain they observation on it as it be give they a short history of it and they will acknowledge its superiority over the needle but on view it through the microscope astonishment will be increase and i have hear many say at such a time o sir how good -lrb- mean _ great _ -rrb- god must be the sting may then be point out as _ unlike _ the needle and perfectly smooth and thus truth may be impart in a manner the most interesting and delightful the influence of such consideration on _ character _ be obvious when the _ greatness _ of god be speak of allusion may be make to we pride and to the importance of humility he _ goodness _ may suggest the evil of unkindness and the importance of benevolence and he _ truth _ may lead to remark on its necessity and the sin of falsehood a small plot of ground may moreover be appropriate to the child some grain of wheat barley or rye may be sow and they may be tell that at a certain time they will spring forth often will they go and anxiously watch for this and at length they will say perhaps please sir such a thing have come up we know it be so for it be just what you say it would be week after week the progress of vegetation will be observe and the fulfilment of the master 's promise will greatly tend to increase _ he _ influence so great will _ he _ appear that he word and command will be more regard while it will be he object to trace the wonder which he predict to they divine source i have frequently observe on such occasion what i should term a act of infant worship often have the question be put to I please sir be it wicked to play as if the spirit be awed and transgression against god be regard with dread caution have be also discover in the use of the divine name and i have listen with delight to such remark as these : please sir when we sing a hymn we may say gad or if we talk about the sun we may say god make it and it be not take he name in vain be it but when we talk of god as boy do in the street that be very wicked the follow fact will illustrate the benefit of scriptural instruction a little boy about four year and a half old belong to a infant school go to see he cousin a little girl about he own age at bed-time the little boy to he great surprise see she get into bed without have say she prayer the little fellow immediately go up to the side of the bed and put this question to she : which would you rather go to heaven or hell the little girl say i do not know not know say the boy why wicked people go to hell and the good go to heaven a happy place the little girl then say why i should like to go to heaven ah but reply the little fellow again you do not say you prayer and all that go heaven pray to god she then say will you teach I to pray you prayer if i live with you say he i would but if you go to the infant school they will teach you to say you prayer and sing hymn too one day while the teacher of a infant school be speak to he little child from the conversation of we lord with the woman of samarium at the well a gentleman present ask the follow question : where should we go to worship god when a little boy answer to a throne of grace and where be a throne of grace any where answer the boy for where we kneel down and pray to god with we heart we be _ then _ at a throne of grace there be time when the child be in a better state to receive religious instruction than other a teacher of observation will soon perceive this and act accordingly if however the thing be overdo which it may be and which i have see then the effect be fatal hypocrisy will take the place of sincerity and the heart will remain unaffected and unimproved a little boy the subject of the follow anecdote be six year of age and forward in he learn i consider he fit to be send to another school and inform the parent accordingly the father come immediately and say he hope i would keep he till he be seven year of age add that he have many reason for make the request i tell he that it be the design of the institution to take such child as no other school would admit and as he child have arrive at the age of six he would be receive into the national school moreover as we have a number of application for the admission of child much younger i could not grant he request he then say i understand that you make use of picture in the school and i have good reason to approve of they for say he you must know that i have a large bible in the house matthew henry 's which be leave I by my deceased mother like many more i never look into it but keep it merely for show the child of course be forbid to open it for fear of its be spoil : but still he be continually ask I to read in it and i as continually deny he indeed i have imbibe many unfavourable impression concern this book and have no inclination to read it and be not very anxious that the child should however the child be not to be put off although several time i give he a box on the ear for worry I for notwithstanding this usage the child would frequently ask I to read it when he think i be in a good humor and at last i comply with he wish ` please father ' say the child ` will you read about solomon 's wise judgment ' ' i do not know where to find it ' be the reply ` then ' say the child ' i will tell you it be in the third chapter of the first book of king ' i look as the child direct and find it i read it to he have do so i be about to shut up the book which the child perceive say ` now please father will you read about lazarus raise from the dead ' which be do and in short say the father he keep I at it for at least two hour that night and completely tire I out for there be no get rid of he the next night be renew the application with ` please father will you read about joseph and he brethren ' and he could always tell I where these story be to be find indeed he be not contented with my read it but would get I into many difficulty by ask I to explain that which i know nothing about and if i say i could not tell he he would tell I that i ought to go to church for he master have tell he that that be the place to learn more about it add ` and i will go with you father ' in short he tell I every picture you have in you school and keep I so well at it that i at last get into the habit of _ reading for myself _ with some degree of delight this therefore be one reason why i wish the child to remain in the school a short time afterwards the mother call on I and tell I that no one could be happier than she be for there be so much alteration in she husband for the better that she could scarcely believe he to be the same man instead of be in the skittle-ground in the evening spend he money and get tipsy he be read at home to she and he child and the money that use to go for gambling be now go to buy book with which in conjunction with the bible they be greatly delighted and afford both he and they a great deal of pleasure and profit here we see a whole family be make comfortable and call to a sense of religion and duty by the instrumentality of a child of six year of age i subsequently make inquiry and find that the whole family attend a place of worship and that they character would bear the strictest investigation the follow anecdote will also shew how early impression be make on the infant mind and the effect such impression may have in the die moment of a child a little boy between the age of five and six year be extremely ill prevail on he mother to ask I to come and see he the mother call and state that she little boy say be want to see he master so bad that he would give any thing if he could see he the mother likewise say she should herself be very much oblige to I if i would come conceive that the child would get better after he have see I i accordingly go and on see the child consider that he could not recover the moment i enter the room the child attempt to rise but could not well my little man say i do you want to see I yes sir i want to see you very much answer the child tell I what you want I for i want to tell you that i can not come to school again because i shall die do not say that say the mother you will get better and then you can go to school again no answer the child i shall not get better i be sure and i want to ask master to let my class sing a hymn over my body when they put it in the pit-hole the child have make I promise that this should be do observe you tell I master when we use to say the picture that the soul of child never die and do you think i shall go to god you ask I a difficult question my little boy say i be it sir say the child i be not afraid to die and i know i shall die well child i should not be afraid to change state with you for if such as you do not go to god i do not know what will become of such as myself and from what i know of you i firmly believe that you will and all like you but you know what i use to tell you at school yes sir i do you use to tell I that i should pray to god to assist I to do to other as i would that they should do to I as the hymn say and mother know that i always say my prayer night and morning and i use to pray for father and mother master and governess and every body else yes my little man this be part of we duty we should pray for every one and i think if god see it needful he will answer we prayer especially when they come from the heart here the child attempt to speak but could not but wave he hand in token of gratitude for my have call and i can truly say that i never see so much confidence resignation and true dependence on the divine will manifest by any grow person on a death-bed much less by a child under the tender age of seven year i bade the child adieu and be much impressed with what i have see the next day the mother call on I and inform I that the child have quit he tenement of clay and that just before he departure have say to she and those around he that the soul of child never die it be only the body that die that he have be tell at school while they be say the picture that the soul go to god who give it the mother say that these be the last word the child be know to utter she then repeat the request about the child sing a hymn over he grave and name the hymn she wish to have sing the time arrive for the funeral and the parent of the child who be to sing the hymn make they very neat and clean and send they to school i send they to the house whence the funeral be to proceed and the undertaker send word that he could not be trouble with such little creature and that unless i attend myself the child could not go i tell he that i be confident that the child would be no trouble to he if he only tell they to follow the mourner two and two and that it be unnecessary for any one to interfere with they further than shew they the way back to the school i think however that i would attend to see how the child behave but do not let they see I until the corpse be arrive at the ground as soon as i have get to the ground some of the child see I and whisper there be master when several of they step out of the rank to favor I with a bow when the corpse be put into the ground the child be arrange round the grave not one of whom be more than six year of age one of they give out the hymn in the usual way and then it be sing by the whole of they and accord to the opinion of the by-stander very well the novelty of the thing cause a great number of person to collect together and yet to they credit while the child be singing there be not a whisper to be hear and when they have finish the hymn the poor people make a collection for the child on the ground the minister himself reward one or two of they and they return well store with money cake & c this simple thing be the means of make the school more know for i could hear person inquire where do these child come from why do not you know reply other from the infant school well answer a third i will try to get my child into it for i should like they to be there of all thing when do they take they in and how do they get they in why you must apply on Monday morning answer another and the follow Monday i have no less than forty-nine application all of which i be oblige to refuse because the school be full -lrb- a -rrb- -lrb- footnote a : this circumstance take place in the heart of london and some of the chief actor in it be now man and woman and should this meet the eye of any of they i be sure they will not forget the circumstance nor entirely forget they old teacher -rrb- natural history when teacher be converse with they child they should always take care to watch they countenance and the moment they appear tire to stop a hour 's instruction when the child 's mind and heart be engage be better than many hour effort when they be think of something else in addition to thirty-four picture of scripture history we have sixty of natural history each picture have a variety of quadruped bird fish and flower the first thing we do be to teach the child the name of the different thing then to distinguish they by they form and lastly they be question on they as follow : if the animal be a horse we put the pointer to it and say -- what be this a a picture of a horse q what be the use of the horse a to draw cart coach waggon dray fire-engine caravan the plough and harrow boat on the canal and any thing that they master want they q will they carry as well as draw a yes they will carry a lady or gentleman on they back a sack of corn or panier or even little child but they must not hit they hard if they do they will fall off they back besides it be very cruel to beat they q what be the difference between carry and draw a to carry be when they have the whole weight on they back but to draw be when they pull any thing along q be there any difference between those horse that carry and those horse that draw a yes the horse that draw cart dray coal-waggons stage waggon and other heavy thing be stouter and much larger and stronger than those that carry on the saddle and be call draught horse q where do the draught horse come from a the largest come from leicestershire and some come from suffolk which be very strong and be call suffolk punch q where do the best saddle-horse come from a they come at first from arabia the place in which the camel be so useful but now it be consider that those be as good which be breed in england q what do they call a horse when he be young a a foal or a young colt q will he carry or draw while he be young a not until he be teach which be call breaking of he in q and when he be break in be he very useful a yes and please sir we hope to be more useful when we be properly teach q what do you mean by be properly teach a when we have as much trouble take with we as the horse and dog have take with they q why you give I a great deal of trouble and yet i endeavor to teach you a yes sir but before infant school be establish little child like we be run the street -lrb- a -rrb- q but you ought to be good child if you do run the street a please sir there be nobody to tell we how -lrb- b -rrb- and if the man do not teach the horse he would not know how to do he work -lrb- footnote a : this answer be give by a child five year of age -rrb- -lrb- footnote b : this answer be give by a child six year of age -rrb- here we observe to the child that as this animal be so useful to mankind it should be treat with kindness and have question they as to the difference between a cart and a coach and satisfied ourselves that they understand the thing that be mention we close by ask they what be the use of the horse after he be dead to which the child reply that its flesh be eat by other animal -lrb- name they -rrb- and that its skin be put into pit with oak bark which be call tanning and that when it be tan it be call leather and leather be make into shoe to keep the foot warm and dry and that we be indebted to the animal for many thing that we both eat and wear and above all to the great god for every thing that we possess i can not help think that if this plan be more generally adopt in all school we should not have so many person ascribe everything to blind chance when all nature exhibit a god who guide protect and continually preserve the whole we also examine the child concern that ill-treated animal the ass and contrast it with the beautiful external appearance of the zebra take care to warn the child not to judge of thing by they outward appearance which the world in general be too apt to do but to judge of thing by they use and of man by they general character and conduct after have examine the child concern the animal that be most familiar to we such as the sheep the cow the dog and other of a similar kind we proceed to foreign animal such as the camel the elephant the tiger the lion & c & c in describe the use of the camel and the elephant there be a fine field to open the understanding of the child by state how useful the camel be in the desert of arabium how much it can carry how long it can go without water and the reason it can go without water longer than most other animal how much the elephant can carry what use it make of its trunk & c all these thing will assist the think power of child and enlarge they understanding if manage carefully we also contrast the beautiful appearance of the tiger with its cruel and blood-thirsty disposition and endeavor to shew these man and woman in miniature that it be a dangerous plan to judge of thing by outward appearance but that there be a more correct way of judge which form a part of the business of education to explain the child be highly delighted with these picture and of they own accord require a explanation of the subject nay they will even ask question that will puzzle the teacher to answer and although there be in some mind such a natural barrenness that like the sand of arabium they be never to be cultivate or improve yet i can safely say that i never know a child who do not like the picture and as soon as i have do explain one it be always please sir may we learn this please teacher may we learn that in short i find that i be generally tire before the child instead of have to apply any magisterial severity they be petition to learn and this mode of teaching possess a advantage over every other because it do not interfere with any religious opinion there be no body of christian that i know or ever hear of who would object to the fact record in the bible be thus elucidate by picture thus a ground-work may be lay not only of natural history but of sacred history also for the object be before the child 's eye they can in some degree comprehend they and store they in they memory indeed there be such attraction in picture that you can scarcely pass a picture-shop in london without see a number of grown person around the window gaze at they when picture be first introduce into the school the child tell they parent many of whom come and ask permission to see they and although the plate be very common i observe a degree of attention and reverence in the parent scarcely to be expect and especially from those who could not read it be generally the case that what we have always with we become so familiar that we set little store by it but on be deprive of it for a time we then set a greater value on it : and i have find this to be the case with the child if the picture we make use of in the school be expose all at once and at all time then there would be such a multiplicity of object before the eye of the child that they attention would not be fix by any of they they would look at they all at first with wonder and surprise but in a short time the picture would cease to attract notice and consequently the child would think no more of they than they would of the paper that cover the room to prevent this and to excite a desire for information it be always necessary to keep some behind and to let very few object appear at one time when the child understand in some measure the subject before they these may be replace by other and so on successively until the whole have be see some person have object to the picture of christ be represent in the human form allege that it be calculate to make the child think he be a mere man only and have think it better that be should not be represent at all the man that undertake to please all will soon find out he mistake and therefore be must do the best he can and leave the objector to please themselves yet it be a great pity little child should suffer from the ill-grounded objection of those who can not do better on visit a school take notice of the picture hang about if they be dusty and have not the appearance of be well-used be sure that the committee have never see a good infant school or that the teacher have never be properly train and therefore do not know how to use they chapter xvi on teaching by object _ object board -- utility of this method _ \* \* \* \* \* the eye will greatly aid the ear \* \* \* \* \* as i have before say that it be we object to teach the child from object in preference to book i will mention a method we adopt for the accomplishment of this purpose it consist of a number of board of which and of they use the follow description will convey a accurate idea the board be about sixteen inch square and a quarter of a inch thick : wainscot be the best as it do not warp these will go into the groove of the lesson post : there should be about twenty article on each board or twenty-five just as it suit the conductor of the school there should be the same quantity of thing on each board in order that all the child may finish at one time this will not be the case if there be more object on one board than another i will give a account of a few of we board and that must suffice or i shall exceed the limit i have prescribe to myself the first board contain a small piece of gold in its rough state a piece of gold in its manufactured state a piece of silver in both state a piece of copper in both state a piece of brass in both state a piece of iron in both state a piece of steel in both state a piece of tinfoil a piece of solder a screw a clasp nail a clout nail a hob nail a spike nail a sparable and a tack these article be all on one board and the monitor put he pointer to each article and tell he little pupil they name and encourage they to repeat the name after he when they finish at one post they go to the next the next board may contain a piece of hemp a piece of rope a piece of string a piece of bag a piece of sack a piece of canvass a piece of hessian a piece of scotch sheet a piece of unbleached linen a piece of bleached linen a piece of diaper linen a piece of dye linen a piece of flax a piece of thread a piece of yarn a piece of tick a piece of raw silk a piece of twisted silk a piece of wove silk figure a piece of white plain sill and a piece of dye silk a piece of ribbon a piece of silk cord a piece of silk velvet & c the next may contain raw cotton cotton yarn sew cotton unbleached calico bleached calico dimity jean fustian velveteen gause nankeen gingham bed furniture print calico marseille flannel baise stuff woollen cloth and wool worst white black and mixed the next may contain milled board paste board bristol card brown paper white paper of various sort white sheep skin yellow sheep tan sheep purple sheep glaze sheep red sheep calf skin cow hide goat skin kid seal pig leather seal skin wash leather beaver & c the next may contain about twenty-five of those wood animal which be import into this country and be to be have at the foreign toy warehouse some of they be carve exceedingly well and appear very like the real animal the next may contain mahogany and the various kind of wood the next may contain pruning of the various fruit tree all about a inch long or a inch square the next may contain the different small article of ironmongery needle pin cutlery small tool and every other object that can be obtain small enough for the purpose the lesson be to be put in the lesson-post the same as the picture lesson and the article be either glue or fasten on the board with screw or wax thread i would have dry leave provide such as a oak leaf a elm leaf a ash leaf & c & c the leaf of ever-green should be keep separate these will enable a judicious instructor to communicate a great variety of valuable information on some thing connect with such instruction i find i arrive at the same conclusion as pestalozzus though i have never read he work and for some year after my first effort do not know that such a person exist i mean however to give my view on teaching by object more fully in a work i hope soon to prepare to be entitle the infant teacher in the nursery and the school the utility of this mode of teaching must be obvious for if the child meet with any of those term in a book which they be read they _ understand they immediately _ which would not be the case unless they have see the _ object _ the most intellectual person would not be able to call thing by they _ proper name _ much less describe they unless he have be teach or hear some other person call they by they right name and we generally learn more by mix with society than ever we could do at school : these sort of lesson person can make themselves and they will last for many year and help to lay a foundation for thing of more importance i be convince the day be not far distant when a museum will be consider necessary to be attach to every first rate school for the instruction of child sight be the most direct inlet for knowledge whatever we have see make a much stronger impression upon we perception be the first power of mind which be bring into action and the one make use of with most ease and pleasure for this reason object lesson be indispensable in a infant school consist both of real substance and of picture the first lesson in paradise be of this kind and we ought therefore to draw instruction from it and out of the ground the lord god form every beast of the field and every fowl of the air and bring they to adam to see what he would call they : and whatsoever adam call every living creature that be the name of it chapter xvii physical education _ exercise -- various position -- exercise blended with instruction -- arithmetical and geometrical amusement _ \* \* \* \* \* would you make infant happy give they variety for novelty have charm that we mind can hardly withstand \* \* \* \* \* as a infant school may be regard in the light of a combination of the school and nursery the _ art of please _ form a prominent part in the system and as little child be very apt to be fretful it become expedient to divert as well as teach there if child of two year old and under be not divert they will naturally cry for they mother : and to have ten or twelve child cry in the school it be very obvious would put every thing into confusion but it be possible to have two hundred or even three hundred child assemble together the eldest not more than six year of age and yet not to hear one of they cry for a whole day indeed i may appeal to the numerous and respectable person who have visit infant school for the truth of this assertion many of whom have declare in my hearing that they could not have conceive it possible that such a number of little child could be assemble together and all be so happy as they have find they the greater part of they be so very young i can assure the reader that many of the child who have cry heartily on be send to school the first day or two have cry as much on be keep at home after they have be in the school but a very short time : and i be of opinion that when child be absent it be generally the fault of the parent i have have child come to school without they breakfast because it have not be ready other have come to school without shoe because they would not be keep at home while they shoe be mend and i have have other come to school half dress whose parent have be either at work or gossipping and who when they have return home have think that they child be lose but to they great surprise and joy when they have apply at the school they have find they there need any thing more be advance than these fact to prove that it be not school or the acquirement of knowledge that be disagreeable to child but the system of injudicious instruction there pursued child be anxious to acquire knowledge and nothing can be more congenial to they taste than association with those of they own age but we ought not to wonder that little child should dislike to go to school when as in most of the dame ' school forty or fifty or perhaps more be assemble together in one room scarcely large enough for one-third of that number and be not allow to speak to or scarcely look at each other in those place i firmly believe many for the want of proper exercise become cripple or have they health much injure by be keep sit so many hour but as child 's health be of the greatest consequence it become necessary to remedy this evil by let they have proper exercise combine as much as possible with instruction to accomplish which many measure have be try but i have find the follow to be the most successful the child be desire to sit on they seat with they foot out straight and to shut each hand and then order to count a hundred or as many as may be think proper lifting up each hand every time they count one and bring each hand down again on they knee when they count another the child have give this the name of blacksmith and when ask why they call it blacksmith they answer because they hammer they knee with they fist in the same way as the blacksmith hammer he iron with a hammer when they have arrive at hundred -lrb- which they never fail to let you know by give a extra shout -rrb- they may be order to stand up and bring into action the joint of the knee and thigh they be desire to add up one hundred two at a time which they do by lift up each foot alternately all the child count at one time say two four six eight ten twelve and so on by this mean every part of the body be put in motion and it likewise have this advantage that by lift up each foot every time they keep good time a thing very necessary as unless this be the case all must be confusion they also add up three at a time by the same method thus three six nine twelve fifteen eighteen and so on but care must be take not to keep they too long at one thing or too long in one position thus exercise the elbow joint by push they out and draw they back as far as possible come here my dear boy look at baby 's two hand and he two little foot upon which baby stand two thumb and eight finger together make ten five toe on each foot the same number again two arm and two shoulder two elbow two wrist now bind up you knuckle make two little fist two leg and two ancle two knee and two hip he finger and toe have all nail on they tip with he hand and he foot he can run jump and crawl he can dance walk or caper or play with he ball take you hoop or you cart and have a good race and that will soon give you a fine rosy face oh what would my boy do without he two hand and he two little foot upon which baby stand they be the gift of kind heaven for you to enjoy then be thankful to heaven my dear little boy have do a lesson or two this way they be desire to put they arm out straight and to say one and one be two two and one be three three and one be four four and one be five five and one be six six and two be eight and in this way they go on until they be desire to stop it should be observe that all _ graceful _ action may be adopt i be sorry to find from visit to various school that the movement of the child have degenerate into buffoonery they have be allow to put themselves into the most ridiculous posture and have thus raise objection which would not otherwise have be urge as however the whole infant system be design to make the _ child think _ i would urge the _ teacher _ to guard against they be automaton let they mark every impropriety with promptitude and correct it with judgment i have specify these method not as be the only one practicable or fit to be adopt but merely as hint to the judicious teacher who will doubtless think of many other conducive to the same end : and the more he can diversify they the better it be the combination of amusement with instruction which in my opinion render the system so successful and unimportant or improper even as it may appear to some be of more real service in the management of young child than all the method of restraint and coercion which have be hitherto but too generally pursue the child may also learn the penny and multiplication table by form themselves into circle around a number of young tree where such be plant in the play-ground for the sake of order each class should have its own particular tree that when they be order to the tree every child may know which tree to go to as soon as they be assemble around the tree they be to join hand and walk round every child say the multiplication table until they have finish it they then let go hand and put they behind and for variety 's sake sing the penny table the alphabet hymn & c & c thus the child be gradually improve and delight for they call it play and it be of little consequence what they call it so long as they be edify exercise and make happy this plan be calculate to impress the lesson on they memory and be adapt for fine weather when they can go out to play as it be call but as in wet or snowy weather they can not go out of the school we then have recourse to the mode previously mention besides it be necessary that child should have exercise in winter as well as in summer in wet as well as in dry weather for this purpose we have several swing in the school-room make of cord only on which the child be allow to swing two at a time the time that they be permit to be on the swing be accord to what they have to repeat if it be the penny table they say -- twenty penny be one and eightpence that we can not afford to lose thirty penny be two and sixpence that will buy a pair of shoe forty penny be three and fourpence that be pay for certain fee fifty penny be four and twopence that will buy five pound of cheese sixty penny will make five shilling which we learn be just a crown seventy penny be five and tenpence this be know throughout the town eighty penny be six and eightpence i 'll always try to think of that ninety penny be seven and sixpence this will buy a beaver hat a hundred penny be eight and fourpence which be teach in th ' infant school eight penny more make just nine shilling so we end this pretty rule -lrb- a -rrb- -lrb- footnote a : a covered play-ground be desirable where practicable -rrb- as soon as the table be thus go through the child who be on the swing get off and other supply they place until probably the penny table have be say twenty time then we go on with the multiplication table until the child have repeat as far as six time six be thirty-six when the child on the swing get off and be succeed by two more on each swing they then commence the other part of the table beginning at six time seven be forty-two until they have finish the table during this time it should be bear in mind that all the child be learn not only those on the swing but those who be sit in the school and it be surprising to see with what alacrity the child will dispatch they other lesson when it be a wet day in order to get to the swing in addition to the knowledge acquire by this method it be admirably calculate to try they courage many little boy and girl who at first be afraid to get on the swing will soon swing stand on one leg and perform other feat with the greatest dexterity at once show they increase courage and greater activity we generally let four or five child come to a swing and those that can seat themselves first be entitle to the first turn for they be never lift on in the anxiety to get on the swing some of they will perhaps get out of temper especially those who be not discipline but when this be detect they be not allow to swing that day which soon make they good-natured to each other and very cautious not to get into a passion thus in some degree they bad temper be correct which be very desirable it be a current remark that bad workman find fault with the tool and lazy teacher find fault with the swing because they must perpetually watch the child we be so tinctured with the old plan of _ rivetting _ the child to _ seat _ that i despair of ever see the opposite plan become general in my time as soon as two child be seat on each swing to preserve order the other retire -lrb- generally speak -rrb- in the greatest good humor to they seat some will i know be apt to exclaim surely this be encouraging and foster bad feeling -- create enmity and ill-will amongst the child but i say no it be teach they to feel a spirit of generous emulation as distinguishable from that of ill-nature or envy beside the swing in many school they have a very useful addition to the play-ground i mean the gymnastic pole although it be most proper for the master in the play-ground to relax altogether the brow of magisterial severity yet there be no occasion for he to withdraw the influence of love he will not prove a check to the enjoyment of the child if enter into the spirit of they innocent pastime he endeavor to heighten they pleasure by a judicious direction of they sport among other amusement which he ingenuity may suggest i would mention a geometrical amusement which be very practicable first let a certain number of child stand in a row opposite to these let one or more child be place as director to order the change of figure a straight line we will suppose be the first thing show by the position of the child the next thing to be form be a _ curve _ by the advancement of each end then a half-circle -- a circle by join hand in a ring -- two equal parallel line by the division of the number in action next a square -- triangle & c & c these change may either be make at the command of the master or as we before propose of one or more child act as officer to direct these geometrical movement have it be constantly bear in memory that god be the creator of the body of a child as well as of its mind and that the healthy action of both be requisite for happiness and usefulness more attention would have be pay to the due and proper exercise of child than have hitherto be do he have implant a instinctive impulse to activity in every young child which display itself in almost incessant motion where there be perfect health and when there be opportunity to restrain this unnecessarily be therefore to act in opposition to the law of nature and the end must be a certain injury to the child to prevent this evil and to act in obedience to these law the various action of clap the hand folding the arm twist the fist and various other motion have be introduce by these mean a spirit of restlessness which would undoubtedly show itself under unnecessary restraint be convert into a motive of obedience and thus even a moral influence be produce by what would appear a mere childish play they may all be go through with elegance and propriety : and no rude or indelicate action should be allow many master be too free in make a show of these exercise to visitor who be perhaps amuse with they but this be to divert they from they proper use they be only invent to be introduce at interval when the child 's attention begin to flag or to give they that proper exercise which they tender age require how have everything connect with the infant system be burlesque and thus sensible person have be lead to despise infant education which if rightly understand by they would be see to be one of the most powerful moral engine that can be put into action for the welfare of we fellow-creature especially of the poorer class chapter viii music _ infant ditty -- song on natural history -- moral lesson in verse -- influence of music in softening of the feeling -- illustrative anecdote _ \* \* \* \* \* music have charm \* \* \* \* \* music have be find a most important means of _ mental _ and _ moral _ improvement its application take place from my find a great difficulty in teach some child especially the younger one to sound they letter and hence i determine to set the alphabet to a simple tune i sing it frequently to the child when they be low or dispirited and although none attempt the same sound at first i have the satisfaction of observe unusual attention my next effort be very injudicious for i urge on they the imitation of these sound before they be actually capable of so do and hence as more reflection would have shew only discordance arise have tell they then to listen _ only _ as they do at first i soon discover that have learn the tune through the proper organ -- the ear they be able to imitate it with the voice we then by the same means mark the distinction between vowel and consonant with a tune that be longer and rather more difficult as the monitor always point out the letter in succession while the child be sing attention be excite and secure and error effectually prevent as correct time and tune could not be keep unless every child sing the right letter success as to the alphabet lead to the adoption of music in the teaching of arithmetic this be available in two way first by combine with it physical exercise and then by task the faculty of observation the former be effect as follow : the child sing one be the half of two two be the half of four three be the half of six & c & c and then bring one hand down on the other alternately without however make too much noise so as to interrupt the time the latter be accomplish by the arithmeticon which have already be explain a few specimen of the ditty thus use shall now be give and several other both hymn and moral song be to be find in the manual recently publish by myself in conjunction with a friend four season for human life we day four season be at most and infancy 's the time of spring oh with what trouble care and cost must we be teach to pray and sing in summer as we growth proceed good fruit should hang on every branch we root be clear would from evil weed as into knowledge we advance we autumn be the season when temptation do we mind assail we fruit be prove in manhood then let not sin death and hell prevail for winter bring old age and death if we have good fruit lay up in store soon as we gasp we latest _ breath _ we land on a _ triumphant shore _ four season of the year on march the twenty-first be spring when little bird begin to sing begin to build and hatch they brood and carefully provide they food summer 's the twenty-first of June the cuckoo change then he tune all nature smile the field look gay the weather 's fair to make the hay September on the twenty-third when sportsman mark at ev'ry bird autumn come in the field be shear the fruit be ripe so be the corn winter 's cold frost and northern blast the season be we mention last the date of which in _ truth _ we must fix for December -- twenty-first five sens all human being must -lrb- with bird and beast -rrb- to be complete five sens have at least : the sense of hear to the ear 's confine the eye we know for see be design would the nose to smell a odour sweet or ill the tongue to taste what will the belly fill the sense of feeling be in every part while life give motion to a beating heart the master 's daily advice to he school if you would in wisdom 's way proceed you intellectual knowledge need let science be you guide star or from its path you 'll wander far ` tis science that direct the mind the path of happiness to find if _ goodness _ add be to _ truth _ ` twill bring reward to every youth the good child 's money-box all penny by the generous deposit here when holiday come i will equally share among all good child attend this school i should wish not to find a dunce or a fool then listen all you who a prize hope to gain attend to you book and you 'll not hope in vain the master the cow come child listen to I now and you shall hear about the cow you 'll find she useful live or dead whether she be black or white or red when milk-maids milk she morn and night she give they milk so fresh and white and this we little child think be very nice for we to drink the curdled milk they press and squeeze and so they make it into cheese the cream they skim and shake in churn and then it soon to butter turn and when she be dead she flesh be good for _ beef _ be we true english food but though ` twill make we brave and strong to eat too much we know be wrong she skin with lime and bark together the tanner tan and make it leather and without _ that _ what should we do for sole to every boot or shoe the shoemaker cut it with he knife and bind the top be by he wife and then he nail it to the last and after sew it tight and fast the hair that grow upon she back be take whether white or black and mix would with mortar short or long which make it very firm and strong the plast ` rer spread it with a tool and this you 'll find be just the rule and when he be spread it tight and fast i be sure it many year will last and last of all if cut with care she horn make comb to comb we hair and so we learn -- thanks to we teacher that cow be good and useful creature the sheep hark now to I and silence keep and we will talk about the sheep for sheep be harmless and we know that on they back the wool do grow the sheep be take once a year and plunge in water clean and clear and there they swim but never bite while man do wash they clean and white and then they take they fat or lean clip off the wool both short and clean and this be call would we understand shear the sheep throughout the land and then they take the wool so white and pack it up in bag quite tight and then they take those bag so full and sell to man that deal in wool the wool be wash would and comb would with hand then it be spin with wheel and band and then with shuttle very soon weave into cloth within the loom the cloth be first send to be dye then it be wash would and press would and dry the tailor then cut out with care the clothes that man and boy do wear the horse come child let we now discourse about the pretty noble horse and then you soon will plainly see how very useful he must be he draw the coach so fine and smart and likewise drag the loaded cart along the road or up the hill though then he task be harder still upon he back man ride with ease he carry they just where they please and though it should be many a mile he get there in a little while with saddle on he back they sit and manage he with rein and bit the whip and spur they use also when they would have he faster go and be the weather cold or hot as they may wish he 'll walk or trot or if to make more haste they need will gallop with the greatest speed when dead he shine skin they use as leather for we boot and shoe alive or dead then thus we see how useful still the horse must be the dog the cow the sheep the horse have long be make the subject of we song but there be many creature yet whose merit we must not forget and first the dog so good to guard he master 's cottage house or yard -- dishonest man away to keep and guard we safely while we sleep for if at midnight still and dark strange step he hear with angry bark he bid he master wake and see if thief or honest folk they be at home abroad obedient still he only guide he master 's will before he step or by he side he run or walk with joy and pride he run to fetch the stick or ball return obedient to the call content and pleased if he but gain a single pat for all he pain but whilst he merit thus we praise pleased with he character and way this let we learn as well we may to love we teacher and obey moral lesson -lrb- a -rrb- -lrb- footnote a : the follow tale though not adapt for the younger child of a infant school and too long to be commit to memory by the elder one might be read to such by the master and would serve as a admirable theme for conversation it be likewise well adapt as a tale for family

be able to play on the violin flute or clarionet but as he must speak much the former be to be prefer such be the influence of the weather that child be almost always dull on dull day and then a little music be of great advantage on wet day when they can not go into the play-ground it assist they in keep the step when they march it cheer and animate they spirit and in some measure compensate for they privation it will also aid various evolution music may be employ moreover to soften the feeling curb the passion and improve the temper and it be strange that it should not have be employ till the operation of the infant system to which it be absolutely indispensable when for instance after a trial by jury as explain in a former page the child have be dispose to harshness and severity a soft and plaintive melody have produce a different decision to recite one case when i be organize the dry-gate school in glasgow -lrb- a -rrb- a little girl in the gallery have lose of she ear-ring -lrb- which by the way like bead be a very improper appendage and ought by all means to be discourage -rrb- and on discover the fact commence a most piteous lamentation i make inquiry for it immediately while the child be seat in the gallery but in vain and i subsequently find it in the hand of a little girl at the bottom who be attentively examine it and who give it I the moment it be demand on ask the child what be to be do in this case they say she should have a pat of the hand i then show that have she intend to steal it she would have secrete it which she do not and that she attention be so absorb by it that she have not hear my inquiry but one little boy be not satisfied he say she ken right weel it be nae she ain but after sing a simple and touching air i be please to find he opinion change perhaps sir he say ye may as weel forgie she this ance as she be but a wee thing -lrb- footnote a : this school have since become a very important normal school from which many other have emanate the head master be the one i originally instruct : mr stowe also one of the director have apply the principle of the infant school system to the instruction of older child which be call stowe 's training system be apply to juvenile with great success i know of no school except the dublin normal school equal to those and of no master superior to those i have see who have be teach there -rrb- the music choose for child should be easy and simple fluent and vary hymn tune should be of a rather lively character as the more dull and sombrous be not well adapt to the infant ear air for the table or exercise song be require to be very cheerful and inspiring and then they tend to excite pleasure and liveliness which should often be aim at in a infant school as child take much interest in singing and readily learn verse by heart so as to sing they although not properly instruct in they meaning or rightly understand they singing have be consider by many person the soul of the system this be a grievous error as regard the intellectual advancement of the child and still worse as regard they health and that of the teacher i have at time enter school as a visitor when the mistress have immediately make the child show off by singing in succession a dozen piece as if they be a musical box thus to sing without bound be a very likely way to bring the mistress to a early grave and injure the lung of the dear little child use as not abuse be the proper rule tar all the new mode of teaching and amusing child that i have introduce but it have often appear to I that abuse it as much as possible be the rule act upon call upon the first singer of the day to sing in this manner and where would they soon be chapter xix grammar _ method of instruction -- grammatical rhyme _ \* \* \* \* \* a few month ago mr -- give he little daughter h -- a child of five year old she first lesson in english grammar but no alarming book of grammar be produce on the occasion nor do the father put on a unpropitious gravity of countenance he explain to the smile child the nature of a verb a pronoun and a substantive -- _ edgeworth _ \* \* \* \* \* it have be well observe that grammar be the first thing teach and the last learn now though it be not my purpose to pretend that i can so far simplify grammar as to make all its rule comprehensible to child so young as those find in infant school i do think that enough may be impart to they to render the matter more comprehensible than it be usually find to be in after year the great mystery of grammar result in my opinion from not make the child acquaint with the thing of which the word use be the sign and moreover from the use of a number of hard word which the child repeat without understand for instance in the classification of word or the part of speech as they be call _ noun substantive _ and _ adjective _ convey as term no idea to the mind of child and in spite of the definition by which they import be explain remain to they as unintelligible as the language of magical incantation that the child can easily comprehend the difference between word which express the name of thing and those which express they quality and between word which express action and those which express the nature of those action be undeniable and this be just what should be teach in a infant school in the first place let the child be accustom to repeat the name of thing not of any certain number of thing set down on a lesson card or in a book but of any thing and every thing in the school-room play-ground & c : next let they be exercise in tell something relate to those thing -- _ they quality _ as for instance the school-room be _ large clean _ & c -- the child be _ quiet good attentive _ & c -- the picture be _ pretty _ : the play-ground be _ pleasant _ & c have accustom the child in this manner first to give you the _ name _ of thing and then to observe and repeat something respect they -- you have gain two end you have first teach the child to be observant and discriminative and secondly you have teach they to distinguish two distinct class of word or _ name _ and _ quality _ and you may now if you please give they term by which to distinguish these respective class viz _ substantive _ and _ adjective _ they will no longer be mysterious word signify nothing but recognize sign by which the child will understand and express definite idea the next thing you have to teach they be the distinction betwixt singular and plural and if you think proper masculine and feminine but before you talk to the child about _ plural number _ and _ masculine gender _ & c let they be make acquaint with the reality of which these hard-sounding word be the sign have make the classification of word clear and comprehensible you next proceed to the second grand class of word the verb and they adjunct the _ adverb _ with these you will proceed as with the former let action be distinguish by word -- the child _ walk play read eat run _ master _ laugh frown speak sing _ and so on let the child find they own example then come the demand from the master for word express the manner of action how do the child _ walk -- slowly quickly orderly _ how do they _ read eat run _ how do the master _ laugh speak sing _ the child now find you adverb and it will be quite time enough to give they term for the classification they thus intuitively make when they have a clear idea of what they be do when this end be attain you child have some idea of grammar and those clear one there be no occasion to stop here proceed but slowly and in the same method the tense of the verb and the subdivision into active passive and neuter will require the greatest care and attention which the teacher can use to simplify they sufficiently for the child 's comprehension as it will likewise enable they to understand the nature and office of the other class of word as however it be not my intention to write a grammar here but merely to throw out a few hint on the subject i shall leave the further development of the plan to the ingenuity of those who may think fit to adopt its principle as above lay down english grammar doth we teach that it have nine part of speech -- article adjective and noun verb conjunction and pronoun with preposition and adverb and interjection as i have hear the letter be just twenty-six these form all word when rightly mix would the vowel be a e o i with u and sometimes w and y without the little vowel ' aid no word or syllable be make but consonant the rest we call and so of these we have mention would all three little word we often see be article -- _ a a _ and _ the _ a noun 's the name of any thing -- as _ school _ or _ garden hoop _ or _ swing _ adjective tell the kind of noun -- as _ great small pretty white _ or _ brown _ instead of noun the pronoun stand john 's head _ he _ face _ my _ arm _ you _ hand verb tell of something be do -- to _ read write count sing jump _ or _ run _ how thing be do the adverb tell -- as _ slowly quickly ill _ or _ well _ conjunction join the noun together -- as man _ and _ child wind _ or _ weather a preposition stand before a noun as _ in _ or _ through _ a door the interjection show surprise -- as _ oh _ how pretty _ ah _ how wise the whole be call nine part of speech which read write speak teach the article three little word we hear and see in frequent use _ a a _ and _ the _ these word so useful though so small be those which article we call the first two _ a _ and _ a _ we use when speaking of one thing alone for instance we might wish to say a _ oak _ a _ man _ a _ dog _ a _ bone _ _ the _ speak of either one or more -- the cow the cow the pig the pig the plum the plum -lrb- you like a score -rrb- the pear the pear the fig the fig a oak a man mean _ any _ oak or _ any _ man of all mankind a dog a bone mean _ any _ dog or _ any _ bone a dog may find this article we only use whenever it may be we wish to speak of some determine thing as thus -- _ the _ bird _ the _ ox _ the _ fish by which we mean not _ any _ bird that fly in the air may be or _ any _ ox amongst the herd or _ any _ fish in stream or sea but some one certain bird or ox or fish -lrb- let it be which it may -rrb- of which we be speak or of which we something mean to write or say remember these thing when you see the little word a a and the these word so useful though so small be those which article we call nothing can be more absurd than to compel young child to commit to memory mere abstract rule express in difficult and technical language such require a painful effort of the mind and one calculate to give a disgust against learn _ grammar be form on language and not language by grammar _ and from this it necessarily follow that child should acquire a considerable store of word from a knowledge of reading and of thing before they mind be tax by abstract rule to be thoroughly understand they require word to be compare with word and one word to be compare with another and how can this be do without the memory be amply supply with they previously such simple instruction as this chapter direct may easily be give but to attempt much more would be like endeavor to build a elegant and ornamental structure before you have collect material to build with chapter xx the elliptical plan of teaching _ method explain -- its success _ \* \* \* \* \* he try each art -- _ goldsmith _ \* \* \* \* \* all person acquaint with child be aware of the torpor of some mind and of the occasional apathy of other and to this it be necessary to provide some counteraction this be do effectually by what be call the elliptical plan accord to which word be omit in a narrative or poem repeat by the teacher for the purpose of be supply by the child these exercise be very agreeable to the child and by they some feature of the mental character become conspicuous child be usually sensible of they need of instruction but if they can make it appear that any of they statement be original they delight be especially manifest there seem too a dislike at first to take any trouble to arrive at the truth careless child will therefore guess several time but a observant teacher will at once perceive that there be no effort of the understanding point it out to the child and thus prevent its recurrence dr gilchrist observe in a letter send to I you have now the whole method before you and i shall boldly stake all my hard-earned fame as a practical orientalist on the salutary consequence that will spring from the adoption of short elliptical tale at you interesting institution my usual practice with respect to the elliptical method of teaching be to deliver some appropriate simple extemporaneous tale leave out but few word at first and those such as must obviously strike the child as they get use to the plan i make the omission more frequent and of word less obvious the follow

\* \* although it have be the special design of the present work to speak of the first effort of _ art _ in assist the proper development of the mental and moral faculty i shall take the liberty of indulge in a few remark on the method at present adopt in the more advanced stage of education as see in we national and Sunday school i need i be sure offer no other apology for so do than the fact that it be in these institution the infant poor must complete they education it be in these school the bud faculty must either ripen or perish and the moral principle become confirm or weaken certain i be that it be the wish of all concern in these praiseworthy institution _ to do they best _ for the attainment of this object -- the welfare and improvement of the rise generation of the poor class and therefore i the less reluctantly offer a few thought on the subject which it be my humble opinion may not be altogether useless with regard to national school i must say there be too much form and too little of the spirit of instruction to be find in they management : the minor faculty be attend to in preference to the higher one it be the memory alone which be call into action the understanding be suffer to lie in a state of torpid inactivity they lesson they plan of use they and they discipline altogether be of that monotonous nature that the child always seem to I to be dosing over they i know it will be plead that the number to be teach at once render this defect unavoidable that it be impossible to teach a large body of child in such a way as to secure the attention and activity of the whole and it be so far true as to its be impossible to detect and reform every idle pupil who find a opportunity of indulge he idleness in the divide attention of he teacher but i do think if it be impossible to cure the evil it may be in a great degree prevent make you system interesting lively and inspiriting and you scholar will neither be able nor willing to slumber over it every one know what a effect be produce on the physical faculty by a succession of the same sound for instance by the long continued chiming of a single bell it induce a drowsiness which we find it impossible to resist except by turn we attention to another thing but let a number of bell strike out into a merry peal how quickly we be arouse how lively we become whilst they various _ change _ secure the attention and interest which they pleasing and spirited tone first excite and just so it be with the mind in the matter of education you must give a variety of tone a newness of aspect to you lesson or you will never be able to keep up a lively attention in you scholar for this purpose i would particularly recommend to the attention of all concern the chapter in this volume on geometry conversation picture and likewise that on the elliptical method by adopt the plan recommend in these chapter the child will have something to do and to do that something they must be _ active _ the first object of the teacher be to excite a thirst for knowledge not to pour unwelcome information into the mind it will probably be say that however well adapt the plan recommend may be for the infantine scholar for whom it be design yet it do not follow that it may be equally advantageous for those of a more advanced age and if by this it be mean that the very same lesson & c be not equally applicable in both case i perfectly agree with the truth of the objection but it be the _ principle _ of education that i recommend and would affirm to be as applicable to child of the most advanced age as to those of the youngest and i may further add that unless this be do these school will not be in a proper state to receive we child so as to carry on the cultivation of all the faculty instead of the memory only it be not sufficient to store the memory we must give employment to the understand it be not sufficient to talk to the child of piety and of goodness we must present they with a living example of both and secure as far as possible a imitation of such example as applicable to Sunday school i would particularly recommend the use of picture lesson on scripture subject for the use of the junior class to be use as a sort of text for conversation suit to the state of they mental faculty i be convince that the knowledge acquire by this method be likely to make a deeper and more lasting impression than that impart in a less interesting mode nor should the lesson on natural history be neglect in my humble opinion in the system of Sunday school instruction inasmuch as the more the child know of the wonder of creation the greater must be they reverence of the almighty creator in addition to which it will enable the teacher to supply variety a thing so agreeable and indeed indispensable in the instruction of child for these reason i think it could not justly be consider as either a misemployment or profanation of the sabbath-day for the elder child moreover it would be advisable to have occasional class lecture simplify for the purpose on astronomy natural history & c and although it might be unadvisable to occupy the hour of the sabbath-day with the delivery of they they might be give on some week-day evening and should be make the medium of reward to good behavior such child as have misbehave themselves be proscribe from attend when thus see in the light of a privilege they would not fail to be interesting to the little auditor as well as conducive to good behavior Sunday school should not be too large nor should child remain in they too long i have observe some instance when this have be neglect of choice be make and connection form which must be often very prejudicial it be with some degree of reluctance and apprehension i touch upon another topic -- that of religious doctrine as school for gratuitous instruction have be establish by most of the religious sect extant it be obvious that some dissimilarity of sentiment on religion subject must exist as impart in such school let it not be suppose that i would cast a censure on any religious body for establish a school devote to such a bless purpose on the contrary i rejoice to see that however various they theory may be they opinion of christian practice as evince in such action be the same but one thing i would say to each and to all let a prominence be give to those fundamental truth of love and goodness which christianity inculcate let the first sound of religion which salute the ear of infancy be that heavenly proclamation which astonish and enrapture the ear of the wakeful shepherd peace on earth and good-will towards man it be the herald-cry by which salvation be usher into the world and surely no other can be so proper for introduce it into the mind of child i must candidly own that i have occasionally witness a greater desire to teach particular doctrine than the simple and beautiful truth which form the spirit of religion and it be against this practice i have presume to raise a dissentient voice the conductor of school in connexion with the british and foreign school society have generally speak more highly of the infant system than other and this be certainly to be attribute to more congeniality since in they the mental power be more fully exercise and there be a greater variety in the instruction give the only objection i can discover to they be one that lie equally against the national school -- i mean the opportunity afford for monitorial oppression but this may be obviate in both case by the judgment and vigilance of the teacher it should be add that school of both kind demand occasional inspection from those intimately acquaint with the system avowedly adopt as they appear very different in different place i will only mention further on this topic that many school be too large no infant school i conceive should exceed 200 nor should a national or british and foreign school exceed 400 when under the care of one master one half of these number would be much better than the whole and tend greatly to the success of the school but fund be so difficult to raise from the apathy show by person in general to the instruction of the poor and therefore the school be so few in number that it be absolutely requisite to place as great a number of child as possible under one master that expense may be save when will this sad state of thing be change and the country at large see that the noblest object it can ever attempt be to rear up its whole population to intelligence virtue and piety in conclusion i would observe that as the foregoing remark have be kindly make in such a manner it be my hope they will all be receive it be most gratifying to I to be able to add that since the above remark be write great improvement have be make in national school a large portion of the public attention have be lately draw to the subject and it be almost universally admit that the present system be capable of considerable improvement this must be gratify to those person who have bear the heat and burthen of the day the national society be take measure to improve they system and also by form diocesan society to establish normal school for the instruction of teacher on improve principle throughout the country i would to god the church of england have do this long ago she would have have fewer enemy and could now have put on a bolder front i trust in god that even now it be not too late and that circumstance may transpire to render she effort in this sacred cause doubly effective she have lately make a noble stand in defense of principle this will have its proper effect but she must not stop there for the enemy be in the field and though he be quiet for a time the many-headed dragon be not crush the utmost vigilance will be necessary to counteract the wiliness of the serpent real improvement in education must be adopt the book use in she school must be revise and improve a larger amount of knowledge must be give to the poorer portion of she son and then a beneficial reaction will not be far distant she have do much but she have much more to do if she do not pre-occupy the ground there be other that will dependence upon the divine will sound discretion and christian principle must be she guide goodness must be she fortress and truth she finger post and then i for one perceive that she will not fail for the bulk of she people be still favourable to she and will rise up in she defense when they assistance be require and if i mistake not the sign of the time there will be work for the think portion of the laity soon cut out work which i fear the clergy can not or will not do but which nevertheless must be do god grant that it may be do well whoever may be

person eminent by they charitable act and who express themselves generally desirous of aid in any plan which may contribute to the improvement and happiness of the poorer class have nevertheless be unwilling to assist in the establishment of infant school fearful that the superior method pursue in these school should render the child educate therein much better inform than the child of the richer class who might thus be supplant in numerous lucrative and honorable situation in after-life from this circumstance one of the two follow conclusion must be draw either that the system of education pursue in the higher school be very faulty and imperfect or that the fear of those person be entire groundless if the first be true then it can not be deny that the consequence fear by the richer class must necessarily take place if either from prejudice or apathy they continue the same faulty and imperfect method of education which by the expression of these fear they positively declare be usually pursue in the higher school but the remedy be easy let the same good principle of tuition be introduce into nursery and into those school to which the child of the rich be send and the latter will not fail to maintain they patrimonial rank in society they need then have no fear least the poorer class should become too intellectual but on the contrary they will soon find that they own welfare security and happiness will not only be insure but will increase in proportion as the poorer class gain knowledge for by the method of instruction pursue in the _ infant school _ the knowledge there acquire be necessarily accompany by the practice of industry sobriety honesty benevolence and mutual kindness in fine by all the moral and religious virtue that the system of instruction recommend in the foregoing page be equally applicable to the child of the rich as to those of the poor there can be no doubt and it might be adopt either in school establish on its principle or in the nursery it be indeed obvious that it might be carry to a much greater extent where the means of so do would not be want many thing might be teach which it be neither advisable nor practicable to teach in the school establish for the instruction of poor child whilst the element of number form and language may be teach by the means and after the manner recommend in the precede chapter on the respective subject there be other branch of knowledge which might enter into the scope of nursery instruction with great advantage to the child as a introduction to _ botany _ i would make the child acquaint with the progress of vegetation _ not from word but from observation _ i would have three or four garden-pot fill with mould introduce into the nursery at a proper season of the year the child should be ask what be in the pot -- dirt or mould will of course be the reply they should then be shewn the seed which be to be deposit in the mould and assume in the eye of the child a prophetic character the mother or governess should inform they of the process of vegetation and that about a certain time a pretty flower will make its appearance in the pot : the seed should then be deposit in the mould and the pot place in a proper situation it would not be improper to let the child themselves sow the seed thus convince they of they power of be useful and become the instrument of so great a wonder as the transformation of a seed into a flower during the time the seed be lie unperceived beneath the mould the child should frequently be send to look if the pretty flower have come up or question as to what they be tell concern it at length the green shoot will make its appearance just peep above the mould to the no small surprise and gratification of the little observer they will mark with attentive eagerness the progress of its growth the appearance of the bud and the gradual development of the pretty flower till they be fully convince of the wisdom of the parent or teacher who foretell all which have happen and make acquaint with the process of vegetation not from word but from observation certain it be that such a lesson could not be wholly useless in the first place it might be make the means of impress they with idea of the almighty power highly conducive to piety secondly it would beget a habit of observation thirdly it would be likely to produce a love of flower and the vegetable world favourable to they future pursuit in the science of botany and lastly it would inspire they little breast with a love and respect for the parent or teacher who be wise and kind enough to teach they so many true and wonderful thing as a efficient and amusing introduction to _ natural history _ i would have every nursery provide with a microscope by means of which the mind of the child might be excite to wonder and admiration at the amazing beauty and perfection of the insect world and the astonishing construction of various substance as see through this instrument so far would this be from beget habit of cruelty that it would be very likely to check they many child who would be loath to torture a large animal such as a cat a dog or a bird feel no compunction at ill-using a fly because it appear to they so insignificant a animal but have they once witness by means of a microscope the wonderful and perfect conformation of the insect i be persuade they would be less inclined to make the distinction various device might be make use of to teach the first truth of _ astronomy _ so simple a device as a apple with a wire run through its center turn round before a candle might serve to explain the phenomenon of day and night whilst the orrery with the accompaniment of a simple and familiar lecture -- -lrb- it should be much more so indeed than any i have hear or read -rrb- -- would make they acquaint with those stupendous fact which strike we with as astonishment and awe it have be well observe by dr young with respect to the wonder of astronomy -- in little thing we search out god -- in great he seize we one thing i would here notice -- that it should be a constant practice to remind the child that in the apple and the orrery they see only a resemblance to the earth and the heavenly body that _ they _ be vast in size and distance beyond they comprehension at the same time lead they to a actual observation of the heaven by means of a telescope this would be a high treat to the child and productive of correct notion which be but too apt to be lose where we be under the necessity of teaching by sign so infinitely unlike in size and nature as the candle and the apple and the brass ball and wire of the orrery to the earth and the heavenly orb for give the child they first lesson in _ geography _ i would have a floor-cloth in every nursery paint like a map but of course not fill up so perfectly as map for adult necessarily be it should contain a correct delineation of the position of a certain space of the globe we will say for instance of england let the child then be tell to proceed from a certain spot to go through certain county town & c and to fetch a piece of cloth from yorkshire or a knife from sheffield cheese from cheshire butter from dorset or lace from huntingdonshire & c & c the lesson thus give would be at once amusing and instructive both to the governess and child if prefer these map might be paint of a less size to cover a table no difficulty would be find to get a set of such table-cover or floor-cloth paint if the public would once encourage the plan there be now large skeleton map publish which have merely the principal city town and river & c mark down so as not to present too many object to confuse the young eye there be also picture map in which the chief production of a country both vegetable and animal be delineate in they proper place these would form a great aid in nursery instruction and also for a infant school let the great truth be ever bear in mind that what be see by the eye be more quickly understand and more certainly remembered than what be merely describe or make know in word i would also have a oblong tray make to hold water large enough to cover a table in this i would fasten piece of cork cut out in the shape of land accord to the best map while other small bit of cork should represent the mountain and hill on the surface of the respective island by application to the toy-maker a sufficient number of animal might be get to stock the respective island & c with they appropriate inhabitant whilst the manufacture and many of the natural product of the different place might be readily supply by the ingenuity of the parent or governess a little boat should then be provide and a voyage to a give part undertake various island might be touch at and various commodity take on board or exchange accord to the mercantile instruction the child should receive whilst brief account might at first be read or give of the climate production and inhabitant of the respective place till the little scholar should be able to conduct the voyage purchase or exchange commodity and give a account of the various country and they inhabitant & c by himself certain i be that more might be acquire by this toothed of geographical knowledge in one week than by the old method in a twelvemonth : and what the child do learn they would always remember i might extend these suggestion to the size of a small volume have i space to do so but the limit of the present one forbid at a future period should my active employment permit i may resume the subject of _ nursery hint _ in a extended and separate form there be indeed many excellent work already publish on the subject but as by the suggestion and contribution of many every plan be likely to be perfect no one be justified in withhold any thing likely to promote the desire object a due improvement of these advantage will make the progress of the higher class more than commensurate with that of the lower it be obvious that the former have resource which can not be obtain by the latter they have the means too of avail themselves of all improvement in education of engage the most intelligent and efficient instructor and of frequently change the scene for they child and consequently the object which come under they observation which i ask be the more honorable course -- to object as some do to the education of the infant poor lest they should learn too much or to improve then the opportunity they have by which they and they child they surpass all other a few word ought to be add on discipline at home it be not uncommon to hear parent in all class of society say that child be too much for I i can not manage he at all we should think he a most unpatriotic englishman who should say the french be too strong for we we can not beat they but very far more absurd and truly unparental it be to confess that a mere child be master of its parent a grow person and a infant what a contrast true it be that many a child have become very unmanageable but this may always be trace to early neglect if from the earliest infancy the young mind be train to little act of obedience they will soon become habitual and pleasant to perform but if improper indulgence and foolish kindness be practice towards child they must of course grow up peevish fretful and ill-tempered obstinate saucy and unmanageable whatsoever a man soweth that shall he reap let this truth be ever engrave upon the mind of all parent a constant exercise of parental love in allow all that be fit and proper and a firm and judicious use of parental authority in strictly refuse and forbid all that be unsuitable or wrong should harmoniously unite they power in training up the young punishment as a last resource ought to be use but never in a spirit of anger wrath or revenge if administer calmly and mildly they will have a double power every wilful offence of a child seem to say correct I but with judgment it may be painful to a parent to put on the graver countenance of love but _ true parental love _ will always do it oh that all parent in every rank of life saw and act upon the great truth that the noblest object that they can present to themselves and the greatest obligation that be lay upon they be to rear up they child to intelligence virtue and piety to make they good rather than great for if they be the former they will assuredly be the latter in its highest and truest sense -lrb- a -rrb- -lrb- footnote a : should the reader be please with this volume i
