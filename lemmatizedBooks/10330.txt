produce by david widger and dagny fruitfulness -lrb- fecondite -rrb- by emile zolum translate and edit by ernest alfr vizetelly translator 's preface fruitfulness be the first of a series of four work in which m zolum propose to embody what he consider to be the four cardinal principle of human life these work spring from the previous series of the three city : lourde rome and pari which deal with the principle of faith hope and charity the last scene in pari when marie pierre froment 's wife take she boy in she arm and consecrate he so to say to the city of labor and think furnish the necessary transition from one series to the other fruitfulness say m zolum create the home thence spring the city from the idea of citizenship come that of the fatherland and love of country in mind feed by science lead to the conception of a wider and vaster fatherland comprise all the people of the earth of these three stage in the progress of mankind the fourth still remain to be attain i have think then of write as it be a poem in four volume in four chant in which i shall endeavor to sum up the philosophy of all my work the first of these volume be ` fruitfulness ' the second will be call ` work ' the third ` truth ' the last ` justice ' in ` fruitfulness ' the hero 's name be matthew in the next work it will be luke in ` truth ' mark and in ` justice ' john the child of my brain will like the four evangelist preach the gospel diffuse the religion of future society which will be found on fruitfulness work truth and justice this then be m zolum 's reply to the cry repeatedly raise by he hero abbe pierre froment in the page of lourde pari and rome : a new religion a new religion critic of those work be careful to point out that no real answer be ever return to the abbe 's despairing call and it must be confess that one must yet wait for the greater part of that answer since fruitfulness though complete as a narrative form but a portion of the whole it be only after the publication of the succeed volume that one will be able to judge how far m zolum 's doctrine and theory in they ensemble may appeal to the requirement of the world while fruitfulness as i have say constitute a first instalment of m zolum 's conception of a social religion it embody a good deal else the idea of write some such work first occur to he many year ago in 1896 he contribute a article to the paris _ figaro _ in which he say : for some ten year now i have be haunt by the idea of a novel of which i shall doubtless never write the first page that novel would have be call ` wastage ' and i should have plead in it in favor of all the rights of life with all the passion which i may have in my heart \* m zolum 's article then proceed to discuss the various social problem theory and speculation which be set forth here and there in the present work briefly the genesis of fruitfulness lie in the article i have quote \* see _ nouvelle campagne _ -lrb- 1896 -rrb- par emile zolum pari 1897 pp 217-228 fruitfulness be a book to be judge from several standpoint it would be unjust and absurd to judge it from one alone such for instance as that of the new social religion to which i have refer it must be look at notably as a tract for the time in relation to certain grievous evil from which france and other country -- though more particularly france -- be undoubtedly suffer and it may be say that some such denunciation of those evil be undoubtedly necessary and that nobody be better place to pen that denunciation than m zolum who alone of all french writer nowadays command universal attention whatever opinion may be hold of he writings they have to be reckon with thus in prepare fruitfulness he be before all else discharging a patriotic duty and that duty he take in hand in a hour of cruel adversity when to assist a great cause he withdraw from france and seek for a time a residence in england where for eleven month i be privileged to help he in maintain he incognito fruitfulness be entirely write in england begin in a surrey country house and finish at the queen 's hotel norwood it would be superfluous for I to enter here into all the question which m zolum raise in he page the evil from which france suffer in relation to the stagnancy of its population be well know and that they continuance -- if continuance there be -- will mean the downfall of the country from its position as one of the world 's great power before the close of the twentieth century be a mathematical certainty that m zolum in order to combat those evil and to do he duty as a good citizen anxious to prevent the decline of he country should have deal with he subject with the greatest frankness and outspokenness be only natural moreover absolute freedom of speech exist in france which be not the case elsewhere thus when i first peruse the original proof of m zolum 's work i come to the conclusion that any version of it in the english language would be well-nigh impossible for some time i remain of that opinion and i make a statement to that effect in a lead literary journal subsequently however my view become modify the man who be ridiculous write a french poet barthelemy be he whose opinion never change and thus i at last revert to a task from which i have turn aside almost in despair various consideration influence I and among they be the thought that if fruitfulness be not present to the public in a english dress m zolum 's new series would remain incomplete decapitate so far as british and american reader be concern after all the criticism deal with the french original be solely direct against matter of form the mould in which some part of the work be cast its high moral purpose be distinctly recognize by several even of its most bitter detractor for I the problem be how to retain the whole ensemble of the narrative and the essence of the lesson which the work inculcate while recast some portion of it and sacrifice those matter of form to which exception be take it be not for I to say whether i have succeed in the task but i think that nothing in any degree offensive to delicate susceptibility will be find in this present version of m zolum 's book the english review of the french original show that if certain portion of it be deem indiscreet it none the less teem with admirable and even delightful page among the english reviewer be two well-known lady writer madame darmesteter -lrb- formerly miss mary robinson -rrb- and miss hannah lynch and the former remark in one part of she critique : even this short review reveal how honest how moral how human and comely be the fable of _ fecondite _ \* while the latter express the view that the work be eminently pugnaciously virtuous in m zolum 's strictly material conception of virtue and again : the page that tell the story of mathieu and marianne it must be admit be as charming as possible they have a bloom a beauty a fragrance we never expect to find in m zolum 's work the tale be a simple one : the cheerful conquest of fortune and the continual birth of offspring \*\* \* _ manchester guardian _ October 27 1899 \*\* _ fortnightly review _ January 1900 of course these lady critic do not favor certain feature of the original and one of they indeed refer to the evil denounce by m zolum as a mere evil of the hour whereas it have be grow and spread for half a century gradually sap all the vitality of france but beside that evil beside the downfall of the family it attack m zolum portray the triumph of rectitude the triumph which follow faith in the power of life and observance of the law of universal labor fruitfulness contain charming picture of homely married life delightful glimpse of childhood and youth : the first smile the first step the first word follow by the playfulness and the flirtation of boyhood and the happiness which wait on the espousal of those who truly love and the punishment of the guilty be awful and the triumph of the righteous be the greatest that can be conceive all those feature have be retain so far as my ability have allow in the present version which will at the same time i think give the reader unacquainted with the french language a general idea of m zolum 's view on one of the great question of the age as well as all the essential portion of a strongly conceive narrative e a v merton surrey england : April 1900 fruitfulness i that morning in the little pavilion of chanteble on the verge of the wood where they have now be install for nearly a month mathieu be make all haste in order that he might catch the seven-o'clock train which every day convey he from janville to pari it be already half-past six and there be fully two thousand pace from the pavilion to janville

which be perch aloft in the midst of greenery on the height of passy beyond the seine whilst on the right arise the campanile of the trocadero palace on one side skirt the rue de la federation one could still see a garden and a little house which have be the modest dwelling of leon beauchene in the heroic day of desperate toil when he have lay the foundation of he fortune then the factory

windowless wall this important and well-known establishment manufacture chiefly agricultural appliance from the most powerful machine to those ingenious and delicate implement on which particular care must be bestow if perfection be to be attain in addition to the hundred of man who work there daily there be some fifty woman burnisher and polisher the entry to the workshop and office be in the rue de la federation through a large carriage way whence one perceive the far-spreading yard with its paving stone invariably black and often streak by rivulet of steam water dense smoke arise from the high chimney strident jet of steam emerge from the roof whilst a low rumble and a shake of the ground betoken the activity within the ceaseless bustle of labor it be thirty-five minute past eight by

between the young people there be no lightning flash such as throw the passion-swayed into each other 's arm but esteem tenderness faith and that mutual conviction of happiness in reciprocal bestowal which tend to indissoluble marriage and they be delighted at marry penniless at bring one another but they full heart forever and forever the only change in mathieu 's circumstance be a increase of salary to two hundred franc a month true he new cousin by marriage just vaguely hint at a possible partnership but that would not be till some very much later date as it happen mathieu froment gradually become indispensable at the work the young master alexandre beauchene pass through a anxious crisis the dowry which he father have be force to draw from he coffer in order to get seraphine married and other large expense which have be occasion by the girl 's rebellious and perverse conduct have leave but little working capital in the business then too on the morrow of leon beauchene 's

inheritance and even suggest the sale of the work the property have narrowly escape be cut up annihilate and alexandre beauchene still shiver with terror and anger at the recollection of that time amidst all he delight at have at last rid himself of he sister by pay she in money the liberally estimate value of she share it be in order to fill up the void thus create in he finances that he have espouse the half-million represent by constance -- a ugly creature as he himself bitterly acknowledge coarse male as he be truth to tell she be so thin so scraggy that before consent to make she he

you be to take dejeuner with we yes yes my good morange it be understand i will look in for you at twelve o'clock then mathieu very carefully scrutinize a wash drawing of a very simple but powerful steam thresher a invention of he own on which he have be work for some time past and which a big landowner of beauce m firon-badinier be to examine during the afternoon the door of the master 's private room be suddenly throw wide open and beauchene appear -- tall with a ruddy face a narrow brow and big brown protrude eye he have a rather large nose thick lip and a full black beard on which he bestow great care as he likewise do on he hair which be carefully comb over he head in order to conceal the serious baldness that be already come upon he although he be scarcely two-and-thirty frock-coated the first thing in the morning he be already smoke a big cigar and he loud voice he peal of gayety he bustling way all betoken a egotist and good liver still in he prime a man for whom money -- capital increase and increase by the labor of other -- be the one only sovereign power ah ah it be ready be it not say he monsieur firon-badinier have again write I that he will be here at three o'clock and you know that i be go to take you to the restaurant with he this evening for one can never induce those fellow to give order unless one ply they with good wine it annoy constance to

chair : ah my dear fellow i be wear out he continue i dine in town last night i get to bed only at one o'clock and there be a terrible lot of work wait for I this morning one positively need to be make of iron until a short time before he have show himself a prodigious worker endowed with really marvellous energy and strength moreover he have give proof of unfailing business instinct with regard to many profitable undertaking invariably the first to appear at the work he look after everything foresee everything fill the place with he bustling zeal and double he output year by year recently however fatigue have be gain ground on he he have always seek plenty of amusement even amid the hard-working life he lead but nowadays certain spree as he call they leave he fairly exhaust he gaze at mathieu : you seem fit enough you do he say how be it that you manage never to look tired as a matter of fact the young man who stand there erect before he drawing-table seem possess of the sturdy health of a young oak tree tall and slender he have the broad lofty tower-like brow of the froment he wear he thick hair cut quite short and he beard which curl slightly in a point but the chief expression of he face rest in he eye which be at once deep and bright keen and thoughtful and almost invariably illumine by a smile they show he to be at once a man of thought and of action very simple very gay and of a kindly disposition oh i he answer with a laugh i behave reasonably but beauchene protest : no you do not the man who already have four child when he be only twenty-seven can not claim to be reasonable and twin too -- you blaise and you deni to begin with and then you boy ambroise and you little girl rise without count the other little girl that you lose at she birth include she you would now have have five youngster you wretch fellow no no i be the one who behave reasonably -- i who have but one child and like a prudent sensible man desire no other he often make such jest remark as these through which filter he genuine indignation for he deem the young couple to be over-careless of they interest and declare that the prolificness of he cousin marianne be quite scandalous accustomed as mathieu be to these attack which leave he perfectly serene he go on laugh without even give a reply when a workman abruptly enter the room -- one who be currently call old moineaud though he be scarcely three-and-forty year of age short and thick-set he have a bullet head a bull 's neck and face and hand scar and dent by more than a quarter of a century of toil by call he be a fitter and he have come to submit a difficulty which have just arise in the piece together of a reap machine but he employer who be still angrily think of over-numerous family do not give he time to explain he purpose and you old moineaud how many child have you he inquire seven monsieur beauchene the workman reply somewhat take aback i have lose three so include they you would now have ten well that be a nice state of thing how can you do otherwise than starve moineaud begin to laugh like the gay thriftless pari workman that he be the little one well they grow up without he even notice it and indeed he be really fond of they so long as they remain at home and besides they work as they grow older and bring a little money in however he prefer to answer he employer with a jest which set they all laugh after he have explain the difficulty with the reaper the other follow he to examine the work for themselves they be already turn into a passage when beauchene see the door of the woman 's workshop open determine to pass that way so that he might give he customary look around it be a long spacious place where the polisher in smock of black serge sit in double row polish and grind they piece at little work-board nearly all of they be young a few be pretty but most have low and common face a animal odor and a stench of rancid oil pervade the place the regulation require perfect silence there during work yet all the girl be gossip as soon however as the master 's approach be signal the chatter abruptly cease there be but one girl who have she head turn and thus see nothing of beauchene go on furiously abuse a companion with whom she have previously start a dispute she and the other be sister and as it happen daughter of old moineaud euphrasie the younger one she who be shout be a skinny creature of seventeen light-haired with a long lean pointed face uncomely and malignant whereas the elder norine barely nineteen be a pretty girl a blonde like she sister but have a milky skin and withal plump and sturdy show real shoulder arm and hip and one of those bright sunshiny face with wild hair and black eye all the freshness of the parisian hussy aglow with the fleeting charm of youth norine be ever quarrel with euphrasie and be please to have she catch in a misdeed so she allow she to rattle on and it thereupon become necessary for beauchene to intervene he habitually evince great severity in the woman 's workshop for he have hitherto hold the view that a employer who jest with he workgirl be a lose man thus in spite of the low character of which he be say to give proof in he walk abroad there have as yet never be the faintest suggestion of scandal in connection with he and the woman in he employ well now mademoiselle euphrasie he exclaim do you intend to be quiet this be quite improper you be fine twenty sous and if i hear you again you will be lock out for a week the girl have turn round in consternation then stifle she rage she cast a terrible glance at she sister think that she might at least have warn she but the other with the discreet air of a pretty wench conscious of she attractiveness continue smile look she employer full in the face as if certain that she have nothing to fear from he they eye meet and for a couple of seconds they glance mingle then he with flush cheek and a angry air resume address one and all : as soon as the superintendent turn she back you chatter away like so many magpie just be careful or you will have to deal with I moineaud the father have witness the scene unmoved as if the two girl -- she whom the master have scold and she who slyly gaze at he -- be not he own daughter and now the round be resume and the three man quit the woman 's workshop amidst profound silence which only the whir of the little grinder disturb when the fitting difficulty have be overcome downstairs and moineaud have receive he order beauchene return to he residence accompany by mathieu who wish to convey marianne 's invitation to constance a gallery connect the black factory building with the luxurious private house on the quay and they find constance in a little drawing-room hang with yellow satin a room to which she be very partial she be seat near a sofa on which lay little maurice she fondly prize and only child who have just complete he seventh year be he ill inquire mathieu the child seem sturdily build and he greatly resemble he father though he have a more massive jaw but he be pale and there be a faint ring round he heavy eyelid he mother that bag of bone a little dark woman yellow and wither at six-and-twenty look at he with a expression of egotistical pride oh no he be never ill she answer only he have be complain of he leg and so i make he lie down and i write last night to ask dr boutan to call this morning pooh exclaim beauchene with a hearty laugh woman be all the same a child who be as strong as a turk i should just like anybody to tell I that he be not strong precisely at that moment in walk dr boutan a short stout man of forty with very keen eye set in a clean-shaven heavy but extremely good-natured face he at once examine the child feel and sound he then with he kindly yet serious air he say : no no there be nothing it be the mere effect of growth the lad have become rather pale through spend the winter in pari but a few month in the open air in the country will set he right again i tell you so cry beauchene constance have keep she son 's little hand in she own he have again stretch himself out and close he eye in a weary way whilst she in she happiness continue smile whenever she choose she could appear quite pleasant-looking however unprepossessing might be she feature the doctor have seat himself for he be fond of linger and chat in the house of friend a general practitioner and one who more particularly tend the ailment of woman and child he be naturally a confessor know all sort of secret and be quite at home in family circle it be he who have attend constance at the birth of that much-spoiled only son and marianne at the advent of the four child she already have mathieu have remain stand await a opportunity to deliver he invitation well say he if you be soon leave for the country you must come one Sunday to janville my wife would be so delighted to see you there to show you we encampment then he jest respect the bareness of the lonely pavilion which they occupy recount that as yet they possess only a dozen plate and five egg-cup but beauchene know the pavilion for he go shooting in the neighborhood every winter have a share in the tenancy of some extensive wood the shooting-rights over which have be parcel out by the owner seguin say he be a friend of mine i have lunch at you pavilion it be a perfect hovel then constance contemptuous at the idea of such poverty recall what madame seguin -- to whom she refer as valentine -- have tell she of the dilapidated condition of the old shooting-box but the doctor after listen with a smile break in : mme seguin be a patient of mine at the time when she last child be bear i advise she to stay at that pavilion the atmosphere be wholesome and child ought to spring up there like couch-grass thereupon with a sonorous laugh beauchene begin to jest in he habitual way remark that if the doctor be correct there would probably be no end to mathieu 's progeny numerous as it already be but this elicit a angry protest from constance who on the subject of child hold the same view as she husband himself profess in he more serious moment mathieu thoroughly understand what they both mean they regard he and he wife with derisive pity tinge with anger the advent of the young couple 's last child little rise have already increase they expense to such a point that they have be oblige to seek refuge in the country in a mere pauper 's hovel and yet in spite of beauchene 's sneer and constance 's angry remark mathieu outwardly remain very calm constance and marianne have never be able to agree they differ too much in all respects and for he part he laugh off every attack unwilling as he be to let anger master he lest a rupture should ensue but beauchene wax passionate on the subject that question of the birth-rate and the present-day fall off in population be one which he think he have completely master and on which he hold forth at length authoritatively he begin by challenge the impartiality of boutan whom he know to be a fervent partisan of large family he make merry with he declare that no medical man could possibly have a disinterested opinion on the subject then he bring out all that he vaguely know of malthusianism the geometrical increase of birth and the arithmetical increase of food-substance the earth become so populous as to be reduce to a state of famine within two century it be the poor 's own fault say he if they lead a life of starvation they have only to limit themselves to as many child as they could provide for the rich be falsely accuse of social wrong-doing they be by no means responsible for poverty indeed they be the only reasonable people they alone by limit they family act as good citizen should act and he become quite triumphant repeat that he know of no cause for self-reproach and that he ever-growing fortune leave he with a easy conscience it be so much the worse for the poor if they be bent on remain poor in vain do the doctor urge that the malthusian theory be shatter that the calculation have be base on a possible not a real increase of population in vain too do he prove that the present-day economic crisis the evil distribution of wealth under the capitalist system be the one hateful cause of poverty and that whenever labor should be justly apportion among one and all the fruitful earth would easily provide sustenance for happy man ten time more numerous than they be now the other refuse to listen to anything take refuge in he egotism declare that all those matter be no concern of he that he feel no remorse at be rich and that those who wish to become rich have in the main simply to do as he have do then logically this be the end of france eh boutan remark maliciously the number of birth ever increase in germany russium and elsewhere while it decrease in a terrible way among we numerically the rank we occupy in europe be already very inferior to what it formerly be and yet number mean power more than ever nowadays it have be calculate that a average of four child per family be necessary in order that population may increase and the strength of a nation be maintain you have but one child you be a bad patriot at this beauchene fly into a tantrum quite beside himself and gasp : i a bad patriot i who kill myself with hard work i who even export french machinery yes certainly i see family acquaintance around I who may well allow themselves four child and i grant that they deserve censure when they have no family but as for I my dear doctor it be impossible you know very well that in my position i absolutely can not then for the hundredth time he give he reason relate how the work have narrowly escape be cut into piece annihilate simply because he have unfortunately be burden with a sister seraphine have behave abominably there have be first she dowry next she demand for the division of the property on they father 's death and the work have be save only by means of a large pecuniary sacrifice which have long cripple they prosperity and people imagine that he would be as imprudent as he father why if maurice should have a brother or a sister he might hereafter find himself in the same dire embarrassment in which the family property might already have be destroy no no he would not expose the boy to the necessity of divide the inheritance in accordance with badly frame law he be resolve that maurice should be the sole master of the fortune which he himself have derive from he father and which he would transmit to he heir increase tenfold for he son he dream of supreme wealth a colossal fortune such as nowadays alone ensure power mathieu refrain from any intervention listen and remain grave for this question of the birth-rate seem to he a frightful one the foremost of all question decide the destiny of mankind and the world there have never be any progress but such as have be determine by increase of birth if nation have accomplish evolution if civilization have advance it be because the nation have multiply and subsequently spread through all the country of the earth and will not to-morrow 's evolution the advent of truth and justice be bring about by the constant onslaught of the greater number the revolutionary fruitfulness of the toiler and the poor it be quite true that mathieu do not plainly say all these thing to himself indeed he feel slightly ashamed of the four child that he already have and be disturb by the counsel of prudence address to he by the beauchene but within he there struggle he faith in life he belief that the greatest possible sum of life must bring about the greatest sum of happiness at last wish to change the subject he bethink himself of marianne 's commission and at the first favorable opportunity exclaim : well we shall rely on you marianne and i for Sunday after next at janville but there be still no answer for just then a servant come to say that a woman with a infant in she arm desire to see madame and beauchene have recognize the wife of moineaud the fitter bid she come in boutan who have now rise be prompt by curiosity to remain a little longer la moineaude short and fat like she husband be a woman of about forty wear out before she time with ashen face pale eye thin fade hair and a weak mouth which already lack many tooth a large family have be too much for she and moreover she take no care of herself well my good woman constance inquire what do you wish with I but la moineaude remain quite scare by the sight of all those people whom she have not expect to find there she say nothing she have hope to speak to the lady privately be this you last-born beauchene ask she as he look at the pale puny child on she arm

soldier in tonquin you have my two big girl euphrasie and norine at the work and i have three leave at home -- victor who be now fifteen then cecile and irma who be ten and seven after irma i think i have do with child for good and i be well pleased but you see this urchin come and i forty too -- it be not just the good lord must surely have abandon we then dr boutan begin to question she he avoid look at the beauchene but there be a malicious twinkle in he little eye and it be evident that he take pleasure in recapitulate the employer 's argument against excessive prolificness he pretend to get angry and to reproach the moineaud for they ten wretched child -- the boy fate to become food for powder the girl always liable to misfortune and he give the woman to understand that it be she own fault if she be in distress for people with a tribe of child about they could never become rich and the poor creature sadly answer that he be quite right but that no idea of become rich could ever have enter they head moineaud know well enough that he would never be a cabinet minister and so it be all the same to they how many child they might have on they hand indeed a number prove a help when the youngster grow old enough to go out to work beauchene have become silent and slowly pace the room a slight chill a feeling of uneasiness be spring up and so constance make haste to inquire : well my good woman what be it i can do for you _ mon dieu _ madame it worry I it be something which moineaud do not dare to ask of monsieur beauchene for my part i hope to find you alone and beg you to intercede for we the fact be we should be very very grateful if we little victor could only be take on at the work but he be only fifteen exclaim beauchene you must wait till he be sixteen the law be strict no doubt only one might perhaps just tell a little fib it would be render we such a service -- no it be impossible big tear well into la moineaude 's eye and mathieu who have listen with passionate interest feel quite upset ah that wretch toil-doomed flesh that hasten to offer itself without wait until it be even ripe for work ah the laborer who be prepare to lie whom hunger set against the very law design for he own protection when la moineaude have go off in despair the doctor continue speaking of juvenile and female labor as soon as a woman first find herself a mother she can no longer continue toiling at a factory she lying-in and the nursing of she babe force she to remain at home or else grievous infirmity may ensue for she and she offspring as for the child it become anemic sometimes cripple besides it help to keep wages down by be take to work at a low scale of remuneration then the doctor go on to speak of the prolificness of wretchedness the swarming of the lower class be not the most hateful natality of all that which mean the endless increase of starveling and social rebel i perfectly understand you beauchene end by say without any show of anger as he abruptly bring he perambulation to a end you want to place I in contradiction with myself and make I confess that i accept moineaud 's seven child and need they whereas i with my fix determination to rest content with a only son suppress as it be a family in order that i may not have to subdivide my estate france ` the country of only son ' as folk say nowadays -- that be it eh but my dear fellow the question be so intricate and at bottom i be altogether in the right then he wish to explain thing and clap he hand to he breast exclaim that he be a liberal a democrat ready to demand all really progressive measure he willingly recognize that child be necessary that the army require soldier and the factory workman only he also invoke the prudential duty of the higher class and reason after the fashion of a man of wealth a conservative clinging to the fortune he have acquire mathieu meanwhile end by understand the brutal truth : capital be compel to favor the multiplication of life foredoom to wretchedness in spite of everything it must stimulate the prolificness of the wage-earning class in order that its profit may continue the law be that there must always be a excess of child in order that there may be enough cheap worker then also speculation on the wages ' ratio wrest all nobility from labor which be regard as the worst misfortune a man can be condemn to when in reality it be the most precious of boon such then be the cancer prey upon mankind in country of political equality and economical inequality the capitalist regime the faulty distribution of wealth at once restrain and precipitate the birth-rate by perpetually increase the wrongful apportionment of means on one side be the rich folk with only son who continually increase they fortune on the other the poor folk who by reason of they unrestrained prolificness see the little they possess crumble yet more and more if labor be honor to-morrow if a just apportionment of wealth be arrive at equilibrium will be restore otherwise social revolution lie at the end of the road but beauchene in he triumphant manner try to show that he possess great breadth of mind he admit the disquieting stride of a decrease of population and denounce the cause of it -- alcoholism militarism excessive mortality among infant and other numerous matter then he indicate remedy first reduction in taxation fiscal means in which he have little faith then freedom to will one 's estate as one pleased which seem to he more efficacious a change too in the marriage law without forget the grant of affiliation rights however boutan end by interrupt he all the legislative measure in the world will do nothing say the doctor manners and custom we notion of what be moral and what be not we very conception of the beautiful in life -- all must be change if france be become depopulate it be because she so choose it be simply necessary then for she to choose so no longer but what a task -- a whole world to create anew at this mathieu raise a superb cry : well we 'll create it i have begin well enough surely but constance after laugh in a constrain way in she turn think it as well to change the subject and so she at last reply to he invitation say that she would do she best to go to janville though she fear she might not be able to dispose of a Sunday to do so dr boutan then take he leave and be escort to the door by beauchene who still go on jest like a man well pleased with life one who be satisfy with himself and other and who feel certain of be able to arrange thing as might best suit he pleasure and he interest a hour later a few minute after midday as mathieu who have be delay in the work go up to the office to fetch morange as he have promise to do it occur to he to take a short cut through the woman 's workshop and there in that spacious gallery already desert and silent he come upon a unexpected scene which utterly amaze he on some pretext or other norine have linger there the last and beauchene be with she clasp she around the waist whilst he eagerly press he lip to hers but all at once they catch sight of mathieu and remain thunderstruck and he for he part flee precipitately deeply annoyed at have be a surprised witness to such a secret ii morange the chief accountant at beauchene 's work be a man of thirty-eight bald and already gray-headed but with a superb dark fan-shaped beard of which he be very proud he full limpid eye straight nose and well-shaped if somewhat large mouth have in he younger day give he the reputation of be a handsome fellow he still take great care of himself invariably wear a tall silk hat and preserve the correct appearance of a very painstaking and well-bred clerk you do not know we new flat yet do you he ask mathieu as he lead he away oh it be perfect as you will see a bedroom for we and another for reine and it be so close to the work too i get there in four minute watch in hand he morange be the son of a petty commercial clerk who have die on he stool after forty year of cloistral office-life and he have marry a clerk 's daughter one valerie duchemin the eldest of four girl whose parent ' home have be turn into a perfect hell full of shameful wretchedness and unacknowledgable poverty through this abominable incumbrance valerie who be good-looking and ambitious be lucky enough however to marry that handsome honest and hard-working fellow morange although she be quite without a dowry and this accomplished she indulge in the dream of climb a little higher up the social ladder and free herself from the loathsome world of petty clerkdom by make the son whom she hope to have either a advocate or a doctor unfortunately the much-desired child prove to be a girl and valerie tremble fearful of find herself at last with four daughter on she hand just as she mother have she dream thereupon change and she resolve to incite she husband onward to the highest post so that she might ultimately give she daughter a large dowry and by this mean gain that admittance to superior sphere which she so eagerly desire she husband who be weak and extremely fond of she end by share she ambition ever revolve scheme of pride and conquest for she benefit but he have now be eight year at the beauchene work and he still earn but five thousand franc a year this drive he and he wife to despair assuredly it be not at beauchene 's that he would ever make he fortune you see he exclaim after go a couple of hundred yard with mathieu along the boulevard de grenelle it be that new house yonder at the street corner it have a stylish appearance eh mathieu then perceive a lofty modern pile ornament with balcony and sculpture work which look quite out of place among the poor little house predominate in the district why it be a palace he exclaim in order to please morange who thereupon draw himself up quite proudly you will see the staircase my dear fellow we place you know be on the fifth floor but that be of no consequence with such a staircase so easy so soft that one climb it almost without know thereupon morange show he guest into the vestibule as if he be usher he into a temple the stucco wall gleam brightly there be a carpet on the stair and color glass in the window and when on reach the fifth story the cashier open the door with he latchkey he repeat with a air of delight : you will see you will see valerie and reine must have be on the watch for they hasten forward at thirty-two valerie be still young and charming she be a pleasant-looking brunette with a round smile face in a setting of superb hair she have a full round bust and admirable shoulder of which she husband feel quite proud whenever she show herself in a low-necked dress reine at this time twelve year old be the very portrait of she mother show much the same smile if rather longer face under similar black tress ah it be very kind of you to accept we invitation say valerie gayly as she press both mathieu 's hand what a pity that madame froment could not come with you reine why do not you relieve the gentleman of he hat then she immediately continue : we have a nice light anteroom you see would you like to glance over we flat while the egg be be boil that will always be one thing do and you will then at least know where you be lunch all this be say in such a agreeable way and morange on he side smile so good-naturedly that mathieu willingly lend himself to this innocent display of vanity first come the parlor the corner room the wall of which be cover with pearl-gray paper with a design of golden flower while the furniture consist of some of those white lacquered loui xvi piece which maker turn out by the gross the rosewood piano show like a big black blot amidst all the rest then overlook the boulevard de grenelle come reine 's bedroom pale blue with furniture of polish pine she parent ' room a very small apartment be at the other end of the flat separate from the parlor by the dining-room the hanging adorning it be yellow and a bedstead a washstand and a wardrobe all of thuya have be crowd into it finally the classic old carve oak triumph in the dining-room where a heavily gilded hang lamp flash like fire above the table dazzling in its whiteness why it be delightful mathieu repeat by way of politeness why it be a real gem of a place in they excitement father mother and daughter never cease lead he hither and thither explain matter to he and make he feel the thing he be most strike by the circumstance that the place recall something he have see before he seem to be familiar with the arrangement of the drawing-room and with the way in which the nicknack in the bedchamber be set out and all at once he remember influence by envy and covert admiration the morange despite themselves no doubt have try to copy the beauchene always short of money as they be they could only and by dint of great sacrifice indulge in a species of make-believe luxury nevertheless they be proud of it and by imitate the envy higher class from afar they imagine that they draw nearer to it and then morange exclaim as he open the dining-room window there be also this outside a balcony run along the house-front and at that height the view be really a very fine one similar to that obtain from the beauchene mansion but more extensive the seine show in the distance and the height of passy rise above the nearer and lower house-roof valerie also call attention to the prospect it be magnificent be it not say she far better than the few tree that one can see from the quay the servant be now bring the boil egg and they take they seat at table while morange victoriously explain that the place altogether cost he sixteen hundred franc a year it be cheap indeed though the amount be a heavy charge on morange 's slender income mathieu now begin to understand that he have be invite more particularly to admire the new flat and these worthy people seem so delighted to triumph over it before he that he take the matter gayly and without thought of spite there be no calculate ambition in he nature he envy nothing of the luxury he brush against in other people 's home and he be quite satisfied with the snug modest life he lead with marianne and he child thus he simply feel surprised at find the morange so desirous of cut a figure and make money and look at they with a somewhat sad smile valerie be wear a pretty gown of foulard with a pattern of little yellow flower while she daughter reine whom she like to deck out coquettishly have a frock of blue linen stuff there be rather too much luxury about the meal also sole follow the egg and then come cutlet and afterwards asparagus the conversation begin with some mention of janville and so you child be in good health oh they be very fine child indeed and you really like the country how funny i think i should feel dreadfully bore there for there be too great a lack of amusement why yes we shall be delighted to go to see you there since madame froment be kind enough to invite we then as be bind to happen the talk turn on the beauchene this be a subject which haunt the morange who live in perpetual admiration of the beauchene though at time they covertly criticise they valerie be very proud of be privileged to attend constance 's Saturday at-home and of have be twice invite to dinner by she during the previous winter she on she side now have a day of she own Tuesday and she even give little private party and half ruin herself in provide refreshment at they as for she acquaintance she speak with profound respect of mme seguin du hordel and that lady 's magnificent mansion in the avenue d'antin for constance have obligingly obtain she a invitation to a ball there but she be particularly vain of the friendship of beauchene 's sister seraphine whom she invariably call madame la baronne de lowicz the baroness come to my at-home one afternoon she say she be so very good-natured and so gay you know she formerly do you not after she marriage eh when she become reconcile to she brother and they wretched dispute about money matter be over by the way she have no great liking for madame beauchene as you must know then she again revert to the manufacturer 's wife declare that little maurice however sturdy he might look be simply puff out with bad flesh and she remark that it would be a terrible blow for the parent if they should lose that only son the subject of child be thus start and when mathieu laughing observe that they the morange have but one child the cashier protest that it be unfair to compare he with m beauchene who be such a wealthy man valerie for she part picture the position of she parent afflict with four daughter who have be oblige to wait month and month for boot and frock and hat and have grow up anyhow in perpetual terror lest they should never find husband a family be all very well but when it happen to consist of daughter the situation become terrible for people of limited means for if daughter be to be launch properly into life they must have dowry besides say she i be very ambitious for my husband and i be convince that he may rise to a very high position if he will only listen to I but he must not be saddle with a lot of incumbrance as thing stand i trust that we may be able to get rich and give reine a suitable dowry morange quite move by this little speech catch hold of he wife 's hand and kiss it weak and good-natured as he be valerie be really the one with will it be she who have instil some ambition into he and he esteem she the more for it my wife be a thoroughly good woman you know my dear froment say he she have a good head as well as a good heart then while valerie recapitulate she dream of wealth the splendid flat she would have the reception she would hold and the two month which like the beauchene she would spend at the seaside every summer mathieu look at she and she husband and ponder they position they case be very different from that of old moineaud who know that he would never be a cabinet minister morange possibly dream that he wife would indeed make he a minister some day every petty bourgeois in a democratic community have a chance of rise and wish to do so indeed there be a universal ferocious rush each seek to push the other aside so that he may the more speedily climb a ring of the social ladder this general ascent this phenomenon akin to capillarity be possible only in a country where political equality and economic inequality prevail for each have the same right to fortune and have but to conquer it there be however a struggle of the vilest egotism if one wish to taste the pleasure of the highly place pleasure which be display to the gaze of all and be eagerly covet by nearly everybody in the lower sphere under a democratic constitution a nation can not live happily if its manners and custom be not simple and if the condition of life be not virtually equal for one and all under other circumstance than these the liberal profession prove all-devouring : there be a rush for public function manual toil be regard with contempt luxury increase and become necessary and wealth and power be furiously appropriate by assault in order that one may greedily taste the voluptuousness of enjoyment and in such a state of affair child as valerie put it be incumbrance whereas one need to be free absolutely unburdened if one wish to climb over all one 's competitor mathieu also think of that law of imitation which impel even the least fortunate to impoverish themselves by strive to copy the happy one of the world how great the distress which really lurk beneath that envied luxury that be copy at such great cost all sort of useless need be create and production be turn aside from the strictly necessary one can no longer express hardship by say that people lack bread what they lack in the majority of case be the superfluous which they be unable to renounce without imagine that they have go to the dog and be in danger of starvation at dessert when the servant be no longer present morange excite by he good meal become expansive glancing at he wife he wink towards they guest say : come he be a safe friend one may tell he everything and when valerie have consent with a smile and a nod he go on : well this be the matter my dear fellow : it be possible that i may soon leave the work oh it be not decide but i be think of it yes i have be think of it for some month past for when all be say to earn five thousand franc a year after eight year ' zeal and to think that one will never earn much more be enough to make one despair of life it be monstrous the young woman interrupted : it be like break one 's head intentionally against a wall well in such circumstance my dear friend the best course be to look out for something elsewhere be it not do you remember michaud whom i have under my order at the work some six year ago a very intelligent fellow he be well scarcely six year have elapse since he leave we to go to the credit national and what do you think he be now earn there twelve thousand franc -- you hear I -- twelve thousand franc the last word ring out like a trumpet-call the morange ' eye dilate with ecstasy even the little girl become very red last march continue morange i happen to meet michaud who tell I all that and show himself very amiable he offer to take I with he and help I on in my turn only there be some risk to run he explain to I that i must at first accept three thousand six hundred so as to rise gradually to a very big figure but three thousand six hundred how can one live on that in the meantime especially now that this flat have increase we expense at this valerie break in impetuously : ` nothing venture nothing have ' that be what i keep on repeat to he of course i be in favor of prudence i would never let he do anything rash which might compromise he future but at the same time he can not moulder away in a situation unworthy of he and so you have make up you mind ask mathieu well my wife have calculate everything morange reply and yes we have make up we mind provide of course that nothing unforeseen occur besides it be only in October that any situation will be open at the credit national but i say my dear friend keep the matter entirely to yourself for we do not want to quarrel with the beauchene just now then he look at he watch for like a good clerk he be very punctual and do not wish to be late at the office the servant be hurry the coffee be serve and they be drink it boil hot as it be when the arrival of a visitor upset the little household and cause everything to be forget oh exclaim valerie as she hastily rise flush with pride madame la baronne de lowicz seraphine at this time nine-and-twenty be red-haired tall and elegant with magnificent shoulder which be know to all pari she red lip be wreathe in a triumphant smile and a voluptuous flame ever shine in she large brown eye fleck with gold pray do not disturb yourselve my friend say she you servant want to show I into the drawing-room but i insist on come in here because it be rather a press matter i have come to fetch you charming little reine to take she to a matinee at the circus a fresh explosion of delight ensue the child remain speechless with joy whilst the mother exult and rattle on : oh madame la baronne you be really too kind you be spoil the child but the fact be that she be not dress and you will have to wait a moment come child make haste i will help you -- ten minute you understand -- i will not keep you wait a moment longer seraphine remain alone with the two man she have make a gesture of surprise on perceive mathieu whose hand like a old friend she now shake and you be you quite well she ask quite well he answer and as she sit down near he he instinctively push he chair back he do not seem at all pleased at have meet she he have be on familiar term with she during he earlier day at the beauchene work she be a frantic pleasure-lover and destitute of both conscience and moral principle she conduct have give rise to scandal even before she extraordinary elopement with baron de lowicz that needy adventurer with a face like a archangel 's and the soul of a swindler the result of the union be a stillborn child then seraphine who be extremely egotistical and avaricious quarrel with she husband and drive he away he repair to berlin and be kill there in a brawl at a gambling den delighted at be rid of he seraphine make every use of she liberty as a young widow she figure at every fete take part in every kind of amusement and many scandalous story be tell of she but she contrived to keep up appearance and be thus still receive everywhere you be live in the country be you not she ask again turn towards mathieu yes we have be there for three week past constance tell I of it i meet she the other day at madame seguin 's we be on the best term possible you know now that i give my brother good advice in point of fact she sister-in-law constance hate she but with she usual boldness she treat the matter as a joke we talk about dr gaude she resume i fancy that she want to ask for he address but she do not dare dr gaude interrupted morange ah yes a friend of my wife 's speak to she about he he be a wonderfully clever man it appear some of he operation be like miracle then he go on talking of dr gaude 's clinic at the hopital marbeuf a clinic whither society folk hasten to see operation perform just as they might go to a theater the doctor who be fond of money and who bleed he wealthy lady patient in more sens than one be likewise partial to glory and proud of accomplish the most dangerous experiment on the unhappy creature who fall into he hand the newspaper be always talk about he he cure be constantly puff and advertise by way of induce fine lady to trust themselves to he skill and he certainly accomplish wonder cut and carve he patient in the quietest most unconcerned way possible with never a scruple never a doubt as to whether what he do be strictly right or not seraphine have begin to laugh show she white wolfish tooth between she blood-red lip when she notice the horrify expression which have appear on mathieu 's face since gaude have be speak of ah say she there be a man now who in nowise resemble you squeamish dr boutan who be always prattle about the birth-rate i can not understand why constance keep to that old-fashioned booby hold the view she do she be quite right you know in she opinion i fully share they morange laugh complaisantly he wish to show she that he opinion be the same however as valerie do not return with reine he grow impatient and ask permission to go and see what they be about perhaps he himself might be able to help in get the child ready as soon as seraphine be alone with mathieu she turn she big ardent gold-flecked eye upon he she no longer laugh with the same laugh as a moment previously a expression of voluptuous irony appear on she bold bad face after a spell of silence she inquire and be my good cousin marianne quite well quite well reply mathieu and the child be still grow yes still grow so you be happy like a good paterfamilias in you little nook perfectly happy again she lapse into silence but she do not cease to look at he more provoke more radiant than ever with the charm of a young sorceress whose eye burn and poison man 's heart and at last she slowly resume : and so it be all over between we he make a gesture in token of assent there have long since be a pass fancy between they he have be nineteen at the time and she two-and-twenty he have then but just enter life and she be already marry but a few month later he have fall in love with marianne and have then entirely free himself from she all over -- really she again inquire smile but aggressive she be look very beautiful and bold seek to tempt he and carry he off from that silly little cousin of hers whose tear would simply have make she laugh and as mathieu do not this time give she any answer even by a wave of the hand she go on : i prefer that : do not reply : do not say that it be all over you might make a mistake you know for a moment mathieu 's eye flash then he close they in order that he might no longer see seraphine who be lean towards he it seem as if all the past be come back she almost press she lip to he as she whisper that she still love he and when he draw back full of mingled emotion and annoyance she raise she little hand to he mouth as if she fear that he be again go to say no be quiet say she they be come the morange be now indeed return with reine whose hair have be curl the child look quite delicious in she frock of rise silk deck with white lace

express they happiness at see such coveted wealth and luxury come to seek they daughter when the door of the flat be close valerie dart on to the balcony exclaim let we see they drive off morange who

as money be so hard to earn iii at the work during the afternoon mathieu who wish to be free earlier than usual in order that before dining in town he might call upon he landlord in accordance with he promise to marianne find himself so busy that he scarcely catch sight of beauchene this be a relief for the secret which he have discover by chance annoy he and he fear lest he might cause he employer

past the opinion of the district have be that no agriculturist could ever turn the expanse to good account the defunct army contractor alone have be able to picture there a romantic park such as he have dream of create around he regal abode it be he by the way who have obtain a authorization to add to the name of seguin that of du hordel -- take from a ruin tower call the hordel which stand on

idleness and cosy nook in which one could hide oneself behind fringe of lofty plant oh so it be you monsieur froment suddenly exclaim somebody in the direction of the table allot to the pewter curio and thereupon a tall young man of thirty whom a screen have hitherto hide from mathieu 's view come forward with outstretched hand ah say mathieu after a moment 's hesitation monsieur charle santerre this be but they second meeting they have find themselves together once before in that same room charle santerre already famous as a novelist a young master popular in parisian drawing-room have a fine brow caress brown eye and a large red mouth which he moustache and beard cut in the assyrian style and carefully curl help to conceal he have make he way thanks to woman whose society he seek under pretext of study they but whom he be resolve to use as instrument of fortune as a matter of calculation and principle he have remain a bachelor and generally install himself in the nest of other in literature feminine frailty be he stock subject he have make it he specialty to depict scene of guilty love amid elegant refined surroundings at first he have no illusion as to the literary value of he work he have simply choose in a deliberate way what he deem to be a pleasant and lucrative trade but dupe by he success he have allow pride to persuade he that he be really a writer and nowadays he pose as the painter of a expire society profess the greatest pessimism and base a new religion on the annihilation of human passion which annihilation would insure the final happiness of the world seguin will be here in a moment he resume in a amiable way it occur to I to take he and he wife to dine at a restaurant this evening before go to a certain first performance where there will probably be some fisticuffs and a rumpus to-night mathieu then for the first time notice that santerre be in evening dress they continue chat for a moment and the novelist call attention to a new pewter treasure among seguin 's collection it represent a long thin woman stretch full-length with she hair streaming around she she seem to be sob as she lay there and santerre declare the conception to be a masterpiece the figure symbolize the end of woman reduce to despair and solitude when man should finally have make up he mind to have nothing further to do with she it be the novelist who in literary and artistic matter help on the insanity which be gradually spring up in the seguin ' home however seguin himself now make he appearance he be of the same age as santerre but be taller and slimmer with fair hair a aquiline nose gray eye and thin lip shaded by a slight moustache he also be in evening dress ah well my dear fellow say he with the slight lisp which he affect valentine be determine to put on a new gown so we must be patient we shall have a hour to wait then on catch sight of mathieu he begin to apologize evince much politeness and strive to accentuate he air of frigid distinction when the young man whom he call he amiable tenant have acquaint he with the motive of he visit -- the leak in the zinc roof of the little pavilion at janville -- he at once consent to let the local plumber do any necessary soldering but when after fresh explanation he understand that the roofing be so worn and damage that it require to be change entirely he suddenly depart from he lofty affability and begin to protest declare that he could not possibly expend in such repair a sum which would exceed the whole annual rental of six hundred franc some soldering he repeat some soldering it be understand i will write to the plumber and wish to change the subject he add : oh wait a moment monsieur froment you be a man of taste i know and i want to show you a marvel he really have some esteem for mathieu for he know that the young fellow possess a quick appreciative mind mathieu begin to smile outwardly yield to this attempt to create a diversion but determine at heart that he would not leave the place until he have obtain the promise of a new roof he take hold of a book clothe in a marvellous binding which seguin have fetch from a bookcase and tender with religious care on the cover of soft snow-white leather be incrust a long silver lily intersect by a tuft of big violet thistle the title of the work beauty imperishable be engrave up above as in a corner of the sky ah what a delightful conception what delightful coloring declare mathieu who be really charm some binding nowadays be perfect gem then he notice the title : why it be monsieur santerre 's last novel say he seguin smile and glance at the writer who have draw near and when he see he examine the book and look quite move by the compliment pay to it he exclaim : my dear fellow the binder bring it here this morning and i be await a opportunity to surprise you with it it be the pearl of my collection what do you think of the idea -- that lily which symbolize triumphant purity and those thistle the plant which spring up among ruin and which symbolize the sterility of the world at last desert again win over to the only perfect felicity all you work lie in those symbol you know yes yes but you spoil I you will end by make I proud mathieu have read santerre 's novel have borrow a copy of it from mme beauchene in order that he wife might see it since it be a book that everybody be talk of and the perusal of it have exasperate he forsake the customary bachelor 's flat where in previous work he have be so fond of lay scene of debauchery santerre have this time try to rise to the level of pure art and lyrical symbolism the story he tell be one of a certain countess anne-marie who to escape a rough-mannered husband of extreme masculinity have seek a refuge in brittany in the company of a young painter endowed with divine inspiration one norbert who have undertake to decorate a convent chapel with painting that depict he various vision and for thirty year he go on painting there ever in colloquy with the angel and ever have anne-marie beside he and during those thirty year of love the countess 's beauty remain unimpaired she be as young and as fresh at the finish as at the outset whereas certain secondary personage introduce into the story wife and mother of a neighbor little town sink into physical and mental decay and monstrous decrepitude mathieu consider the author 's theory that all physical beauty and moral nobility belong to virgin only to be thoroughly imbecile and he could not restrain himself from hint he disapproval of it both santerre and seguin however hotly oppose he and quite a discussion ensue first santerre take up the matter from a religious standpoint say he the word of the old testament increase and multiply be not to be find in the new testament which be the true basis of the christian religion the first christian he declare have hold marriage in horror and with they the holy virgin have become the ideal of womanhood seguin thereupon nod approval and proceed to give he opinion on feminine beauty but these be hardly to the taste of mathieu who promptly point out that the conception of beauty have often varied to-day say he you conceive beauty to consist in a long slim attenuate almost angular figure but at the time of the renaissance the type of the beautiful be very different take ruben take titian take even raffaelle and you will see that they woman be of robust build even they virgin mary have a motherly air to my think moreover if we revert to some such natural type of beauty if woman be not encourage by fashion to compress and attenuate they figure so that they very nature they very organism be change there would perhaps be some hope of cope with the evil of depopulation which be talk about so much nowadays the other look at he and smile with a air of compassionate superiority depopulation a evil exclaimed seguin can you my dear sir intelligent as you be still believe in that hackneyed old story come reflect and reason a little then santerre chime in and they go on talk one after the other and at time both together schopenhauer and hartmann and nietzsche be pass in review and they claim malthus as one of themselves but all this literary pessimism do not trouble mathieu he with he belief in fruitfulness remain convinced that the nation which no longer have faith in life must be dangerously ill true there be hour when he doubt the expediency of numerous family and ask himself if ten thousand happy people be not preferable to a hundred thousand unhappy one in which connection political and economic condition have to be take into account but when all be say he remain almost convince that the malthusian hypothesis would prove as false in the future as they have prove false in the past moreover say he even if the world should become densely populate even if food supplies such as we know they should fall short chemistry would extract other means of subsistence from inorganic matter and besides all such eventuality be so far away that it be impossible to make any calculation on a basis of scientific certainty in france too instead of contribute to any such danger we be go backward we be march towards annihilation the population of france be once a fourth of the population of europe but now it be only one-eighth in a century or two pari will be dead like ancient athen and ancient rome and we shall have fall to the rank that greece now occupy pari seem determine to die but santerre protest : no no pari simply wish to remain stationary and it wish this precisely because it be the most intelligent most highly civilized city in the world the more nation advance in civilization the smaller become they birth-rate we be simply give the world a example of high culture superior intelligence and other nation will certainly follow that example when in turn they also attain to we state of perfection there be sign of this already on every side quite so exclaimed seguin back up he friend the phenomenon be general all the nation show the same symptom and be decrease in number or will decrease as soon as they become civilized japan be affect already and the same will be the case with china as soon as europe force open the door there mathieu have become grave and attentive since the two society man seat before he in evening dress have begin to talk more rationally the pale slim flat virgin they ideal of feminine beauty be no longer in question the history of mankind be pass by and almost as if commune with himself he say : so you do not fear the yellow peril that terrible swarming of asiatic barbarian who it be say would at some fatal moment sweep down on we europe ravage it and people it afresh in past age history always begin anew in that fashion by the sudden shift of ocean the invasion of fierce rough race come to endow weakened nation with new blood and after each such occurrence civilization flower afresh more broadly and freely than ever how be it that babylon nineveh and memphi fall into dust with they population who seem to have die on the spot how be it that athen and rome still agonize to-day unable to spring afresh from they ash and renew the splendor of they ancient glory how be it that death have already lay its hand upon pari which whatever she splendor be but the capital of a france whose virility be weaken you may argue as you please and say that like the ancient capital of the world pari be die of a excess of culture intelligence and civilization it be none the less a fact that she be approach death the turn of the tide which will carry splendor and power to some new nation you theory of equilibrium be wrong nothing can remain stationary whatever cease to grow decrease and disappear and if pari be bent on die she will die and the country with she well for my part declare santerre resume the pose of a elegant pessimist if she wish to die i sha not oppose she in fact i be fully determine to help she it be evident that the really honest sensible course be to check any increase of population add seguin but mathieu as if he have not hear they go on : i know herbert spencer 's law and i believe it to be theoretically correct it be certain that civilization be a check to fruitfulness so that one may picture a series of social evolution conduce now to decrease and now to increase of population the whole end in final equilibrium by the very effect of culture 's victory when the world shall be entirely populated and civilized but who can foretell what road will be follow through what disaster and suffering one may have to go more and more nation may disappear and other may replace they and how many thousand of year may not be need before the final adjustment compound of truth justice and peace be arrive at at the thought of this the mind tremble and hesitate and the heart contract with a pang deep silence fall while he thus remain disturbed shake in he faith in the good power of life and at a loss as to who be right -- he or those two man so languidly stretch out before he but valentine seguin 's wife come in laughing and make a exhibition of masculine way which it have cost she much trouble to acquire ah you people you must not bear I any malice you know that girl celeste take such a time over everything at five-and-twenty valentine be short slight and still girlish fair with a delicate face laugh blue eye and a pert little nose she could not claim to be pretty still she be charming and droll and very free and easy in she way for not only do she husband take she about with he to all sort of objectionable place but she have become quite familiar with the artist and writer who frequent the house thus it be only in the presence of something extremely insulting that she again show herself the last of the vaugelade and would all at once draw herself up and display haughty contempt and frigidity ah it be you monsieur froment she say amiably step towards mathieu and shake he hand in cavalier fashion be madame froment in good health be the child flourish as usual seguin be examine she dress a gown of white silk trim with unbleached lace and he suddenly give way to one of those horribly rude fit which burst forth at time amid all he great affectation of politeness what have you keep we wait all this time to put that rag on well you never look a greater fright in you life and she have enter the room convince that she look charming she make a effort to control herself but she girlish face darkened and assume a expression of haughty vindictive revolt then she slowly turn she eye towards the friend who be present and who be gaze at she with ecstasy strive to accentuate the slavish submissiveness of he attitude you look delicious he murmur that gown be a marvel seguin laugh and twit santerre on he obsequiousness towards woman valentine mollify by the compliment soon recover she birdlike gayety and such free and easy conversation ensue between the trio that mathieu feel both stupefy and embarrass in fact he would have go off at once have it not be for he desire to obtain from he landlord a promise to repair the pavilion properly wait another moment valentine at last say to she husband i tell celeste to bring the child so that we might kiss they before start mathieu wish to profit by this fresh delay and seek to renew he request but valentine be already rattle on again talk of dining at the most disreputable restaurant possible and ask if at the first performance which they be to attend they would see all the horror which have be hiss at the dress rehearsal the night before she appear like a pupil of the two man between whom she stand she even go further in she opinion than they do display the wildest pessimism and such extreme view on literature and art that they themselves could not forbear laugh wagner be greatly over-estimate in she opinion she ask for invertebrate music the free harmony of the pass wind as for she moral view they be enough to make one shudder she have get past the argumentative amours of ibsen 's idiotic rebellious heroine and have now reach the theory of pure intangible beauty she deem santerre 's last creation anne-marie to be far too material and degraded because in one deplorable passage the author remark that norbert 's kiss have leave they trace on the countess 's brow santerre dispute the quotation whereupon she rush upon the volume and seek the page to which she have refer but i never degrade she exclaim the novelist in despair she never have a child pooh what of that exclaimed valentine if anne-marie be to raise we heart she ought to be like spotless marble and norbert 's kiss should leave no mark upon she but she be interrupt for celeste the maid a tall dark girl with a equine head big feature and a pleasant air now come in with the two child gaston be at this time five year old and lucie be three both be slight and delicate pale like rose bloom in the shade like they mother they be fair the lad 's hair be incline to be carroty while that of the girl suggest the color of oats and they also have they mother 's blue eye but they face be elongate like that of they father dress in white with they lock curl arrayed indeed in the most coquettish style they look like big fragile doll the parent be touch in they worldly pride at sight of they and insist on they play they part with due propriety well do not you wish anybody good evening the child be not timid they be already use to society and look visitor full in the face if they make little haste it be because they be naturally indolent and do not care to obey they at last make up they mind and allow themselves to be kiss good evening good friend santerre then they hesitate before mathieu and they father have to remind they of the gentleman 's name though they have already see he on two or three occasion good evening monsieur froment valentine take hold of they sit they on she lap and half stifle they with caress she seem to adore they but as soon as she have sit they down again she forget all about they so you be go out again mamma ask the little boy why yes my darling papa and mamma you know have they affair to see to so we shall have dinner all alone mamma valentine do not answer but turn towards the maid who be wait for order -- you be not to leave they for a moment celeste -- you hear and above all thing they be not to go into the kitchen i can never come home without find they in the kitchen it be exasperate let they have they dinner at seven and put they to bed at nine and see that they go to sleep the big girl with the equine head listen with a air of respectful obedience while she faint smile express the cunning of a norman peasant who have be

so far as there be happiness in life it would perhaps be better for they never to have be bear however my duty to the country be do each wife ought to have a boy and a girl as i have thereupon mathieu see that she be jest venture to say with a laugh : well that be not the opinion of you medical man dr boutan he declare that to make the country prosperous every married couple ought to have four child four child he be mad cry seguin and again with the greatest freedom of language he bring forward he pet theory there be a world of meaning in he wife 's laughter while celeste stand there unmoved and the child listen without understanding but at last santerre lead the seguin away it be only in the hall that mathieu obtain from he landlord a promise that he would write to the plumber at janville and that the roof of the pavilion should be entirely renovate since the rain come into the bedroom the seguin ' landau be wait at the door when they have get into it with they friend it occur to mathieu to raise he eye and at one of the window he perceive celeste standing between the two child intent no doubt on assure herself that monsieur and madame be really go the young man recall reine 's departure from she parent but here both lucie and gaston remain motionless gravely mournful and neither they father nor they mother once think of look up at they iv at half-past seven o'clock when mathieu arrive at the restaurant on the place de la madeleine where he be to meet he employer he find he already there drink a glass of madeira with he customer m firon-badinier the dinner be a remarkable one choice viand and the best wine be serve in abundance but mathieu be strike less by the appetite which the other display than by beauchene 's activity and skill glass in hand never lose a bite he have already persuade he customer by the time the roast arrive to order not only the new thresher but also a mow machine m firon-badinier be to take the train for evreux at nine-twenty and when nine o'clock strike the other now eager to be rid of he contrived to pack he off in a cab to the st-lazare railway station for a moment beauchene remain standing on the pavement with mathieu and take off he hat in order that the mild breeze of that delightful may evening might cool he burn head well that be settle he say with a laugh but it be not so easily manage it be the pommard which induce the beggar to make up he mind all the same i be dreadfully afraid he would make I miss my appointment these remark which escape he amid he semi-intoxication lead he to more confidential talk he put on he hat again light a fresh cigar and take mathieu 's arm then they walk on slowly through the passion-stirred throng and the nightly blaze of the boulevard there be plenty of time say beauchene i be not expect till half-past nine and it be close by will you have a cigar no you never smoke never well my dear fellow it would be ridiculous to feign with you since you happen to see I this morning oh it be a stupid affair i be quite of that opinion but then what would you have thereupon he launch out into long explanation concern he marital life and the intrigue which have suddenly spring up between he and that girl norine old moineaud 's daughter he profess the greatest respect for he wife but he be nevertheless a loose liver and constance be now begin to resign herself to the inevitable she close she eye when it would have be unpleasant for she to keep they open she know very well that it be essential that the business should be keep together and pass intact into the hand of they son maurice a tribe of child would have mean the ruin of all they plan mathieu listen at first in great astonishment and then begin to ask question and raise objection at most of which beauchene laugh gayly like the gross egotist he be he talk at length with extreme volubility go into all sort of detail at time assume a semi-apologetic manner but more frequently justify himself with a air of triumph and finally when they reach the corner of the rue caumartin he halt to bid mathieu good-by he there have a little bachelor 's lodging which be keep in order by the concierge of the house who be very well pay prove a extremely discreet domestic as he hurry off mathieu still stand at the corner of the street could not help thinking of the scene which he have witness at the beauchene work that day he think of old moineaud the fitter whom he again see standing silent and unmoved in the woman 's workroom while he daughter euphrasie be be soundly rate by beauchene and while norine the other girl look on with a sly laugh when the toiler 's child have grow up and go to join the lad the army of slaughter and the girl the army of vice the father degrade by the ill of life pay little heed to it all to he it be seemingly a matter of indifference to what disaster the wind may carry the fledgeling who fall from the nest it be now half-past nine o'clock and mathieu have more than a hour before he to reach the northern railway station so he do not hurry but stroll very leisurely up the boulevard he have eat and drunk far more than usual and beauchene 's insidious confidential talk still buzz in he ear help on he intoxication he hand be hot and now and again a sudden glow pass over he face and what a warm evening it be too on those boulevard blaze with electric light fever by a swarm jostle throng amid a ceaseless rumble of cab and omnibus it be all like a stream of ardent life flow away into the night and mathieu allow himself to be carry on by the torrent whose hot breath whose glow of passion he ever feel sweeping over he then in a reverie he picture the day he have just spend first he be at the beauchene ' in the morning and see the father and mother standing like accomplice who fully share one another 's view beside the sofa on which maurice they only son lay doze with a pale and waxen face the work must never be expose to the danger of be subdivide maurice alone must inherit all the million which the business might yield so that he might become one of the prince of industry and therefore the husband hurry off to sin while the wife close she eye in this sense in defiance of morality and health do the capitalist bourgeoisie which have replace the old nobility virtually re-establish the law of primogeniture that law have be abolish at the revolution for the bourgeoisie 's benefit but now also for its own purpose it revive it each family must have but one son mathieu have reach this stage in he reflection when he thought be divert by several street hawker who in sell the last edition of a evening print announce a drawing of the lottery stock of some enterprise launch by the credit national and then he suddenly recall the morange in they dining-room and hear they recapitulate they dream of make a big fortune as soon as the accountant should have secure a post in one of the big banking establishment where the principal raise man of value to the highest post those morange live in everlasting dread of see they daughter marry a needy petty clerk succumb to that irresistible fever which in a democracy ravage by political equality and economic inequality impel every one to climb higher up the social ladder envy consume they at the thought of the luxury of other they plunge into debt in order that they might imitate from afar the elegance of the upper class and all they natural honesty and good nature be poison by the insanity bear of ambitious pride and here again but one child be permissible lest they should be embarrassed delay forever impede in the attainment of the future they covet a crowd of people now bar mathieu 's way and he perceive that he be near the theater where a first performance be take place that evening it be a theater where free farcical piece be produce and on its wall be post huge portrait of its star a carroty wench with a long flat figure destitute of all womanliness and seemingly symbolical of perversity passer-by stop to gaze at the bill the vilest remark be hear and mathieu remember that the seguin and santerre be inside the house laughing at the piece which be of so filthy a nature that the spectator at the dress rehearsal though they be by no means over-nice in such matter have express they disgust by almost wreck the auditorium and while the seguin be gloat over this horror yonder at they house in the avenue d'antin celeste have just put the child gaston and lucie to bed and have then hastily return to the kitchen where a friend madame menoux who keep a little haberdasher 's shop in the neighborhood await she gaston have be give some wine to drink be already asleep but lucie who again feel sick lay shiver in she bed not daring to call celeste lest the servant who do not like to be disturb should ill-treat she and at two o'clock in the morning after offer santerre a oyster supper at a night restaurant the seguin would come home they mind unhinge by the imbecile literature and art to which they have take for fashion 's sake vitiate yet more by the ignoble performance they have witness and the base society they have elbow at supper they seem to typify vice for vice 's sake elegant vice and pessimism as a principle indeed when mathieu try to sum up he day he find vice on every side in each of the sphere with which he have come in contact and now the example he have witness fill he no longer with mere surprise they disturb he they shake he belief they make he doubt whether he notion of life duty and happiness might not after all be inaccurate he stop short and draw a long breath seek to drive away he grow intoxication he have pass the grand opera and be reach the crossway of the rue drouot perhaps he increase of fever be due to those glowing boulevard the private room of the restaurant be still ablaze the cafe throw bright radiance across the road the pavement be block by they table and chair and customer all pari seem to have come down thither to enjoy that delightful evening there be endless elbow endless mingling of breath as the swell crowd saunter along couple linger before the sparkling display of jeweller ' shop middle-class family sweep under dazzling arch of electric lamp into cafe concert whose huge poster promise the grossest amusement hundred and hundred of woman go by with trail skirt and whisper and jest and laugh while man dart in pursuit now of a fair chignon now of a dark one in the open cab man and woman sit side by side now husband and wife long since marry now chance couple who have meet but a hour ago but mathieu go on again yield to the force of the current carry along like all the other a prey to the same fever which spring from the surroundings from the excitement of the day from the custom of the age and he no longer take the beauchene the morange the seguin as isolate type it be all pari that symbolize vice all pari that yield to debauchery and sink into degradation there be the folk of high culture the folk suffer from literary neurosis there be the merchant prince there be the man of liberal profession the lawyer the doctor the engineer there be the people of the lower middle-class the petty tradesman the petty clerk there be even the manual worker poison by the example of the upper sphere -- all practise the doctrine of egotism as vanity and the passion for money grow more and more intense no more child pari be bent on die and mathieu recall how napoleon i one evening after battle on behold a plain strew with the corpse of he soldier have put he trust in pari to repair the carnage of that day but time have change paris would no longer supply life whether it be for slaughter or for toil and as mathieu thought of it all a sudden weakness come upon he again he ask himself whether the beauchene the morange the seguin and all those thousand and thousand around he be not right and whether he be not the fool the dupe the criminal with he belief in life ever renascent ever grow and spread throughout the world and before he arise too the image of seraphine the temptress open she perfumed arm to he and carry he off to the same existence of pleasure and baseness which the other lead then he remember the three hundred franc which he carry in he pocket three hundred franc which must last for a whole month though out of they he have to pay various little sum that he already owe the remainder would barely suffice to buy a ribbon for marianne and jam for the youngster ' bread and if he set the morange on one side the other the beauchene and the seguin be rich he bitterly recall they wealth he picture the rumble factory with its black building cover a great stretch of ground he picture hundred of workman ever increase the fortune of they master who dwell in a handsomely appoint pavilion and whose only son be grow up for future sovereignty under he mother 's vigilant eye he picture too the seguin ' luxurious mansion in the avenue d'antin the great hall the magnificent staircase the vast room above crowd with marvel he picture all the refinement all the train of wealth all the token of lavish life the big dowry which would be give to the little girl the high position which would be purchase for the son and he bare and empty-handed who now possess nothing not even a stone at the edge of a field would doubtless always possess nothing neither factory buzz with workman nor mansion rear its proud front aloft and he be the imprudent one and the other be the sensible the wise what would ever become of himself and he troop of child would he not die in some garret would they not lead life of abject wretchedness ah it be evident the other be right the other be sensible and he feel unhinge he regard himself with contempt like a fool who have allow himself to be dupe then once more the image of seraphine arise before he eye more tempting than ever a slight quiver come upon he as he behold the blaze of the northern railway station and all the feverish traffic around it wild fancy surge through he brain he think of beauchene why should he not do likewise he recall past time and yield to sudden madness turn he back upon the station and retrace he step towards the boulevard seraphine he say to himself be doubtless wait for he she have tell he that he would always be welcome as for he wife he would tell she he have miss he train at last a block in the traffic make he pause and on raise he eye he see that he have reach the boulevard once more the crowd still stream along but with increase feverishness mathieu 's temple be beat and wild word escape he lip why should he not live the same life as the other he be ready even eager to plunge into it but the block in the traffic continue he could not cross the road and while he stand there hesitation and doubt come upon he he see in that increase obstruction a deliberate obstacle to he wild design and all at once the image of seraphine fade from before he mind 's eye and he behold another he wife he dear wife marianne await he all smile and trustfulness in the fresh quietude of the country could he deceive she then all at once he again rush off towards the railway station in fear lest he should lose he train he be determine that he would listen to no further prompting that he would cast no further glance upon glowing dissolute pari and he reach the station just in time to climb into a car the train start and he journey on lean out of he compartment and offer he face to the cool night breeze in order that it might calm and carry off the evil fever that have possess he the night be moonless but stud with such pure and such glowing star that the country could be see spread far away beneath a soft bluish radiance already at twenty minute past eleven marianne find herself on the little bridge cross the yeuse midway between chanteble the pavilion where she and she husband live and the station of janville the child be fast asleep she have leave they in the charge of zoe the servant who sit knit beside a lamp the light of which could be see from afar show like a bright spark amid the black line of the wood whenever mathieu return home by the seven o'clock train as be he wont marianne come to meet he at the bridge occasionally she bring she two eldest boy the twin with she though they little leg move but slowly on the return journey when in retrace they step a thousand yard or more they have to climb a rather steep hillside and that evening late though the hour be marianne have yield to that pleasant habit of hers enjoy the delight of thus go forward through the lovely night to meet the man she worship she never go further than the bridge which arch over the narrow river she seat herself on its broad low parapet as on some rustic bench and thence she overlook the whole plain as far as the house of janville before which pass the railway line and from afar she could see she husband approach along the road which wind between the cornfield that evening she take she usual seat under the broad velvety sky spangle with gold and with a movement which bespeak she solicitude she turn towards the bright little light shine on the verge of the sombre wood a light tell of the quietude of the room in which it burn the servant 's tranquil vigil and the happy slumber of the child in the adjoining chamber then marianne let she gaze wander all around she over the great estate of chantebled belong to the seguin the dilapidated pavilion stand at the extreme edge of the wood whose copse intersect by patch of heath spread over a lofty plateau to the distant farm of mareuil and lillebonne but that be not all for to the west of the plateau lay more than two hundred and fifty acre of land a marshy expanse where pool stagnate amid brushwood vast uncultivated tract where one go duck-shooting in winter and there be yet a third part of the estate acre upon acre of equally sterile soil all sand and gravel descend in a gentle slope to the embankment of the railway line it be indeed a stretch of country lose to culture where the few good patch of loam remain unproductive inclose within the waste land but the spot have all the beauty and exquisite wildness of solitude and be one that appeal to healthy mind fond of see nature in freedom and on that lovely night one could nowhere have find more perfect and more balmy quiet marianne who since come to the district have already thread the woodland path explore the stretch of brushwood around the mere and descend the pebbly slope let she eye travel slowly over the expanse divine spot she have visit and be fond of though the darkness now prevent she from see they in the depths of the wood a owl raise its soft regular cry while from a pond on the right ascend a faint croaking of frog so far away that it sound like the vibration of crystal and from the other side the side of pari there come a grow rumble which little by little rise above all the other sound of the night she hear it and at last lend ear to nothing else it be the train for whose familiar roar she wait every evening as soon as it leave monval station on its way to janville it give token of its come but so faintly that only a practice ear could distinguish its rumble amid the other sound rise from the country side for she part she hear it immediately and thereupon follow it in fancy through every phase of its journey and never have she be better able to do so than on that splendid night amid the profound quietude of the earth 's slumber it have leave monval it be turn beside the brickwork it be skirt st george 's field in another two minute it would be at janville then all at once its white light shone out beyond the poplar tree of le mesnil rouge and the panting of the engine grow louder like that of some giant racer drawing near on that side the plain spread far away into a dark unknown region beneath the star-spangled sky which on the very horizon show a ruddy reflection like that of some brasier the reflection of nocturnal pari blaze and smoking in the darkness like a volcano marianne spring to she foot the train stop at janville and then its rumble rise again grow fainter and die away in the direction of vieux-bourg but she no longer pay attention to it she now have eye and ear only for the road which wind like a pale ribbon between the dark patch of corn she husband do not take ten minute to cover the thousand yard and more which separate the station from the little bridge and as a rule she perceive and recognize he far off but on that particular night such be the deep silence that she could distinguish he footfall on the echo road long before he dark slim figure show against the pale ground and he find she there erect under the star smile and healthy a picture of all that be good the milky whiteness of she skin be accentuate by she beautiful black hair catch up in a huge coil and she big black eye which beam with all the gentleness of spouse and mother she straight brow she nose she mouth she chin so boldly purely round she cheek which glow like savory fruit she delightful little ear -- the whole of she face full of love and tenderness bespoke beauty in full health the gayety which come from the accomplishment of duty and the serene conviction that by loving life she would live as she ought to live what so you have come then mathieu exclaimed as soon as he be near she but i begged you not to come out so late be you not afraid at be alone on the road at this time of night she begin to laugh afraid say she when the night be so mild and healthful besides would not you rather have I here to kiss you ten minute sooner those simple word bring tear to mathieu 's eye all the murkiness all the shame through which he have pass in pari horrify he he tenderly take he wife in he arm and they exchange the closest the most human of kiss amid the quiet of the slumbering field after the scorching pavement of pari after the eager struggle of the day and the degrading spectacles of the night how reposeful be that far-spreading silence that faint bluish radiance that endless unrolling of plain steep in refreshing gloom and dream of fructification by the morrow 's sun and what suggestion of health and rectitude and felicity rise from productive nature who fall asleep beneath the dew of night solely that she might reawaken in triumph ever and ever rejuvenate by life 's torrent which stream even through the dust of she path mathieu slowly seat marianne on the low broad parapet once more he keep she near he heart it be a halt full of affection which neither could forego in presence of the universal peace that come to they from the star and the water and the wood and the endless field what a splendid night murmur mathieu how beautiful and how pleasant to live in it then after a moment 's rapture during which they both hear they heart beat he begin to tell she of he day she question he with loving interest and he answer happy at have to tell she no lie no the beauchene can not come here on Sunday constance never care much for we as you well know they boy maurice be suffer in the leg dr boutan be there and the question of child be discuss again i will tell you all about that on the other hand the morange have promise to come you can not have a idea of the delight and vanity they display in show I they new flat what with they eagerness to make a big fortune i be much afraid that those worthy folk will do something very foolish oh i be forget i call on the landlord and though i have a good deal of difficulty over it he end by consent to have the roof entirely relay ah what a home too those seguin have i come away feel quite scared but i will tell you all about it by and by with the rest marianne evince no loquacious curiosity she quietly await he confidence and show anxiety only respect themselves and the child you receive you salary do not you she ask yes yes you need not be afraid about that oh i be not afraid it be only we little debt which worry I then she ask again : and do you business dinner go off all right i be afraid that beauchene might detain you and make you miss you train he reply that everything have go off properly but as he speak he flush and feel a pang at he heart to rid himself of he emotion he affect sudden gayety well and you my dear he ask how do you manage with you thirty sous my thirty sous she gayly respond why i be much too rich we fare like prince all five of we and i have six sous left then in she turn she give a account of she day she daily life pure as crystal she recapitulate what she have do what she have say she related how the child have behave and she enter into the minutest detail respect they and the house with she moreover one day be like another each morning she set herself to live the same life afresh with never-failing happiness to-day though we have a visit say she madame lepailleur the woman from the mill over yonder come to tell I that she have some fine chicken for sale as we owe she twelve franc for egg and milk i believe that she simply call to see if i mean to pay she i tell she that i would go to she place to-morrow while speak marianne have point through the gloom towards a big black pile a little way down the yeuse it be a old water-mill which be still work and the lepailleur have now be install in it for three generation the last of they francoi lepailleur who consider himself to be no fool have come back from he military service with little inclination to work and a idea that the mill would never enrich he any more than it have enrich he father and grandfather it then occur to he to marry a peasant farmer 's daughter victoire cornu whose dowry consist of some neighbor field skirt the yeuse and the young couple then live fairly at they ease on the produce of those field and such small quantity of corn as the peasant of the district still bring to be ground at the old mill if the antiquated and badly repair mechanism of the mill have be replace by modern appliance and if the land instead of be impoverish by adherence to old-fashioned practice have fall into the hand of a intelligent man who believe in progress there would no doubt have be a fortune in it all but lepailleur be not only disgusted with work he treat the soil with contempt he indeed typify the peasant who have grow weary of he eternal mistress the mistress whom he forefather love too much remember that in spite of all they effort to fertilize the soil it have never make they rich or happy he have end by hate it all he faith in its power have depart he accuse it of have lose its fertility of be use up and decrepit like some old cow which one send to the slaughter-house and accord to he everything go wrong : the soil simply devour the seed sown in it the weather be never such as it should be the season no longer come in they proper order briefly it be all a premeditated disaster bring about by some evil power which have a spite against the peasantry who be foolish to give they sweat and they blood to such a thankless creature madame lepailleur bring she boy with she a little fellow three year old call antonin resume marianne and we fall to talk of child together she quite surprise I peasant folk you know use to have such large family but she declare that one child be quite enough yet she be only twenty-four and she husband not yet twenty-seven these remark revive the thought which have fill mathieu 's mind all day for a moment he remain silent then he say she give you she reason no doubt give reason -- she with she head like a horse 's she long freckled face pale eye and tight miserly mouth -- i think she be simply a fool ever in admiration before she husband because he fight in africa and read the newspaper all that i could get out of she be that child cost one a good deal more than they bring in but the husband no doubt have idea of he own you have see he have not you a tall slim fellow as carroty and as scraggy as he wife with a angular face green eye and prominent cheekbone he look as though he have never feel in a good humor in he life and i understand that he be always complain of he father-in-law because the other have three daughter and a son of course that cut down he wife 's dowry she inherit only a part of she father 's property and besides as the trade of a miller never enriched he father lepailleur curse he mill from morning till night and declare that he will not prevent he boy antonin from go to eat white bread in paris if he can find a good berth there when he grow up thus even among the country folk mathieu find a small family the rule among the cause be the fear of have to split up a inheritance the desire to rise in the social system the disgust of manual toil and the thirst for the luxury of town life since the soil be become bankrupt why indeed continue till it when one know that one would never grow rich by do so mathieu be on the point of explain these thing to he wife but he hesitate and then simply say : lepailleur do wrong to complain he have two cow and a horse and when there be urgent work he can take a assistant we this morning have just thirty sous belong to we and we own no mill no scrap of land for my part i think he mill superb i envy he every time i cross this bridge just fancy we two be the miller -- why we should be very rich and very happy this make they both laugh and for another moment they remain seat there watch the dark massive mill beside the yeuse between the willow and poplar on both bank the little river flow on peacefully scarce murmuring as it course among the water plant which make it ripple then amid a clump of oak appear the big shed shelter the wheel and the other building garland with ivy honeysuckle and creeper the whole form a spot of romantic prettiness and at night especially when the mill sleep without a light at any of its window there be nothing of more dreamy more gentle charm why remark mathieu lower he voice there be somebody under the willow beside the water i hear a slight noise yes i know reply marianne with tender gayety it must be the young couple who settle themselves in the little house yonder a fortnight ago you know whom i mean -- madame angelin that schoolmate of constance 's the angelin who have become they neighbor interested the froment the wife be of the same age as marianne tall dark with fine hair and fine eye radiant with continual joy and fond of pleasure and the husband be of the same age as mathieu a handsome fellow very much in love with moustache wave in the wind and the joyous spirit of a musketeer they have marry with sudden passion for one another have between they a income of some ten thousand franc a year which the husband a fan painter with a pretty talent might have double have it not be for the spirit of amorous idleness into which he marriage have throw he and that spring-time they have seek a refuge in that desert of janville that they might love freely passionately in the midst of nature they be always to be meet hold each other by the waist on the secluded path in the wood and at night they love to stroll across the field beside the hedge along the shady bank of the yeuse delighted when they could linger till very late near the murmur water in the thick shade of the willow but there be quite another side to they idyl and marianne mention it to she husband she have chat with madame angelin and it appear that the latter wish to enjoy life at all event for the present and do not desire to be burden with child then mathieu 's worrying thought once more come back to he and again at this fresh example he wonder who be right -- he who stand alone in he belief or all the other well he mutter at last we all live accord to we fancy but come my dear let we go in we disturb they they slowly climb the narrow road lead to chanteble where the lamp shine out like a beacon when mathieu have bolt the front door they grope they way upstairs the ground floor of they little house comprise a dining-room and a drawing-room on the right hand of the hall and a kitchen and a store place on the left upstairs there be four bedroom they scanty furniture seem quite lose in those big room but exempt from vanity as they be they merely laugh at this by way of luxury they have simply hang some little curtain of red stuff at the window and the ruddy reflection from these hanging seem to they to impart wonderfully rich cheerfulness to they home they find zoe they peasant servant asleep over she knitting beside the lamp in they own bedroom and they have to wake she and send she as quietly as possible to bed then mathieu take up the lamp and enter the child 's room to kiss they and make sure that they be comfortable it be seldom they awake on these occasion have place the lamp on the mantelshelf he still stand there look at the three little bed when marianne join he in the bed against the wall at one end of the room lay blaise and deni the twin sturdy little fellow six year of age while in the second bed against the opposite wall be ambroise now nearly four and quite a little cherub and the third bed a cradle be occupy by mademoiselle rise fifteen month of age and wean for three week past she lay there half naked show she white flowerlike skin and she mother have to cover she up with the bedclothes which she have thrust aside with she self-willed little fist meantime the father busy himself with ambroise 's pillow which have slip aside both husband and wife come and go very gently and bent again and again over the child 's face to make sure that they be sleep peacefully they kiss they and linger yet a little longer fancy that they have hear blaise and deni stir at last the mother take up the lamp and they go off one after the other on tiptoe when they be in they room again marianne exclaimed : i do not want to worry you while we be out but rise make I feel anxious to-day i do not find she well and it be only this evening that i feel more at ease about she then see that mathieu start and turn pale she go on : oh it be nothing i should not have go out if i have feel the least fear for she but with those little folk one be never free from anxiety she then begin to make she preparation for the night but mathieu instead of imitate she sit down at the table where the lamp stand and draw the money pay to he by morange from he pocket when he have count those three hundred franc those fifteen loui he say in a bitter jest way the money have not grow on the road here it be you can pay we debt to-morrow this remark give he a fresh idea take he pencil he begin to jot down the various amount they owe on a blank page of he pocket diary we say twelve franc to the lepailleur for egg and milk how much do you owe the butcher he ask the butcher reply marianne who have sit down to take off she shoe well say twenty franc and the grocer and the baker i do not know exactly but about thirty franc altogether there be nobody else then mathieu add up the item : that make sixty-two franc say he take they away from three hundred and we shall have two hundred and thirty-eight leave eight franc a day at the utmost well we have a nice month before we with we four child to feed particularly if little rise should fall ill the remark surprise he wife who laugh gayly and confidently say : why what be the matter with you to-night my dear you seem to be almost in despair when as a rule you look forward to the morrow as full of promise you have often say that it be sufficient to love life if one wish to live happily as for I you know with you and the little one i feel the happiest richest woman in the world at this mathieu could restrain himself no longer he shake he head and mournfully begin to recapitulate the day he have just spend at great length he relieve he long-pent-up feeling he speak of they poverty and the prosperity of other he speak of the beauchene the morange the seguin the lepailleur of all he have see of they of all they have say of all they scarcely disguise contempt for a improvident starvele like himself he mathieu and she marianne would never have factory nor mansion nor mill nor a income of twelve thousand franc a year and they increase penury as the other say have be they own work they have certainly show themselves imprudent improvident and he go on with he recollection tell marianne that he fear nothing for himself but that he do not wish to condemn she and the little one to want and poverty she be surprise at first and by degree become colder more constrain as he tell she all that he have upon he mind tear slowly well into she eye and at last however lovingly he speak she could no longer restrain herself but burst into sob she do not question what he say she speak no word of revolt but it be evident that she whole be rebel and that she heart be sorely grieve he start greatly trouble when he see she tear something akin to she own feeling come upon he he be terribly distressed angry with himself do not weep my darling he exclaim as he press she to he : it be stupid brutal and wrong of I to speak to you in that way do not distress yourself i beg you we 'll think it all over and talk about it some other time she cease to weep but she continue silent cling to he with she head rest on he shoulder and mathieu by the side of that loving trustful woman all health and rectitude and purity feel more and more confuse more and more ashamed of himself ashamed of have give heed to the base sordid calculate principle which other make the basis of they life he think with loathing of the sudden frenzy which have possess he during the evening in paris some poison must have be instil into he vein he could not recognize himself but honor and rectitude clear-sightedness and trustfulness in life be fast return through the window which have remain open all the sound of the lovely spring night pour into the room it be spring the season of love and beneath the palpitating star in the broad heaven from field and forest and water come the murmur of germinate life and never have mathieu more fully realize that whatever loss may result whatever difficulty may arise whatever fate may be in store all the creative power of the world whether of the animal order whether of the order of the plant for ever and ever wage life 's great incessant battle against death man alone dissolute and diseased among all the other denizen of the world all the healthful force of nature seek death for death 's sake the annihilation of he species then mathieu again catch he wife in a close embrace printing on she lip a long ardent kiss ah dear heart forgive I i doubt both of we it would be impossible for either of we to sleep unless you forgive I well let the other hold we in derision and contempt if they choose let we love and live as nature tell we for you be right : therein lie true wisdom and true courage v mathieu rise noiselessly from he little folding iron bedstead beside the large one of mahogany on which marianne lay alone he look at she and see that she be awake and smile

exclaim they be awake you see oh well we may let they come since to-day be Sunday for a few moment there have be a noise as of a aviary in commotion in the adjoining room prattle shrill chirping and ring burst of laughter could be hear then come a noise as of pillow and bolster fly about while two little fist continue pummel the partition as if it be a drum yes yes say the mother smile and anxious answer they tell they to come they will be break everything if you do not thereupon the father himself strike the wall at which a victorious outburst cry of triumphal delight arise on the other side and mathieu scarcely have time to open the door before tramp and scuffle could be hear in the passage a triumphal entry follow all four of they wear long nightdresses fall to they little bare foot and they trot along and laugh with they brown hair streaming about they face quite pink and they eye radiant with candid delight ambroise though he be younger than he brother march first for

out in order that marianne might profit by the bright sunshine the child have be dress in readiness before sit down to table and it be scarcely more than one o'clock when the family turn the corner of the rue de la federation and find itself upon the quay this portion of grenelle lie between the champ de mar and the densely populated street of the center of the district have a aspect all its own characterize by vast bare expanse and long and almost desert street run at right angle and fringe by factory with lofty interminable gray wall during work-hour nobody pass along these street and on raise one 's head one see only lofty chimney belch forth thick coal smoke above the roof of big building with dusty window pane and if any large cart entrance happen to be open one may espy deep yard crowd with dray and full of acrid vapor the only sound be the strident puff of jet of steam the dull rumble of machinery and the sudden rattle of ironwork lower from the cart to the pavement but on sunday the factory do not work and the district then fall into death-like silence in summer time there be but bright sunshine heating the pavement in winter some icy snow-laden wind rush down the lonely street the population of grenelle be say to be the worst of paris both the most vicious and the most wretched the neighborhood of the ecole militaire attract thither a swarm of worthless woman who bring in they train all the scum of the populace in contrast to all this the gay bourgeois district of passy rise up across the seine while the rich aristocratic quarter of the invalide and the faubourg st germain spread out close by thus the beauchene work on the quay as they owner laughingly say turn they back upon misery and look towards all the prosperity and gayety of this world mathieu be very partial to the avenue plant with fine tree which radiate from the champ de mar and the esplanade des invalides supply great gap for air and sunlight but he be particularly fond of that long diversified quaus d'orsay which start from the rue du bac in the very center of the city pass before the palais bourbon cross first the esplanade des invalides and then the champ de mar to end at the boulevard de grenelle in the black factory region how majestically it spread out what fine old leafy tree there be round that bend of the seine from the state tobacco work to the garden of the eiffel tower the river wind along with sovereign gracefulness the avenue stretch out under superb foliage you can really saunter there amid delicious quietude instinct as it be with all the charm and power of paris it be thither that mathieu wish to take he wife and the little one that Sunday but the distance be considerable and some anxiety be feel respect rise 's little leg she be intrust to ambroise who although the youngest of the boy be already energetic and determine these two open the march then come blaise and deni the twin the parent bring up the rear everything at first go remarkably well : they stroll on slowly in the gay sunshine that beautiful winter afternoon be exquisitely pure and clear and though it be very cold in the shade all seem golden and velvety in the stretch of bright light there be a great many people out of door -- all the idle folk clothe in they Sunday best whom the faintest sunshine draw in crowd to the promenade of pari little rise feeling warm and gay draw herself up as if to show the people that she be a big girl she cross the whole extent of the champ de mar without ask to be carry and she three brother stride along make the frozen pavement resound beneath they step promenader be ever turn round to watch they in other city of europe the sight of a young married couple precede by four child would have excite no comment but here in paris the spectacle be so unusual that remark of astonishment sarcasm and even compassion be exchange mathieu and marianne divined even if they do not actually hear these comment but they care nothing for they they bravely go they way smile at one another and feel convinced that the course they have take in life be the right one whatever other folk might think or say it be three o'clock when they turn they step homeward and marianne feeling rather tired then take a little rest on a sofa in the drawing-room where zoe have previously light a good fire the child quiet by fatigue be sit round a little table listen to a tale which deni read from a story-book when a visitor be announce this prove to be constance who after drive out with maurice have think of call to inquire after marianne whom she see only once or twice a week although the little pavilion be merely separate by a garden from the large house on the quay oh be you poorly my dear she inquire as she enter the room and perceive marianne on the sofa oh dear no reply the other but i have be out walk for the last two hour and be now take some rest mathieu have bring a armchair forward for he wife 's rich vain cousin who whatever she real feeling certainly strive to appear amiable she apologize for not be able to call more frequently and explain what a number of duty she have to discharge as mistress of she home meantime maurice clothe in black velvet hang round she petticoat gaze from a distance at the other child who one and all return he scrutiny well maurice exclaim he mother do not you wish you little cousin good-day he have to do as he be bid and step towards they but all five remain embarrassed they seldom meet and have as yet have no opportunity to quarrel the four little savage of chantebled feel indeed almost out of they element in the presence of this young parisian with bourgeois manners and be all you little folk quite well resume constance who with she sharp eye be compare she son with the other lad ambroise have grow he elder brother also look very strong she examination do not apparently result to maurice 's advantage the latter be tall and look sturdy but he have quite a waxen complexion nevertheless the glance that constance give the other be full of irony disdain and condemnation when she have first hear that marianne be likely to become a mother once more she have make no secret of she disapproval she hold to she old opinion more vigorously than ever marianne know full well that they would fall out if they discuss the subject of child seek another topic of conversation she inquire after beauchene and alexandre say she why do you not bring he with you i have not see he for a week why break in mathieu i tell you he have go shooting yesterday evening he sleep no doubt at puymoreau the other side of chanteble so as to be in the wood at daybreak this morning and he probably will not be home till to-morrow ah yes i remember now well it be nice weather to be in the wood this however be another perilous subject and marianne regret have broach it for truth to tell one never know where beauchene might really be when he claim to have go shooting he avail himself so often of this pretext to absent himself from home that constance be doubtless aware of the truth but in the presence of that household whose union be so perfect she be determine to show a brave front well you know say she it be i who compel he to go about and take as much exercise as possible he have a temperament that need the open air shooting be very good for he at this same moment there come another ring at the door announce another visitor and this time it be madame morange who enter the room with she daughter reine she color when she catch sight of madame beauchene so keenly be she impress by that perfect model of wealth and distinction whom she ever strive to imitate constance however profit by the diversion of valerie 's arrival to declare that she unfortunately could not remain any longer as a friend must now be wait for she at home well at all event leave we maurice suggest mathieu here 's reine here now and all six child can play a little while together i will bring you the boy by and by when he have have a little snack but maurice have already once more seek refuge among he mother 's skirt and she refuse the invitation oh no no say she he have to keep to a certain diet you know and he must not eat anything away from home good-by i must be off i call only to inquire after you all in pass keep well good-by then she lead she boy away never speak to valerie but simply shake hand with she in a familiar protect fashion which the other consider to be extremely distinguish reine on she side have smile at maurice whom she already slightly know she look delightful that day in she gown of thick blue cloth she face smile under she heavy black tress and show such a likeness to she mother that she seem to be the latter 's younger sister marianne quite charm call the girl to she : come and kiss I my dear oh what a pretty young lady why she be get quite beautiful and tall how old be she nearly thirteen valerie reply she have seat herself in the armchair vacate by constance and mathieu notice what a keen expression of anxiety there be in she soft eye after mention that she also have call in pass to make inquiry and declare that both mother and child look remarkably well she relapse into gloomy silence scarcely listen to marianne who thank she for have come thereupon it occur to mathieu to leave she with he wife to he it seem that she must have something on she mind and perhaps she wish to make a confidante of marianne my dear reine say he come with these little one into the dining-room we will see what afternoon snack there be and lay the cloth this proposal be greet with shout of delight and all the child troop into the dining-room with mathieu a quarter of a hour later when everything be ready there and valerie come in the latter 's eye look very red as if she have be weep and that evening when mathieu be alone with he wife he learn what the trouble be morange 's scheme of leave the beauchene work and enter the service of the credit national where he would speedily rise to a high and lucrative position he hope too of give reine a big dowry and marry she off to advantage -- all the ambitious dream of rank and wealth in which he wife and he have indulge now show no likelihood of fulfilment since it seem probable that valerie might again have a child both she and she husband be in despair over it and though marianne have do she utmost to pacify she friend and reconcile she to circumstance there be reason to fear that in she distract condition she might do something desperate four day later when the froment lunch with the seguin du hordel at the luxurious mansion in the avenue d'antin they come upon similar trouble there seguin who be positively enrage do not scruple to accuse he wife of infidelity and on he side he take to quite a bachelor life he have be a gambler in he younger day and have never fully cure himself of that passion which now break out afresh like a fire which have only slumber for a time he spend night after night at he club play at baccarat and could be meet in the bet ring at every race meeting then too he glide into equivocal society and appear at home only at interval to vent he irritation and spite and jealousy upon he ail wife she poor woman be absolutely guiltless of the charge prefer against she but know she husband and unwilling for she own part to give up she life of pleasure she have practice concealment as long as possible and now she be really very ill haunt too by a unreasoning irremovable fear that it would all end in she death mathieu who have see she but a few month previously look so fair and fresh be amaze to find she such a wreck and on she side valentine gaze all astonishment at marianne notice with surprise how calm and strong the young woman seem and how limpid she clear and smile eye remain on the day of the froment ' visit seguin have go out early in the morning and when they arrive he have not yet return thus the lunch be for a short time keep wait and during the interval celeste the maid enter the room where the visitor sit near she mistress who be stretch upon a sofa look a perfect picture of distress valentine turn a question glance on the servant who forthwith reply : no madame monsieur have not come back yet but that woman of my village be here you know madame the woman i speak to you about sophie couteau la couteau as we call she at rougemont who bring nurse to pari well what of it exclaim valentine on the point of order celeste to leave the room for it seem to she quite outrageous to be disturb in this manner well madame she be here and as i tell you before if you would intrust she with the matter now she would find a very good wet nurse for you in the country and bring she here whenever she be wanted la couteau have be stand behind the door which have remain ajar and scarcely have celeste finish than without wait for a invitation she boldly enter the room she be a quick little wizened woman with certain peasant way but considerably polish by she frequent journey to pari so far as she small keen eye and point nose go she long face be not unpleasant but its expression of good nature be mar by she hard mouth she thin lip suggestive of artfulness and cupidity she gown of dark woollen stuff she black cape black mitten and black cap with yellow ribbon give she the appearance of a respectable countrywoman go to mass in she Sunday best have you be a nurse valentine inquire as she scrutinize she yes madame reply la couteau but that be ten year ago when i be only twenty it seem to I that i be not likely to make much money by remain a nurse and so i prefer to set up as a agent to bring other to pari as she speak she smile like a intelligent woman who feel that those who give they service as wet nurse to bourgeois family be simply fool and dupe however she fear that she might have say too much on the point and so she add : but one do what one can eh madame the doctor tell I that i should never do for a nurse again and so i think that i might perhaps help the poor little dear in another manner and you bring wet nurse to the pari office yes madame twice a month i supply several office but more particularly madame broquette 's office in the rue roquepine it be a very respectable place where one run no risk of be deceive -- and so if you like madame i will choose the very best i can find for you -- the pick of the bunch so to say i know the business thoroughly and you can rely on I as she mistress do not immediately reply celeste venture to intervene and begin by explain how it happen that la couteau have call that day when she go back into the country madame she almost always take a baby with she sometimes a nurse 's child and sometimes the child of people who be not well enough off to keep a nurse in the house and she take these child to some of the rearer in the country she just now come to see I before go round to my friend madame menoux whose baby she be to take away with she valentine become interested this madame menoux be a haberdasher in the neighborhood and a great friend of celeste 's she have marry a former soldier a tall handsome fellow who now earn a hundred and fifty franc a month as a attendant at a museum she be very fond of he and have bravely set up a little shop the profit from which double they income in such wise that they live very happily and almost at they ease celeste who frequently absent herself from she duty to spend hour gossip in madame menoux 's little shop be forever be scold for this practice but in the present instance valentine full of anxiety and curiosity do not chide she the maid be quite proud at be question and inform she mistress that madame menoux 's baby be a fine little boy and that the mother have be attend by a certain madame rouche who live at the lower end of the rue du rocher it be i who recommend she continue the servant for a friend of mine whom she have attend have speak to I very highly of she no doubt she have not such a good position as madame bourdieu who have so handsome a place in the rue de miromesnil but she be less expensive and so very kind and oblige then celeste suddenly cease speak for she notice that mathieu 's eye be fix upon she and this for reason best know to herself make she feel uncomfortable he on he side certainly place no confidence in this big dark girl with a head like that of a horse who it seem to he know far too much marianne join in the conversation but why ask she why do not this madame menoux whom you speak about keep she baby with she thereupon la couteau turn a dark harsh glance upon this lady visitor who whatever course she might take herself have certainly no right to prevent other from do business oh it be impossible exclaimed celeste well pleased with the diversion madame menoux 's shop be no bigger than my pocket-handkerchief and at the back of it there be only one little room where she and she husband take they meal and sleep and that room too overlook a tiny courtyard where one can neither see nor breathe the baby would not live a week in such a place and besides madame menoux would not have time to attend to the child she have never have a servant and what with wait on customer and have to cook meal in time for she husband 's return from the museum she never have a moment to spare oh if she could she would be very happy to keep the little fellow with she it be true say marianne sadly there be some poor mother whom i pity with all my heart this person you speak of be not in poverty and yet be reduce to this cruel separation for my part i should not be able to exist if a child of mine be take away from I to some unknown spot and give to another woman la couteau doubtless interpret this as a attack upon herself assume the kindly demeanor of one who dote on child the air which she always put on to prevail over hesitate mother she reply : oh rougemont be such a very pretty place and then it be not far from bayeux so that folk be by no means savage there the air be so pure too that people come there to recruit they health and besides the little one who be confide to we be well care for i assure you one would have to be heartless to do otherwise than love such little angel however like celeste she relapse into silence on see how significantly mathieu be look at she perhaps in spite of she rustic way she understand that there be a false ring in she voice besides of what use be she usual patter about the salubrity of the region since that lady madame seguin wish to have a nurse at she house so she resume : then it be understand madame i will bring you the best we have a real treasure valentine now a little tranquillized as to she fear for herself find strength to speak out no no i will not pledge myself in advance i will send to see the nurse you bring to the office and we shall see if there be one to suit I then without occupy herself further about the woman she turn to marianne and ask : shall you nurse you baby yourself certainly as i do with the other we have very decide opinion on that point my husband and i no doubt i understand you : i should much like to do the same myself but it be impossible la couteau have remain there motionless vex at have come on a fruitless errand and regret the loss of the present which she would have earn by she obligingness in provide a nurse she put all she spite into a glance which she shoot at marianne who think she be evidently some poor creature unable even to afford a nurse however at a sign which celeste make she she courtesy humbly and withdraw in the company of the maid a few minute afterwards seguin arrive and repair to the dining-room they all sit down to lunch there it be a very luxurious meal comprise egg red mullet game and crawfish with red and white bordeaux wine and iced champagne such diet for valentine and marianne would never have meet with dr boutan 's approval but seguin declare the doctor to be a unbearable individual whom nobody could ever please he seguin while show all politeness to he guest seem that day to be in a execrable temper again and again he level annoying and even galling remark at he wife carry thing to such a point at time that tear come to the unfortunate woman 's eye now that he scarcely set foot in the house he complain that everything be go wrong there if he spend he time elsewhere it be accord to he entirely he wife 's fault the place be become a perfect hell upon earth and in everything the slightest incident the most common-place remark he find a opportunity for jeer and gibe these make mathieu and marianne extremely uncomfortable but at last he let fall such a harsh expression that valentine indignantly rebel and he have to apologize at heart he fear she especially when the blood of the vaugelade arise within she and she give he to understand in she haughty disdainful way that she would some day revenge herself on he for he treatment however seek another outlet for he spite and rancor he at last turn to mathieu and speak of chantebled say bitterly that the game in the cover there be fast become scarcer and scarcer in such wise that he now have difficulty in sell he shooting share so that he income from the property be dwindle every year he make no secret of the fact that he would much like to sell the estate but where could he possibly find a purchaser for those unproductive wood those sterile plain those marsh and those tract of gravel mathieu listen to all this attentively for during he long walk in the summer he have begin to take a interest in the estate be you really of opinion that it can not be cultivate he ask it be pitiful to see all that land lie waste and idle cultivate it cry seguin ah i should like to see such a miracle the only crop that one will ever raise on it be stone and frog they have by this time eat they dessert and before rise from table marianne be tell valentine that she would much like to see and kiss she child who have not be allow to lunch with they elder on account of they suppose unruly way when a couple of visitor arrive in turn and everything else be forget one be santerre the novelist who of late have seldom call on the seguin and the other much to mathieu 's dislike prove to be beauchene 's sister seraphine the baroness de lowicz she look at the young man in a bold provoke significant manner and then like santerre cast a sly glance of mock contempt at marianne and valentine she and the novelist between they soon turn the conversation on to subject that appeal to they vicious taste and santerre related that he have lately see doctor gaude perform several operation at the marbeuf hospital he have find there the usual set of society man who attend first performance at the theater and indeed there be also some woman present and then he enlarged upon the subject give the crudest and most precise particulars much to the delight of seguin who every now and again interpolate remark of approval while both mathieu and marianne grow more and more ill at ease the young woman sit look with amazement at santerre as he calmly recapitulate horror after horror to the evident enjoyment of the other she remember have read he last book that love story which have seem to she so supremely absurd with its theory of the annihilation of the human species and she at last glance at mathieu to tell he how weary she feel of all the semi-society and semi-medical chatter around she and how much she would like to go off home lean on he arm and walk slowly along the sunlit quay he for he part feel a pang at see so much insanity rife amid those wealthy surroundings he make he wife a sign that it be indeed time to take leave what be you go already valentine then exclaim well i dare not detain you if you feel tired however when marianne beg she to kiss the child for she she add : why yes it be true you have not see they wait a moment pray i want you to kiss they yourself but when celeste appear in answer to the bell she announce that monsieur gaston and mademoiselle lucie have go out with they governess and this make seguin explode once more all he rancor against he wife revive the house be go to rack and ruin she spend she day lie on a sofa since when have the governess take leave to go out with the child without say anything one could not even see the child now in order to kiss they it be a nice state of thing they be leave to the servant in fact it be the servant now who control the house thereupon valentine begin to cry _ mon dieu _ say marianne to she husband when she find herself out of door able to breathe and happy once more now that she be lean on he arm why they be quite mad the people in that house yes mathieu respond they be mad no doubt but we must pity they for they know not what happiness be vi about nine o'clock one fine cold morning a few day afterwards as mathieu bind for he office a little late through have linger near he wife be stride hastily across the garden which separate the pavilion from the factory yard he meet constance and maurice who clothe in fur be go out for a walk in the sharp air beauchene who be accompany they as far as the gate barehead and ever sturdy and victorious gayly exclaim to he wife : give the youngster a good spin on he leg let he take in all the fresh air he can there be nothing like that and good food to make a man mathieu on hearing this stop short have maurice be poorly again he inquire oh no hastily reply the boy 's mother with a appearance of great gayety assume perhaps from a unconscious desire to hide certain covert fear only the doctor want he to take exercise and it be so fine this morning that we be go off on quite a expedition do not go along the quay say beauchene again go up towards the invalide he 'll have much stiffer march to do when he be a soldier then the mother and the child have take themselves off he go back into the work with mathieu add in he triumphant way : that youngster you know be as strong as a oak but woman be always so nervous for my part i be quite easy in mind about he as you can see and with a laugh he conclude : when one have but one son he keep he that same day about a hour later a terrible dispute which break out between old moineaud 's daughter norine and euphrasie throw the factory into a state of commotion norine 's intrigue with beauchene have end in the usual way he have soon tired of the girl and betaken himself to some other pass fancy leave she to she tear she shame and all the consequence of she fault for although it have hitherto be possible for she to conceal she condition from she parent she be unable to deceive she sister who be she constant companion the two girl be always bicker and norine have for some time live in dread of scandal and exposure and that day the trouble come to a climax begin with a trivial dispute about a bit of glass-paper in the workroom then develop into a furious exchange of coarse insulting language and culminate in a frantic outburst from euphrasie who shriek to the assemble work-girl all that she know about she sister there be a outrageous scene : the sister fight claw and scratch one another desperately and could not be separate until beauchene mathieu and morange attract by the extraordinary uproar rush into the workroom and restore a little order fortunately for beauchene euphrasie do not know the whole truth and norine after give she employer a humble supplicating glance keep silence but old moineaud be present and the public revelation of he daughter 's shame send he into a fury he order norine out of the work forthwith and threaten to throw she out of window should he find she at home when he return there in the evening and beauchene both annoy at the scandal and ashamed at be the primary cause of it do not venture to interfere it be only after the unhappy norine have rush off sob that he find strength of mind to attempt to pacify the father and assert he authority in the workroom by threaten to dismiss one and all of the girl if the slightest scandal the slightest noise should ever occur there again mathieu be deeply pained by the scene but keep he own counsel what most astonished he be the promptness with which beauchene regain he self-possession as soon as norine have flee and the majesty with which he withdraw to he office after threaten the other and restore order another whom the scene have painfully affect be morange whom mathieu to he surprise find ghastly pale with tremble hand as if indeed he have have some share of responsibility in this unhappy business but morange as he confide to mathieu be distressed for other reason the scene in the workroom the revelation of norine 's condition the fate await the girl drive away into the bleak icy street have revive all he own poignant worry with respect to valerie mathieu have already hear of the latter 's trouble from he wife and he speedily grasp the accountant 's mean it vaguely seem to he also that morange be yield to the same unreasoning despair as valerie and be almost willing that she should take the desperate course which she have hint to marianne but it be a very serious matter and mathieu do not wish to be in any way mix up in it have try he best to pacify the cashier he seek forgetfulness of these painful incident in he work that afternoon however a little girl cecile moineaud the old fitter 's youngest daughter slip into he office with a message from she mother beseech he to speak with she he readily understand that the woman wish to see he respect norine and in he usual compassionate way he consent to go the interview take place in one of the adjacent street down which the cold winter wind be blow la moineaude be there with norine and another little girl of hers irma a child eight year of age both norine and she mother weep abundantly while beg mathieu to help they he alone know the whole truth and be in a position to approach beauchene on the subject la moineaude be firmly determine to say nothing to she husband she tremble for he future and that of she son alfr who be now employ at the work for there be no tell what might happen if beauchene 's name should be mention life be indeed hard enough already and what would become of they all should the family bread-winner be turn away from the factory norine certainly have no legal claim on beauchene the law be peremptory on that point but now that she have lose she employment and be drive from home by she father could he leave she to die of want in the street the girl try to enforce she moral claim by assert that she have always be virtuous before meet beauchene in any case she lot remain a very hard one that beauchene be the father of she child there could be no doubt and at last mathieu without promising success tell the mother that he would do all he could in the matter he keep he word that same afternoon and after a great deal of difficulty he succeed at first beauchene fume storm deny equivocate almost blame mathieu for interfere talk too of blackmail and put on all sort of high and mighty air but at heart the matter greatly worry he what if norine or she mother should go to he wife constance might close she eye as long as she simply suspect thing but if complaint be formally openly make to she there would be a terrible scandal on the other hand however should he do anything for the girl it would become known and everybody would regard he as responsible and then there would be no end to what he call the blackmail however when beauchene reach this stage mathieu feel that the battle be gain he smile and answer : of course one can never tell -- the girl be certainly not malicious but when woman be drive beyond endurance they become capable of the worst folly i must say that she make no demand of I she do not even explain what she want she simply say that she could not remain in the street in this bleak weather since she father have turn she away from home if you want my opinion it be this : i think that one might at once put she to board at a proper place let we say that four or five month will elapse before she be able to work again that would mean a round sum of five hundred franc in expense at that cost she might be properly look after beauchene walk nervously up and down and then reply : well i have not a bad heart as you know five hundred franc more or less will not inconvenience I if i fly into a temper just now it be because the mere idea of be rob and impose upon put I beside myself but if it be a question of charity why then do as you suggest it must be understand however that i will not mix myself up in anything i wish even to remain ignorant of what you do choose a nurse place the girl where you please and i will simply pay the bill neither more nor less then he heave a sigh of relief at the prospect of be extricate from this equivocal position the worry of which he refuse to acknowledge and once more he put on the mien of a superior victorious man one who be certain that he will win all the battle of life in fact he even jest about the girl and at last go off repeat he instruction : see that my condition be fully understand i do not want to know anything about any child do whatever you please but never let I hear another word of the matter that day be certainly one fertile in incident for in the evening there be quite a alarm at the beauchene at the moment when they be about to sit down to dinner little maurice faint away and fall upon the floor nearly a quarter of a hour elapse before the child could be revive and meantime the distract parent quarrel and shout accuse one another of have compel the lad to go out walk that morning in such cold frosty weather it be evidently that foolish outing which have chill he at least this be what they say to one another by way of quiet they anxiety constance while she hold she boy in she arm picture he as dead it occur to she for the first time that she might possibly lose he at this idea she experience a terrible heart-pang and a feeling of motherliness come upon she so acute that it be like a revelation the ambitious woman that be in she she who dream of royalty for that only son the future princely owner of the ever-growing family fortune likewise suffer horribly if she be to lose that son she would have no child leave why have she none other be it not she who have will it thus at this think a feeling of desperate regret shoot through she like a red-hot blade burn she cruelly to the very depths of she be maurice however at last recovered consciousness and even sit down to the table and eat with a fair appetite then beauchene immediately shrug he shoulder and begin to jest about the unreasoning fear of woman and as time go by constance herself cease to think of the incident on the morrow when mathieu have to attend to the delicate mission which he have undertake he remember the two woman of whom celeste the maid have speak on the day of he visit to the seguin he at first dismiss all idea of that madame rouche of whom the girl have speak so strangely but he think of make some inquiry respect madame bourdieu who accommodate boarder at the little house where she reside in the rue de miromesnil and he seem to remember that this woman have attend madame morange at the time of reine 's birth a circumstance which induce he to question the cashier at the very first word the latter seem greatly disturbed yes a lady friend recommend madame bourdieu to my wife say he but why do you ask I and as he speak he look at mathieu with a expression of anguish as if that sudden mention of madame bourdieu 's name signify that the young fellow have guess he secret preoccupation it be as though he have be abruptly surprise in wrong-doing perhaps too certain dim haunting thought which he have long be painfully revolve in he mind without as yet be able to come to a decision take shape at that moment at all event he turn pale and he lip tremble then as mathieu give he to understand that it be a question of place norine somewhere he involuntarily let a avowal escape he my wife be speak to I of madame bourdieu only this morning he begin oh i do not know how it happen but as you be aware reine be bear so many year ago that i can not give you any precise information it seem that the woman have do well and be now at the head of a first-class establishment inquire there yourself i have no doubt you will find what you want there mathieu follow this advice but at the same time as he have be warn that madame bourdieu 's term be rather high he stifle he prejudice and begin by repair to the rue du rocher in order to reconnoitre madame rouche 's establishment and make some inquiry of she the mere aspect of the place chill he it be one of the black house of old pari with a dark evil-smelling passage lead into a small yard which the nurse 's few squalid room overlook above the passage entrance be a yellow signboard which simply bear the name of madame rouche in big letter she herself prove to be a person of five - or six-and-thirty gown in black and spare of figure with a leaden complexion scanty hair of no precise color and a big nose of unusual prominence with she low drawling speech she prudent cat-like gesture and she sour smile he divine she to be a dangerous unscrupulous woman she tell he that as the accommodation at she disposal be so small she only take boarder for a limited time and this of course enable he to curtail he inquiry glad to have do with she he hurry off oppress by nausea and vaguely frighten by what he have see of the place on the other hand madame bourdieu 's establishment a little three-storied house in the rue de miromesnil between the rue la boetie and the rue de penthievre offer a engaging aspect with its bright facade and muslin-curtained window and madame bourdieu then two-and-thirty rather short and stout have a broad pleasant white face which have greatly help she on the road to success she expatiate to mathieu on the preliminary training that be require by one of she profession the cost of it the effort need to make a position the responsibility the inspection the worry of all sort that she have to face and she plainly tell the young man that she charge for a boarder would be two hundred franc a month this be far more than he be empower to give however after some further conversation when madame bourdieu learn that it be a question of four month ' board she become more accommodate and agree to accept a round sum of six hundred franc for the entire period provide that the person for whom mathieu be act would consent to occupy a three-bedded room with two other boarder altogether there be about a dozen boarder ' room in the house some of these have three and even four bed while other the term for which be naturally higher contain but one madame bourdieu could accommodate as many as thirty boarder and as a rule she have some five-and-twenty staying on she premise provide they comply with the regulation no question be ask they they be not require to say who they be or whence they come and in most case they be merely know by some christian name which they choose to give mathieu end by agree to madame bourdieu 's term and that same evening norine be take to she establishment some little trouble ensue with beauchene who protest when he learn that five hundred franc would not suffice to defray the expense however mathieu manage affair so diplomatically that at last the other not only become reconcile to the term but provide the money to purchase a little linen and even agree to supply pocket-money to the extent of ten franc a month thus five day after norine have enter madame bourdieu 's establishment mathieu decide to return thither to hand the girl she first ten franc and tell she that he have settle everything he find she there in the boarder ' refectory with some of she companion in the house -- a tall thin severe-looking englishwoman with lifeless eye and bloodless lip who call herself amy and a pale red-haired girl with a tip-tilted nose and a big mouth who be know as victoire then too there be a young person of great beauty answering to the name of rosine a jeweller 's daughter so norine tell mathieu whose story be at once pathetic and horrible the young man while wait to see madame bourdieu who be engage sit for a time answer norine 's question and listen to the other who converse before he in a free and open way he heart be wring by much that he hear and as soon as he could rid himself of norine he return to the waiting-room eager to complete he business there however two woman who wish to consult madame bourdieu and who sit chat side by side on a sofa tell he that she be still engage so that he be compel to tarry a little longer he ensconce himself in a large armchair and take a newspaper from he pocket begin to read it but he have not be thus occupy for many minute before the door open and a servant enter usher in a lady dress in black and thickly veil whom she ask to be good enough to wait she turn mathieu be on the point of rise for though he back be turn to the door he could see in a looking-glass that the new arrival be none other than morange 's wife valerie after a moment 's hesitation however the sight of she black gown and thick veil which seem to indicate that she desire to escape recognition induce he to dive back into he armchair and feign extreme attention to he newspaper she on she side have certainly not notice he but by glance slantwise towards the looking-glass he could observe all she movement meantime the conversation between the other woman on the sofa continue and to mathieu 's surprise it suddenly turn on madame rouche concern whom one of they begin tell the most horrible story which fully confirm the young man 's previous suspicion these story seem to have a powerful fascination for valerie who sit in a corner never stir but listen intently she do not even turn she head towards the other woman but beneath she veil mathieu could detect she big eye glitter feverishly she start but once it be when one of the other inquire of she friend where that horrid creature la rouche reside and the other reply at the lower end of the rue du rocher then they chatter abruptly cease for madame bourdieu make she appearance on the threshold of she private room the gossip exchange only a few word with she and then as mathieu remain in he armchair the high back of which conceal he from view valerie rise from she seat and follow madame bourdieu into the private room as soon as he be alone the young man let he newspaper fall upon he knee and lapse into a reverie haunt by all the chatter he have hear both there and in norine 's company and shudder at the thought of the dreadful secret that have be reveal to he how long a interval elapse he could not tell but at last he be suddenly rouse by a sound of voice madame bourdieu be now escort valerie to the door she have the same plump fresh face as usual and even smile in a motherly way but the other be quiver as with distress and grief you be not sensible my dear child say madame bourdieu to she it be simply foolish of you come go home and be good then valerie have withdraw without utter a word madame bourdieu be greatly surprise to see mathieu who have rise from he chair and she suddenly become serious displeased with herself at have speak in he presence fortunately a diversion be create by the arrival of norine who come in from the refectory and mathieu then promptly settle he business and go off after promise norine that he would return some day to see she to make up for lose time he be walk hastily towards the rue la boetie when all at once he come to a halt for at the very corner of that street he again perceive valerie now talk to a man none other than she husband so morange have come with she and have wait for she in the street while she interview madame bourdieu and now they both stand there consult together hesitate and evidently in distress it be plain to mathieu that a terrible combat be go on within they they stamp about move hither and thither in a feverish way then halt once more to resume they conversation in a whisper at one moment the young man feel intensely relieve for turn into the rue la boetie they walk on slowly as if downcast and resign in the direction of grenelle but all at once they halt once more and exchange a few word and then mathieu 's heart contract as he see they retrace they step along the rue la boetie and follow the rue de la pepiniere as far as the rue du rocher he readily divine whither they be go but some irresistible force impel he to follow they and before long from a open doorway in which he prudently conceal himself he see they look round to ascertain whether they be observe and then slink first the wife and afterwards the husband into the dark passage of la rouche 's house for a moment mathieu linger in he hiding-place quiver full of dread and horror and when at last he turn he step homeward it be with a heavy heart indeed the week go by the winter run its course and march have come round when the memory of all that the young fellow have hear and see that day -- thing which he have vainly strive to forget -- be revive in the most startling fashion one morning at eight o'clock morange abruptly call at the little pavilion in the rue de la federation accompany by he daughter reine the cashier be livid haggard distract and as soon as reine have join mathieu 's child and could not hear what he say he implore the young man to come with he in a gasp he tell the dreadful truth -- valerie be die she daughter believe she to be in the country but that be a mere fib devise to quiet the girl valerie be elsewhere in pari and he morange have a cab wait below but lack the strength to go back to she alone so poignant be he grief so great he dread mathieu be expect a happy event that very day and he at first tell the cashier that he could not possibly go with he but when he have inform marianne that he believe that something dreadful have happen to the morange she bravely bid he render all assistance and then the two man drive as mathieu have anticipate to the rue du rocher and there find the hapless valerie not die but dead and white and icy cold ah the desperate tearless grief of the husband who fall upon he knee at the bedside benumb annihilate as if he also feel death 's heavy hand upon he for a moment indeed the young man anticipate exposure and scandal but when he hint this to la rouche she faintly smile she have friend on many side it seem she have already report valerie 's death at the municipal office and the doctor who would be send to certify the demise would simply ascribe it to natural cause such be the usual practice then mathieu bethought himself of lead morange away but the other still plunge in painful stupor do not heed he no no my friend i pray you say nothing he at last reply in a very faint distant voice as though he fear to awaken the unfortunate woman who have fall asleep forever i know what i have do i shall never forgive myself if she lie there it be because i consent yet i adore she and never wish she aught but happiness i love she too much and i be weak still i be the husband and when she madness come upon she i ought to have act sensibly and have warn and dissuade she i can understand and excuse she poor creature but as for I it be all over i be a wretch i feel horrify with myself all he mediocrity and tenderness of heart sob forth in this confession of he weakness and he voice never give sign of animation never rise in a louder tone from the depths of he annihilate be which would evermore be void she wish to be gay and rich and happy he continue it be so legitimate a wish on she part she be so intelligent and beautiful there be only one delight for I to content she taste and satisfy she ambition you know we new flat we spend far too much money on it then come that story of the credit national and the hope of speedily rise

escape from everlasting penury and drudgery be to evade nature and now alas she lie there morange 's lugubrious voice never break by a sob never rise to violence but sound like a distant monotonous mournful knell rent mathieu 's heart he seek word of consolation and speak of reine ah yes say the other i be very fond of reine she be so like she mother you will keep she at you house till to-morrow will not you tell she nothing let she play i will acquaint she with this dreadful misfortune and do not worry I i beg you do not take I away i promise you that i will keep very quiet : i will simply

so overcome at last decide to leave he there and enter the wait cab drive back to grenelle ah it be indeed relief for he to see the crowded sunlit street again and to breathe the keen air which come in at both window of the vehicle emerge from that horrid gloom he breathe gladly beneath the vast sky all radiant with healthy joy and the image of marianne arise before he like a consolatory promise of life 's come victory a atonement for every shame and iniquity he dear wife whom everlasting hope keep full of health and courage and through whom even amid she pang love would triumph while they both hold themselves in readiness for to-morrow 's allotted effort the cab roll on so slowly that mathieu almost despaired eager as he be to reach he bright little house that he might once more take

sunlight streaming brilliantly like a glorious greet to new life while he yet stand there dazzle by the glow the doctor say to he : it be a boy then mathieu lean over he wife and kiss she lovingly she

sunlight and how well-behaved he be for it be wonderful to see how quickly he cease wail and give sign of satisfaction when he feel the all-enveloping caress of the warm water never have father and

uncertain on she leg catch hold of the scale in she impatient effort to climb upon the bed and almost topple everything over i want to see i want to see she cry in she shrill voice at this the other likewise wish to meddle and already stretch out they little hand so that it become necessary to turn they out of door now kindly oblige I by go to play outside say mathieu take you hat and remain under the window so that we may hear you then in spite of the complaint and leap of master gervai marianne be at last able to obtain he correct weight and what delight there be for he have gain more

the child who be already protrude he lip and grope with he hand and when he find what he want he eagerly begin to suck mathieu see that both mother and babe be steep in sunshine then go to draw one of the curtain but marianne exclaimed : no no leave we the sun it do not inconvenience we at all it fill we vein with springtide he come back and linger near the bed the sun 's ray pour over it and life

amusing she husband observe she gayety draw near and begin to admire the child by way of follow she example ah yes he be really a pretty baby but i have see so many frightful one -- thin puny bluish little thing look like little plucked chicken when they be white and plump they be quite nice mathieu begin to laugh and twit the angelin on have no child of they own but on this point they hold very decide opinion they wish to enjoy life unburdened by offspring while they be young as for what might happen in five or six year ' time that of course be another matter nevertheless madame angelin could not help be strike by the delightful picture which marianne so fresh and gay present with she plump little babe at she breast in that white bed amid the bright sunshine at last she remark : there be one thing i certainly could not feed a child i should have to engage a nurse for any baby of mine of course she husband reply i would never allow you to feed it it would be idiotic these word have scarcely pass he lip when he regret they and apologize to marianne explain that no mother possess of means be nowadays willing to face the trouble and worry of nursing oh for my part marianne respond with she quiet smile if i have a hundred thousand franc a year i should nurse all my child even be there a dozen of they to begin with it be so healthful you know both for mother and child : and if i do not do my duty to the little one i should look on myself as a criminal as a mother who grudge she offspring health and life lower she beautiful soft eye towards she boy she watch he with a look of infinite love while he continue nursing gluttonously and in a dreamy voice she continue : to give a child of mine to another -- oh no never i should feel too jealous i want my child to be entirely my own and it be not merely a question of a child 's physical health i speak of he whole be of the intelligence and heart that will come to he and which he ought to derive from I alone if i should find he foolish or malicious later on i should think that he nurse have poison he dear little fellow when he pull like that it be as if he be drink I up entirely then mathieu deeply move turn towards the other say : ah she be quite right i only wish that every mother could hear she and make it the fashion in france once more to suckle they infant it would be sufficient if it become a ideal of beauty and indeed be it not of the loftiest and brightest beauty the angelin complaisantly begin to laugh but they do not seem convinced just as they rise to take they leave a extraordinary uproar burst forth beneath the window the pierce clamor of little wilding freely romp in the field and it be all cause by ambroise throw a ball which have lodge itself on a tree blaise and deni be fling stone at it to bring it down and rise call and jump and stretch out she arm as if she hope to be able to reach the ball the angelin stop short surprised and almost nervous good heaven murmur claire what will it be when you have a dozen but the house would seem quite dead if they do not romp and shout say marianne much amuse good-by my dear i will go to see you when i can get about the month of march and April prove superb and all go well with marianne thus the lonely little house nestle amid foliage be ever joyous each Sunday in particular prove a joy for the father do not then have to go to he office on the other day he start off early in the morning and return about seven o'clock ever busily laden with work in the interval and if he constant perambulation do not affect he good-humor he be nevertheless often haunt by thought of the future formerly he have never be alarm by the penury of he little home never have he indulge in any dream of ambition or wealth besides he know that he wife 's only idea of happiness like he own be to live there in very simple fashion lead a brave life of health peacefulness and love but while he do not desire the power procure by a high position and the enjoyment offer by a large fortune he could not help ask himself how he be to provide be it ever so modestly for he increase family what would he be able to do should he have other child how would he procure the necessaries of life each time that a fresh birth might impose fresh requirement upon he one situate as he be must create resource draw food from the earth step by step each time a little mouth open and cry its hunger aloud otherwise he would be guilty of criminal improvidence and such reflection as these come upon he the more strongly as he penury have increase since the birth of gervai -- to such a point indeed that marianne despite prodigy of economy no longer know how to make she money last she till the end of the month the slightest expenditure have to be debate the very butter have to be spread thinly on the child 's bread and they have to continue wear they blouse till they be well-nigh threadbare to increase the embarrassment they grow every year and cost more money it have be necessary to send the three boy to a little school at janville which be as yet but a small expense but would it not be necessary to send they the following year to a college and where be the money for this to come from a grave problem a worry which grow from hour to hour and which for mathieu somewhat spoilt that charming spring whose advent be flower the countryside the worst be that mathieu deem himself immure as it be in he position as designer at the beauchene work even admit that he salary should some day be double it be not seven or eight thousand franc a year which would enable he to realize he dream of a numerous family freely and proudly grow and spread like some happy forest indebted solely for strength health and beauty to the good common mother of all the earth which give to all its sap and this be why since he return to janville the earth the soil have attract he detain he during he frequent walk while he revolve vague but ever-expanding thought in he mind he would pause for long minute now before a field of wheat now on the verge of a leafy wood now on the margin of a river whose water glisten in the sunshine and now amid the nettle of some stony moorland all sort of vague plan then rise within he uncertain reverie of such vast scope such singularity that he have as yet speak of they to nobody not even he wife other would doubtless have mock at he for he have as yet but reach that dim quiver hour when inventor feel the gust of they discovery sweep over they before the idea that they be revolve present itself with full precision to they mind yet why do he not address himself to the soil man 's everlasting provider and nurse why do he not clear and fertilize those far-spreading land those wood those heath those stretch of stony ground which be leave sterile around he since it be just that each man should bring he contribution to the common weal create subsistence for himself and he offspring why should not he at the advent of each new child supply a new field of fertile earth which would give that child food without cost to the community that be he sole idea it take no more precise shape at the thought of realize it he be carry off into splendid dream the froment have be in the country fully a month when one evening marianne wheeling gervai 's little carriage in front of she come as far as the bridge over the yeuse to await mathieu who have promise to return early indeed he get there before six o'clock and as the evening be fine it occur to marianne to go as far as the lepailleur ' mill down the river and buy some new-laid egg there i be willing say mathieu i be very fond of they romantic old mill you know though if it be mine i should pull it down and build another one with proper appliance in the yard of the picturesque old building half cover with ivy with its mossy wheel slumbering amid water-lily they find the lepailleur the man tall dry and carroty the woman as carroty and as dry as himself but both of they young and hardy they child antonin be sit on the ground digging a hole with he little hand egg la lepailleur exclaimed yes certainly madame there must be some she make no haste to fetch they however but stand look at gervai who be asleep in he little vehicle ah so that be you last he be plump and pretty enough i must say she remark but lepailleur raise a derisive laugh and with the familiarity which the peasant display towards the bourgeois whom he know to be hard up he say : and so that make you five monsieur ah well that would be a deal too many for poor folk like we why mathieu quietly inquire have not you get this mill and do not you own field to give labor to the arm that would come and whose labor would double and treble you produce these simple word be like a whipstroke that make lepailleur rear and once again he pour forth all he spite ah surely now it be not he tumble-down old mill that would ever enrich he since it have enrich neither he father nor he grandfather and as for he field well that be a pretty dowry that he wife have bring he land in which nothing more would grow and which however much one might water it with one 's sweat do not even pay for manure and sowing but in the first place resume mathieu you mill ought to be repair and its old mechanism replace or better still you should buy a good steam-engine repair the mill buy a engine why that be madness the other reply what would be the use of it as it be people hereabouts have almost renounce grow corn and i remain idle every other month and then continue mathieu if you field yield less it be because you cultivate they badly follow the old routine without proper care or appliance or artificial manure appliance artificial manure all that humbug which have only send poor folk to rack and ruin ah i should just like to see you try to cultivate the land better and make it yield what it 'll never yield any more thereupon he quite lose he temper become violent and brutal launching against the ungrateful earth all the charge which he love of idleness and he obstinacy suggest he have travel he have fight in africa as a soldier folk could not say that he have always live in he hole like a ignorant beast but none the less on leave he regiment he have lose all taste for work and come to the conclusion that agriculture be doom and would never give he aught but dry bread to eat the land would soon be bankrupt and the peasantry no longer believe in it so old and empty and worn out have it become and even the sun get out of order nowadays they have snow in July and thunderstorm in December a perfect upset of season which wreck the crop almost before they be out of the ground no monsieur say lepailleur what you say be impossible it be all past the soil and work there be nothing left of either it be barefaced robbery and though the peasant may kill himself with labor he will soon be leave without even water to drink child indeed no no there be antonin of course and for he we may just be able to provide but i assure you that i will not even make antonin a peasant against he will if he take to schooling and wish to go to paris i shall tell he that he be quite right for pari be nowadays the only chance for sturdy chap who want to make a fortune so he will be at liberty to sell everything if he choose and try he luck there the only thing that i regret be that i do not make the venture myself when there be still time mathieu begin to laugh be it not singular that he a bourgeois with a bachelor 's degree and scientific attainment should dream of come back to the soil to the common mother of all labor and wealth when this peasant spring from peasant curse and insult the earth and hope that he son would altogether renounce it never have anything strike he as more significant it symbolize that disastrous exodus from the rural district towards the town a exodus which year by year increase unhinge the nation and reduce it to anemia you be wrong he say in a jovial way so as to drive all bitterness from the discussion do not be unfaithful to the earth she be a old mistress who would revenge herself in you place i would lay myself out to obtain from she by increase of care all that i might want as in the world 's early day she be still the great fruitful spouse and she yield abundantly when she be love in proper fashion but lepailleur raise he fist retort : no no i have have enough of she and by the way continue mathieu one thing which astonish I be that no courageous intelligent man have ever yet come forward to do something with all that vast abandon estate yonder -- that chanteble -- which old seguin formerly dream of turn into a princely domain there be great stretch of waste land wood which one might partly fall heath and moorland which might easily be restore to cultivation what a splendid task what a work of creation for a bold man to undertake this so amaze lepailleur that he stand there openmouthe then he jeer spirit assert itself : but my dear sir -- excuse my say it -- you must be mad cultivate chanteble clear those stony tract wade about in those marsh why one might bury million there without reap a single bushel of oats it be a cursed spot which my grandfather 's father see such as it be now and which my grandson 's son will see just the same ah well i be not inquisitive but it would really amuse I to meet the fool who might attempt such madness _ mon dieu _ who know mathieu quietly conclude when one only love strongly one may work miracle la lepailleur after go to fetch a dozen egg now stand erect before she husband in admiration at hear he talk so eloquently to a bourgeois they agree very well together in they avaricious rage at be unable to amass money by the handful without any great exertion and in they ambition to make they son a gentleman since only a gentleman could become wealthy and thus as marianne be go off after place the egg under a cushion in gervai ' little carriage the other complacently call she attention to antonin who have make a hole in the ground be now spit into it oh he be smart say she he know he alphabet already and we be go to put he to school if he take after he father he will be no fool i assure you it be on a Sunday some ten day later that the supreme revelation the great flash of light which be to decide he life and that of those he love fall suddenly upon mathieu during a walk he take with he wife and the child they have go out for the whole afternoon take a little snack with they in order that they might share it amid the long grass in the field and after scour the path cross the copse ramble over the moorland they come back to the verge of the wood and sit down under a oak thence the whole expanse spread out before they from the little pavilion where they dwell to the distant village of janville on they right be the great marshy plateau from which broad dry sterile slope descend while lower ground stretch away on they left then behind they spread the wood with deep thicket part by clearing full of herbage which no scythe have ever touch and not a soul be to be see around they there be naught save wild nature grandly quiescent under the bright sun of that splendid April day the earth seem to be dilate with all the sap amass within it and a flood of life could be feel rise and quiver in the vigorous tree the spreading plant and the impetuous growth of bramble and nettle which stretch invadingly over the soil and on all side a powerful pungent odor be diffuse do not go too far marianne call to the child we shall stay under this oak we will have something to eat by and by blaise and deni be already bound along follow by ambroise to see who could run the fastest but rise pettishly call they back for she prefer to play at gather wild flower the open air fairly intoxicate the youngster the herbage rise here and there to they very shoulder but they come back and gather flower and after a time they set off at a wild run once more one of the big brother carry the little sister on he back mathieu however have remain absent-minded with he eye wander hither and thither throughout they walk at time he do not hear marianne when she speak to he he lapse into reverie before some uncultivated tract some copse overrun with brushwood some spring which suddenly bubble up and be then lose in mire nevertheless she feel that there be no sadness nor feeling of indifference in he heart for as soon as he return to she he laugh once more with he soft loving laugh it be she who often send he roam about the country even alone for she feel that it would do he good and although she have guess that something very serious be pass through he mind she retain full confidence wait till it should please he to speak to she now however just as he have sink once more into he reverie he glance wander afar study the great varied expanse of land she raise a light cry : oh look look under the big oak tree she have place master gervai in he little carriage among wild weed which hide its wheel and while she hand a little silver mug from which it be intend they should drink while take they snack she have notice that the child raise he head and follow the movement of she hand in which the silver sparkle beneath the sun-rays forthwith she repeat the experiment and again the child 's eye follow the starry gleam ah it can not be say that i be mistaken and be simply fancy it she exclaim it be certain that he can see quite plainly now my pretty pet my little darling she dart to the child to kiss he in celebration of that first clear glance and then too come the delight of the first smile why look in he turn say mathieu who be lean over the child beside she yielding to the same feeling of rapture there he be smile at you now but of course as soon as these little fellow see clearly they begin to laugh she herself burst into a laugh you be right he be laugh ah how funny he look and how happy i be both father and mother laugh together with content at the sight of that infantile smile vague and fleeting like a faint ripple on the pure water of some spring amid this joy marianne call the four other who be bound under the young foliage around they : come rise come ambroise come blaise and deni it be time now come at once to have something to eat they hasten up and the snack be set out on a patch of soft grass mathieu unhook the basket which hang in front of the baby 's little vehicle and marianne have draw some slice of bread-and-butter from it proceed to distribute they perfect silence ensue while all four child begin bite with hearty appetite which it be a pleasure to see but all at once a scream arise it come from master gervai who be vex at not have be serve first ah yes it be true i be forget you say marianne gayly you shall have you share there open you mouth you darling and with a easy simple gesture she unfasten she dress-body and then under the sunlight which steep she in golden radiance in full view of the far-spreading countryside where all likewise be bare -- the soil the tree the plant streaming with sap -- have seat herself in the long grass where she almost disappear amid the swarm growth of April 's germ the babe on she breast eagerly suck in she warm milk even as all the encompass verdure be suck life from the soil how hungry you be she exclaim do not pinch I so hard you little glutton meantime mathieu have remain stand amid the enchantment of the child 's first smile and the gayety bear of the hearty hunger around he then he dream of creation come back to he and he at last give voice to those plan for the future which haunt he and of which he have so far speak to nobody : ah well it be high time that i should set to work and find a kingdom if these child be to have enough soup to make they grow shall i tell you what i have think -- shall i tell you marianne raise she eye smile and all attention yes tell I you secret if the time have come oh i could guess that you have some great hope in you but i do not ask you anything i prefer to wait he do not give a direct reply for at a sudden recollection he feeling rebel that lepailleur say he be simply a lazy fellow and a fool in spite of all he cunning air can there be any more sacrilegious folly than to imagine that the earth have lose she fruitfulness and be become bankrupt -- she the eternal mother eternal life she only show herself a bad mother to she bad son the malicious the obstinate and the dull-witted who do not know how to love and cultivate she but if a intelligent son come and devote himself to she and work she with the help of experience and all the new system of science you will soon see she quicken and yield tremendous harvest unceasingly ah folk say in the district that this estate of chanteble have never yield and never will yield anything but nettle well nevertheless a man will come who will transform it and make it a new land of joy and abundance then suddenly turn round with outstretched arm and point to the spot to which he refer in turn he go on : yonder in the rear there be nearly five hundred acre of little wood stretch as far as the farm of mareuil and lillebonne they be separate by clearing of excellent soil which broad gap unite and which could easily be turn into good pasture for there be numerous spring and indeed the spring become so abundant on the right that they have change that big plateau into a kind of marshland dot with pond and plant with reed and rush but picture a man of bold mind a clearer a conqueror who should drain those land and rid they of superfluous water by means of a few canal which might easily be dig why then a huge stretch of land would be reclaim hand over to cultivation and wheat would grow there with extraordinary vigor but that be not all there be the expanse before we those gentle slope from janville to vieux-bourg that be another five hundred acre which be leave almost uncultivated on account of they dryness the stony poverty of they soil so it be all very simple one would merely have to take the source up yonder the water now stagnant and carry they across those sterile slope which when irrigate would gradually develop extraordinary fertility i have see everything i have study everything i feel that there be at least twelve hundred acre of land which a bold creator might turn into a most productive estate yonder lie a whole kingdom of corn a whole new world to be create by labor with the help of the beneficent water and we father the sun the source of eternal life marianne gaze at he and admire he as he stand there quiver ponder over all that he evoke from he dream but she be frighten by the vastness of such hope and could not restrain a cry of disquietude and prudence no no that be too much you desire the impossible how can you think that we shall ever possess so much -- that we fortune will spread over the entire region think of the capital the arm that would be need for such a conquest for a moment mathieu remain silent on thus suddenly be bring back to reality then with he affectionate sensible air he begin to laugh you be right i have be dream and talk wildly he reply i be not yet so ambitious as to wish to be king of chantebled but there be truth in what i have say to you and besides what harm can there be in dream of great plan to give oneself faith and courage meantime i intend to try cultivate just a few acre which seguin will no doubt sell I cheaply enough together with the little pavilion in which we live i know that the unproductiveness of the estate weigh on he and later on we shall see if the earth be dispose to love we and come to we as we go to she ah well my dear give that little glutton plenty of life and you my darling eat and drink and grow in strength for the earth belong to those who be healthy and numerous blaise and deni make answer by take some fresh slice of bread-and-butter while rise drain the mug of wine and water which ambroise hand she and marianne sit there like the symbol of blossom fruitfulness the source of vigor and conquest while gervai heartily nurse on he pull so hard indeed that one could hear the sound of he lip it be like the faint noise which attend the rise of a spring -- a slender rill of milk that be to swell and become a river around she the mother hear that source spring up and spread on all side she be not nourishing alone : the sap of April be dilate the land send a quiver through the wood raise the long herbage which embower she and beneath she from the bosom of the earth which be ever in travail she feel that flood of sap reach and ever pervade she and it be like a stream of milk flow through the world a stream of eternal life for humanity 's eternal crop and on that gay day of spring the dazzling singing fragrant countryside be steep in it all triumphal with that beauty of the mother who in the full light of the sun in view of the vast horizon sit there nurse she child viii on the morrow after a morning 's hard toil at he office at the work mathieu have thing well advance bethought himself of go to see norine at madame bourdieu 's he know that she have give birth to a child a fortnight previously and he wish to ascertain the exact state of affair in order to carry to a end the mission with which beauchene have intrust he as the other however have never again speak to he on the subject he simply tell he that he be go out in the afternoon without indicate the motive of he absence at the same time he know what secret relief beauchene would experience when he at last learn that the whole business be at a end -- the child cast adrift and the mother follow she own course on reach the rue de miromesnil mathieu have to go up to norine 's room for though she be to leave the house on the follow Thursday she still keep she bed and at the foot of the bedstead asleep in a cradle he be surprise to see the infant of which he think she have already rid herself oh be it you she joyously exclaim i be about to write to you for i want to see you before go away my little sister here would have take you the letter cecile moineaud be indeed there together with the younger girl irma the mother unable to absent herself from she household duty have send they to make inquiry and give norine three big orange which glisten on the table beside the bed the little girl have make the journey on foot greatly interested by all the sight of the street and the display in the shop-window and now they be enrapture with the fine house in which they find they big sister sojourning and full of curiosity with respect to the baby which sleep under the cradle 's muslin curtain mathieu make the usual inquiry of norine who answer he gayly but pout somewhat at the prospect of have so soon to leave the house where she have find herself so comfortable we sha not easily find such soft mattress and such good food eh victoire she ask whereupon mathieu perceive that another girl be present a pale little creature with wavy red hair tip-tilted nose and long mouth whom he have already see there on the occasion of a previous visit she sleep in one of the two other bed which the room contain and now sit beside it mend some linen she be to leave the house on the morrow have already send she child to the foundling hospital and in the meantime she be mend some thing for rosine the well-to-do young person of great beauty whom mathieu have previously espy and whose story accord to norine be so sadly pathetic victoire cease sewing and raise she head she be a servant girl by call one of those unlucky creature who be overtake by trouble when they have scarce arrive in the great city from they native village well say she it be quite certain that one will not be able to dawdle in bed and that one will not have warm milk give one to drink before get up but all the same it be not lively to see nothing but that big gray wall yonder from the window and besides one can not go on forever do nothing norine laugh and jerk she head as if she be not of this opinion then as she little sister embarrass she she wish to get rid of they and so my pussy say she you say that papa 's still angry with I and that i be not to go back home oh cry cecile it be not so much that he be angry but he say that all the neighbor would point they finger at he if he let you come home besides euphrasie keep he anger up particularly since she be arrange to get marry what euphrasie go to be marry you do not tell I that norine look very vexed particularly when she sister speak both together tell she that the future husband be auguste benard a jovial young mason who live on the floor above they he have take a fancy to euphrasie though she have no good look and be as thin at eighteen as a grasshopper doubtless however he consider she strong and hard-working much good may it do they say norine spitefully why with she evil temper she 'll be beat he before six month be over you can just tell mamma that i do not care a rap for any of you and that i need nobody i 'll go and look for work and i 'll find somebody to help I so you hear do not you come back here i do not want to be bother by you any more at this irma but eight year old and tender-hearted begin to cry why do you scold we we do not come to worry you i want to ask you too if that baby 's yours and if we may kiss it before we go away norine immediately regret she spiteful outburst she once more call the girl she little pussy kiss they tenderly and tell they that although they must run away now they might come back another day to see she if it amuse they thank mamma from I for she orange and as for the baby well you may look at it but you must not touch it for if it wake up we should not be able to hear ourselves then as the two child lean inquisitively over the cradle mathieu also glance at it and see a healthy sturdy-looking child with a square face and strong feature and it seem to he that the infant be singularly like beauchene at that moment however madame bourdieu come in accompany by a woman whom he recognize as sophie couteau la couteau that nurse-agent whom he have see at the seguin ' one day when she have go thither to offer to procure they a nurse she also certainly recognize this gentleman whose wife proud of be able to suckle she own child have evince such little inclination to help other to do business she pretend however that she see he for the first time for she be discreet by profession and not even inquisitive since so many matter be ever come to she knowledge without the ask little cecile and little irma go off at once and then madame bourdieu address norine inquire : well my child have you think it over have you quite make up you mind about that poor little darling who be sleep there so prettily here be the person i speak to you about she come from normandy every fortnight bring nurse to pari and each time she take baby away with she to put they out to nurse in the country though you say you will not feed it you surely need not cast off you child altogether you might confide it to this person until you be in a position to take it back or else if you have make up you mind to abandon it altogether she will kindly take it to the foundling hospital at once great perturbation have come over norine who let she head fall back on she pillow over which stream she thick fair hair whilst she face darken and she stammer : _ mon dieu _ _ mon dieu _ you be go to worry I again then she press she hand to she eye as if anxious to see nothing more this be what the regulation require of I monsieur say madame bourdieu to mathieu in a undertone while leave the young mother for a moment to she reflection we be recommend to do all we can to persuade we boarder especially when they be situate like this one to nurse they infant you be aware that this often save not only the child but the mother herself from the sad future which threaten she and so however much she may wish to abandon the child we leave it near she as long as possible and feed it with the bottle in the hope that the sight of the poor little creature may touch she heart and awaken feeling of motherliness in she nine time out of ten as soon as she give the child the breast she be vanquish and she keep it that be why you still see this baby here mathieu feeling greatly move draw near to norine who still lay back amid she streaming hair with she hand press to she face come say he you be a goodhearted girl there be no malice in you why not yourself keep that dear little fellow then she uncover she burning tearless face : do the father even come to see I she ask bitterly i can not love the child of a man who have behave as he have the mere thought that it be there in that cradle put I in a rage but that dear little innocent be not guilty it be he whom you condemn yourself whom you punish for now you will be quite alone and he might prove a great consolation no i tell you no i will not i can not keep a child like that with nobody to help I we all know what we can do do not we well it be of no use my question myself i be not brave enough i be not stupid enough to do such a thing no no and no he say no more for he realize that nothing would prevail over that thirst for liberty which she feel in the depths of she be with a gesture he express he sadness but he be neither indignant nor angry with she for other have make she what she be well it be understand you will not be force to feed it resume madame bourdieu attempt a final effort but it be not praiseworthy to abandon the child why not trust it to madame here who would put it out to nurse so that you would be able to take it back some day when you have find work it would not cost much and no doubt the father would pay this time norine fly into a passion he pay ah you do not know he it be not that the money would inconvenience he for he be a millionnaire but all he want be to see the little one disappear if he have dare he would have tell I to kill it just ask that gentleman if i speak the truth you see that he keep silent and how be i to pay when i have not a copper when to-morrow i shall be cast out-of-door perhaps without work and without bread no no a thousand time no i can not then overcome by a hysterical fit of despair she burst into sob i beg you leave I in peace for the last fortnight you have be torture I with that child by keep he near I with the idea that i should end by nurse he you bring he to I and set he on my knee so that i may look at he and kiss he you be always worry I with he and make he cry with the hope that i shall pity he and take he to my breast but _ mon dieu _ can not you understand that if i turn my head away if i do not want to kiss he or even to see he it be because i be afraid of be catch and loving he like a big fool which would be a great misfortune both for he and for I he 'll be far happier by himself so i beg you let he be take away at once and do not torture I any more sob violently she again sink back in bed and bury she dishevelled head in the pillow la couteau have remain wait mute and motionless at the foot of the bedstead in she gown of dark woollen stuff and she black cap trim with yellow ribbon she retain the air of a peasant woman in she Sunday best and she strive to impart a expression of compassionate good-nature to she long avaricious false face although it seem to she unlikely that business would ensue she risk a repetition of she customary speech at rougemont you know madame you little one would be just the same as at home there be no better air in the department people come there from bayeux to recruit they health and if you only know how well the little one be care for it be the only occupation of the district to have little parisian to coddle and love and besides i would not charge you dear i have a friend of mine who already have three nursling and as she naturally bring they up with the bottle it would not put she out to take a fourth for almost next to nothing come do not that suit you -- do not that tempt you when however she see that tear be norine 's only answer she make a impatient gesture like a active woman who can not afford to lose she time at each of she fortnightly journey as soon as she have rid herself of she batch of nurse at the different office she hasten round the nurse ' establishment to pick up infant so as to take the train homewards the same evening together with two or three woman who as she put it help she to cart the little one about on this occasion she be in a greater hurry as madame bourdieu who employ she in a variety of way have ask she to take norine 's child to the foundling hospital if she do not take it to rougemont and so say la couteau turn to madame bourdieu i shall have only the other lady 's child to take back with I well i have better see she at once to make final arrangement then i 'll take this one and carry it yonder as fast as possible for my train start at six o'clock when la couteau and madame bourdieu have go off to speak to rosine who be the other lady refer to the room sink into silence save for the wail and sob of norine mathieu have seat himself near the cradle gaze compassionately at the poor little babe who be still peacefully sleep soon however victoire the little servant girl who have hitherto remain silent as if absorb in she sewing break the heavy silence and talk on slowly and interminably without raise she eye from she needle you be quite right in not trust you child to that horrid woman she begin whatever may be do with he at the hospital he will be better off there than in she hand at least he will have a chance to live and that be why i insist like you on have mine take there at once you know i belong in that woman 's region -- yes i come from berville which be barely four mile from rougemont and i can not help know la couteau for folk talk enough about she in we village she be a nice creature and no mistake and it be a fine trade that she ply sell other people 's milk she be no better than she should be at one time but at last she be lucky enough to marry a big coarse brutal fellow whom at this time of day she lead by the nose and he help she yes he also bring nurse to pari and take baby back with he at busy time but between they they have more murder on they conscience than all the assassin that have ever be guillotine the mayor of berville a bourgeois who be retire from business and a worthy man say that rougemont be the curse of the department i know well enough that there be always be some rivalry between rougemont and berville but the folk of rougemont ply a wicked trade with the baby they get from paris all the inhabitant have end by take to it there be nothing else do in the whole village and you should just see how thing be arrange so that there may be as many funeral as possible ah yes people do not keep they stock-in-trade on they hand the more that die the more they earn and so one can understand that la couteau always want to take back as many baby as possible at each journey she make victoire recount these dreadful thing in she simple way as one whom pari have not yet turn into a liar and who say all she know careless what it may be and it seem thing be far worse year ago she continue i have hear my father say that in he time the agent would bring back four or five child at one journey -- perfect parcel of baby which they tie together and carry under they arm they set they out in row on the seat in the waiting-room at the station and one day indeed a rougemont agent forget one child in a waiting-room and there be quite a row about it because when the child be find again it be dead and then you should have see in the train what a heap of poor little thing there be all cry with hunger it become pitiable in winter time when there be snow and frost for they be all shiver and blue with cold in they scanty ragged swaddling-clothes one or another often die on the way and then it be remove at the next station and bury in the nearest cemetery and you can picture what a state those who do not die be in at we place we care better for we pig for we certainly would not send they travel in that fashion my father use to say that it be enough to make the very stone weep nowadays however there be more supervision the regulation allow the agent to take only one nursle back at a time but they know all sort of trick and often take a couple and then too they make arrangement they have woman who help they and they avail themselves of those who may be go back into the country alone yes la couteau have all sort of trick to evade the law and besides all the folk of rougemont close they eye -- they be too much interested in keep business brisk and all they fear be that the police may poke they nose into they affair ah it be all very well for the government to send inspector every month and insist on register and the mayor 's signature and the stamp of the commune why it be just as if it do nothing it do not prevent these woman from quietly ply they trade and send as many little one as they can to kingdom-come we have get a cousin at rougemont who say to we one day : ` la malivoire 's precious lucky she get rid of four more during last month ' victoire pause for a moment to thread she needle norine be still weep while mathieu listen mute with horror and with he eye fix upon the sleep child no doubt folk say less about rougemont nowadays than they use to the girl resume but there be still enough to disgust one we know three or four baby-farmer who be not worth they salt the rule be to bring the little one up with the bottle you know and you would be horrify if you see what bottle they be -- never clean always filthy with the milk inside they icy cold in the winter and sour in the summer la vimeux for she part think that the bottle system cost too much and so she feed she child on soup that clear they off all the quicker at la loiseau 's you have to hold you nose when you go near the corner where the little one sleep -- they rag be so filthy as for la gavette she be always work in the field with she man so that the three or four nursling that she generally have be leave in charge of the grandfather a old cripple of seventy who can not even prevent the fowl from come to peck at the little one \* and thing be worse even at la cauchoi ' for as she have nobody at all to mind the child when she go out work she leave they tie in they cradle for fear lest they should tumble out and crack they skull you might visit all the house in the village and you would find the same thing everywhere there be not a house where the trade be not carry on round we part there be place where folk make lace or make cheese or make cider but at rougemont they only make dead body \* there be no exaggeration in what m zolum write on this subject i have even read in french government report of instance in which nursling have be devour by pig and it be a well-known say in france that certain norman and touraine village be virtually pave with little parisian -- trans all at once she cease sewing and look at mathieu with she timid clear eye but the worst of all she continue be la couillard a old thief who once do six month in prison and who now live a little way out of the village on the verge of the wood no live child have ever leave la couillard 's that be she specialty when you see a agent like la couteau for instance take she a child you know at once what be in the wind la couteau have simply bargain that the little one shall die it be settle in a very easy fashion : the parent give a sum of three or four hundred franc on condition that the little one shall be keep till he first communion and you may be quite certain that he die within a week it be only necessary to leave a window open near he as a nurse use to do whom my father know at winter time when she have half a dozen baby in she house she would set the door wide open and then go out for a stroll and by the way that little boy in the next room whom la couteau have just go to see she 'll take he to la couillard 's i be sure for i hear the mother mademoiselle rosine agree with she the other day to give she a sum of four hundred franc down on the understanding that she should have nothing more to do in the matter at this point victoire cease speak for la couteau come in to fetch norine 's child norine who have emerge from she distress during the servant girl 's story have end by listen to they with great interest but directly she perceive the agent she once more hide she face in she pillow as though she fear to see what be about to happen mathieu on he side have rise from he chair and stand there quiver so it be understand i be go to take the child say la couteau madame bourdieu have give I a slip of paper bear the date of the birth and the address only i ought to have some christian name what do you wish the child to be call norine do not at first answer then in a faint distressful voice she say : alexandre alexandre very well but you would do better to give the boy a second christian name so as to identify he the more readily if some day you take it into you head to run after he it be again necessary to tear a reply from norine honore she say alexandre honore -- all right that last name be yours be it not \* and the first be the father 's that be settle and now i have everything i need only it be four o'clock already and i shall never get back in time for the six o'clock train if i do not take a cab it be such a long way off -- the other side of the luxembourg and a cab cost money how shall we manage \* norine be of course a diminutive of honorine which be the feminine form of honore -- trans while she continue whine to see if she could not extract a few franc from the distressed girl it suddenly occur to mathieu to carry out he mission to the very end by drive with she himself to the foundling hospital so that he might be in a position to inform beauchene that the child have really be deposit there in he presence so he tell la couteau that he would go down with she take a cab and bring she back all right that will suit I let we be off it be a pity to wake the little one since he be so sound asleep but all the same we must pack he off since it be decide with she dry hand which be use to handle goods of this description she catch up the child perhaps however a little roughly forget she assumed wheedling good nature now that she be simply charge with convey it to hospital and the child awake and begin to scream loudly ah dear I it will not be amusing if he keep up this music in the cab quick let we be off but mathieu stop she will not you kiss he norine he ask at the very first squeal that sorry mother have dip yet lower under she sheet carry she hand to she ear distract as she be by the sound of those cry no no she gasp take he away take he away at once do not begin torture I again then she close she eye and with one arm repulse the child who seem to be pursue she but when she feel that the agent be lay he on the bed she suddenly shudder sit up and give a wild hasty kiss which light on the little fellow 's cap she have scarcely open she tear-dimmed eye and could have see but a vague phantom of that poor feeble creature wail and struggle at the decisive moment when he be be cast into the unknown you be kill I take he away take he away once in the cab the child suddenly become silent either the jolting of the vehicle calm he or the creaking of the wheel fill he with emotion la couteau who keep he on she knee at first remain silent as if interested in the people on the footwalk where the bright sun be shine then all of a sudden she begin to talk vent she thought aloud that little woman make a great mistake in not trust the child to I i should have put he out to nurse properly and he would have grow up finely at rougemont but there they all imagine that we simply worry they because we want to do business but i just ask you if she have give I five franc for myself and pay my return journey would that have ruin she a pretty girl like she ought not to be hard up for money i know very well that in we call there be some people who be hardly honest who speculate and ask for commission and then put out nursling at cheap rate and rob both the parent and the nurse it be really not right to treat these dear little thing as if they be goods -- poultry or vegetable when folk do that i can understand that they heart get harden and that they pass the little one on from hand to hand without any more care than if they be stock-in-trade but then monsieur i be a honest woman i be authorize by the mayor of we village i hold a certificate of morality which i can show to anybody if ever you should come to rougemont just ask after sophie couteau there folk will tell you that i be a hard-working woman and do not owe a copper to a soul mathieu could not help look at she to see how unblushingly she thus praise herself and she speech strike he as if it be a premeditated reply to all that victoire have relate of she for with the keen scent of a shrewd peasant woman she must have guess that charge have be bring against she when she feel that he pierce glance be diving to she very soul she doubtless fear that she have not lie with sufficient assurance and have somehow negligently betray herself for she do not insist but put on more gentleness of manner and contented herself with praise rougemont in a general way say what a perfect paradise it be where the little one be receive fed care for and coddle as if they be all son of prince then see that the gentleman utter never a word she become silent once more it be evidently useless to try to win he over and meantime the cab roll and roll along street follow street ever noisy and crowded and they cross the seine and at last draw near to the luxembourg it be only after pass the palace garden that la couteau again begin : well it be that young person 's own affair if she imagine that she child will be better off for pass through the foundling i do not attack the administration but you know monsieur there be a good deal to be say on the matter at rougemont we have a number of nursling that it send we and they do not grow any better or die less frequently than the other well well people be free to act as they fancy but all the same i should like you to know as i do all that go on in there the cab have stop at the top of the rue denfert-rochereau at a short distance from the former outer boulevard a big gray wall stretch out the frigid facade of a state establishment and it be through a quiet simple unobtrusive little doorway at the end of this wall that la couteau go in with the child mathieu follow she but he do not enter the office where a woman receive the child he feel too much emotion and fear lest he should be question it be indeed as if he consider himself a accomplice in a crime though la couteau tell he that the woman would ask he nothing and the strictest secrecy be always observe he prefer to wait in a anteroom which lead to several closed compartment where the person who come to deposit child be place to wait they turn and he watch the woman go off carry the little one who still remain extremely well behave with a vacant stare in he big eye though the interval of wait could not have last more than twenty minute it seem terribly long to mathieu lifeless quietude reign in that stern sad-looking anteroom wainscote with oak and pervade with the smell peculiar to hospital all he hear be the occasional faint wail of some infant above which now and then rise a heavy restrained sob come perhaps from some mother who be wait in one of the adjoining compartment and he recall the slide of other day the box which turn within the wall the mother creep up conceal herself much as possible from view thrust she baby into the cavity as into a oven give a tug at the bell-chain and then precipitately flee mathieu be too young to have see the real thing he have only see it represent in a melodrama at the port st martin theater \* but how many story it recall -- hamper of poor little creature bring up from the province and deposit at the hospital by carrier the steal babe of duchess here cast into oblivion by suspicious-looking man the hundred of wretched work-girl too who have here rid themselves of they unfortunate child now however the child have to be deposit openly and there be a staff which take down name and date while give a pledge of inviolable secrecy mathieu be aware that some few people imputed to the suppression of the slide system the great increase in criminal offence but each day public opinion condemn more and more the attitude of society in former time and discard the idea that one must accept evil dam it in and hide it as if it be some necessary sewer for the only course for a free community to pursue be to foresee evil and grapple with it and destroy it in the bud to diminish the number of cast-off child one must seek out the mother encourage they succor they and give they the means to be mother in fact as well as in name at that moment however mathieu do not reason it be he heart that be affect fill with grow pity and anguish at the thought of all the crime all the shame all the grief and distress that have pass through that anteroom in which he stand what terrible confession must have be hear what a procession of suffer ignominy and wretchedness must have be witness by that woman who receive the child in she mysterious little office to she all the wreckage of the slum all the woe lie beneath gilded life all the abomination all the torture that remain unknown be carry there in she office be the port for the shipwreck there the black hole that swallow up the offspring of frailty and shame and while mathieu 's spell of wait continue he see three poor creature arrive at the hospital one be surely a work-girl delicate and pretty though she look so thin so pale too and with so wild a air that he remember a paragraph he have lately read in a newspaper recount how another such girl after forsake she child have throw herself into the river the second seem to he to be a married woman some workman 's wife no doubt overburdened with child and unable to provide food for another mouth while the third be tall strong and insolent -- one of those who bring three or four child to the hospital one after the other and all three woman plunge in and he hear they be pen in separate compartment by a attendant while he with stricken heart realize how heavily fate fall on some still stand there wait \* the slide system which enable a mother to deposit she child at the hospital without be see by those within cease to be employ officially as far back as 1847 but the apparatus be long preserved intact and i recollect see it in the latter year of the second empire _ cir _ 1867-70 when i be often at the artist ' studio in the neighborhood the aperture through which child be deposit in the sliding-box be close to the little door of which m zolum speak -- trans when la couteau at last reappear with empty arm she say never a word and mathieu put no question to she still in silence they take they seat in the cab and only some ten minute afterwards when the vehicle be already roll through bustling populous street do the woman begin to laugh then as she companion still silent and distant do not condescend to ask she the cause of she sudden gayety she end by say aloud : do you know why i be laugh if i keep you wait a bit longer it be because i meet a friend of mine a attendant in the house just as i leave the office she be one of those who put the baby out to nurse in the province \* well my friend tell I that she be go to rougemont to-morrow with two other attendant and that among other they would certainly have with they the little fellow i have just leave at the hospital \* there be only about 600 bed at the hopital des enfants assiste and the majority of the child deposit there be perforce place out to purse in the country -- trans again do she give vent to a dry laugh which distort she wheedling face and she continue : how comical eh the mother would not let I take the child to rougemont and now it be go there just the same ah some thing be bind to happen in spite of everything mathieu do not answer but a icy chill have speed through he heart it be true fate pitilessly take its own course what would become of that poor little fellow to what early death what life of suffer or wretchedness or even crime have he be thus brutally cast but the cab continue roll on and for a long while neither mathieu nor la couteau speak again it be only when the latter alight in the rue de miromesnil that she begin to lament on see that it be already half-past five o'clock for she feel certain that she would miss she train particularly as she still have some account to settle and that other child upstairs to fetch mathieu who have intend to keep the cab and drive to the northern terminus then experience a feeling of curiosity and thought of witness the departure of the nurse-agent so he calm la couteau by tell she that if she would make haste he would wait for she and as she ask for a quarter of a hour it occur to he to speak to norine again and so he also go upstairs when he enter norine 's room he find she sit up in bed eat one of the orange

faintly in a embarrassed way it be do he simply say she do not immediately reply but wipe she finger on she handkerchief however it be necessary that she should say something and so she begin : you do not tell I you would come back -- i be not expect you well it be do and it be all for the best i assure you there be no means of do otherwise then she speak of she departure ask the young man if he think she might regain admittance to the work and declare that in any case she should go there to see if the master would have the audacity to turn she away thus she continue while the minute go slowly by the conversation have drop mathieu scarcely reply to she when la couteau carry the other child in she arm at last dart in like a gust of wind let 's make haste let 's make haste she cry they never end with they figure they try all they can to leave I without a copper for myself but norine detain she asking : oh be that rosine 's baby pray do show it I then she uncover the infant 's face and exclaim : oh how plump and pretty he be and she begin another sentence : what a pity can one have the heart -- but then she remember pause and change she word : yes how heartrending it be when one have to forsake such little angel good-by take care of yourself cry la couteau you will make I miss my train and i have get the return ticket too the five other be wait for I at the station ah what a fuss they would make if i get there too late then follow by mathieu she hurry away bound down the stair where she almost fall with she little burden but soon she throw herself back in the cab which roll off ah that be a good job and what do you say of that young person monsieur she would not lay out fifteen franc a month on she own account and yet she reproach that good mademoiselle rosine who have just give I four hundred franc to have she little one take care of till he first communion just look at he -- a superb child be not he what a pity it be that the finest be often those who die the first mathieu look at the infant on the woman 's knee he garment be very white of fine texture trim with lace as if he be some little condemn prince be take in all luxury to execution and the young man remember that norine have tell he that the child be the offspring of crime bear amid secrecy he be now for a fix sum to be hand over to a woman who would quietly suppress he by simply leave some door or window wide open young though the boy be he already have a finely-formed face that suggest the beauty of a cherub and he be very well behave he do not raise the faintest wail but a shudder sweep through mathieu how abominable la couteau quickly spring from the cab as soon as they reach the courtyard of the st lazare station thank you monsieur you have be very kind say she and if you will kindly recommend I to any lady you may know i shall be quite at they disposal then mathieu have alight on the pavement in he turn see a scene which detain he there a few moment longer amid all the scramble of passenger and luggage five woman of peasant aspect each carry a infant be dart in a scared uneasy way hither and thither like crow in trouble with big yellow beak quiver and black wing flap with anxiety then on perceive la couteau there be one general caw and all five swoop down upon she with angry voracious mien and after a furious exchange of cry and explanation the six band themselves together and with cap-string wave and skirt fly rush towards the train carry the little one like bird of prey who fear delay in return to the charnel-house and mathieu remain alone in the great crowd thus every year do these crow of ill omen carry off from paris no fewer than 20000 child who be never never see again ah that great question of the depopulation of france not merely be there those who be resolve to have no child not only be infanticide and crime of other kind rife upon all side but one-half of the babe save from those danger be kill thief and murderess eager for lucre flock to the great city from the four point of the compass and bear away all the bud life that they arm could carry in order that they might turn it to death they beat down the game they watch in the doorway they sniff from afar the innocent flesh on which they prey and the babe be cart to the railway station the cradle the ward of hospital and refuge the wretched garret of poor mother without fire and without bread -- all all be empty and the package be heap up move carelessly hither and thither send off distribute to be murder either by foul deed or by neglect the raid sweep on like tempest blast death 's scythe never know dead season at every hour it mow down bud life child who might well have live be take from they mother the only nurse whose milk would have nourish they to be cart away and to die for lack of proper nutriment a rush of blood warm mathieu 's heart when all at once he think of marianne so strong and healthy who would be wait for he on the bridge over the yeuse in the open country with they little gervai at she breast figure that he have see in print come back to he mind in certain region which devoted themselves to baby-farm the mortality among the nursling be fifty per cent in the best of they it be forty and seventy in the worst it be calculate that in one century seventeen million of nursling have die over a long period the mortality have remain at from one hundred to one hundred and twenty thousand per annum the most deadly reign the greatest butchery of the most terrible conqueror have never result in such massacre it be a giant battle that france lose every year the abyss into which she whole strength sink the charnel-place into which every hope be cast at the end of it be the imbecile death of the nation and mathieu seize with terror at the thought rush away eager to seek consolation by the side of marianne amid the peacefulness the wisdom and the health which be they happy lot ix one Thursday morning mathieu go to lunch with dr boutan in the room where the latter have reside for more than ten year in the rue de l'universite behind the palais-bourbon by a contradiction at which he himself often laugh this impassioned apostle of fruitfulness have remain a bachelor he extensive practice keep he in a perpetual hurry and he have little time free beyond he dejeuner hour accordingly whenever a friend wish to have any serious conversation with he he prefer to invite he to he modest table to partake more or less hastily of a egg a cutlet and a cup of coffee mathieu wish to ask the doctor 's advice on a grave subject after a couple of week ' reflection he idea of experiment in agriculture of extricate that unappreciated estate of chanteble from chaos preoccupy he to such a degree that he positively suffer at not daring to come to a decision the imperious desire to create to produce life health strength and wealth grow within he day by day yet what fine courage and what a fund of hope he need to venture upon a enterprise which outwardly seem so wild and rash and the wisdom of which be apparent to himself alone with whom could he discuss such a matter to whom could he confide he doubt and hesitation when the idea of consult boutan occur to he he at once ask the doctor for a appointment here be such a confidant as he desire a man of broad brave mind one who worship life who be endowed with far-seeing intelligence and who would therefore at once look beyond the first difficulty of execution as soon as they be face to face on either side of the table mathieu begin to pour forth he confession recount he dream -- he poem as he call it and the doctor listen without interrupt evidently win over by the young man 's grow creative emotion when at last boutan have to express a opinion he reply : _ mon dieu _ my friend i can tell you nothing from a practical point of view for i have never even plant a lettuce i will even add that you project seem to I so hazardous that any one verse in these matter whom you might consult would assuredly bring forward substantial and convincing argument to dissuade you but you speak of this affair with such superb confidence and ardor and affection that i feel convinced you would succeed moreover you flatter my own view for i have long endeavor to show that if numerous family be ever to flourish again in france people must again love and worship the soil and desert the town and lead a fruitful fortify country life so how can i disapprove you plan moreover i suspect that like all people who ask advice you simply come here in the hope that you would find in I a brother ready in principle at all event to wage the same battle at this they both laugh heartily then on boutan inquire with what capital he would start operation mathieu quietly explain that he do not mean to borrow money and thus run into debt he would begin if necessary with very few acre indeed convince as he be of the conquer power of labor he would be the head and he would assuredly find the necessary arm he only worry be whether he would be able to induce seguin to sell he the old hunting-box and the few acre round it on a system of yearly payment without preliminary disbursement when he speak to the doctor on this subject the other reply : oh i think he be very favorably disposed i know that he would be delighted to sell that huge unprofitable estate for with he increase pecuniary want he be very much embarrass by it you be aware no doubt that thing be go from bad to worse in he household then the doctor break off to inquire : and we friend beauchene have you warn he of you intention to leave the work why no not yet say mathieu and i would ask you to keep the matter private for i wish to have everything settle before inform he lunch quickly they have now get to they coffee and the doctor offer to drive mathieu back to the work as he be go there himself for madame beauchene have request he to call once a week in order that he might keep a eye on maurice 's health not only do the lad still suffer from he leg but he have so weak and delicate a stomach that he have to be diet severely it be the kind of stomach one find among child who have not be bring up by they own mother continue boutan you plucky wife do not know that trouble she can let she child eat whatever they fancy but with that poor little maurice the merest trifle such as four cherry instead of three provoke indigestion well so it be settle i will drive you back to the work only i must first make a call in the rue roquepine to choose a nurse it will not take I long i hope quick let we be off when they be together in the brougham boutan tell mathieu that it be precisely for the seguin that he be go to the nurse-agency there be a terrible time at the house in the avenue d'antin a few month previously valentine have give birth to a daughter and she husband have obstinately resolve to select a fit nurse for the child himself pretend that he know all about such matter and he have choose a big sturdy young woman of monumental appearance nevertheless for two month past andree the baby have be pine away and the doctor have discover by analyze the nurse 's milk that it be deficient in nutriment thus the child be simply perish of starvation to change a nurse be a terrible thing and the seguin ' house be in a tempestuous state the husband rush hither and thither bang the door and declare that he would never more occupy himself about anything and so add boutan i have now be instruct to choose a fresh nurse and it be a press matter for i be really feel anxious about that poor little andree but why do not the mother nurse she child ask mathieu the doctor make a gesture of despair ah my dear fellow you ask I too much but how would you have a parisienne of the wealthy bourgeoisie undertake the duty the long brave task of nurse a child when she lead the life she do what with reception and dinner and soiree and absence and social obligation of all sort that little madame seguin be simply trifling when she put on a air of deep distress and say that she would so much have like to nurse she infant but that it be impossible since she have no milk she never even try when she first child be bear she could doubtless have nurse it but to-day with the imbecile spoilt life she lead it be quite certain that she be incapable of make such a effort the worst be my dear fellow as any doctor will tell you that after three or four generation of mother who do not feed they child there come a generation that can not do so and so my friend we be fast come not only in france but in other country where the odious wet-nurse system be in vogue to a race of wretched degenerate woman who will be absolutely powerless to nourish they offspring mathieu then remember what he have witness at madame bourdieu 's and the foundling hospital and he impart he impression to boutan who again make a despairing gesture there be a great work of social salvation to be accomplish say he no doubt a number of philanthropist be try they best to improve thing but private effort could not cope with such widespread need there must be general measure law must be pass to save the nation the mother must be protect and help even in secrecy if she ask for it she must be care for succore from the earliest period and right through all the long month during which she feed she babe all sort of establishment would have to be found -- refuge convalescent home and so forth and there must be protective enactment and large sum of money vote to enable help to be extend to all mother whatever they might be it be only by such preventive step that one could put a stop to the frightful hecatomb of newly-born infant that incessant loss of life which exhaust the nation and bring it nearer and nearer to death every day and continue the doctor it may all be sum up in this verity : ` it be a mother 's duty to nurse she child ' and besides a mother be she not the symbol of all grandeur all strength all beauty she represent the eternity of life she deserve a social culture she should be religiously venerate when we know how to worship motherhood we country will be save and this be why my friend i should like a mother feed she babe to be adopt as the highest expression of human beauty ah how can one persuade we parisienne all we french woman indeed that woman 's beauty lie in be a mother with a infant on she knee whenever that fashion prevail we shall be the sovereign nation the master of the world he end by laugh in a distressed way in he despair at be unable to change manners and custom aware as he be that the nation could be revolutionize only by a change in its ideal of true beauty to sum up then i believe in a child be nurse only by its own mother every mother who neglect that duty when she can perform it be a criminal of course there be instance when she be physically incapable of accomplish she duty and in that case there be the feeding-bottle which if employ with care and extreme cleanliness only sterilize milk be use will yield a sufficiently good result but to send a child away to be nurse means almost certain death and as for the nurse in the house that be a shameful transaction a source of incalculable evil for both the employer 's child and the nurse 's child frequently die from it just then the doctor 's brougham draw up outside the nurse-agency in the rue roquepine i dare say you have never be in such a place although you be the father of five child say boutan to mathieu gayly no i have not well then come with I one ought to know everything the office in the rue roquepine be the most important and the one with the best reputation in the district it be keep by madame broquette a woman of forty with a dignified if somewhat blotched face who be always very tightly lace in a fade silk gown of dead-leaf hue but if she represent the dignity and fair fame of the establishment in its intercourse with client the soul of the place the ever-busy manipulator be she husband monsieur broquette a little man with a pointed nose quick eye and the agility of a ferret charge with the police duty of the office the supervision and training of the nurse he receive they make they clean themselves teach they to smile and put on pleasant way besides pen they in they various room and prevent they from eat too much from morn till night he be ever prowl about scolding and terrorize those dirty ill-behaved and often lie and thieve woman the building a dilapidated private house with a damp ground floor to which alone client be admit have two upper story each comprise six room arrange as dormitory in which the nurse and they infant sleep there be no end to the arrival and departure there : the peasant woman be ever gallop through the place drag trunk about carry babe in swaddle clothes and fill the room and the passage with wild cry and vile odor and amid all this the house have another inmate mademoiselle broquette herminie as she be call a long pale bloodless girl of fifteen who moon about languidly among that swarm of sturdy young woman boutan who know the house well go in follow by mathieu the central passage which be fairly broad end in a glass door which admit one to a kind of courtyard where a sickly conifer stand on a round patch of grass which the dampness rot on the right of the passage be the office whither madame broquette at the request of she customer summon the nurse who wait in a neighboring room which be simply furnish with a greasy deal table in the center the furniture of the office be some old empire stuff upholster in red velvet there be a little mahogany center table and a gilt clock then on the left of the passage near the kitchen be the general refectory with two long table cover with oilcloth and surround by straggle chair whose straw seat be badly damage just a make-believe sweep with a broom be give there every day : one could divine long-amassed tenacious dirt in every dim corner and the place reek with a odor of bad cookery mingle with that of sour milk when boutan thrust open the office door he see that madame broquette be busy with a old gentleman who sit there inspect a party of nurse she recognize the doctor and make a gesture of regret no matter no matter he exclaim i be not in a hurry : i will wait through the open door mathieu have catch sight of mademoiselle herminie the daughter of the house ensconce in one of the red velvet armchair near the window and dreamily peruse a novel there while she mother stand up extol she goods in she most dignified way to the old gentleman who gravely contemplate the procession of nurse and seem unable to make up he mind let we have a look at the garden say the doctor with a laugh one of the boast of the establishment indeed as set forth in its prospectus be a garden and a tree in it as if there be plenty of good air there as in the country they open the glass door and on a bench near the tree they see a plump girl who doubtless have just arrive pretend to clean a squeal infant she herself look sordid and have evidently not wash since she journey in one corner there be a overflow of kitchen utensil a pile of crack pot and greasy and rusty saucepan then at the other end a french window give access to the nurse ' waiting-room and here again there be a nauseous spectacle of dirt and untidiness all at once monsieur broquette dart forward though whence he have come it be hard to say at all event he have see boutan who be a client that need attention be my wife busy then say he i can not allow you to remain wait here doctor come come i pray you with he little ferret eye he have catch sight of the dirty girl clean the child and he be anxious that he visitor should see nothing further of a character to give they a bad impression of the establishment pray doctor follow I he repeat and understand that a example be necessary he turn to the girl exclaim what business have you to be here why have not you go upstairs to wash and dress i shall fling a pailful of water in you face if you do not hurry off and tidy yourself then he force she to rise and drive she off all scared and terrify in front of he when she have go upstairs he lead the two gentleman to the office entrance and begin to complain : ah doctor if you only know what trouble i have even to get those girl to wash they hand we who be so clean who put all we pride in keep the house clean if ever a speck of dust be see anywhere it be certainly not my fault since the girl have go upstairs a fearful tumult have arise on the upper floor whence also a vile smell descend some dispute some battle seem to be in progress there be shout and howl follow by a furious exchange of vituperation pray excuse I at last exclaimed monsieur broquette my wife will receive you in a minute thereupon he slip off and fly up the stair with noiseless agility and directly afterwards there be a explosion then the house suddenly sink into death-like silence all that could be hear be the voice of madame in the office as in a very dignified manner she keep on praise she goods well my friend say boutan to mathieu while they walk up and down the passage all this the material side of thing be nothing what you should see and know be what go on in the mind of all these people and note that this be a fair average place there be other which be real den and which the police sometimes have to close no doubt there be a certain amount of supervision and there be severe regulation which compel the nurse to bring certificate of morality book set forth they name age parentage the situation they have hold and so on with other document on which they have immediately to secure a signature from the prefecture where the final authorization be grant they but these precaution do not prevent fraud and deceit of various kind the woman assert that they have only recently begin nursing when they have be do it for month they show you superb child which they have borrow and which they assert to be they own and there be many other trick to which they resort in they eagerness to make money as the doctor and mathieu chat on they pause for a moment near the door of the refectory which chance to be open and there among other young peasant woman they espy la couteau hastily partaking of cold meat doubtless she have just arrive from rougemont and after dispose of the batch of nurse she have bring with she be seek sustenance for the various visit which she would have to make before return home the refectory with its wine-stained table and greasy wall cast a smell like that of a badly-kept sink ah so you know la couteau exclaim boutan when mathieu have tell he of he meeting with the woman then you know the depths of crime la couteau be a ogress and yet think of it with we fine social organization she be more or less useful and perhaps i myself shall be happy to choose one of the nurse that she have bring with she at this moment madame broquette very amiably ask the visitor into she office after long reflection the old gentleman have go off without select any nurse but say that he would return some other time there be folk who do not know they own mind say madame broquette sententiously it be not my fault and i sincerely beg you to excuse I doctor if you want a good nurse you will be satisfy for i have just receive some excellent one from the province i will show you herminie meanwhile have not condescend to raise she nose from she novel she remain ensconce in she armchair still read with a weary bored expression on she anaemic countenance mathieu after sit down a little on one side contented himself with look on while boutan stand erect attentive to every detail like a commander review he troops and the procession begin have open a door which communicate with the common room madame broquette assume the most noble air leisurely introduce the pick of she nurse in group of three each with she infant in she arm about a dozen be thus inspect : short one with big heavy limb tall one suggest maypole dark one with coarse stiff hair fair one with the whitest of skin quick one and slow one ugly one and other who be pleasant-looking all however wear the same nervous silly smile all sway themselves with embarrassed timidity the anxious mien of the bondswoman at the slave market who fear that she may not find a purchaser they clumsily try to put on graceful way radiant with internal joy directly a customer seem to nibble but clouding over and cast black glance at they companion when the latter seem to have the better chance out of the dozen the doctor begin by set three aside and finally he detain but one in order that he might study she more fully one can see that monsieur le docteur know he business madame broquette allow herself to say with a flattering smile i do not often have such pearl but she have only just arrive otherwise she would probably have be engage already i can answer for she as i could for myself for i have put she out before the nurse be a dark woman of about twenty-six of average height build strongly enough but have a heavy common face with a hard-looking jaw have already be in service however she hold herself fairly well so that child be not you first one ask the doctor no monsieur he be my third then boutan inquire into she circumstance study she papers take she into madame broquette 's private room for examination and on he return make a minute inspection of she child a strong plump boy some three month old who in the interval have remain very quiet on a armchair the doctor seem satisfied but he suddenly raise he head to ask and that child be really you own oh monsieur where could i have get he otherwise oh my girl child be borrow you know then he pause for a moment still hesitate and look at the young woman embarrass by some feeling of doubt although she seem to embody all requirement and be you all quite well in you family he ask have none of you relative ever die of chest complaint never monsieur well of course you would not tell I if they have you book ought to contain a page for information of that kind and you be you of sober habit you do not drink oh monsieur this time the young woman bristle up and boutan have to calm she then she face brighten with pleasure as soon as the doctor -- with the gesture of a man who be take he chance for however careful one may be there be always a element of chance in such matter -- say to she : well it be understand i engage you if you can send you child away at once you can go this evening to the address i will give you let I see what be you name marie lebleu madame broquette who without presume to interfere with a doctor have retain she majestic air which so fully proclaim the high respectability of she establishment now turn towards she daughter : herminie go to see if madame couteau be still there then as the girl slowly raise she pale dreamy eye without stir from she chair she mother come to the conclusion that she have better execute the commission herself a moment later she come back with la couteau the doctor be now settle money matter eighty franc a month for the nurse and forty-five franc for she board and lodging at the agency and madame broquette 's charge then there be the question of she child 's return to the country which mean another thirty franc without count a gratuity to la couteau i be go back this evening say the latter i be quite willing to take the little one with I in the avenue d'antin do you say oh i know there be a lady 's maid from my district in that house marie can go there at once when i have settle my business in a couple of hour i will go and rid she of she baby on enter the office la couteau have glance askance at mathieu without however appear to recognize he he have remain on he chair silently watch the scene -- first a inspection as of cattle at a market and then a bargaining the sale of a mother 's milk and by degree pity and revolt have fill he heart but a shudder pass through he when la couteau turn towards the quiet fine-looking child of which she promise to rid the nurse and once more he picture she with she five companion at the st-lazare railway station each like some voracious crow with a new-born babe in she clutch it be the pillaging begin afresh life and hope be again be steal from pari and this time as the doctor say a double murder be threaten for however careful one may be the employer 's child often die from another 's milk and the nurse 's child carry back into the country like a parcel be kill with neglect and indigestible pap but everything be now settle and so the doctor and he companion drive away to grenelle and there at the very entrance of the beauchene work come a meeting which again fill mathieu with emotion morange the accountant be return to he work after dejeuner accompany by he daughter reine both of they dress in deep mourning on the morrow of valerie 's funeral morange have return to he work in a state of prostration which almost resemble forgetfulness it be clear that he have abandon all ambitious plan of quit the work to seek a big fortune elsewhere still he could not make up he mind to leave he flat though it be now too large for he besides be too expensive but then he wife have live in those room and he wish to remain in they and moreover he desire to provide he daughter with all comfort all the affection of he weak heart be now give to that child whose resemblance to she mother distract he he would gaze at she for hour with tear in he eye a great passion be spring up within he he one dream now be to dower she richly and seek happiness through she if indeed he could ever be happy again thus feeling of avarice have come to he he economize with respect to everything that be not connect with she and secretly seek supplementary work in order that he might give she more luxury and increase she dower without she he would have die of weariness and self-abandonment she be indeed fast become he very life why yes say she with a pretty smile in answer to a question which boutan put to she it be i who have bring poor papa back i want to be sure that he would take a stroll before set to work again other wise he shut himself up in he room and do not stir morange make a vague apologetic gesture at home indeed overcome as he be by grief and remorse he live in he bedroom in the company of a collection of he wife 's portrait some fifteen photograph show she at all age which he have hang on the wall it be very fine to-day monsieur morange say boutan you do right in take a stroll the unhappy man raise he eye in astonishment and glance at the sun as if he have not previously notice it that be true it be fine weather -- and besides it be very good for reine to go out a little then he tenderly gaze at she so charming so pink and white in she black mourning gown he be always fear that she must feel bore during the long hour when he leave she at home alone with the servant to he solitude be so distressful so full of the wife whom he mourn and whom he accuse himself of have kill papa will not believe that one never feel _ ennui _ at my age say the girl gayly since my poor mamma be no longer there i must need be a little woman and besides the baroness sometimes call to take I out then she give a shrill cry on see a brougham draw up close to the curb a woman be lean out of the window and she recognize she why papa there be the baroness she must have go to we house and clara must have tell she that i have accompany you here this indeed be what have happen morange hastily lead reine to the carriage from which seraphine do not alight and when he daughter have spring in joyously he remain there another moment effusively thank the baroness and delighted to think that he dear child be go to amuse herself then after watch the brougham till it disappear he enter the factory look suddenly aged and shrunken as if he grief have fall on he shoulder once more so overwhelming he that he quite forget the other and do not even take leave of they poor fellow muttered mathieu who have turn icy cold on see seraphine 's bright mock face and red hair at the carriage window then he be go to he office when beauchene beckon to he from one of the window of the house to come in with the doctor the pair of they find constance and maurice in the little drawing-room whither the father have repair to finish he coffee and smoke a cigar boutan immediately attend to the child who be much better with respect to he leg but who still suffer from stomachic disturbance the slightest departure from the prescribe diet lead to troublesome complication constance though she do not confess it have become really anxious about the boy and question the doctor and listen to he with all eagerness while she be thus engage beauchene draw mathieu on one side i say he begin laugh why do you not tell I that everything be finish over yonder i meet the pretty blonde in the street yesterday mathieu quietly reply that he have wait to be question in order to render a account of he mission for he have not care to be the first to raise such a painful subject the money hand to he for expense have prove sufficient and whenever the other desire it he could produce receipt for he various disbursement he be already enter into particulars when beauchene jovially interrupt he you know what happen here she have the audacity to come and ask for work not of I of course but of the foreman of the woman 's work-room fortunately i have foresee this and have give strict order so the foreman tell she that consideration of order and discipline prevent he from take she back she sister euphrasie who be to be marry next week be still work here just fancy they have another set-to besides she place be not here then he go to take a little glass of cognac which stand on the mantelpiece mathieu have learn only the day before that norine on leave madame bourdieu 's have seek a temporary refuge with a female friend not care to resume a life of quarrel at she parent ' home besides she attempt to regain admittance at beauchene 's she have apply at two other establishment but as a matter of fact she do not evince any particular ardor in seek to obtain work four month ' idleness and coddling have altogether disgusted she with a factory hand 's life and the inevitable be bind to happen indeed beauchene as he come back sip he cognac resume : yes i meet she in the street she be quite smartly dress and lean on the arm of a big bearded young fellow who do nothing but make eye at she it be certain to come to that you know i always think so then he be step towards he wife and the doctor when he remember something else come back and ask mathieu in a yet lower tone what be it you be tell I about the child and as soon as mathieu have relate that he have take the infant to the foundling hospital so as to be certain that it be deposit there he warmly press he hand that be perfect thank you my dear fellow i shall be at peace now he feel indeed intensely relieved hum a lively air and then take he stand before constance who be still consult the doctor she be hold little maurice against she knee and gaze at he with the jealous love of a good bourgeoise who carefully watch over the health of she only son that son whom she wish to make a prince of industry and wealth all at once however in reply to a remark from boutan she exclaim : why then doctor you think I culpable you really say that a child nurse by he mother always have a stronger constitution than other and can the better resist the ailment of childhood oh there be no doubt of it madame beauchene cease to chew he cigar shrug he shoulder and burst into a sonorous laugh : oh do not you worry that youngster will live to be a hundred why the burgundian who nurse he be as strong as a rock but i say doctor you intend then to make the chamber pass a law for obligatory nursing by mother at this sally boutan also begin to laugh well why not say he this at once supply beauchene with material for innumerable jest why such a law would completely upset manners and custom social life would be suspend and drawing-room would become desert poster would be placard everywhere bear the inscription : close on account of nursing briefly say beauchene in conclusion you want to have a revolution a revolution yes the doctor gently reply and we will effect it x mathieu finish study he great scheme the clearing and cultivation of chantebled and at last contrary to all prudence but with all the audacity of fervent faith and hope it be resolve upon he warn beauchene one morning that he should leave the work at the end of the month for on the previous day he have speak to seguin and have find he quite willing to sell the little pavilion and some fifty acre around it on very easy term as mathieu have imagine seguin 's affair be in a very muddle state for he have lose large sum at the gaming table and spend money recklessly on woman lead indeed a most disastrous life since trouble have arise in he home and so he welcome the transaction which mathieu propose to he in the hope that the young man would end by rid he of the whole of that unprofitable estate should he first experiment prove successful then come other interview between they and seguin finally consent to sell on a system of annual payment spread over a term of year the first to be make in two year ' time from that date as thing stand the property seem likely to remain unremunerative forever and so there be nothing risk in allow the purchaser a couple of year ' credit however they agree to meet once more and settle the final detail before a formal deed of sale be draw up and one Monday morning therefore about ten o'clock mathieu set out for the house in the avenue d'antin in order to complete the business that morning as it happen celeste the maid receive in the linen room where she usually remain a visit from she friend madame menoux the little haberdasher of the neighborhood in whose tiny shop she be so fond of gossip they have become more intimate than ever since la couteau at celeste 's instigation have take madame menoux 's child pierre to rougemont to be put out to nurse there in the best possible way for the sum of thirty franc a month la couteau have also very complaisantly promise to call each month at one or another of she journey in order to receive the thirty franc thereby save the mother the trouble of send the money by post and also enable she to obtain fresh news of she child thus each time a payment become due if la couteau 's journey happen to be delay a single day madame menoux grow terribly frightened and hasten off to celeste to make inquiry of she and moreover she be glad to have a opportunity of converse with this girl who come from the very part where she little pierre be be rear you will excuse I will not you mademoiselle for call so early say she but you tell I that you lady never require you before nine o'clock and i have come you know because i have have no news from over yonder and it occur to I that you perhaps might have receive a letter blonde short and thin madame menoux who be the daughter of a poor clerk have a slender pale face and a pleasant but somewhat sad expression from she own slightness of build probably spring she passionate admiration for she big handsome husband who could have crush she between he finger if she be slight however she be endowed with unconquerable tenacity and courage and she would have kill herself with hard work to provide he with the coffee and cognac which he like to sip after each repast ah it be hard she continue to have have to send we pierre so far away as it be i do not see my husband all day and now i have a child whom i never see at all but the misfortune be that one have to live and how could i have keep the little fellow in that tiny shop of mine where from morning till night i never have a moment to spare yet i can not help cry at the thought that i be not able to keep and nurse he when my husband come home from the museum every evening we do nothing but talk about he like a pair of fool and so accord to you mademoiselle that place rougemont be very healthy and there be never any nasty illness about there but at this moment she be interrupt by the arrival of another early visitor whose advent she hail with a cry of delight oh how happy i be to see you madame couteau what a good idea it be of mine to call here amid exclamation of joyous surprise the nurse-agent explain that she have arrive by the night train with a batch of nurse and have start on she round of visit as soon as she have deposit they in the rue roquepine after bidding celeste good-day in pass say she i intend to call on you my dear lady but since you be here we can settle we account here if you be agreeable madame menoux however be look at she very anxiously and how be my little pierre she ask why not so bad not so bad he be not you know one of the strongest one can not say that he be a big child only he be so pretty and nice-looking with he rather pale face and it be quite certain that if there be bigger baby than he be there be smaller one too she speak more slowly as she proceed and carefully seek word which might render the mother anxious without drive she to despair these be she usual tactic in order to disturb she customer ' heart and then extract as much money from they as possible on this occasion she must have guess that she might carry thing so far as to ascribe a slight illness to the child however i must really tell you because i do not know how to lie and besides after all it be my duty -- well the poor little darling have be ill and he be not quite well again yet madame menoux turn very pale and clasp she puny little hand : _ mon dieu _ he will die of it no no since i tell you that he be already a little better and certainly he do not lack good care you should just see how la loiseau coddle he when child be well behave they soon get themselves love and the whole house be at he service and no expense be spare the doctor come twice and there be even some medicine and that cost money the last word fall from la couteau 's lip with the weight of a club then without leave the scared tremble mother time to recover the nurse-agent continue : shall we go into we account my dear lady madame menoux who have intend to make a payment before return to she shop be delighted to have some money with she they look for a slip of paper on which to set down the figure first the month 's nursing thirty franc then the doctor six franc and indeed with the medicine that would make ten franc ah and besides i mean to tell you add la couteau that so much linen be dirty during he illness that you really ought to add three franc for the soap that would only be just and besides there be other little expense sugar and egg so that in you place to act like a good mother i should put down five franc forty-five franc altogether will that suit you in spite of she emotion madame menoux feel that she be be rob that the other be speculate on she distress she make a gesture of surprise and revolt at the idea of have to give so much money -- that money which she find so hard to earn no end of cotton and needle have to be sell to get such a sum together and she distress between the necessity of economy on the one hand and she maternal anxiety on the other would have touch the hardest heart but that will make another half-month 's money say she at this la couteau put on she most frigid air : well what would you have it be not my fault one can not let you child die so one must incur the necessary expense and then if you have not confidence in I say so send the money and settle thing direct indeed that will greatly relieve I for in all this i lose my time and trouble but then i be always stupid enough to be too oblige when madame menoux again quiver and anxious have give way another difficulty arise she have only some gold with she two twenty-franc piece and one ten-franc piece the three coin lay glitter on the table la couteau look at they with she yellow fixed eye well i can not give you you five franc change she say i have not any change with I and you celeste have you any change for this lady she risk ask this question but put it in such a tone and with such a glance that the other immediately understand she i have not a copper in my pocket she reply deep silence fall then with bleeding heart and a gesture of cruel resignation madame menoux do what be expect of she keep those five franc for yourself madame couteau since you have to take so much trouble and _ mon dieu _ may all this money bring I good luck and at least enable my poor little fellow to grow up a fine handsome man like he father oh as for that i 'll warrant it cry the other with enthusiasm those little ailment do not mean anything -- on the contrary i see plenty of little folk i do and so just remember what i tell you yours will become a extraordinarily fine child there will not be better when madame menoux go off la couteau have lavish such flattery and such promise upon she that she feel quite light and gay no longer regret she money but dream of the day when little pierre would come back to she with plump cheek and all the vigor of a young oak as soon as the door have close behind the haberdasher celeste begin to laugh in she impudent way : what a lot of fib you tell she i do not believe that she child so much as catch a cold she exclaim la couteau begin by assume a dignified air : say that i be a liar at once the child be not well i assure you the maid 's gayety only increase at this well now you be really comical put on such air with I i know you remember and i know what be mean when the tip of you nose begin to wriggle the child be quite puny repeat she friend more gently oh i can believe that all the same i should like to see the doctor 's prescription and the soap and the sugar but you know i do not care a button about the matter as for that little madame menoux it be here to-day and go to-morrow she have she business and i have mine and you too have yours and so much the better if you get as much out of it as you can but la couteau change the conversation by ask the maid if she could not give she a drop of something to drink for night travel do upset she stomach so thereupon celeste with a laugh take a bottle half-full of malaga and a box of biscuit from the bottom of a cupboard this be she little secret store steal from the still-room then as the other express a fear that she mistress might surprise they she make a gesture of insolent contempt she mistress why she have she nose in she basin and perfumery pot and be not at all likely to call till she have fix herself up so as to look pretty there be only the child to fear added celeste that gaston and that lucie a couple of brat who be always after one because they parent never trouble about they but let they come and play here or in the kitchen from morning till night and i do not dare lock this door for fear they should come rap and kick at it when by way of precaution she have glance down the passage and they have both seat themselves at table they warm and speak out they mind soon reach a stage of easy impudence and say everything as if quite unconscious how abominable it be while sip she wine celeste ask for news of the village and la couteau speak the brutal truth between two biscuit it be at the vimeux ' house that the servant 's last child bear in la rouche 's den have die a fortnight after arrive at rougemont and the vimeux who be more or less she cousin have send she they friendly remembrance and the news that they be about to marry off they daughter then at la gavette 's the old grandfather who look after the nursling while the family be at work in the field have fall into the fire with a baby in he arm fortunately they have be pull out of it and only the little one have be roasted la cauchois though at heart she be not downcast now have some fear that she might be worry because four little one have go off from she house all in a body a window be forgetfully leave open at night-time they be all four little parisian it seem -- two foundling and two that have come from madame bourdieu 's since the beginning of the year as many have die at rougemont as have arrive there and the mayor have declare that far too many be die and that the village would end by get a bad reputation one thing be certain la couillard would be the very first to receive a visit from the gendarme if she do not so arrange matter as to keep at least one nursle alive every now and then ah that couillard add the nurse-agent just fancy my dear i take she a child a perfect little angel -- the boy of a very pretty young person who be stop at madame bourdieu 's she pay four hundred franc to have he bring up until he first communion and he live just five day really now that be not long enough la couillard need not have be so hasty it put I in such a temper i ask she if she want to dishonor I what will ruin I be my good heart i do not know how to refuse when folk ask I to do they a service and god in heaven know how fond i be of child i have always live among they and in future if anybody who be a friend of mine give I a child to put out to nurse i shall say : ` we will not take the little one to la couillard for it would be tempting providence but after all i be a honest woman and i wash my hand of it for if i do take the cherub over yonder i do not nurse they and when one 's conscience be at ease one can sleep quietly ' of course chime in celeste with a air of conviction while they thus wax maudlin over they malaga there arise a horrible red vision -- a vision of that terrible rougemont pave with little parisian the filthy bloody village the charnel-place of cowardly murder whose steeple point so peacefully to the sky in the midst of the far-spreading plain but all at once a rush be hear in the passage and the servant hasten to the door to rid herself of gaston and lucie who be approach be off i do not want you here you mamma have tell you that you must not come here then she come back into the room quite furious that be true say she i can do nothing but they must come to bother I why do not they stay a little with the nurse oh by the way interrupted la couteau do you hear that marie lebleu 's little one be dead she must have have a letter about it such a fine child it be but what can one expect it be a nasty wind passing and then you know the say ' a nurse 's child be the child of sacrifice ' yes she tell I she have hear of it reply celeste but she beg I not to mention it to madame as such thing always have a bad effect the worst be that if she child 's dead madame 's little one be not much better off at this la couteau prick up she ear ah so thing be not satisfactory no indeed it be not on account of she milk that be good enough and she have plenty of it only you never see such a creature -- such a temper always brutal and insolent bang the door and talking of smash everything at the slightest word and besides she drink like a pig -- as no woman ought to drink la couteau 's pale eye sparkle with gayety and she briskly nod she head as if to say that she know all this and have be expect it in that part of normandy in and around rougemont all the woman drink more or less and the girl even carry little bottle of brandy to school with they in they basket marie lebleu however be a woman of the kind that one pick up under the table and indeed it might be say that since the birth of she last child she have never be quite sober i know she my dear exclaimed la couteau she be impossible but then that doctor who choose she do not ask my opinion and besides it be not a matter that concern I i simply bring she to paris and take she child back to the country i know nothing about anything else let the gentlefolk get out of they trouble by themselves this sentiment tickle celeste who burst out laugh you have not a idea say she of the infernal life that marie lead here she fight people she throw a water-bottle at the coachman she break a big vase in madame 's apartment she make they all tremble with constant dread that something awful may happen and then if you know what trick she play to get something to drink for it be find out that she drink and all the liqueur be put under lock and key so you do not know what she devise well last week she drain a whole bottle of eau de melisse and be ill quite ill from it another time she be catch sip some eau de cologne from one of the bottle in madame 's dressing-room i now really believe that she treat herself to some of the spirit of wine that be give she for the warmer -- it be enough to make one die of laugh i be always splitting my side over it in my little corner then she laugh till the tear come into she eye and la couteau on she side highly amuse begin to wriggle with a savage delight all at once however she calm down and exclaim but i say they will turn she out of door oh that will not be long they would have do so already if they have dare but at this moment the ringing of a bell be hear and a oath escape celeste good there be madame ringing for I now one can never be at peace for a moment la couteau however be already stand up quite serious intent on business and ready to depart come little one do not be foolish you must do you work for my part i have a idea i 'll run to fetch one of the nurse whom i bring this morning a girl i can answer for as for myself in a hour 's time i

exclusive right of purchase the remainder of the chantebled estate in portion and at fix date seguin be promise that he would carefully study this proposal when he be cut short by a sudden tumult -- distant shout wild hurry to and fro and a violent banging of door why what be it what be it he mutter turn towards the shake wall the door suddenly open and valentine reappear distract red with fear and anger and carry she little andree who wail and struggle in she arm there there my pet gasp the mother do not cry she sha not hurt you any more there it be nothing darling be quiet do then she deposit the little girl in a large armchair where she at once become quiet again she be a very pretty child but still so puny although nearly four month old that there seem to be nothing but she beautiful big eye in she pale little face well what be the matter ask seguin in astonishment the matter be my friend that i have just find marie lie across the cradle as drunk as a market porter and half stifle the child if i have be a few moment later it would have be all over drunk at ten o'clock in the morning can one understand such a thing i have notice that she drink and so i hide the liqueur for i hope to be able to keep she since she milk be so good but do you know what she have drunk why the methylate spirit for the warmer the empty bottle have remain beside she but what do she

room where she be now smash the furniture there just listen indeed a distant uproar of destruction reach they they look one at the other and deep silence fall full of embarrassment and alarm and then seguin end by ask in he curt dry voice well what can i say that woman be a brute beast and i can not leave andree in she charge to be kill by she i have bring the child here and i certainly shall not take she back i will even own that i will not run the risk of go back to the room you will have to turn the girl out of door after pay she wages i i cry seguin then walk up and down as if spur on the anger which be rise within he he burst forth : i have have enough you know of all these idiotic story this house have become a perfect hell upon earth all through that child there will soon be nothing but fight here from morning till night first of all it be pretend that the nurse whom i take the trouble to choose be not healthy well then a second nurse be engage and she get drunk and stifle the child and now i suppose we be to have a third some other vile creature who will prey on we and drive we mad no no it be too exasperating i will not have it valentine she fear now calm become aggressive what will not you have there be no sense in what you say as we have a child we must have a nurse if i have speak of nurse the little one myself you would have tell I i be a fool you would have find the house more uninhabitable than ever if you have see I with the child always in my arm but i will not nurse -- i can not as you say we will take a third nurse it be simple enough and we 'll do so at once and risk it seguin have abruptly halt in front of andree who alarm by the sight of he stern dark figure begin to cry blind as he be by anger he perhaps fail to see she even as he fail to see gaston and lucie who have hasten in at the noise of the dispute and stand near the door full of curiosity and fear as nobody thought of send they away they remain there and see and hear everything the carriage be wait resume seguin in a voice which he strive to render calm let we make haste let we go valentine look at he in stupefaction come be reasonable say she how can i leave this child when i have nobody to whom i can trust she the carriage be wait for we he repeat quiver let we go at once and as he wife this time contented herself with shrug she shoulder he be seize with one of those sudden fit of madness which impel he to the greatest violence even when people be present and make he openly display he rankle poisonous sore that absurd jealousy which have upset he life as for that poor little puny wail child he would have crush she for he hold she to be guilty of everything and indeed it be she who be now the obstacle to that excursion he have plan that pleasure trip which he have promise himself and which now seem to he of such supreme importance and 'twa so much the better if friend be there to hear he so in the vilest language he begin to upbraid he wife not only reproach she for the birth of that child but even deny that the child be he you will only be content when you have drive I from the house he finish in a fury you will not come well then i 'll go by myself and thereupon he rush off like a whirlwind without a word to santerre who have remain silent and without even remember that mathieu still stand there await a answer the latter in consternation at hear all these thing have not dare to withdraw lest by do so he should seem to be pass judgment on the scene standing there motionless he turn he head aside look at little andree who be still cry and at gaston and lucie who silent with fright press one against the other behind the armchair in which they sister be wail valentine have sink upon a chair stifle with sob she limb tremble the wretch ah how he treat I to accuse I thus when he know how false it be ah never more no never more i would rather kill myself yes kill myself then santerre who have hitherto stand on one side gently draw near to she and venture to take she hand with a gesture of affectionate compassion while say in a undertone : come calm yourself you know very well that you be not alone that you be not forsake there be some thing which can not touch you calm yourself cease weep i beg you you distress I dreadfully he make himself the more gentle since the husband have be the more brutal and he lean over she yet the more closely and again lower he voice till it become but a murmur only a few word could be hear : it be wrong of you to worry yourself like this forget all that folly i tell you before that he do not know how to behave towards a woman twice be that last remark repeat with a sort of mock pity and she smile vaguely amid she dry tear in she turn murmur : you be kind you be thank you and you be quite right ah if i could only be a little happy then mathieu distinctly see she press santerre 's hand as if in acceptance of he consolation it be the logical fatal outcome of the situation -- give a wife whom she husband have pervert a mother who refuse to nurse she babe and yet a cry from andree suddenly set valentine erect awake to the reality of she position if that poor creature be so puny die for lack of she mother 's milk the mother also be in danger from she refusal to nurse she and clasp she to she breast like a buckler of invincible defense life and salvation one through the other or disaster for both such be the law and doubtless valentine become clearly conscious of she peril for she hasten to take up the child and cover she with caress as if to make of she a protect rampart against the supreme madness to which she have feel prompt and great be the distress that come over she she other child be there look and listen and mathieu also be still wait when she perceive he she tear gush forth again and she strive to explain thing and even attempt to defend she husband excuse he there be moment when he quite lose he head _ mon dieu _ what will become of I with this child yet i can not nurse she now it be too late it be frightful to be in such a position without know what to do ah what will become of I good lord santerre again attempt to console she but she no longer listen to he and he be about to defer all further effort till another time when unexpected intervention help on he design celeste who have enter noiselessly stand there wait for she mistress to allow she to speak it be my friend who have come to see I madame say she you know the person from my village sophie couteau and as she happen to have a nurse with she -- there be a nurse here oh yes madame a very fine one a excellent one then on perceive she mistress 's radiant surprise she joy at this relief she show herself zealous : madame must not tire herself by hold the little one madame have not the habit if madame will allow I i will bring the nurse to she heaving a sigh of happy deliverance valentine have allow the servant to take the child from she so heaven have not abandon she however she begin to discuss the matter and be not incline to have the nurse bring there she somehow fear that if the other one who be drunk in she room should come out and meet the new arrival she would set about beat they all and break everything at last she insist on take santerre and mathieu into the linen-room say that the latter must certainly have some knowledge of these matter although he declare the contrary only gaston and lucie be formally forbid to follow you be not want say they mother so stay here and play but we other will all go and as softly as possible please so that that drunken creature may not suspect anything once in the linen-room valentine order all the door to be carefully secure la couteau be stand there with a sturdy young person of five-and-twenty who carry a superb-looking infant in she arm she have dark hair a low forehead and a broad face and be very respectably dress and she make a little courtesy like a well-trained nurse who have already serve with gentlefolk and know how to behave but valentine 's embarrassment remain extreme she look at the nurse and at the babe like a ignorant woman who though she elder child have be bring up in a room adjoining she own have never trouble or concern herself about anything in she despair see that santerre keep to himself she again appeal to mathieu who once more excuse himself and it be only then that la couteau after glance askance at the gentleman who somehow or other always turn up whenever she have business to transact venture to intervene : will madame rely on I if madame will kindly remember i once before venture to offer she my service and if she have accept they she would have save herself no end of worry that marie lebleu be impossible and i certainly could have warn madame of it at the time when i come to fetch marie 's child but since madame 's doctor have choose she it be not for I to speak oh she have good milk that be quite sure only she also have a good tongue which be always dry so if madame will now place confidence in I -- then she rattle on interminably expatiate on the respectability of she calling and praise the value of the goods she offer well madame i tell you that you can take la catiche with you eye shut she be exactly what you want there be no better in paris just look how she be build how sturdy and how healthy she be and she child just look at it she be married she even have a little girl of four at the village with she husband she be a respectable woman which be more than can be say for a good many nurse in a word madame i know she and can answer for she if you be not please with she i myself will give you you money back in she haste to get it all over valentine make a great gesture of surrender she even consent to pay one hundred franc a month since la catiche be a married woman moreover la couteau explain that she would not have to pay the office charge which would mean a saving of forty-five franc though perhaps madame would not forget all the trouble which she la couteau have take on the other hand there would of course be the expense of take la catiche 's child back to the village a matter of thirty franc valentine liberally promise to double that sum and all seem to be settle and she feel deliver when she suddenly bethought herself of the other nurse who have barricade herself in she room how could they get she out in order to install la catiche in she place what exclaim la couteau do marie lebleu frighten you she have better not give I any of she nonsense if she want I ever to find she another situation i 'll speak to she never fear celeste thereupon place andree on a blanket which be lie there side by side with the infant of which the new nurse have rid herself a moment previously and undertake to conduct la couteau to marie lebleu 's room deathlike silence now reign there but the nurse-agent only have to give she name to secure admittance she go in and for a few moment one only hear she dry curt voice then on come out she tranquillize valentine who have go to listen tremble i have sober she i can tell you say she pay she she month 's wages she be pack she box and go off then as they go back into the linen-room valentine settle pecuniary matter and add five franc for this new service but a final difficulty arise la couteau could not come back to fetch la catiche 's child in the evening and what be she to do with it during the rest of the day well no matter she say at last i 'll take it i 'll deposit it at the office before i go my round they 'll give it a bottle there and it 'll have to grow accustomed to the bottle now will not it of course the mother quietly reply then as la couteau on the point of leave after all sort of bow and thanks turn round to take the little one she make a gesture of hesitation on see the two child lie side by side on the blanket the devil she murmur i must not make a mistake this seem amusing and enliven the other celeste fairly explode and even la catiche grin broadly while la couteau catch up the child with she long claw-like hand and carry it away yet another go to be cart away yonder in one of those ever-recurring _ razzia _ which consign the little babe to massacre mathieu alone have not laugh he have suddenly recall he conversation with boutan respect the demoralizing effect of that nurse trade the shameful bargaining the common crime of two mother who each risk the death of she child -- the idle mother who buy another 's service the venal mother who sell she milk he feel cold at heart as he see one child carry off still full of life and the other remain there already so puny and what would be fate 's course would not one or the other perhaps both of they be sacrifice valentine however be already lead both he and santerre to the spacious salon again and she be so delighted so fully relieve that she have recover all she cavalier carelessness she passion for noise and pleasure and as mathieu be about to take he leave he hear the triumphant santerre say to she while for a moment he retain she hand in he clasp : till to-morrow then and she who have cast she buckler of defense aside make answer : yes -- yes to-morrow a week later la catiche be the acknowledged queen of the house andree have recover a little color and be increase in weight daily and in presence of this result the other bow low indeed there be every disposition to overlook all possible fault on the nurse 's part she be the third and a fourth would mean the child 's death so that she be a indispensable a providential helper one whose service must be retain at all cost moreover she seem to have no defect for she be a calm cunning peasant woman one who know how to rule she employer and extract from they all that be to be extract she conquest of the seguin be effect with extraordinary skill at first some unpleasantness seem likely because celeste be on she own side pursue a similar course but they be both too intelligent to do otherwise than come to a understanding as they department be distinct they agree that they could prosecute parallel invasion and from that moment they even help one another divide the empire and prey upon the house in company la catiche sit upon a throne serve by the other domestic with she employer at she foot the finest dish be for she she have she special wine she special bread she have everything most delicate and most nourishing that could be find gluttonous slothful and proud she strut about bend one and all to she fancy the other give way to she in everything to avoid send she into a temper which might have spoil she milk at she slightest indisposition everybody be distract one night she have a attack of indigestion and all the doctor in the neighborhood be ring up to attend on she she only real defect perhaps be a slight inclination for pilfer she appropriate some linen that be lie about but madame would not hear of the matter be mention there be also the chapter of the present which be heap on she in order to keep she in good temper apart from the regulation present when the child cut its first tooth advantage be take of various other occasion and a ring a brooch and a pair of earring be give she naturally she be the most adorn nurse in the champs-elysee with superb cloak and the richest of cap trim with long ribbon which flare in the sunlight never do lady lead a life of more sumptuous idleness there be also the present which she extract for she husband and she little girl at the village parcel be send they by express train every week and on the morning when news come that she own baby carry back by la couteau have die from the effect of a bad cold she be present with fifty franc as if in payment for the loss of she child little andree meanwhile grow ever stronger and thus la catiche rise higher and higher with the whole house bend low beneath she tyrannical sway on the day when mathieu call to sign the deed which be to insure he the possession of the little pavilion of chanteble with some fifty acre around it and the privilege of acquire other part of the estate on certain condition he find seguin on the point of start for le havre where a friend a wealthy englishman be wait for he with he yacht in order that they might have a month 's trip round the coast of spain yes say seguin feverishly allude to

ribbon streaming victoriously in the sunshine xi on the day when the first blow with the pick be deal marianne with gervai in she arm come and sit down close by full of happy emotion at this work of faith and hope which mathieu be so boldly undertake it be a clear warm day in the middle of June with a pure broad sky that encourage confidence and as the child have be give a holiday they play about

of he long thought of ripening scheme with great prudence and wisdom he have assure himself a modest livelihood for a year of effort by a intelligent scheme of association and advance repayable out of profit which would enable he to wait for he first harvest and it be he life that he risk on that future crop should the earth refuse he worship and he labor but he be a faithful believer one who feel certain of conquer since love and determination be he well then here go he gallantly cry may the earth prove a good mother to we then he deal the first blow with he pick the work be begin to the left of the old pavilion in a corner of that extensive marshy tableland where little stream course on all side through the reed which spring up everywhere it be at first simply a question of drain a few acre by capture these stream and turn they into canal in order to direct they afterwards over the dry sandy slope which descend towards the railway line after a attentive examination mathieu have discover that the work might easily be execute and that water-furrow would suffice such be the disposition and nature of the ground this indeed be he real discovery not to mention the layer of humus which he feel certain would be find amass on the plateau and the wondrous fertility which it would display as soon as a ploughshare have pass through it and so with he pick he now begin to open the trench which be to drain the damp soil above and fertilize the dry sterile thirsty ground below the open air however have doubtless give gervai a appetite for he begin to cry he be now a strong little fellow three month and a half old and never neglect mealtime he be grow like one of the young tree in the neighbor wood with hand which do not easily release what they grasp with eye too full of light now all laughter and now all tear and with the ever open beak of a greedy bird that raise a tempest whenever he mother keep he wait yes yes i know you be there say she come do not deafen we any longer then she give he the breast and he become quiet simply purr like a happy little kitten the beneficent source have begin to flow once more as if it be inexhaustible the trickle milk murmur unceasingly one might have say that it could be hear descend and spread while mathieu on he side continue open he trench assist by the two man whose apprenticeship be long since past he rise up at last wipe he brow and with he air of quiet certainty exclaim : it be only a trade to learn in a few month ' time i shall be nothing but a peasant look at that stagnant pond there green with water-plant the spring which feed it be yonder in that big tuft of herbage and when this trench have be open to the edge of the slope you will see the pond dry up and the spring gush forth and take its course carry the beneficent water away ah say marianne may it fertilize all that stony expanse for nothing can be sadder than dead land how happy it will be to quench its thirst and live again then she break off to scold gervai : come young gentleman do not pull so hard say she wait till it come you know very well that it be all for you meantime the blow of the pickax ring out the trench rapidly make its way through the fat moist soil and soon the water would flow into the parched vein of the neighbor sandy tract to endow they with fruitfulness and the light trickle of the mother 's milk also continue with the faint murmur of a inexhaustible source flow from she breast into the mouth of she babe like a fountain of eternal life it ever and ever flow it create flesh intelligence and labor and strength and soon its whispering would mingle with the babble of the deliver spring as it descend along the trench to the dry hot land and at last there would be but one and the same stream one and the same river gradually overflow and carry life to all the earth a mighty river of nourishing milk flow through the world 's vein create without a pause and produce yet more youth and more health at each return of springtide four month later when mathieu and he man have finish the autumn plough there come the sowing on the same spot marianne be there again and it be such a very mild gray day that she be still able to sit down and once more gayly give the breast to little gervai he be already eight month old and have become quite a personage he grow a little more every day always in he mother 's arm on that warm breast whence he suck life he be like the seed which cling to the seed-pod so long as it be not ripe and at that first quiver of November that approach of winter through which the germ would slumber in the furrow he press he chilly little face close to he mother 's warm bosom and nurse on in silence as if the river of life be lose bury deep beneath the soil ah say marianne laughing you be not warm young gentleman be you it be time for you to take up you winter quarter just then mathieu with he sower 's bag at he waist be return towards they scatter the seed with broad rhythmical gesture he have hear he wife and he pause to say to she : let he nurse and sleep till the sun come back he will be a man by harvest time and point to the great field which he be sowing with he assistant he add : all this will grow and ripen when we gervai have begin to walk and talk -- just look see we conquest he be proud of it from ten to fifteen acre of the plateau be now rid of the stagnant pool clear and level and they spread out in a brown expanse rich with humus while the water-furrow which intersect they carry the stream to the neighbor slope before cultivate those dry land one must yet wait until the moisture should have penetrate and fertilize they that would be the work of the future and thus by degree life would be diffuse through the whole estate evening be come on resume mathieu i must make haste then he set off again throw the seed with he broad rhythmical gesture and while marianne gravely smile watch he go it occur to little rise to follow in he track and take up handful of earth which she scatter to the wind the three boy perceive she and blaise and deni then hasten up follow by ambroise all gleefully imitate they father 's gesture and dart hither and thither around he and for a moment it be almost as if mathieu with the sweep of he arm not only cast the seed of expected corn into the furrow but also sow those dear child cast they here and there without cessation so that a whole nation of little sower should spring up and finish populate the world two month more go by and January have arrive with a hard frost when one day the froment unexpectedly receive a visit from seguin and beauchene who have come to try they luck at wild-duck shooting among such of the pond on the plateau as have not yet be drain it be a Sunday and the whole family be gather in the roomy kitchen cheer by a big fire through the clear window one could see the far-spreading countryside white with rime and stiffly slumber under that crystal case like some venerated saint await April 's resurrection and that day when the visitor present themselves gervai also be slumber in he white cradle render somnolent by the season but plump even as lark be in the cold weather and wait he also simply for life 's revival in order to reappear in all the triumph of he acquire strength the family have gayly partake of dejeuner and now before nightfall the four

they live there very simply like genuine peasant without any luxury any amusement save that of be together they gay bright kitchen be redolent of that easy primitive life live so near the earth which free one from fictitious want ambition and the longing for pleasure and no fortune no power could have bring such quiet delight as that afternoon of happy intimacy while the last-born sleep so soundly and quietly that one could not even hear he breathe beauchene and seguin break in upon the quiet like unlucky sportsman with they limb weary and they face and hand icy cold amid the exclamation of surprise which greet they they complain of the folly that have possess they to venture out of pari in such bleak weather just fancy my dear fellow say beauchene we have not see a single duck it be no doubt too cold and you can not imagine what a bitter wind blow on the plateau amid those pond and bush bristle with icicle so we give up the idea of any shooting you must give we each a glass of hot wine and then we 'll get back to paris seguin who be in even a worse humor stand before the fire try to thaw himself and while marianne make haste to warm some wine he begin to speak of the clear field which he have skirt under the icy cover however beneath which they stiffly slumber hide the seed within they he have guess nothing of the truth and already feel anxious about this business of mathieu 's which look anything but encouraging indeed he already fear that he would not be pay he purchase money and so make bold to speak ironically i say my dear fellow i be afraid you have lose you time he begin i notice it all as i go by and it do not seem promising but how can you hope to reap anything from rotten soil in which only reed have be grow for century one must wait mathieu quietly answer you must come back and see it all next June but beauchene interrupt they there be a train at four o'clock i think say he let we make haste for it would annoy we tremendously to miss it would it not seguin so say he give he a gay meaning glance they have doubtless plan some little spree together like husband bent on avail themselves to the utmost of the convenient pretext of a day 's shooting then have drunk some wine and feeling warm and livelier they begin to express astonishment at they surroundings it stupefy I my dear fellow declare beauchene that you can live in this awful solitude in the depth of winter it be enough to kill anybody i be all in favor of work you know but dash it one must have some amusement too but we do amuse ourselves say mathieu wave he hand round that rustic kitchen in which centre all they pleasant family life the two visitor follow he gesture and gaze in amazement at the wall cover with utensil at the rough furniture and at the table on which the child be still build they village after offer they cheek to be kiss no doubt they be unable to understand what pleasure there could possibly be there for suppress a jeer laugh they shake they head to they it be really a extraordinary life a life of most singular taste come and see my little gervai say marianne softly he be asleep mind you must not wake he for politeness ' sake they both bent over the cradle and express surprise at find a child but ten month old so big he be very good too only as soon as he should wake he would no doubt deafen everybody and then too if a fine child like that suffice to make life happy how many people must be guilty of spoil they life the visitor come back to the fireside anxious only to be go now that they feel enliven so it be understand say mathieu you will not stay to dinner with we oh no indeed they exclaim in one breath then to attenuate the discourtesy of such a cry beauchene begin to jest and accept the invitation for a later date when the warm weather should have arrive on my word of honor we have business in paris he declare but i promise you that when it be fine we will all come and spend a day here -- yes with we wife and child and you will then show we you work and we shall see if you have succeed so good-by all my good wish my dear fellow au revoir cousin au revoir child be good then come more kiss and hand-shake and the two man disappear and when the gentle silence have fall once more mathieu and marianne again find themselves in front of the bright fire while the child complete the building of they village with a great consumption of paste and gervai continue sleep soundly have they be dream mathieu wonder what sudden blast from all the shame and suffering of pari have blow into they far-away quiet outside the country retain its icy rigidity the fire alone sing the song of hope in life 's future revival and all at once after a few minute ' reverie the young man begin to speak aloud as if he have at last just find the answer to all sort of grave question which he have long since put to himself but those folk do not love they be incapable of loving money power ambition pleasure -- yes all those thing may be theirs but not love even the husband who deceive they wife do not really love they mistress they have never glow with the supreme desire the divine desire which be the world 's very soul the brazier of eternal life and that explain everything without desire there be no love no courage and no hope by love alone can one create and if love be restrict in its mission there be but failure yes they lie and deceive because they do not love then they suffer and lapse into moral and physical degradation and at the end lie the collapse of we rotten society which break up more and more each day before we eye that then be the truth i be seek it be desire and love that save whoever love and create be the revolutionary savior the maker of man for the new world which will shortly dawn never before have mathieu so plainly understand that he and he wife be different from other this now strike he with extraordinary force comparison ensue and he realize that they simple life free from the lust of wealth they contempt for luxury and worldly vanity all they common participation in toil which make they accept and glorify life and its duty all that mode of existence of theirs which be at once they joy and they strength spring solely from the source of eternal energy : the love with which they glow if later on victory should remain with they if they should some day leave behind they work of value and health and happiness it would be solely because they have possess the power of love and the courage to love freely harvest in a ever-increasing family both the means of support and the means of conquest and this sudden conviction fill mathieu with such a glow that he lean towards he wife who sit there deeply move by what he say and kiss she ardently upon the lip it be divine love pass like a flaming blast but she though she own eye be sparkling laughingly scold he say : hush hush you will wake gervai then they remain there hand in hand press each other 's finger amid the silence evening be come on and at last the child they village finish raise cry of rapture at see it stand there among bit of wood which figure tree and then the soften glance of the parent stray now through the window towards the crop sleep beneath the crystalline rime and now towards they last-born 's cradle where hope be likewise slumber again do two long month go by gervai have just complete he first year and fine weather setting in early be hasten the awaking of the earth one morning when marianne and the child go to join mathieu on the plateau they raise shout of wonder so completely have the sun transform the expanse in a single week it be now all green velvet a thick endless carpet of sprout corn of tender delicate emerald hue never have such a marvellous crop be see and thus as the family walk on through the mild radiant April morning amid the country now rouse from winter 's sleep and quiver with fresh youth they all wax merry at the sight of that healthfulness that progress fruitfulness which promise the fulfilment of all they hope and they rapture yet increase when all at once they notice that little gervai also be awake to life acquire decisive strength as he struggle in he little carriage and he mother remove he from it behold he take he flight and stagger make four step then hang to he father 's leg with he little fist a cry of extraordinary delight burst forth why he walk he walk ah those first lisping of life those successive flight of the dear little one the first glance the first smile the first step -- what joy do they not bring to parent ' heart they be the rapturous _ etape _ of infancy for which father and mother watch which they await impatiently which they hail with exclamation of victory as if each be a conquest a fresh triumphal entry into life the child grow the child become a man and there be yet the first tooth force its way like a needle-point through rosy gum and there be also the first stammer word the pa-pa the mam-ma which one be quite ready to detect amid the vaguest babble though it be but the purring of a kitten the chirping of a bird life do its work and the father and the mother be ever wonderstruck with admiration and emotion at the sight of that efflorescence alike of they flesh and they soul wait a moment say marianne he will come back to I gervais gervais and after a little hesitation a false start the child do indeed return take the four step afresh with arm extend and beat the air as if they be balancing-poles gervai gervai call mathieu in he turn and the child go back to he and again and again do they want he to repeat the journey amid they mirthful cry so pretty and so funny do they find he then see that the four other child begin play rather roughly with he in they enthusiasm marianne carry he away and once more on the same spot on the young grass do she give he the breast and again do the stream of milk trickle forth close by that spot skirt the new field there pass a crossroad in rather bad condition lead to a neighbor village and on this road a cart suddenly come into sight jolting amid the rut and drive by a peasant -- who be so absorb in he contemplation of the land which mathieu have clear that he would have let he horse climb upon a heap of stone have not a woman who accompany he abruptly pull the rein the horse then stop and the man in a jeer voice call out : so this then be you work monsieur froment mathieu and marianne thereupon recognize the lepailleur the people of the mill they be well aware that folk laugh at janville over the folly of they attempt -- that mad idea of grow wheat among the marsh of the plateau lepailleur in particular distinguished himself by the violent raillery he level at this parisian a gentleman bear with a good berth who be so stupid as to make himself a peasant and fling what money he have to that rascally earth which would assuredly swallow he and he child and he money all together without yield even enough wheat to keep they in bread and thus the sight of the field have stupefy he it be a long while since he have pass that way and he have never think that the seed would sprout so thickly for he have repeat a hundred time that nothing would germinate so rotten be all the land although he almost choke with covert anger at see he prediction thus falsify he be unwilling to admit he error and put on a air of ironical doubt so you think it will grow eh well one can not say that it have not come up only one must see if it can stand and ripen and as mathieu quietly smile with hope and confidence he add strive to poison he joy : ah when you know the earth you 'll find what a hussy she be i have see plenty of crop come on magnificently and then a storm a gust of wind a mere trifle have reduce they to nothing but you be young at the trade as yet you 'll get you experience in misfortune he wife who nod approval on hear he talk so finely then address herself to marianne : oh my man do not say that to discourage you madame but the land you know be just like child there be some who live and some who die some who give one pleasure and other who kill one with grief but all consider one always bestow more on they than one get back and in the end one find oneself dupe you 'll see you 'll see without reply marianne move by these malicious prediction gently raise she trustful eye to mathieu and he though for a moment irritated by all the ignorance envy and imbecile ambition which he feel be before he contented himself with jest that be it we 'll see when you son antoine become a prefect and i have twelve peasant daughter ready i 'll invite you to they wedding for it be you mill that ought to be rebuild you know and provide with a fine engine so as to grind all the corn of my property yonder leave and right everywhere the sweep of he arm embrace such a far expanse of ground that the miller who do not like to be deride almost lose he temper he lash he horse with he whip and the cart jolt on again through the rut wheat in the ear be not wheat in the mill say he au revoir and good luck to you all the same thanks au revoir then while the child still run about seek early primrose among the moss mathieu come and sit down beside marianne who he see be quiver he say nothing to she for he know that she possess sufficient strength and confidence to surmount unaided such fear for the future as threat might kindle in she womanly heart but he simply set himself there so near she that he touch she look and smile at she the while and she immediately become calm again and likewise smile while little gervai whom the word of the malicious could not as yet disturb nurse more eagerly than ever with a purr of rapturous satisfaction the milk be ever trickle bring flesh to little limb which grow stronger day by day spread through the earth fill the whole world nourish the life which increase hour by hour and be not this the answer which faith and hope return to all threat of death -- the certainty of life 's victory with fine child ever grow in the sunlight and fine crop ever rise from the soil at each return spring to-morrow yet once again on the glorious day of harvest the corn will have ripen the child will be man and it be thus indeed three month later when the beauchene and the seguin keep they promise come -- husband wife and child -- to spend a Sunday afternoon at chanteble the froment have even prevail on morange to be of the party with reine in they desire to draw he for a day at any rate from the dolorous prostration in which he live as soon as all these fine folk have alight from the train it be decide to go up to the plateau to see the famous field for everybody be curious about they so extravagant and inexplicable do the idea of mathieu 's return to the soil and transformation into a peasant seem to they he laugh gayly and at least he succeed in surprising they when he wave he hand towards the great expanse under the broad blue sky that sea of tall green stalk whose ear be already heavy and undulated at the faintest breeze that warm splendid afternoon the far-spreading field look like the very triumph of fruitfulness a growth of germ which the humus amass through century have nourish with prodigious sap thus produce this first formidable crop as if to glorify the eternal source of life which sleep in the earth 's flank the milk have stream and the corn now grow on all side with overflow energy create health and strength bespeak man 's labor and the kindliness the solidarity of the world it be like a beneficent nourishing ocean in which all hunger would be appease and in which to-morrow might arise amid that tide of wheat whose wave be ever carry good news to the horizon true neither constance nor valentine be greatly touch by the sight of the wave wheat for other ambition fill they mind : and morange though he stare with he vague dim eye do not even seem to see it but beauchene and seguin marvel for they remember they visit in the month of January when the frozen ground have be wrapt in sleep and mystery they have then guess nothing and now they be amaze at this miraculous awakening this conquer fertility which have change a part of the marshy tableland into a field of live wealth and seguin in particular do not cease praise and admire certain as he now feel that he would be pay and already hope that mathieu would soon take a further portion of the estate off he hand then as soon as they have walk to the old pavilion now transform into a little farm and have seat themselves in the garden pend dinner-time the conversation fall upon child marianne as it happen have wean gervai the day before and he be there among the lady still somewhat unsteady on he leg and yet boldly go from one to the other careless of he frequent fall on he back or he nose he be a gay-spirited child who seldom lose he temper doubtless because he health be so good he big clear eye be ever laugh he offer he little hand in a friendly way and be very white very pink and very sturdy -- quite a little man indeed though but fifteen and a half month old constance and valentine admire he while marianne jested and turn he away each time that he greedily put out he little hand towards she no no monsieur it be over now you will have nothing but soup in future weaning be such a terrible business then remark constance do he let you sleep last night oh yes he have good habit you know he never trouble I at night but this morning he be stupefy and begin to cry still you see he be fairly well behave already besides i never have

daughter -- little andree then too both reine and maurice be present and the latter now indeed seem to be all right upon he leg though he square face with its heavy jaw still remain somewhat pale he mother watch he run about and feel so happy and so vain at the realization of she dream that she become quite amiable even towards these poor relative the froment whose retirement into the country seem to she like a incomprehensible downfall which forever thrust they out of she social sphere ah well resume beauchene i have only one boy but he be a sturdy fellow i warrant it be not he mathieu these word have scarcely pass he lip when he must have regret they he eyelid quiver and a little chill come over he as he glance meet that of he former designer for in the latter 's clear eye he behold as it be a vision of that other son norine 's ill-fated child who have be cast into the unknown then there come a pause and amid the shrill cry of the boy and girl play at hide-and-seek a number of little shadow flit through the sunlight : they be the shadow of the poor doomed babe who scarce see the light before they be carry off from home and hospital to be abandon in corner and die of cold and perhaps even of starvation mathieu have be unable to answer a word and he emotion increase when he notice morange huddle up on a chair and gaze with blur tearful eye at little gervai who be laughingly toddle hither and thither have a vision come to he also have the phantom of he dead wife shrink from the duty of motherhood and murder in a hateful den rise before he in that sunlit garden amid all the turbulent mirth of happy playful child what a pretty girl you daughter reine be say mathieu in the hope of draw the accountant from he haunting remorse just look at she run about -- so girlish still as if she be not almost old enough to be marry morange slowly raise he head and look at he daughter and a smile return to he eye still moist with tear day by day he adoration increase as reine grow up he find she more and more like she mother and all he thought become centre in she he one yearning be that she might be very beautiful very happy very rich that would be a sign that he be forgive -- that would be the only joy for which he could yet hope and amid it all there be a vague feeling of jealousy at the thought that a husband would some day take she from he and that he would remain alone in utter solitude alone with the phantom of he dead wife marry he murmur oh not yet she be only fourteen at this the other express surprise : they would have take she to be quite eighteen so womanly be she precocious beauty already as a matter of fact resume she father feeling flatter she have already be ask in marriage you know that the baroness de lowicz be kind enough to take she out now and then well she tell I that a arch-millionnaire have fall in love with reine -- but he 'll have to wait i shall still be able to keep she to myself for another five or six year at least he no longer weep but give a little laugh of egotistical satisfaction without notice the chill occasion by the mention of seraphine 's name for even beauchene feel that he sister be hardly a fit companion for a young girl then marianne anxious at see the conversation drop begin question valentine while gervai at last slyly creep to she knee why do you not bring you little andree she inquire i should have be so pleased to kiss she and she would have be able to play with this little gentleman who you see do not leave I a moment 's peace but seguin do not give he wife time to reply ah no indeed he exclaim in that case i should not have come it be quite enough to have to drag the two other about that fearful child have not cease deafen we ever since she nurse go away valentine

she have for some time be ail and have finally be remove to the hospital mathieu have for a while employ she young sister cecile now seventeen as a servant in the house at chantebled but she be of poor health and have return to pari where curiously enough she also enter doctor gaude 's clinic and boutan wax indignant at the method which gaude employ the two sister the married woman and the girl have be discharge as cure and so far this might seem to be the case but time in boutan 's opinion would bring round some terrible revenge one curious point of the affair be that beauchene 's dissolute sister seraphine have hear of these so-called cure which the newspaper have widely extol have actually seek out the benard and the moineaud to interview euphrasie and cecile on the subject and in the result she likewise have place herself in gaude 's hand she certainly be of little account and whatever might become of she the world would be none the poorer by she death but boutan point out that during the fifteen year that gaude 's theory and practice have prevail in france no fewer than half a million woman have be treat accordingly and in the vast majority of case without any such treatment be really necessary moreover boutan speak feelingly of the after result of such treatment -- comparative health for a few brief year follow in some case by a total loss of muscular energy and in other by insanity of a most violent form so that the padded cell of the madhouse be fill year by year with the unhappy woman who have pass through the hand of gaude and he colleague from a social point of view also the effect be disastrous they run counter to all boutan 's own theory and blast all he hope of live to see france again hold a foremost place among the nation of the earth ah say he to mathieu if people be only like you and you good wife during those four year at chanteble the froment have be ever found create increase and multiply again and again prove victorious in the eternal battle which life wages against death thanks to that continual increase both of offspring and of fertile land which be like they very existence they joy and they strength desire pass like a gust of flame -- desire divine and fruitful since they possess the power of love kindliness and health and they energy do the rest -- that will of action that quiet bravery in the presence of the labor that be necessary the labor that have make and that regulate the earth but during the first two year they have to struggle incessantly there be two disastrous winter with snow and ice and march bring hail-storm and hurricane which leave the crop lie low even as lepailleur have threateningly predict with a laugh of impotent envy it seem as if the earth mean to prove a bad mother ungrateful to they for they toil indifferent to they loss during those two year they only extricate themselves from trouble thanks to the second fifty acre that they purchase from seguin to the west of the plateau a fresh expanse of rich soil which they reclaim amid the marsh and which in spite of frost and hail yield a prodigious first harvest as the estate gradually expand it also grow stronger better able to bear ill-luck but mathieu and marianne also have great family worry they five elder child give they much anxiety much fatigue as with the soil here again there be a daily battle endless care and endless fear little gervai be stricken with fever and narrowly escape death rise too one day fill they with the direst alarm for she fall from a tree in they presence but fortunately with no worse injury than a sprain and on the other hand they be happy in the three other blaise deni and ambroise who prove as healthy as young oak-tree and when marianne give birth to she sixth child on whom they bestow the gay name of claire mathieu celebrate the new pledge of they affection by further acquisition then during the two ensue year they battle and sadness and joy all result in victory once more marianne give birth and mathieu conquer new land there be ever much labor much life expend and much life realize and harvest this time it be a question of enlarge the estate on the side of the moorland the sandy gravelly slope where nothing have grow for century the capture source of the tableland direct towards those uncultivated tract gradually fertilize they cover they with increase vegetation there be partial failure at first and defeat even seem possible so great be the patient determination which the creative effort demand but here too the crop at last overflow while the intelligent felling of a part of the purchase wood result in a large profit and give mathieu a idea of cultivate some of the spacious clearing hitherto overgrow with bramble and while the estate spread the child grow it have be necessary to send the three elder one -- blaise deni and ambroise -- to a school in pari whither they gallantly repair each day by the first train return only in the evening but the three other little gervai and the girl rise and claire be still allow all freedom in the midst of nature marianne however give birth to a seventh child amid circumstance which cause mathieu keen anxiety for a moment indeed he fear that he might lose she but she healthful temperament triumph over all and the child -- a boy name gregoire -- soon drink life and strength from she breast as from the very source of existence when mathieu see he wife smile again with that dear little one in she arm he embrace she passionately and triumph once again over every sorrow and every pang yet another child yet more wealth and power yet a additional force bear into the world another field ready for to-morrow 's harvest and 'twa ever the great work the good work the work of fruitfulness spreading thanks to the earth and to woman both victorious over destruction offering fresh means of subsistence each time a fresh child be bear and loving willing battle toiling even amid suffer and ever tend to increase of life and increase of hope \* \* \* \* \* \* then two more year roll on and during those two year mathieu and marianne have yet another child a girl and again at the same time as the family increase the estate of chanteble be increase also -- on one side by five-and-seventy acre of woodland stretch over the plateau as far as the field of mareuil and on the other by five-and-seventy acre of sloping moorland extend to the village of monval alongside the railway line but the principal change be that as the old hunting-box the little dilapidated pavilion no longer offer sufficient accommodation a whole farmstead have to be erect -- stone building and barn and shed and stable and cowhouse -- for farm hand and crop and animal whose number increase at each enlargement of the estate it be the resistless conquest of life it be fruitfulness spreading in the sunlight it be labor ever incessantly pursue its work of creation amid obstacle and suffer ever make good all loss and at each succeed hour set more energy more health and more joy in the vein of the world but during those two year while chantebled grow while labor and worry and victory alternate mathieu suddenly find himself mix up in a terribly tragedy he be oblige to come to pari at time -- more often indeed than he care -- now through he business relation with seguin now to sell now to buy now to order one thing or another he often purchase implement and appliance at the beauchene work and have thus keep up intercourse with morange who once more seem a changed man time have largely heal the wound leave by he wife 's death particularly as she seem to live again in reine to whom he be more attach than ever reine be no longer a child she have become a woman still she father hope to keep she with he some year yet while work with all diligence saving and save every penny that he could spare in order to increase she dowry but the inevitable be on the march for the girl have become the constant companion of seraphine the latter however depraved she might be have certainly in the first instance entertain no idea of corrupt the child whom she patronize she have at first take she solely to such place of amusement as be fit for she year and understanding but little by little the descent have come reine too as she grow into a woman amid the hour of idleness when she be leave alone by she father -- who perforce have to spend he day at the beauchene work -- develop a ardent temperament and a thirst for every frivolous pleasure and by degree the once simply pet child become a participator in seraphine 's own reckless and dissolute life when the end come and reine find herself in dire trouble because of a high state functionary a married man a friend of seraphine 's -- both woman quite lose they head such a blow might kill morange everything must be hide from he but how thereupon seraphine devise a plan she obtain permission for reine to accompany she on a visit into the country but while the fond father imagine that he daughter be enjoy herself among society folk at a chateau in the loiret she be really hide in paris it be indeed a repetition of she mother 's tragic story with this difference -- that seraphine address herself to no vulgar madame rouche but to a assistant of she own surgeon gaude a certain sarraille who have a dingy den of a clinic in the passage tivolus it be a bright day in August and mathieu who have come to pari to make some purchase at the beauchene work be lunch alone with morange at the latter 's flat when seraphine arrive there breathless and in consternation reine she say have be take ill in the country and she have bring she back to pari to she own flat but it be not thither it be to sarraille 's den that she drive morange and mathieu and there the frightful scene which have be enact at la rouche 's at the time of valerie 's death be repeat reine too be dead -- dead like she mother and morange in a first outburst of fury threaten both seraphine and sarraille with the scaffold for half a hour there be no master he but all at once he break down to lose he daughter as he have lose he wife it be too appalling the blow be too great he have strength leave only to weep sarraille moreover defend himself he swear that he have know nothing of the truth that the decease have simply come to he for legitimate treatment and that both she and the baroness have deceive he then seraphine on she side take hold of morange 's hand protest she devotion she frightful grief she fear too lest the reputation of the poor dear girl should be drag through the mire if he -lrb- the father -rrb- do not keep the terrible secret she accept she share of responsibility and blame admit that she have be very culpable and speak of eternal remorse but might the terrible truth be bury in the dead girl 's grave might there be none but pure flower strew upon that grave might she who lay therein be regret by all who have know she as one snatch away in all innocence of youth and beauty and morange yield to he weakness of heart stifle the while with sob and scarce repeat that word murderer which have spring from he lip so impulsively a little while before he think too of the scandal a autopsy a court of law the newspaper recount the crime he daughter 's memory cover with mire and -- no no he could have none of that whatever seraphine might be she have speak rightly then he powerlessness to avenge he daughter complete he prostration it be as if he have be beat almost to the point of death every one of he limb be bruise he head seem empty he heart cold and scarce able to beat and he sink into a sort of second childhood clasp he hand and stammer plaintively terrify and beseech compassion like one whose suffering be too hard to bear and when mathieu seek to console he he mutter : oh it be all over they have both go one after the other and i alone be guilty the first time it be i who lie to reine tell she that she mother be travel and then she in she turn lie to I the other day with that story of a invitation to a chateau in the country ah if eight year ago i have only oppose my poor valerie 's madness my poor reine would still be alive to-day yes it be all my fault i alone kill they by my weakness i be they murderer shiver deathly cold he go on amid he sob : and wretched fool that i have be i have kill they through love they too much they be so beautiful and it be so excusable for they to be rich and gay and happy one after the other they take my heart from I and i live only in they and by they and for they when one have leave I the other become my all in all and for she my daughter i again indulge in the dream of ambition which have originate with she mother and yet i kill they both and my mad desire to rise and conquer fortune lead I to that twofold crime ah when i think that even this morning i still dare to esteem myself happy at have but that one child that daughter to cherish what foolish blasphemy against love and life she be dead now dead like she mother and i be alone with nobody to love and nobody to love I -- neither wife nor daughter neither desire nor will but alone -- ah all alone forever it be the cry of supreme abandonment that he raise while sink to the floor strengthless with a great void within he and all he could do be to press mathieu 's hand and stammer : leave I -- tell I nothing you alone be right i refuse the offer of life and life have now take everything from I mathieu in tear himself kiss he and linger yet a few moment longer in that tragic den feeling more move than he have ever feel before and when he go off he leave the unhappy morange in the charge of seraphine who now treat he like a little ailing child whose will-power be entirely go and at chanteble as time go on mathieu and marianne found create increase and multiply during the two year which elapse they again prove victorious in the eternal battle which life wages against death thanks to that continual increase both of offspring and of fertile land which be like they very existence they joy and they strength desire pass like a gust of flame -- desire divine and fruitful since they possess the power of love kindliness and health and they energy do the rest -- that will of action that quiet bravery in the presence of the labor that be necessary the labor that have make and that regulate the world they be however still in the hard try earlier stage of they work of conquest and they often weep with grief and anxiety many be they care too in transform the old pavilion into a farm the outlay be considerable and at time it seem as if the crop would never pay the building account moreover as the enterprise grow in magnitude and there come more and more cattle more and more horse a larger staff of both man and girl become necessary to say nothing of additional implement and appliance and the increase of supervision which leave the froment little rest mathieu control the agricultural part of the enterprise ever seek improve method for draw from the earth all the life that slumber within it and marianne watch over the farmyard the dairy the poultry and show herself a first-class accountant keep the book and receive and pay money and thus in spite of recur worry stroke of bad luck and inevitable mistake fortune smile on they athwart all worry and loss so brave and sensible do they prove in they incessant daily struggle apart too from the new building the estate be increase by five-and-seventy acre of woodland and five-and-seventy acre of sandy sloping soil mathieu 's battle with those sandy slope become yet keener more and more heroic as he field of action expand but he end by conquer by fertilize they yet more each season thanks to the fructify spring which he direct through they upon every side and in the same way he cut broad road through the new wood which he purchase on the plateau in order to increase the means of communication and carry into effect he idea of use the clearing as pasture for he cattle pend the time when he might largely devote himself to stock-raising in this wise then the battle go on and spread incessantly in all direction and the chance of decisive victory likewise increase compensation for possible loss on one side be find on another where the harvest prove prodigious and like the estate the child also grow blaise and deni the twin now already fourteen year of age reap prize after prize at school put they younger brother ambroise slightly to shame for he quick and ingenious mind be often busy with other matter than he lesson gervai the girl rise and claire as well as the last-born boy little gregoire be yet too young to be trust alone in pari and so they continue grow in the open air of the country without any great mishap befall they and at the end of those two year marianne give birth to she eighth child this time a girl name louise and when mathieu see she smile with the dear little babe in she arm he embrace she passionately and triumph once again over every sorrow and every pang yet another child yet more wealth and power yet a additional force bear into the world another field ready for to-morrow 's harvest and 'twa ever the great work the good work the work of fruitfulness spreading thanks to the earth and thanks to woman both victorious over destruction offering fresh means of subsistence each time a fresh child be bear and loving willing battle toiling even amid suffer and ever tend to increase of life and increase of hope \* \* \* \* \* \* then two more year roll on and during those two year mathieu and marianne have yet another child another daughter whom they call madeleine and once again the estate of chanteble be increase this time by all the marshland whose pond and whose spring remain to be drain and capture on the west of the plateau the whole of this part of the property be now acquire by the froment -- two hundred acre of land where hitherto only water plant have grow but which now be give over to cultivation and yield abundant crop and the new spring turn into canal on every side again carry beneficent life to the sandy slope and fertilize they it be life 's resistless conquest it be fruitfulness spreading in the sunlight it be labor ever incessantly pursue its work of creation amid obstacle and suffer make good all loss and at each succeed hour set more energy more health and more joy in the vein of the world this time it be seguin himself who ask mathieu to purchase a fresh part of the estate press he even to take all that be leave of it wood and moorland -- extend over some five hundred acre nowadays seguin be often in need of money and in order to do business he offer mathieu lower term and all sort of advantage but the other prudently decline the proposal keep steadfastly to he original intention which be that he would proceed with he work of creation step by step in accordance with he exact means and requirement moreover a certain difficulty arise with regard to the purchase of the remain moor for enclose by this land eastward near the railway line be a few acre belong to lepailleur the miller who have never do anything with they and so mathieu prefer to select what remain of the marshy plateau add however that he would enter into negotiation respect the moorland later on when the miller should have consent to sell he enclosure he know that ever since he property have be increase lepailleur have regard he with the greatest jealousy and hatred and he do not think it advisable to apply to he personally certain as he feel that he would fail in he endeavor seguin however pretend that if he take up the matter he would know how to bring the miller to reason and even secure the enclosure for next to nothing and indeed think that he might yet induce mathieu to purchase all the remain property he determine to see lepailleur and negotiate with he before even sign the deed which be to convey to mathieu the select marshland on the plateau but the outcome prove as mathieu have foresee lepailleur ask such a monstrous price for he few acre enclose within the estate that nothing could be do when he be approach on the subject by seguin he make little secret of the rage he feel at mathieu 's triumph he have tell the young man that he would never succeed in reap a ear of wheat from that uncultivated expanse give over to bramble for century past and yet now it be cover with abundant crop and this have increase the miller 's rancor against the soil he hate it yet more than ever for its harshness to he a peasant 's son and its kindliness towards that bourgeois who seem to have fall from heaven expressly to revolutionize the region thus in answer to seguin he declare with a sneer that since sorcerer have spring up who be able to make wheat sprout from stone he patch of ground be now worth its weight in gold several year previously no doubt he have offer seguin the enclosure for a trifle but time have change and he now crow loudly over the other 's folly in not entertain he previous offer on the other hand there seem little likelihood of he turn the enclosure to account himself for he be more disgusted than ever with the tilling of the soil he disposition have be further embittered by the birth of a daughter whom he would willingly have dispense with anxious as he be with respect to he son antonin now a lad of twelve who prove so sharp and quick at school that he be regard by the folk of janville as a little prodigy mathieu have mortally offend the father and mother by suggest that antonin should be send to a agricultural college -- a very sensible suggestion but one which exasperate they determine as they be to make he a gentleman as lepailleur would not part with he enclosure on any reasonable term seguin have to content himself for the time with sell mathieu the select marshland on the plateau a deed of conveyance have be prepare they exchange signature and then on seguin 's hand there still remain nearly two hundred and fifty acre of wood in the direction of lillebonne together with the moorland stretch to vieux-bourg in which lepailleur 's few acre be enclose it be on the occasion of the visit which he pay seguin in reference to these matter that mathieu become acquaint with the terrible break-up of the other 's home the very room of the house in the avenue d'antin particularly the once sumptuous cabinet speak of neglect and abandonment the desire to cut a figure in society and to carry the fad of the moment to extreme ever possess seguin and thus he have for a while renounce he pretended artistic taste for certain new form of sport -- the motor-car craze and so forth but he only real passion be horseflesh and to this he at last return a racing stable which he set up quickly help on he ruin woman and gaming have be responsible for the loss of part of he large fortune and now horse be devour the remainder it be say too that he gamble at the bourse in the hope of recoup himself for he loss on the turf and by way too of affect a air of power and influence for he allow it to be suppose that he obtain information direct from member of the government and as he loss increase and downfall threaten he all that remain of the _ bel esprit _ and moralist once so prone to discuss literature and social philosophy with santerre be a embittered impotent individual -- one who have proclaim himself a pessimist for fashion 's sake and be now catch in he own trap have so spoilt he existence that he be now but a artisan of corruption and death all be disaster in he home celeste the maid have long since be dismiss and the child be now in the charge of a certain german governess call nora who virtually rule the house she position with respect to seguin be evident to one and all but then what of seguin 's wife and santerre the worst be that this horrible life which seem to be accept on either side be know to the child or at all event to the elder daughter lucie yet scarcely in she teens there have be terrible scene with this child who evince a mystical disposition and be ever talk of become a nun when she grow up gaston she brother resemble he father he be brutal in he way narrow-minded supremely egotistical very different be the little girl andree whom la catiche have suckle she have become a pretty child -- so affectionate docile and gay that she scarcely complain even of she brother 's tease almost bully way what a pity think mathieu that so lovable a child should have to grow up amid such surroundings and then he thought turn to he own home -- to chanteble the debt contract at the outset of he enterprise have at last be pay and he alone be now the master there resolve to have no other partner than he wife and child it be for each of he child that he conquer a fresh expanse of land that estate would remain they home they source of nourishment the tie link they together even if they become disperse through the world in a variety of social position and thus how decisive be that growth of the property the acquisition of that last lot of marshland which allow the whole plateau to be cultivate there might now come yet another child for there would be food for he wheat would grow to provide he with daily bread and when the work be finish when the last spring be capture and the land have be drain and clear how prodigious be the scene at springtide -- with the whole expanse as far as eye could see one mass of greenery full of the promise of harvest therein be compensation for every tear every worry and anxiety of the earlier day of labor meantime mathieu amid he creative work receive marianne 's gay and courageous assistance and she be not merely a skilful helpmate take a share in the general management keep the account and watch over the home she remain both a loving and well-loved spouse and a mother who nurse rear and educate she little one in order to give they some of she own sense and heart as boutan remark it be not enough for a woman to have a child she should also possess healthy moral gift in order that she may bring it up in creditable fashion marianne for she part make it she pride to obtain everything from she child by dint of gentleness and grace she be listen to obey and worship by they because she be so beautiful so kind and so greatly beloved she task be scarcely easy since she have eight child already but in all thing she proceed in a very orderly fashion utilize the elder to watch over the younger one give each a little share of loving authority and extricate herself from every embarrassment by set truth and justice above one and all blaise and deni the twin who be now sixteen and ambroise who be nearly fourteen do in a measure escape she authority be largely in they father 's hand but around she she have the five other -- from rise who be eleven to louise who be two year old between they at interval of a couple of year come gervai claire and gregoire and each time that one fly away as it be feel he wing strong enough for flight there appear another to nestle beside she and it be again a daughter madeleine who come at the expiration of those two year and when mathieu see he wife erect and smile again with the dear little girl at she breast he embrace she passionately and triumph once again over every sorrow and every pang yet another child yet more wealth and power yet a additional force bear into the world another field ready for to-morrow 's harvest and 'twa ever the great work the good work the work of fruitfulness spreading thanks to the earth and thanks to woman both victorious over destruction offering fresh means of subsistence each time a fresh child be bear and loving willing battle toiling even amid suffer and ever tend to increase of life and increase of hope xiii two more year go by and during those two year mathieu and marianne have yet another daughter and this time as the family increase chanteble also be increase by all the woodland extend eastward of the plateau to the distant farm of mareuil and lillebonne all the northern part of the property be thus acquire : more than five hundred acre of wood intersect by clearing which road soon connect together and those clearing transform into pasture-land water by the neighbor spring enable mathieu to treble he live-stock and attempt cattle-raising on a large scale it be the resistless conquest of life it be fruitfulness spreading in the sunlight it be labor ever incessantly pursue its work of creation amid obstacle and suffer make good all loss and at each succeed hour set more energy more health and more joy in the vein of the world since the froment have become conqueror busily found a little kingdom and build up a substantial fortune in land the beauchene no longer deride they respect what they have once deem they extravagant idea in establish themselves in the country astonished and anticipate now the fullest success they treat they as well-to-do relative and occasionally visit they delighted with the aspect of that big bustling farm so full of life and prosperity it be in the course of these visit that constance renew she intercourse with she former schoolfellow madame angelin the froment ' neighbor a great change have come over the angelin they have end by purchase a little house at the end of the village where they invariably spend the summer but they buoyant happiness seem to have depart they have long desire to remain unburdened by child and now they eagerly long to have a child and none come though claire the wife be as yet but six-and-thirty she husband the once gay handsome musketeer be already turn gray and lose he eyesight -- to such a degree indeed that he could scarcely see well enough to continue he profession as a fan-painter when madame angelin go to pari she often call on constance to whom before long she confide all she worry she have be in a doctor 's hand for three year but all to no avail and now during the last six month she have be consult a person in the rue de miromesnil a certain madame bourdieu say she constance at first make light of she friend 's statement and in part decline to believe she but when she find herself alone she feel disquiet by what she have hear perhaps she would have treat the matter as mere idle tittle-tattle if she have not already regret that she herself have no second child on the day when the unhappy morange have lose he only daughter and have remain stricken down utterly alone in life she have experience a vague feeling of anguish since that supreme loss the wretched accountant have be live on in a state of imbecile stupefaction simply discharge he duty in a mechanical sort of way from force of habit scarcely speak but show great gentleness of manner he live as one who be strand fate to remain forever at beauchene 's work where he salary have now rise to eight thousand franc a year it be not know what he do with this amount which be considerable for a man who lead such a narrow regular life free from expense and fancy outside he home -- that flat which be much too big for he but which he have nevertheless obstinately retain shut himself up therein and lead a most misanthropic life in fierce solitude it be he grievous prostration which have at one moment quite upset and affected constance so that she have even sob with the desolate man -- she whose tear flow so seldom no doubt a thought that she might have have other child than maurice come back to she in certain bitter hour of unconscious self-examination when from the depths of she being in which feeling of motherliness awaken there rise vague fear sudden dread such as she have never know before yet maurice she son after a delicate youth which have necessitate great care be now a handsome fellow of nineteen still somewhat pale but vigorous in appearance he have complete he study in a fairly satisfactory manner and be already help he father in the management of the work and he adoring mother have never set higher hope upon he head she already picture he as the master of that great establishment whose prosperity he would yet increase thereby rise to royal wealth and power constance 's worship for that only son to-morrow 's hero increase the more since he father day by day decline in she estimation till she regard he in fact with naught but contempt and disgust it be a logical downfall which she could not stop and the successive phase of which she herself fatally precipitate at the outset she have overlook he infidelity then from a spirit of duty and to save he from irreparable folly she have seek to retain he near she and finally fail in she endeavor she have begin to feel loathing and disgust he be now two-and-forty he drink too much he eat too much he smoke too much he be grow corpulent and scant of breath with hang lip and heavy eyelid he no longer take care of he person as formerly but go about slipshod and indulge in the coarsest pleasantry but it be more particularly away from he home that he sink into degradation indulge in the low debauchery which have ever attract he every now and again he disappear from the house and sleep elsewhere then he concoct such ridiculous falsehood that he could not be believe or else do not take the trouble to lie at all constance who feel powerless to influence he end by allow he complete freedom the worst be that the dissolute life he lead grievously affect the business he who have be such a great and energetic worker have lose both mental and bodily vigor he could no longer plan remunerative stroke of business he no longer have the strength to undertake important contract he linger in bed in the morning and remain for three or four day without once go round the work let disorder and waste accumulate there so that he once triumphal stock-takings now year by year show a falling-off and what a end it be for that egotist that enjoyer so gayly and noisily active who have always profess that money -- capital increase tenfold by the labor of other -- be the only desirable source of power and whom excess of money and excess of enjoyment now cast with appropriate irony to slow ruin the final paralysis of the impotent but a supreme blow be to fall on constance and fill she with horror of she husband some anonymous letter the low treacherous revenge of a dismiss servant apprise she of beauchene 's former intrigue with norine that work-girl who have give birth to a boy spirit away none know whither though ten year have elapse since that occurrence constance could not think of it without a feeling of revolt whither have that child be send be he still alive what ignominious existence be he lead she be vaguely jealous of the boy the thought that she husband have two son and she but one be painful to she now that all she motherly nature be arouse but she devote herself yet more ardently to she fondly love maurice she make a demi-god of he and for he sake even sacrifice she just rancor she indeed come to the conclusion that he must not suffer from he father 's indignity and so it be for he that with extraordinary strength of will she ever preserve a proud demeanor feign that she be ignorant of everything never address a reproach to she husband but remain in the presence of other the same respectful wife as formerly and even when they be alone together she keep silence and avoid explanation and quarrel never even think of the possibility of revenge she seem in the presence of she husband 's profligacy to attach herself more firmly to she home cling to she son and protect by he from thought of evil as much as by she own sternness of heart and principle and thus sorely wound full of repugnance but hide she contempt she await the triumph of that son who would purify and save the house feel the greatest faith in he strength and quite surprised and anxious whenever all at once without reasonable cause a little quiver from the unknown bring she a chill affect she heart as with remorse for some long-past fault which she no longer remember that little quiver come back while she listen to all that madame angelin confide to she and at last she become quite interested in she friend 's case and offer to accompany she some day when she might be call on madame bourdieu in the end they arrange to meet one Thursday afternoon for the purpose of go together to the rue de miromesnil as it happen that same Thursday about two o'clock mathieu who have come to pari to see about a threshing-machine at beauchene 's work be quietly walk along the rue la boetie when he meet cecile moineaud who be

brutal surroundings there and rob of she earnings week by week she dream be to secure a home of she own to find a little money that would enable she to install herself in a room where she might live in peace and quietness it have occur to mathieu to give she a pleasant surprise some day by supply she with the small sum she need where be you run so fast he gayly ask she the meeting seem to take she aback and she answer in a evasive embarrassed way : i be go to the rue de miromesnil for a call i have to make notice he kindly air however she soon tell he the truth she sister that poor creature norine have just give birth to another child she third at madame bourdieu 's establishment a gentleman who have be protect she have cast she adrift and she have be oblige to sell she few stick of

you have begin to give he the breast be it my fault she angrily exclaim i do not want to give it to he you know what my idea be and i fly into a passion and almost fight madame bourdieu when she put he in my arm but then how could i hold out he cry so dreadfully with hunger poor little mite and seem to suffer so much that i be weak enough to let he nurse just a little i do not intend to repeat it but the next day he cry again and so i have to continue worse luck for I there be no pity show I i have be make a hundred time more unhappy than i should have be for of course i shall soon have to get rid of he as i get rid of the other tear appear in she eye it be the oft-recurring story of the girl-mother who be prevail upon to nurse she child for a few day in the hope that she will grow attach to the babe and be unable to part from it the chief object in view be to save the child because its best nurse be its natural nurse the mother and norine instinctively divine the trap set for she have struggle to escape it and repeat sensibly enough that one ought not to begin such a task when one mean to throw it up in a few day ' time as soon as she yield she be certain to be catch she egotism be bind to be vanquish by the wave of pity love and hope that would sweep through she heart the poor pale puny infant have weigh but little the first time he take the breast but every morning afterwards he have be weigh afresh and on the wall at the foot of the bed have be hang the diagram indicate the daily difference of weight at first norine have take little interest in the matter but as the line gradually ascend plainly indicate how much the child be profit she give it more and more attention all at once as the result of a indisposition the line have dip down and since then she have always feverishly await the weigh eager to see if the line would once more ascend then a continuous rise have set in she laugh with delight that little line which ever ascend tell she that she child be save and that all the weight and strength he acquire be derive from she -- from she milk she blood she flesh she be complete the appoint work and motherliness at last awaken within she be blossom in a florescence of love if you want to kill he continue mathieu you need only take he from you breast see how eagerly the poor little fellow be nurse this be indeed true and norine burst into big sob : _ mon dieu _ you be begin to torture I again do you think that i shall take any pleasure in get rid of he now you force I to say thing which make I weep at night when i think of they i shall feel as if my very vitals be be tear out when this child be take from I there be you both pleased that you have make I say it but what good do it do to put I in such a state since nobody can remedy thing and he must need go to the foundling while i return to the gutter to wait for the broom that be to sweep I away but cecile who likewise be weep kiss and kiss the child and again revert to she dream explain how happy they would be all three of they in a nice room which she picture full of endless joy like some paradise it be by no means difficult to cut out and paste up the little box as soon as norine should know the work she who be strong might perhaps earn three franc a day at it and five franc a day between they would not that mean fortune the rearing of the child and all evil thing forget at a end norine more weary than ever give way at last and cease refuse you daze I she say i do not know do as you like -- but certainly it will be great happiness to keep this dear little fellow with I cecile enraptured clap she hand while mathieu who be greatly move give utterance to these deeply significant word : you have save he and now he save you then norine at last smile she feel happy now a great weight have be lift from she heart and carry she child in she arm she insist on accompany she sister and they friend to the first floor during the last half-hour constance and madame angelin have be deep in consultation with madame bourdieu the former have not give she name but have simply play the part of a oblige friend accompany another on a occasion of some delicacy madame bourdieu with the keen scent characteristic of she profession divine a possible customer in that inquisitive lady who put such strange question to she however a rather painful scene take place for realize that she could not forever deceive madame angelin with false hope madame bourdieu decide to tell the truth -- she case be hopeless constance however at last make a sign to entreat she to continue deceive she friend if only for charity 's sake the other therefore while conduct she visitor to the landing speak a few hopeful word to madame angelin : after all dear madame say she one must never despair i do wrong to speak as i do just now i may yet be mistaken come back to see I again at this moment mathieu and cecile be still on the landing in conversation with norine whose infant have fall asleep in she arm constance and madame angelin be so surprised at find the farmer of chanteble in the company of the two young woman that they pretend they do not see he all at once however constance with the help of memory recognize norine the more readily perhaps as she be now aware that mathieu have ten year previously act as she husband 's intermediary and a feeling of revolt and the wildest fancy instantly arise within she what be mathieu do in that house whose child be it that the young woman carry in she arm at that moment the other child seem to peer forth from the past she see it in swaddle clothes like the infant there indeed she almost confound one with the other and imagine that it be indeed she husband 's illegitimate son that be sleep in he mother 's arm before she then all the satisfaction she have derive from what she have hear madame bourdieu say depart and she go off furious and ashamed as if soil and threaten by all the vague abomination which she have for some time feel around she without know however whence come the little chill which make she shudder as with dread as for mathieu he see that neither norine nor cecile have recognize madame beauchene under she veil and so he quietly continue explain to the former that he would take step to secure for she from the assistance publique -- the official organization for the relief of the poor -- a cradle and a supply of baby linen as well as immediate pecuniary succor since she undertake to keep and nurse she child afterwards he would obtain for she a allowance of thirty franc a month for at least one year this would greatly help the sister particularly in the earlier stage of they life together in the room which they have settle to rent when mathieu add that he would take upon himself the preliminary outlay of a little furniture and so forth norine insist upon kiss he oh it be with a good heart say she it do one good to meet a man like you and come kiss my poor little fellow too it will bring he good luck on reach the rue la boetie it occur to mathieu who be bind for the beauchene work to take a cab and let cecile alight near she parent ' home since it be in the neighborhood of the factory but she explain to he that she wish first of all to call upon she sister euphrasie in the rue caroline this street be in the same direction and so mathieu make she get into the cab tell she that he would set she down at she sister 's door she be so amaze so happy at see she dream at last on the point of realization that as she sit in the cab by the side of mathieu she do not know how to thank he she eye be quite moist all smile and tear you must not think I a bad daughter monsieur say she because i be so pleased to leave home papa still work as much as he be able though he do not get much reward for it at the factory and mamma do all she can at home though she have not much strength leave she nowadays since victor come back from the army he have marry and have child of he own and i be even afraid that he 'll have more than he can provide for as while he be in the army he seem to have lose all taste for work but the sharpest of the family be that lazy-bones irma my younger sister who be so pretty and so delicate-looking perhaps because she be always ill as you may remember mamma use to fear that irma might turn out badly like norine well not at all indeed she be the only one of we who be likely to do well for she be go to marry a clerk in the post-office and so the only one leave at home be myself and alfr oh he be a perfect bandit that be the plain truth he commit a theft the other day and one have no end of trouble to get he out of the hand of the police commissary but all the same mamma have a weakness for he and let he take all my earnings yes indeed i have have quite enough of he especially as he be always terrifying I out of my wit threaten to beat and even kill I though he well know that ever since my illness the slightest noise throw I into a faint and as all consider neither papa nor mamma need I it be quite excusable be not it that i should prefer live quietly alone it be my right be it not monsieur she go on to speak of she sister euphrasie who have fall into a most wretched condition say she ever since pass through dr gaude 's hand she home have virtually be break up she have become decrepit a mere bundle of rag unable even to handle a broom it make one tremble to see she then after a pause just as the cab be reach the rue caroline the girl continue : will you come up to see she you might say a few kind word to she it would please I for i be go on a rather unpleasant errand i think that she would have strength enough to make some little box like I and thus earn a few penny for herself but she have keep the work i give she more than a month now and if she really can not do it i must take it back mathieu consent and in the room upstairs he behold one of the most frightful poignant spectacles that he have ever witness in the center of that one room where the family sleep and eat euphrasie sit on a straw-bottomed chair and although she be barely thirty year of age one might have take she for a little old woman of fifty so thin and so withered do she look that she resemble one of those fruit suddenly deprive of sap that dry up on the tree she tooth have fall and of she hair she only retain a few white lock but the more characteristic mark of this mature senility be a wonderful loss of muscular strength a almost complete disappearance of will energy and power of action so that she now spend whole day idle stupefy without courage even to raise a finger when cecile tell she that she visitor be m froment the former chief designer at the beauchene work she do not even seem to recognize he she no longer take interest in anything and when she sister speak of the object of she visit ask for the work with which she have entrust she she answer with a gesture of utter weariness : oh what can you expect it take I too long to stick all those little bit of cardboard together i can not do it it throw I into a perspiration then a stout woman who be cut some bread and butter for the three child intervene with a air of quiet authority : you ought to take those material away mademoiselle cecile she be incapable of do anything with they they will end by get dirty and then you people will not take they back this stout woman be a certain madame joseph a widow of forty and a charwoman by call whom benard the husband have at first engage to come two hour every morning to attend to the housework he wife not have strength enough to put on a child 's shoe or to set a pot on the fire at first euphrasie have offer furious resistance to this intrusion of a stranger but she physical decline progress she have be oblige to yield and then thing have go from bad to worse till madame joseph become supreme in the household between time there have be terrible scene over it all but the wretched euphrasie stammer and shiver have at last resigned herself to the position like some little old woman sink into second childhood and already cut off from the world that benard and madame joseph be not bad-hearted in reality be show by the fact that although euphrasie be now but a useless encumbrance they keep she with they instead of fling she into the street as other would have do why there you be again in the middle of the room suddenly exclaim the fat woman who each time that she go hither and thither find it necessary to avoid the other 's chair how funny it be that you can never put yourself in a corner auguste will be come in for he four o'clock snack in a moment and he will not be at all pleased if he do not find he cheese and he glass of wine on the table without reply euphrasie nervously stagger to she foot and with the greatest trouble drag she chair towards the table then she sit down again limp and very weary just as madame joseph be bring the cheese benard whose workshop be near by make he appearance he be still a full-bodied jovial fellow and begin to jest with he sister-in-law while show great politeness towards mathieu whom he thank for take interest in he unhappy wife 's condition _ mon dieu _ monsieur say he it be not she fault it be all due to those rascally doctor at the hospital for a year or so one might have think she cure but you see what have now become of she ah it ought not to be allow you be no doubt aware that they treat cecile just the same and there be another too a baroness whom you must know she call here the other day to see euphrasie and upon my word i do not recognize she she use to be such a fine woman and now she look a hundred year old yes yes i say that the doctor ought to be send to prison he be about to sit down to table when he stumble against euphrasie 's chair she sit watch he with a anxious semi-stupefied expression there you be in my way as usual say he one be always tumble up against you come make a little room do he do not seem to be a very terrible customer but at the sound of he voice she begin to tremble full of childish fear as if she be threaten with a thrashing and this time she find strength enough to drag she chair as far as a dark closet the door of which be open she there seek refuge ensconce herself in the gloom amid which one could vaguely espy she shrunken wrinkled face which suggest that of some very old great-grandmother who be take year and year to die mathieu 's heart contract as he observe that senile terror that shiver obedience on the part of a woman whose harsh dry aggressively quarrelsome disposition he so well remembered industrious self-willed full of life as she have once be she be now but a limp human rag and yet she case be record in medical annals as one of the renowned gaude 's great miracle of cure ah how truly have boutan speak in say that people ought to wait to see the real result of those victorious operation which be sap the vitality of france cecile however with eager affection kiss the three child who somehow continue to grow up in that wreck household tear come to she eye and directly madame joseph have give she back the work-material entrust to euphrasie she hurry mathieu away and as they reach the street she say : thank you monsieur froment i can go home on foot now -- how frightful eh ah as i tell you we shall be in paradise norine and i in the quiet room which you have so kindly promise to rent for we on reach beauchene 's establishment mathieu immediately repair to the workshop but he could obtain no precise information respect he

of friendship it be understand the young fellow need only present himself at the work and in the first instance he should be put with morange in order that he might learn something of the business mechanism of the establishment thus talk beauchene puff and cough and spat exhale meantime the odor of tobacco alcohol and musk which he always bring back from he spree while he wife smile affectionately before the other as be she wont but direct at he glance full of despair and disgust whenever madame angelin turn she head as beauchene continue talk too much owning for instance that he do not know how far the thresher might be from completion mathieu notice constance listen anxiously the idea of blaise enter the establishment have already render she grave and now she husband 's apparent ignorance of important business matter distressed she besides the thought of norine be revive in she mind she remember the girl 's child and almost fear some fresh understanding between beauchene and mathieu all at once however she give a cry of great relief : ah here be maurice she son be enter the room -- she son the one and only god on whom she now set she affection and pride the

one he have grow up and one have know for year all the joy of have he at one 's side but when one never have a child -- never never -- ah come rather suffer and mourn than such a void as that and

sister have become passionately fond of draw and painting which she have learn at first simply by way of accomplishment she have end however by painting miniature very prettily and as she mother remark she proficiency might prove a resource to she in the event of misfortune certainly there be some of the bourgeois respect and esteem for a good education in the fairly cordial greet which constance extend to charlotte who have paint a miniature portrait of she a good though a flattering likeness on the other hand blaise who be endowed with the creative fire of the froment ever strive ever hard at work become a valuable assistant to maurice as soon as a brief stay in morange 's office have make he familiar with the business of the firm indeed it be maurice who find that he father

before she son could in this matter only obey respectfully she evince boundless faith in the vastness of maurice 's intellect he study have prove fairly satisfactory if he be somewhat slow and heavy and have frequently be delay by youthful illness he have nevertheless diligently plod on as he be far from talkative he mother give out that he be a reflective concentrated genius who would astonish the world by action not by speech before he be even fifteen she say of he in she adoring way : oh he have a great mind and naturally enough she only acknowledge blaise to be a necessary lieutenant a humble assistant one whose hand would execute the sapient young master 's order the latter to she thinking be now so strong and so handsome and he be so quickly revive the business compromise by the father 's slow collapse that surely he must be on the high-road to prodigious wealth to that final great triumph indeed of which she have be dream so proudly so egotistically for so many year but all at once the thunderbolt fall it be not without some hesitation that blaise have agree to make the little pavilion he home for he know that there be a idea of reduce he to the status of a mere piece of machinery but at the birth of he little girl he bravely decide to accept the proposal and to engage in the battle of life even as he father have engage in it mindful of the fact that he also might in time have a large family but it so happen that one morning when he go up to the house to ask maurice for some instruction he hear from constance herself that the young man have spend a very bad night and that she have therefore prevail on he to remain in bed she do not evince any great anxiety on the subject the indisposition could only be due to a little fatigue indeed for a week past the two

kindly moreover she be really grieve by the terrible catastrophe so she and she husband after distribute the day 's work among the servant set out for janville station which they reach just in time to catch the quarter-past ten o'clock train it be already roll on again when they recognize the lepailleur and they son antonin in the very compartment where they be seat see the froment thus together in full dress the miller imagine that they be go to a wedding and when he learn that they have a visit of condolence to make he exclaim : oh so it be just the contrary but no matter it be a outing a little diversion nevertheless since mathieu 's victory since the whole of the estate of chanteble have be conquer and fertilize lepailleur have show some respect for he bourgeois rival nevertheless although he could not deny the result hitherto obtain he do not altogether surrender but continue sneering as if he expect that some rending of heaven or earth would take place to prove he in the right he would not confess that he have make a mistake he repeat that he know the truth and that folk would some day see plainly enough that a peasant 's calling be the very worst call there could be since the dirty land have go bankrupt and would yield nothing more besides he hold he revenge -- that enclosure which he leave barren uncultivated by way of protest against the adjoining estate which it intersect the thought of this make he ironical well he resume in he ridiculously vain scoff way we be go to paris too yes we be go to install this young gentleman there he point as he speak to he son antonin now a tall carroty fellow of eighteen with a elongate head a few light-colored bristle be already sprout on he chin and cheek and he wear town attire with a silk hat and glove and a bright blue necktie after astonishing janville by he success at school he have display so much repugnance to manual work that he father have decide to make a parisian of he so it be decide you have quite make up you mind ask mathieu in a friendly way why yes why should i force he to toil and moil without the least hope of ever enrich himself neither my father nor i ever manage to put a copper by with that wretched old mill of ours why the mill-stone wear away with rot more than with grind corn and the wretched field too yield far more pebble than crown and so as he be now a scholar he may as well try he fortune in pari there be nothing like city life to sharpen a man 's wit madame lepailleur who never take she eye from she son but remain in admiration before he as formerly before she husband now exclaim with a air of rapture : yes yes he have a place as a clerk with maitre rousselet the attorney we have rent a little room for he i have see about the furniture and the linen and to-day 's the great day he will sleep there to-night after we have dine all three at a good restaurant ah yes i be very pleased he be make a start now and he will perhaps end by be a minister of state say

the parent nowadays celebrate they child 's departure and accompany the adventurer on he way anxious and proud to climb the social ladder with he and that which bring a smile to the lip of the farmer of chanteble the bourgeois who have become a peasant be the thought of the double change : the miller 's son go to paris whereas he have go to the earth the mother of all strength and regeneration antonin however have also begin to laugh with the air of a artful idler who be more particularly attract by the free dissipation of paris life oh minister say he i have not much taste for that i would much sooner win a million at once so as to rest afterwards delighted with this display of wit the lepailleur burst into noisy merriment oh they boy would do great thing that be quite certain marianne she heart oppress by thought of the mourning which await she have hitherto keep silent she now ask however why little therese do not form one of the party lepailleur dryly reply that he do not choose to embarrass himself with a child but six year old who do not know how to behave she arrival have upset everything in the house thing would have be much better if she have never be bear then as marianne begin to protest say that she have seldom see a more intelligent and prettier little girl madame lepailleur answer more gently : oh she be sharp that be true enough but one can not send girl to pari she 'll have to be put somewhere and it will mean a lot of trouble a lot of money however we must not talk about all that this morning since we want to enjoy ourselves at last the train reach

under the pretext of seek fresh air and constance remain at home feverish she eye red with weep one day mathieu who have come to grenelle to see he daughter-in-law charlotte be linger in the garden playing with little berthe who have climb upon he knee when he be surprise by the sudden approach of constance who must have see he from she window she invent a pretext to draw he into the house and

be reason why i should do so nearly fifteen year ago i know it for a fact my husband have a child by a girl who be employ at the work and i also know that you act as he intermediary on that occasion and make certain arrangement with respect to that girl and she child -- a boy be it not she pause for a reply but mathieu stupefy at find she so well inform and at a loss to understand why she speak to he of that sorry affair after the lapse of so many year could only make a gesture by which he betray both he surprise and he anxiety oh say she i do not address any reproach to you i be convince that you motive be quite friendly even affectionate and that you wish to hush up a scandal which might have be very unpleasant for I moreover i do not desire to indulge in recrimination after so long a time my desire be simply for information for a long time i do not care to investigate the statement whereby i be inform of the affair but the recollection of it come back to I and haunt I persistently and it be natural that i should apply to you i have never speak a word on the subject to my husband and indeed it be best for we tranquillity that i should not attempt to extort a detailed confession from he one circumstance which have induce I to speak to you be that on a occasion when i accompany madame angelin to a house in the rue de miromesnil i perceive you there with that girl who have another child in she arm so you have not lose sight of she and you must know what she be do and whether she first child be alive and in that case where he be and how he be situate mathieu still refrain from reply for constance 's increase feverishness put he on he guard and impel he to seek the motive of such a strange application on the part of one who be as a rule so proud and so discreet what could be happen why do she strive to provoke confidential revelation which might have far-reaching effect then as she closely scan he with she keen eye he seek to answer she with kind evasive word you greatly embarrass I and besides i know nothing likely to interest you what good would it do yourself or you husband to stir up all the dead past take my advice forget what people may have tell you -- you be so sensible and prudent -- but she interrupt he catch hold of he hand and hold they in she warm quiver grasp never before have she so behave forget and surrender herself so passionately i repeat say she that nobody have anything to fear from I -- neither my husband nor that girl nor the child can not you understand I i be simply torment i suffer at know nothing yes it seem to I that i shall feel more at ease when i know the truth it be for myself that i question you for my own peace of mind ah if i could only tell you if i could tell you he begin to divine many thing it be unnecessary for she to be more explicit he know that during the past year she and she husband have be hope for the advent of a second child and that none have come as a woman constance feel no jealousy of norine but as a mother she be jealous of she son she could not drive the thought of that child from she mind it ever and ever return thither like a mock insult now that she hope of replace maurice be fading fast day by day do she dream more and more passionately of the other woman 's son wonder where he be what have become of he whether he be healthy and whether he resemble he father i assure you my dear mathieu she resume that you will really bring I relief by answer I be he alive tell I simply whether he be alive but do not tell I a lie if he be dead i think that i shall feel calmer and yet good heaven i certainly wish he no evil then mathieu who feel deeply touch tell she the simple truth since you insist on it for the benefit of you peace of mind and since it be to remain entirely between we and to have no effect on you home i see no reason why i should not confide to you what i know but that be very little the child be leave at the foundling hospital in my presence since then the mother have never ask for news have receive none i need not add that you husband be equally ignorant for he always refuse to have anything to do with the child be the lad still alive where be he those be thing which i can not tell you a long inquiry would be necessary if however you wish for my opinion i think it probable that he be dead for the mortality among these poor cast-off child be very great constance look at he fixedly you be tell I the real truth you be hide nothing she ask and as he begin to protest she go on : yes yes i have confidence in you and so you believe that he be dead ah to think of all those child who die when so many woman would be happy to save one to have one for themselves well if you have not be able to tell I anything positive you have at least do you best thank you during the ensue month mathieu often find himself alone with constance but she never revert to the subject she seem to set she energy on forget all about it though he divine that it still haunt she meantime thing go from bad to worse in the beauchene household the husband gradually go back to he former life of debauchery in spite of all the effort of constance to keep he near she she for she part cling to she fixed idea and before long she consult boutan there be a terrible scene that day between husband and wife in the doctor 's presence constance rake up the story of norine and cast it in beauchene 's tooth while he upbraid she in a variety of way however boutan 's advice though follow for a time prove unavailing and she at last lost confidence in he then she spend month and month in consult one and another she place herself in the hand of madame bourdieu she even go to see la rouche she apply to all sort of charlatan exasperate to fury at find that there be no real succor for she she might long ago have have a family have she so chosen but she have elect otherwise set all she egotism and pride on that only son whom death have snatch away and now the motherhood she long for be deny she for nearly two year do constance battle and at last in despair she be seize with the idea of consult dr gaude he tell she the brutal truth it be useless for she to address herself to charlatan she would simply be rob by they there be absolutely no hope for she and gaude utter those decisive word in a light jest way as though surprised and amuse by she profound grief she almost faint on the stair as she leave he flat and for a moment indeed death seem welcome but by a great effort of will she recover self-possession the courage to face the life of loneliness that now lay before she moreover another idea vaguely dawn upon she and the first time she find herself alone with mathieu she again speak to he of norine 's boy forgive I say she for revert to a painful subject but i be suffer too much now that i know there be no hope for I i be haunt by the thought of that illegitimate child of my husband 's will you do I a great service make the inquiry you once speak to I about try to find out if he be alive or dead i feel that when i know the fact peace may perhaps return to I mathieu be almost on the point of answer she that even if this child be find again it could hardly cure she of she grief at have no child of she own he have divine she agony at see blaise take maurice 's place at the work now that beauchene have resume he dissolute life and daily intrust the young man with more and more authority blaise 's home be prosper too charlotte have now give birth to a second child a boy and thus fruitfulness be invade the place and usurpation become more and more likely since constance could never more have a heir to bar the road of conquest without penetrate she singular feeling mathieu fancy that she perhaps wish to sound he to ascertain if he be not behind blaise urge on the work of spoliation she possibly imagine that she request would make he anxious and that he would refuse to make the necessary research at this idea he decide to do as she desire if only to show she that he be above all the base calculation of ambition i be at you disposal cousin say he it be enough for I that this inquiry may give you a little relief but if the lad be alive be i to bring he to you oh no no i do not ask that and then gesticulate almost wildly she stammer : i do not know what i want but i suffer so dreadfully that i be scarce able to live in point of fact a tempest rage within she but she really have no settle plan one could hardly say that she really think of that boy as a possible heir in spite of she hatred of all conqueror from without be it likely that she would accept he as a conqueror in the face of she outraged womanly feeling and she bourgeois horror of illegitimacy and yet if he be not she son he be at least she husband 's and perhaps a idea of save she empire by place the work in the hand of that heir be dimly rise within she above all she prejudice and she rancor but however that might be she feeling for the time remain confused and the only clear thing be she desperate torment at be now and forever childless a torment which goad she on to seek another 's child with the wild idea of make that child in some slight degree she own mathieu however ask she be i to inform beauchene of the step i take do you as you please she answer still that would be the best that same evening there come a complete rupture between herself and she husband she throw in beauchene 's face all the contempt and loathing that she have feel for he for year hopeless as she be she revenge herself by tell he everything that she have on she heart and mind and she slim dark figure upborne by bitter rage assume such redoubtable proportion in he eye that he feel frighten by she and flee henceforth they be husband and wife in name only it be logic on the march it be the inevitable disorganization of a household reach its climax it be rebellion against nature 's law and indulgence in vice lead to the gradual decline of a man of intelligence it be a hard worker sink into the sloth of so-called pleasure and then death have snatch away the only son the home break to piece -- the wife -- fate to childlessness and the husband drive away by she rolling through debauchery towards final ruin but mathieu keep he promise to constance discreetly begin he research and before he even consult beauchene it occur to he to apply at the foundling hospital if as he anticipate the child be dead the affair would go no further fortunately enough he remember all the particulars : the two name alexandre-honore give to the child the exact date of the deposit at the hospital indeed all the little incident of the day when he have drive thither with la couteau and when he be receive by the director of the establishment and have explain to he the real motive of he inquiry at the same time give he name he be surprise by the promptness and precision of the answer : alexandre-honore put out to nurse with the woman loiseau at rougemont have first keep cow and have then try the calling of a locksmith but for three month past he have be in apprenticeship with a wheelwright a certain montoir reside at saint-pierre a hamlet in the vicinity of rougemont thus the lad live he be fifteen year old and that be all mathieu could obtain no further information respect either he physical health or he morality when mathieu find himself in the street again slightly daze he remember that la couteau have tell he that the child would be send to rougemont he have always picture it die there carry off by the hurricane which kill so many babe and lie in the silent village cemetery pave with little parisian to find the boy alive save from the massacre come like a surprise of destiny and bring vague anguish a fear of some terrible catastrophe to mathieu 's heart at the same time since the boy be live and he now know where to seek he he feel that he must warn beauchene the matter be become serious and it seem to he that he ought not to carry the inquiry any further without the father 's authorization that same day then before return to chanteble he repair to the factory where he be lucky enough to find beauchene whom blaise 's absence on business have detain there by force thus he be in a very bad humor puffing and yawning and half asleep it be nearly three o'clock and he declare that he could never digest he lunch properly unless he go out afterwards the truth be that since he rupture with he wife he have be devote he afternoon to pay attention to a girl serve at a beer-house ah my good fellow he mutter as he stretch himself my blood be evidently thickening i must bestir myself or else i shall be in a bad way however he wake up when mathieu have explain the motive of he visit at first he could scarcely understand it for the affair seem to he so extraordinary so idiotic eh what do you say it be my wife who speak to you about that child it be she who have take it into she head to collect information and start a search he fat apoplectical face become distorted he anger be so violent that he could scarcely stutter when he hear however of the mission with which he wife have intrust mathieu he at last explode : she be mad i tell you that she be rave mad be such fancy ever see every morning she invent something fresh to distract I without heed this interruption mathieu quietly finish he narrative : and so i have just come back from the foundling hospital where i learn that the boy be alive i have he address -- and now what be i to do this be the final blow beauchene clench he fist and raise he arm in exasperation ah well here be a nice state of thing but why on earth do she want to trouble I about that boy he be not hers why can not she leave we alone the boy and I it be my affair and i ask you if it be at all proper for my wife to send you run about after he besides i hope that you be not go to bring he to she what on earth could we do with that little peasant who may have every vice just picture he come between we i tell you that she be mad mad mad he have begin to walk angrily to and fro all at once he stop : my dear fellow you will just oblige I by tell she that he be dead but he turn pale and recoil constance stand on the threshold and have hear he for some time past she have be in the habit of stealthily prowl around the office like one on the watch for something for a moment at the sight of the embarrassment which both man display she remain silent then without even address she husband she ask : he be alive be he not mathieu could but tell she the truth he answer with a nod then beauchene in despair make a final effort : come be reasonable my dear as i be say only just now we do not even know what this youngster 's character be you surely do not want to upset we life for the mere pleasure of do so stand there lean and frigid she give he a harsh glance then turn she back on he she demand the child 's name and the name of the wheelwright and the locality good you say alexandre-honore with montoir the wheelwright at saint-pierre near rougemont in calvado well my friend oblige I by continue you research endeavor to procure I some precise information about this boy 's habit and disposition be prudent too do not give anybody 's name and thanks for what you have do already thanks for all you be do for I thereupon she take herself off without give any further explanation without even tell she husband of the vague plan she be form beneath she crush contempt he have grow calm again why should he spoil he life of egotistical pleasure by resist that mad creature all that he need do be to put on he hat and betake himself to he usual diversion and so he end by shrug he shoulder after all let she pick he up if she choose it will not be my do act as she ask you my dear fellow continue you research and try to content she perhaps she will then leave I in peace but i have have quite enough of it for to-day good-by i be go out with the view of obtain some information of rougemont mathieu at first thought of apply to la couteau if he could find she again for which purpose it occur to he that he might call on madame bourdieu in the rue de miromesnil but another and more certain means suggest itself he have be lead to renew he intercourse with the seguin of whom he have for a time lose sight and much to he surprise he have find valentine 's former maid celeste in the avenue d'antin once more through this woman he think he might reach la couteau direct the renewal of the intercourse between the froment and the seguin be due to a very happy chance mathieu 's son ambroise on leave college have enter the employment of a uncle of seguin 's thoma du hordel one of the wealthiest commission merchant in pari and this old man who despite he year remain very sturdy and still direct he business with all the fire of youth have conceive a grow fondness for ambroise who have great mental endowment and a real genius for commerce du hordel 's own child have consist of two daughter one of whom have die young while the other have marry a madman who have lodge a bullet in he head and have leave she childless and crazy like himself this partially explain the deep grandfatherly interest which du hordel take in young ambroise who be the handsomest of all the froment with a clear complexion large black eye brown hair that curl naturally and manners of much refinement and elegance but the old man be further captivate by the young fellow 's spirit of enterprise the four modern language which he speak so readily and the evident mastery which he would some day show in the management of a business which extend over the five part of the world in he childhood among he brother and sister ambroise have always be the boldest most captivating and self-assertive the other might be better than he but he reign over they like a handsome ambitious greedy boy a future man of gayety and conquest and this indeed he prove to be by the charm of he victorious intellect he conquer old du hordel in a few month even as later on he be destine to vanquish everybody and everything much as he please he strength lay in he power of pleasing and he power of action a blending of grace with the most assiduous industry about this time seguin and he uncle who have never set foot in the house of the avenue d'antin since insanity have reign there draw together again they apparent reconciliation be the outcome of a drama shroud in secrecy seguin hard up and in debt cast off by nora who divine he approach ruin and prey upon by other voracious creature have end by commit on the turf one of those indelicate action which honest people call theft du hordel on be apprise of the matter have hasten forward and have pay what be due in order to avoid a frightful scandal and he be so upset by the extraordinary muddle in which he find he nephew 's home once all prosperity that remorse come upon he as if he be in some degree responsible for what have happen since he have egotistically keep away from he relative for he own peace 's sake but he be more particularly win over by he grandniece andree now a delicious young girl well-nigh eighteen year of age and therefore marriageable she alone suffice to attract he to the house and he be greatly distressed by the dangerous state of abandonment in which he find she she father continue drag out he worthless life away from home she mother valentine have just emerge from a frightful crisis she final rupture with santerre who have make up he mind to marry a very wealthy old lady which after all be the logical destiny of such a crafty exploiter of woman one who behind he affectation of culture pessimism have the vilest and greediest of nature valentine distract by this rupture have now throw herself into religion and like she husband disappear from the house for whole day she be say to be a active helpmate of old count de navarede the president of a society of catholic propaganda gaston she son have leave saint-cyr three month previously be now at the cavalry school of saumur so fire with passion for a military career that he already speak of remain a bachelor since a soldier 's sword should be he only love he only spouse then lucie now nineteen year old and full of mystical exaltation have already enter a ursuline convent for she novitiate and in the big empty home whence father mother brother and sister flee there remain but the gentle and adorable andree expose to all the blast of insanity which even now sweep through the household and so distressed by loneliness that she uncle du hordel full of compassionate affection conceive the idea of give she a husband in the person of young ambroise the future conqueror this plan be help on by the renew presence of celeste the maid eight year have elapse since valentine have be oblige to dismiss this woman for immorality and during those eight year celeste weary of service have try a number of equivocal calling of which she do not speak she have end by turn up at rougemont she native place in bad health and such a state of wretchedness that for the sake of a living she go out as a charwoman there then she gradually recover she health and accumulate a little stock of clothes thanks to the protection of the village priest whom she win over by a affectation of extreme piety it be at rougemont no doubt that she plan she return to the seguin of whose vicissitude she be inform by la couteau the latter have keep up she intercourse with madame menoux the little haberdasher of the neighborhood valentine shortly after she rupture with santerre one day of furious despair when she have again dismiss all she servant be surprise by the arrival of celeste who show herself so repentant so devoted and so serious-minded that she former mistress feel touch she make she weep on remind she of she fault and ask she to swear before god that she would never repeat they for celeste now go to confession and partook of the holy communion and carry with she a certificate from the cure of rougemont vouch for she deep piety and high morality this certificate act decisively on valentine who unwilling to remain at home and weary of the trouble of housekeeping understand what precious help she might derive from this woman on she side celeste certainly rely upon power be surrender to she two month later by favor lucie 's excessive partiality to religious practice she have help she into a convent gaston show himself only when he secure a few day ' leave and so andree alone remain at home impede by she presence the great general pillage that celeste dream of the maid therefore become a most active worker on behalf of she young mistress 's marriage andree it should be say be comprise in ambroise 's universal conquest she have meet he at she uncle du hordel 's house for a year before it occur to the latter to marry they she be a very gentle girl a little golden-haired sheep as she mother sometimes say and that handsome smile young man who evince so much kindness towards she become the subject of she thought and hope whenever she suffer from loneliness and abandonment thus when she uncle prudently question she she fling herself into he arm weep big tear of gratitude and confession valentine on be approach at first manifest some surprise what a son of the froment those froment have already take chanteble from they and do they now want to take one of they daughter then amid the collapse of fortune and household she could find no reasonable objection to urge she have never be attach to andree she accuse la catiche the nurse of have make the child she own that gentle docile emotional little sheep be not a seguin she often remark then while feign to defend the girl celeste embittered she mother against she and inspire she with a desire to see the marriage promptly conclude in order that she might free herself from she last care and live as she wish thus after a long chat with mathieu who promise he consent it remain only for du hordel to assure himself of seguin 's approval before a application in due form be make it be difficult however to find seguin in a suitable frame of mind so week be lose and it become necessary to pacify ambroise who be very much in love and be doubtless warn by he all-invading genius that this loving and simple girl would bring he a kingdom in she apron one day when mathieu be pass along the avenue d'antin it occur to he to call at the house to ascertain if seguin have re-appear there for he have suddenly take himself off without warning and have go so it be believe to italy then as mathieu find himself alone with celeste the opportunity seem to he a excellent one to discover la couteau 's whereabouts he ask for news of she say that a friend of he be in need of a good nurse well monsieur you be in luck 's way the maid reply la couteau be to bring a child home to we neighbor madame menoux this very day it be nearly four o'clock now and that be the time when she promise to come you know madame menoux 's place do you not it be the third shop in the first street on the left then she apologize for be unable to conduct he thither : i be alone she say we still have no news of the master on wednesday madame preside at the meeting of she society and mademoiselle andree have just go out walk with she uncle mathieu hastily repair to madame menoux 's shop from a distance he see she standing on the threshold age have make she thinner than ever at forty she be as slim as a young girl with a long and pointed face silent labor consume she for twenty year she have be desperately sell bit of cotton and package of needle without ever make a fortune but pleased nevertheless at be able to add she modest gain to she husband 's monthly salary in order to provide he with sundry little comfort he rheumatism would no doubt soon compel he to relinquish he post as a museum attendant and how would they be able to manage with he pension of a few hundred franc per annum if she do not keep up she business moreover they have meet with no luck they first child have die and some year have elapse before the birth of a second boy whom they have greet with delight no doubt though he would prove a heavy burden to they especially as they have now decide to take he back from the country thus mathieu find the worthy woman in a state of great emotion wait for the child on the threshold of she shop and watch the corner of the avenue oh it be celeste who send you monsieur no la couteau have not come yet i be quite astonished at it i expect she every moment will you kindly step inside monsieur and sit down he refuse the only chair which block up the narrow passage where scarcely three customer could have stand in a row behind a glass partition one perceive the dim back shop which serve as kitchen and dining-room and bedchamber and which receive only a little air from a damp inner yard which suggest a sewer shaft as you see monsieur we have scarcely any room continue madame menoux but then we pay only eight hundred franc rent and where else could we find a shop at that price and besides i have be here for nearly twenty year and have work up a little regular custom in the neighborhood oh i do not complain of the place myself i be not big there be always sufficient room for I and as my husband come home only in the evening and then sit down in he armchair to smoke he pipe he be not so much inconvenience i do all i can for he and he be reasonable enough not to ask I to do more but with a child i fear that it will be impossible to get on here the recollection of she first boy she little pierre return to she and she eye fill with tear ah monsieur that be ten year ago and i can still see la couteau bring he back to I just as she 'll be bring the other by and by i be tell so many tale there be such good air at rougemont and the child lead such healthy life and my boy have such rosy cheek that i end by leave he there till he be five year old regret that i have no room for he here and no you can not have a idea of all the present that the nurse wheedle out of I of all the money that i pay it be ruination and then all at once i have just time to send for the boy and he be bring back to I as thin and pale and weak as if he have never taste good bread in he life two month later he die in my arm he father fall ill over it and if we have not be attach to one another i think we should both have go and drown ourselves scarce wipe she eye she feverishly return to the threshold and again cast a passionate expectant glance towards the avenue and when she come back have see nothing she resume : so you will understand we emotion when two year ago though i be thirty-seven i again have a little boy we be wild with delight like a young married couple but what a lot of trouble and worry we have to put the little fellow out to nurse as we let the other one since we could not possibly keep he here and even after swearing that he should not go to rougemont we end by say that we at least know the place and that he would not be worse off there than elsewhere only we send he to la vimeux for we would not hear any more of la loiseau since she send pierre back in such a fearful state and this time as the little fellow be now two year old i be determine to have he home again though i do not even know where i shall put he i have be wait for a hour now and i can not help tremble for i always fear some catastrophe she could not remain in the shop but remain standing by the doorway with she neck outstretch and she eye fix on the street corner all at once a deep cry come from she : ah here they be leisurely and with a sour harass air la couteau come in and place the sleep child in madame menoux 's arm say as she do so : well you george be a tidy weight i can tell you you will not say that i have bring you this one back like a skeleton quiver she leg sink beneath she for very joy the mother have be oblige to sit down keep she child on she knee kiss he examine he all haste to see if he be in good health and likely to live he have a fat and rather pale face and seem big though puffy when she have unfasten he wrap she hand tremble the while with nervousness she find that he be pot-bellied with small leg and arm he be very big about the body she murmur cease to smile and turn gloomy with renew fear ah yes complain away say la couteau the other be too thin this one will be too fat mother be never satisfy at the first glance mathieu have detect that the child be one of those who be feed on pap stuff for economy 's sake with bread and water and fate to all the stomachic complaint of early childhood and at the sight of the poor little fellow rougemont the frightful slaughter-place with its daily massacre of the innocent arise in he memory such as it have be describe to he in year long past there be la loiseau whose habit be so abominably filthy that she nursling rot as on a manure heap there be la vimeux who never purchase a drop of milk but pick up all the village crust and make bran porridge for she charge as if they have be pig there be la gavette too who be always in the field leave she nursling in the charge of a paralytic old man who sometimes let they fall into the fire and there be la cauchoi who have nobody to watch the babe contented herself with tie they in they cradle leave they in the company of fowl which come in band to peck at they eye and the scythe of death sweep by there be wholesale assassination door be leave wide open before row of cradle in order to make room for fresh bundle despatch from pari yet all do not die here for instance be one bring home again but even when they come back alive they carry with they the germ of death and another hecatomb ensue another sacrifice to the monstrous god of social egotism i be tire out i must sit down resume la couteau seat herself on the narrow bench behind the counter ah what a trade and to think that we be always receive as if we be heartless criminal and thief she also have become wither she sunburnt tan face suggest more than ever the beak of a bird of prey but she eye remain very keen sharpen as it be by ferocity she no doubt fail to get rich fast enough for she continue wail complain of she calling of the increase avarice of parent of the demand of the authority of the warfare which be be declare against nurse-agent on all side yes it be a lose calling say she and really god must have abandon she that she should still be compel to carry it on at forty-five year of age it will end by kill I she add i shall always get more kick than money at it how unjust it be here have i bring you back a superb child and yet you look anything but pleased -- it be enough to disgust one of do one 's best in thus complain she object perhaps be to extract from the haberdasher as large a present as possible madame menoux be certainly disturb by it all she boy wake up and begin to wail loudly and it become necessary to give he a little lukewarm milk at last when the account be settle the nurse-agent see that she would have ten franc for herself grow calmer she be about to take she leave when madame menoux point to mathieu exclaim : this gentleman wish to speak to you on business although la couteau have not see the gentleman for several year past she have recognize he perfectly well still she have not even turn towards he for she know he to be mix up in so many matter that he discretion be a certainty and so she contented herself with say : if monsieur will kindly explain to I what it be i shall be quite at he service i will accompany you reply mathieu we can speak together as we walk along very good that will suit I well for i be rather in a hurry once outside mathieu resolve that he would try no ruse with she the best course be to tell she plainly what he want and then to buy she silence at the first word he speak she understand he she well remember norine 's child although in she time she have carry dozen of child to the foundling hospital the particular circumstance of that case however the conversation which have take place she drive with mathieu in a cab have all remain engrave on she memory moreover she have find that child again at rougemont five day later and she even remember that she friend the hospital-attendant have leave it with la loiseau but she have occupy herself no more about it afterwards and she believe that it be now dead like so many other when she hear mathieu speak of the hamlet of saint-pierre of montoir the wheelwright and of alexandre-honore now fifteen who must be in apprenticeship there she evince great surprise oh you must be mistaken monsieur she say i know montoir at saint-pierre very well and he certainly have a lad from the foundling of the age you mention at he place but that lad come from la cauchois he be a big carroty fellow name richard who arrive at we village some day before the other i know who he mother be she be a english woman call amy who stop more than once at madame bourdieu 's that ginger-haired lad be certainly not you norine 's boy alexandre-honore be dark well then reply mathieu there must be another apprentice at the wheelwright 's my information be precise it be give I officially after a moment 's perplexity la couteau make a gesture of ignorance and admit that mathieu might be right it be possible say she perhaps montoir have two apprentice he do a good business and as i have not be to saint-pierre for some month now i can say nothing certain well and what do you desire of I monsieur he then give she very clear instruction she be to obtain the most precise information possible about the lad 's health disposition and conduct whether the schoolmaster have always be please with he whether he employer be equally satisfied and so forth briefly the inquiry be to be complete but above all thing she be to carry it on in such a way that nobody should suspect anything neither the boy himself nor the folk of the district there must be absolute secrecy all that be easy reply la couteau i understand perfectly and you can rely on I i shall need a little time however and the best plan will be for I to tell you of the result of my research when i next come to pari and if it suit you you will find I to-day fortnight at two o'clock at broquette 's office in the rue roquepine i be quite at home there and the place be like a tomb some day later as mathieu be again at the beauchene work with he son blaise he be observe by constance who call he to she and question he in such direct fashion that he have to tell she what step he have take when she hear of he appointment with la couteau for the Wednesday of the ensue week she say to he in she resolute way : come and fetch I i wish to question that woman myself i want to be quite certain on the matter in spite of the lapse of fifteen year broquette 's nurse-office in the rue roquepine have remain the same as formerly except that madame broquette be dead and have be succeed by she daughter herminie the sudden loss of that fair dignified lady who have possess such a decorative presence and so ably represent the high morality and respectability of the establishment have at first seem a severe one but it so happen that herminie a tall slim languid creature that she be gorge with novel-reading also prove in she way a distinguished figurehead for the office she be already thirty and be still unmarried feeling indeed nothing but loathing for all the mother laden with whining child by whom she be surround moreover m broquette she father though now more than five-and-seventy secretly remain the all-powerful energetic director of the place discharge all needful police duty drill new nurse like recruit remain ever on the watch and incessantly perambulate the three floor of he suspicious dingy lodging-house la couteau be wait for mathieu in the doorway on perceive constance whom she do not know for she have never previously meet she she seem surprise who could that lady be what have she to do with the affair however she promptly extinguish the bright gleam of curiosity which for a moment light up she eye and as herminie with distinguished nonchalance be at that moment exhibit a party of nurse to two gentleman in the office she take she visitor into the empty refectory where the atmosphere be as usual taint by a horrible stench of cookery you must excuse I monsieur and madame she exclaim but there be no other room free just now the place be full then she carry she keen glance from mathieu to constance prefer to wait until she be question since another person be now in the secret you can speak out say mathieu do you make the inquiry i speak to you about certainly monsieur they be make and properly make i think then tell we the result : i repeat that you can speak freely before this lady oh monsieur it will not take I long you be quite right : there be two apprentice at the wheelwright 's at saint-pierre and one of they be alexandre-honore the pretty blonde 's child the same that we take together over yonder he have be there i find barely two month after try three or four other calling and that explain my ignorance of the circumstance only he be a lad who can stay nowhere and so three week ago he take himself off constance could not restrain a exclamation of anxiety : what take himself off yes madame i mean that he run away and this time it be quite certain that he have leave the district for he disappear with three hundred franc belong to montoir he master la couteau 's dry voice ring as if it be a axe deal a deadly blow although she could not understand the lady 's sudden pallor and despairing emotion she certainly seem to derive cruel enjoyment from it be you quite sure of you information resume constance struggle against the fact that be perhaps mere village tittle-tattle tittle-tattle madame oh when i undertake to do anything i do it properly i speak to the gendarme they have scour the whole district and it be certain that alexandre-honore leave no address behind he when he go off with those three hundred franc he be still on the run as for that i 'll stake my name on it this be indeed a hard blow for constance that lad whom she fancy she have find again of whom she dream incessantly and on whom she have base so many unacknowledgable plan of vengeance escape she vanish once more into the unknown she be distract by it as by some pitiless stroke of fate some fresh and irreparable defeat however she continue the interrogatory surely you do not merely see the gendarme you be instruct to question everybody that be

house in which madame desvignes have take refuge after she husband 's death and which she have now occupy for some twelve year live there in a very quiet retired way on the scanty income she have manage to save be the first in the village on the high road for a week past she elder daughter charlotte blaise 's wife have come to stay there with she child berthe and christophe who need change of air and on the previous evening they have be join by blaise who be well pleased to spend Sunday with they madame desvignes ' younger daughter marthe be delighted whenever she sister thus come to spend a few week in the old home bring she little one with she and once more occupy the room which have belong to she in she girlish day all the laughter and playfulness of the past come back again and the one dream of worthy madame desvignes amid she pride at be a grandmamma be of complete she life-work hitherto so prudently carry on by marry off marthe in she turn as a matter of fact it have seem likely that there might be three instead of two wedding at chanteble that spring deni who since leave a scientific school have embark in fresh technical study often sleep at the farm and nearly every Sunday he see marthe who be of the same age as rose and she constant companion the young girl a pretty blonde like she sister charlotte but of a less impulsive and more practical nature have indeed attract deni and dowerless though she be he have make up he mind to marry she since he have discover that she possess the sterling quality that help one on to fortune but in they chat together both evince good sense and serene confidence without sign of undue haste particularly be this the case with deni who be very methodical in he way and unwilling to place a woman 's happiness in question until he could offer she a assure position thus of they own accord they have postpone they marriage quietly and smilingly resist the passionate assault of rose whom the idea of three wedding on the same day have greatly excite at the same time deni continue visit madame desvignes who on she side equally prudent and confident receive he much as if he be she son that morning he have even quit the farm at seven o'clock say that he mean to surprise blaise in bed and thus he also be to be meet at janville as it happen the fete of janville fall on Sunday the second in may encompass the square in front of the railway station be roundabout booth shoot gallery and refreshment stall stormy shower during the night have cleanse the sky which be of a pure blue with a flaming sun whose heat in fact be excessive for the season a good many people be already assemble on the square -- all the idler of the district band of child and peasant of the surrounding country eager to see the sight and into the midst of this crowd fall the froment -- first the bicyclist next the wagon and then the other who have be meet at the entry of the village we be produce we little effect exclaim rise as she spring from she wheel this be incontestable during the earlier year the whole of janville have look harshly on those froment those bourgeois who have come nobody know whence and who with overween conceit have talk of make corn grow in land where there have be nothing but crop of stone for century past then the miracle mathieu 's extraordinary victory have long hurt people 's vanity and thereby increase they anger but everything pass away one can not regard success with rancor and folk who grow rich always end by be in the right thus nowadays janville smile complacently on that swarm family which have grow up beside it forget that in former time each fresh birth at chanteble have be regard as quite scandalous by the gossip besides how could one resist such a happy display of strength and power such a merry invasion when as on that festive Sunday the whole family come up at a gallop conquer the road the street and the square what with the father and mother the eleven child -- six boy and five girl -- and two grandchild already there be fifteen of they the eldest boy the twin be now four-and twenty and still so much alike that people occasionally mistake one for the other as in they cradle day when marianne have be oblige to open they eye to identify they those of blaise be gray and those of deni black nicola the youngest boy at the other end of the family scale be as yet but five year old a delightful little urchin be he a precocious little man whose energy and courage be quite amusing and between the twin and that youngster come the eight other child : ambroise the future husband who be already on the road to every conquest rise so brimful of life who likewise be on the eve of marry gervai with he square brow and wrestler 's limb who would soon be fight the good fight of agriculture claire who be silent and hardworking and lack beauty but possess a strong heart and a housewife 's sensible head next gregoire the undisciplined self-willed schoolboy who be ever beat the hedge in search of adventure and then the three last girl : louise plump and good natured madeleine delicate and of dreamy mind marguerite the least pretty but the most loving of the trio and when behind they father and they mother the eleven come along one after the other follow too by berthe and christophe represent yet another generation it be a real procession that one saw as for instance on that fine Sunday on the grand place of janville already crowd with holiday-making folk and the effect be irresistible even those who be scarcely please with the prodigious success of chantebled feel enliven and amuse at see the froment gallop about and invade the place so much health and mirth and strength accompany they as if earth with she overflow gift of life have thus profusely create they for to-morrow 's everlasting hope let those who think themselves more numerous come forward rise resume gayly and then we will count one another come be quiet say she mother who after alight from the wagon have set nicola on the ground you will end by make people hoot we hoot we why they admire we : just look at they how funny it be mamma that you be not prouder of yourself and of we why i be so very proud that i fear to humiliate other they all begin to laugh and mathieu standing near marianne likewise feel proud at find himself as he put it among the sacred battalion of he son and daughter to that battalion worthy madame desvignes herself belong since she daughter charlotte be add soldier to it and help it to become a army such as it be indeed this be only the beginning later on the battalion would be see ever increase and multiply become a swarm victorious race great-grandchild follow grandchild till there be fifty of they and a hundred and two hundred all tend to increase the happiness and beauty of the world and in the mingled amazement and amusement of janville gather around that fruitful family there be certainly some of the instinctive admiration which be feel for the strength and the healthfulness which create great nation besides we have only friend now remark mathieu everybody be cordial with we oh everybody mutter rise just look at the lepailleurs yonder in front of that booth the lepailleur be indeed there -- the father the mother antonin and therese in order to avoid the froment they be pretend to take great interest in a booth where a number of crudely-colored china ornament be display as prize for the winner at a lucky-wheel they no longer even exchange courtesy with the chantebled folk for in they impotent rage at such ceaseless prosperity they have avail themselves of a petty business dispute to break off all relation lepailleur regard the creation of chanteble as a personal insult for he have not forget he jeer and challenge with respect to those moorland from which in he opinion one would never reap anything but stone and thus when he have well examine the china ornament it occur to he to be insolent with which object he turn round and stare at the froment who as the train they be expect would not arrive for another quarter of a hour be gayly promenade through the fair the miller 's bad temper have for the last two month be increase by the return of he son antonin to janville under very deplorable circumstance this young fellow who have set off one morning to conquer pari send there by he parent who have a blind confidence in he fine handwriting have remain with maitre rousselet the attorney for four year as a petty clerk dull-witted and extremely idle he have not make the slightest progress in he profession but have gradually sink into debauchery cafe-life drunkenness gambling and facile amours to he the conquest of paris mean greedy indulgence in the coarsest pleasure such as he have dream of in he village it consume all he money all the supplies which he extract from he mother by continual promise of victory in which she implicitly believe so great be she faith in he but he end by grievously suffer in health turn thin and yellow and actually begin to lose he hair at three-and-twenty so that he mother full of alarm bring he home one day declare that he work too hard and that she would not allow he to kill himself in that fashion it leak out however later on that maitre rousselet have summarily dismiss he even before this be know he return home do not fail to make he father growl the miller partially guess the truth and if he do not openly vent he anger it be solely from pride in order that he might not have to confess he mistake with respect to the brilliant career which he have predict for antonin at home when the door be close lepailleur revenge himself on he wife pick the most frightful quarrel with she since he have discover she frequent remittance of money to they son but she hold she own against he for even as she have formerly admire he so at present she admire she boy she sacrifice as it be the father to the son now that the latter 's greater learning bring she increase surprise and so the household be all disagreement as a result of that foolish attempt bear of vanity to make they heir a monsieur a parisian antonin for he part sneer and shrug he shoulder at it all idle away he time pend the day when he might be able to resume a life of profligacy when the froment pass by it be a fine sight to see the lepailleur stand there stiffly and devour they with they eye the father pucker he lip in a attempt to sneer and the mother jerk she head with a air of bravado the son standing there with he hand in he pocket present a sorry sight with he bent back he bald head and pale face all three be seek to devise something disagreeable when a opportunity present itself why where be therese exclaimed la lepailleur she be here just now : what have become of she i will not have she leave I when there be all these people about it be quite true for the last moment therese have disappear she be now ten year old and very pretty quite a plump little blonde with wild hair and black eye which shine brightly but she have a terribly impulsive and wilful nature and would run off and disappear for hour at a time beat the hedge and scour the countryside in search of bird ' - nest and flower and wild fruit if she mother however make such a display of alarm dart hither and thither to find she just as the froment pass by it be because she have become aware of some scandalous proceedings during the previous week therese 's ardent dream be to possess a bicycle and she desire one the more since she parent stubbornly refuse to content she declare in fact that those machine might do for bourgeois but be certainly not fit for well-behaved girl well one afternoon when she have go as usual into the field she mother return from market have perceive she on a desert strip of road in company with little gregoire froment another young wanderer whom she often meet in this wise in spot know only to themselves the two make a very suitable pair and be ever larking and rambling along the path under the leaf beside the ditch but the abominable thing be that on this occasion gregoire have seat therese on he own bicycle be support she at the waist and run alongside help she to direct the machine briefly it be a real bicycle lesson which the little rascal be give and which the little hussy take with all the pleasure in the world when therese return home that evening she have she ear soundly box for she pain where can that little gadabout have get to la lepailleur continue shout one can no sooner take one 's eye off she than she run away antonin however have peep behind the booth contain the china ornament lurch back again still with he hand in he pocket and say with he vicious sneer : just look there you 'll see something and indeed behind the booth he mother again find therese and gregoire together the lad be hold he bicycle with one hand and explain some of the mechanism of it while the girl full of admiration and covetousness look on with glowing eye indeed she could not resist she inclination but laughingly let gregoire raise she in order to seat she for a moment on the saddle when all at once she mother 's terrible voice burst forth : you wicked hussy what be you up to there again just come back at once or i 'll settle you business for you then mathieu also catch sight of the scene sternly summon gregoire : please to place you wheel with the other you know what i have already say to you so do not begin again it be war lepailleur impudently growl ignoble threat which fortunately be lose amid the strain of a barrel organ and the two family separate go off in different direction through the grow holiday-making crowd will not that train ever come then resume rise who with joyous impatience be at every moment turn to glance at the clock of the little railway station on the other side of the square we have still ten minute to wait : whatever shall we do as it happen she have stop in front of a hawker who stand on the footway with a basketful of crawfish crawl pell-mell at he foot they have certainly come from the source of the yeuse three league away they be not large but they be very tasty for rise herself have occasionally catch some in the stream and thus a greedy but also playful fancy come to she oh mamma she cry let we buy the whole basketful it will be for the feast of welcome you see it will be we present to the royal couple we be await people will not say that we majesty neglect to do thing properly when they be expect other majesty and i will cook they when we get back and you 'll see how well i shall succeed at this the other begin to poke fun at she but she parent end by do as she ask big child as she be who in the fulness of she happiness hardly know what amusement to seek however as by way of pastime she obstinately seek to count the crawfish quite a affair ensue : some of they pinch she and she drop they with a little shriek and amid it all the basket fall over and then the crawfish hurriedly crawl away the boy and girl dart in pursuit of they there be quite a hunt in which even the serious member of the family at last take part and what with the laughter and eagerness of one and all the big as well as the little the whole happy brood the sight be so droll and gay that the folk of janville again draw near and good-naturedly take they share of the amusement all at once however arise a distant rumble of wheel and a engine whistle ah good heaven here they be cry rise quite scared quick quick or the reception will be miss a scramble ensue the owner of the crawfish be pay and there be just time to shut the basket and carry it to the wagon the whole family be already run off invade the little station and range itself in good order along the arrival platform no no not like that rise repeat you do not observe the right order of precedence the queen mother must be with the king she husband and then the prince accord to they height frederic must place himself on my right and it be for I you know to make the speech of welcome the train stop when ambroise and andree alight they be at first much surprised to find that everybody have come to meet they draw up in a row with solemn mien when rise however begin to deliver a pompous little speech treat she brother 's betroth like some foreign princess whom she have order to welcome in the name of the king she father the young couple begin to laugh and even prolong the joke by respond in the same style the railway man look on and listen gaping it be a fine farce and the froment be delight at show themselves so playful on that warm may morning but marianne suddenly raise a exclamation of surprise : what have not madame seguin come with you she give I so many promise that she would in the rear of ambroise and andree celeste the maid have alone alight from the train and she undertake to explain thing : madame charge I say she to say that she be really most grieve yesterday she still hope that she would be able to keep she promise only in the evening she receive a visit from monsieur de navarede who be preside to-day Sunday at a meeting of he society and of course madame could not do otherwise than attend it so she request I to accompany the young people and everything be satisfactory for here they be you see as a matter of fact nobody regret the absence

defiance it will never dare to come down before we get home then with a comical semblance of authority she dispose she people in the order which she have plan in she mind a week previously and the procession set off through the admire village amid the smile of all the good woman hasten to they doorstep and then spread out along the white road between the fertile field where band of startled lark take wing carry they clear song to the heaven it be really magnificent at the head of the party be rise and frederic side by side on they bicycle open the nuptial march with majestic amplitude behind they follow the three maid of honor the younger sister louise madeleine and marguerite the tallest first the shortest last and each on a wheel proportion to she growth and with beret \* on they head and they hair down they back wave in the breeze they look adorable suggest a flight of messenger swallow skim over the ground and bear good tiding onward as for gregoire the page restive and always ready to bolt he do not behave very well for he actually try to pass the royal couple at the head of the procession a proceeding which bring he various severe admonition until he fall back as duty demand to he deferential and modest post on the other hand as the three maid of honor begin to sing the ballad of cinderellum on she way to the palace of prince charming the royal couple condescendingly declare that the song be appropriate and of pleasing effect whatever might be the requirement of etiquette indeed rise frederic and gregoire also end by sing the ballad which ring out amid the serene far-spreading countryside like the finest music in the world \* the beret be the pyreneean tam-o ' - shanter then at a short distance in the rear come the chariot the good old family wagon which be now crowd accord to the prearranged program it be gervai who hold the ribbon with claire beside he the two strong horse trot on in they usual leisurely fashion in spite of all the gay whip-cracking of they driver who also wish to contribute to the music inside there be now seven people for six place for if the three child be small they be at the same time so restless that they fully take up they share of room first face to face there be ambroise and andree the betrothed couple who be be honor by this glorious welcome then also face to face there be the high and mighty ruler of the region mathieu and marianne the latter of whom keep little nicola the last prince of the line on she knee he bray the while like a little donkey because he feel so pleased then the last place be occupy by the ruler ' granddaughter and grandson mademoiselle berthe and monsieur christophe who be as yet unable to walk long distance and the chariot roll on with much majesty albeit that for fear of the rain the curtain of stout white linen have already be half-drawn thus give the vehicle at a distance somewhat of the aspect of a miller 's van further back yet as a sort of rear-guard be a group on foot compose of blaise deni madame desvignes and she daughter charlotte and marthe they have absolutely refuse to take a fly find it more pleasant to walk the mile and a half which separate chanteble from janville if the rain should fall they would manage to find shelter somewhere besides rise have declare that a suite on foot be absolutely necessary to give the procession its full significance those five last comer would represent the multitude the great concourse of people which follow sovereign and acclaim they or else they might be the necessary guard the man-at-arms who watch for the purpose of foil a possible attack from some felon neighbor at the same time it unfortunately happen that worthy madame desvignes could not walk very fast so that the rear-guard be soon distanced to such a degree indeed that it become merely a little lost group far away still this do not disconcert rise but rather make she laugh the more at the first bend of the road she turn she head and when she see she rear-guard more than three hundred yard away she raise cry of admiration oh just look frederic what a interminable procession what a deal of room we take up the cortege be become longer and longer and the road will not be long enough for it very soon then as the three maid of honor and the page begin to jeer impertinently just try to be respectful she say count a little there be six of we form the vanguard in the chariot there be nine and six and nine make fifteen add to they the five of the rear-guard and we have twenty wherever else be such a family see why the rabbit who watch we pass be mute with stupor and humiliation then come another laugh and once more they all take up the song of cinderellum on she way to the palace of prince charming it be at the bridge over the yeuse that the first drop of rain big drop they be begin to fall the big livid cloud urge on by a terrible wind be gallop across the sky fill it with the clamor of a tempest and almost immediately afterwards the rain-drop increase in volume and in number lash by so violent a squall that the water pour down as if by the bucketful or as if some huge sluice-gate have suddenly burst asunder overhead one could no longer see twenty yard before one in two minute the road be run with water like the bed of a torrent then there be a _ sauve-qui-peut _ among the procession it be learn later on that the people of the rear-guard have luckily be surprise near a peasant 's cottage in which they have quietly seek refuge then the folk in the wagon simply draw they curtain and halt beneath the shelter of a wayside tree for fear lest the horse should take fright under such a downpour they call to the bicyclist ahead of they to stop also instead of obstinately remain in such a deluge but they word be lose amid the rush of water however the little girl and the page take a proper course in crouch beside a thick hedge though the betrothed couple wildly continue on they way frederic the more reasonable of the two certainly have sense enough to say : this be not prudent on we part let we stop like the other i beg you but from rise all excitement transport by she blissful fever and insensible so it seem to the pelting of the rain he only draw this answer : pooh what do it matter now that we be soak it be by stop that we might do ourselves harm let we make haste all haste in three minute we shall be at home and able to make fine sport of those laggard when they arrive in another quarter of a hour they have just cross the yeuse bridge and they sweep on side by side although the road be far from easy be a continual ascent for a thousand yard or so between row of lofty poplar i assure you that we be do wrong the young man repeat they will blame I and they will be right oh well cry she i be amusing myself this bicycle bath be quite funny leave I then if you do not love I enough to follow I he follow she however press close beside she and seek to shelter she a little from the slanting rain and it be a wild mad race on the part of that young couple almost link together they elbow touch as they speed on and on as if lift from the ground carry off by all that rush howling water which pour down so ragefully it be as though a thunder-blast bear they along but at the very moment when they spring from they bicycle in the yard of the farm the rain cease and the sky become blue once more rise be laugh like a lunatic and look very flushed but she be soak to such a point that water stream from she clothes she hair she hand you might have take she for some fairy of the spring who have overturn she urn on herself well the fete be complete she exclaim breathlessly all the same we be the first home she then dart upstairs to comb she hair and change she gown but to gain just a few minute eager as she be to cook the crawfish she do not take the trouble to put on dry linen she wish the pot to be on the fire with the water the white wine the carrot and spice before the family arrive and she come and go attend to the fire and fill the whole kitchen with she gay activity like a good housewife who be glad to display she accomplishment while she betrothed who have also come downstairs again after change he clothes watch she with a kind of religious admiration at last when the whole family have arrive the folk of the brake and the pedestrian also there come a rather sharp explanation mathieu and marianne be angry so greatly have they be alarm by that rush through the storm there be no sense in it my girl marianne repeat do you at least change you linen why yes why yes reply rise where be the crawfish mathieu meantime be lecture frederic you might have break you neck say he and besides it be by no means good to get soak with cold water when one be hot you ought to have stop she well she insist on go on and whenever she insist on anything you know i have not the strength to prevent she at last rise in she pretty way put a end to the reproach come that be enough scolding i do wrong no doubt but will not anybody compliment I on my _ court-bouillon _ have you ever known crawfish to smell as nice as that the lunch be wonderfully gay as they be twenty and wish to have a real rehearsal of the wedding feast the table have be set in a large gallery adjoining the ordinary dining-room this gallery be still bare but throughout the meal they talk incessantly of how they would embellish it with shrub garland of foliage and clump of flower during the dessert they even send for a ladder with the view of indicate on the wall the main line of the decoration for a moment or so rise previously so talkative have lapse into silence she have eat heartily but all the color have leave she face which have assume a waxy pallor under she heavy hair which be still damp and when she wish to ascend the ladder herself to indicate how some ornament should be place she leg suddenly fail she she stagger and then faint away everybody be in consternation but she be promptly place in a chair where for a few minute longer she remain unconscious then on come to she sens she remain for a moment silent oppressed as by a feeling of pain and apparently fail to understand what have take place mathieu and marianne terribly upset press she with question anxious as they be to know if she feel better she have evidently catch cold and this be the fine result of she foolish ride by degree the girl recover she composure and again smile she then explain that she now feel no pain but that it have suddenly seem to she as if a heavy paving-stone be lie on she chest then this weight have melt away leave she better able to breathe and indeed she be soon on she foot once more and finish give she view respect the decoration of the gallery in such wise that the other end by feel reassure and the afternoon pass away joyously in the making of all sort of splendid plan little be eat at dinner for they have do too much honor to the crawfish at noon and at nine o'clock as soon as celeste arrive for andree the gathering break up ambroise be return to pari that same evening blaise and deni be to take the seven

thought of the general rendezvous which the family have arrange for the approach wedding neither mathieu nor marianne go to bed at once however though they do not even speak of it together they think that rise look very strange as if indeed she be intoxicate she have again stagger on return to the house and though she only complain of some slight oppression they prevail on she to go to bed after she have retire to she room which adjoin they own marianne go several time to see if she be well wrap up and be sleep peacefully while mathieu remain anxiously thoughtful beside the lamp at last the girl fall asleep and the parent leave the door of communication open then exchange a few word in a undertone in they desire to tranquillize each other it would surely be nothing a good night 's rest would suffice to restore rise to she wonted health then in they turn they go to bed the whole farm lapse into silence surrender itself to slumber until the first cockcrow but all at once about four o'clock shortly before daybreak a stifled call mamma mamma awake both mathieu and marianne and they spring out of bed barefooted shiver and grope for the candle rise be again stifle struggle against another attack of extreme violence for the second time however she soon regain consciousness and appear relieved and thus the parent great as be they distress prefer to summon nobody but to wait till daylight they alarm be cause particularly by the great change they notice in they daughter 's appearance she face be swollen and distorted as if some evil power have transform she in the night but she fall asleep again in a state of great prostration and they no longer stir for fear of disturb she slumber they remain there watch and wait listen to the revival of life in the farm around they as the daylight gradually increase time go by five and then six o'clock strike and at about twenty minute to seven mathieu on look into the yard and there catch sight of deni who be to return to pari by the seven o'clock train hasten down to tell he to call upon boutan and beg the doctor to come at once then as soon as he son have start he rejoin marianne upstairs still unwilling to call or warn anybody but a third attack follow and this time it be the thunderbolt rise have half rise in bed she arm throw out she mouth distend as she gasp mamma mamma then in a sudden fit of revolt a last flash of life she spring from she bed and step towards the window whose pane be all aglow with the rise sun and for a moment she lean there she leg bare she shoulder bare and she heavy hair fall over she like a royal mantle never have she look more beautiful more dazzling full of strength and love but she murmur : oh how i suffer it be all over i be go to die she father dart towards she she mother sustain she throw she arm around she like invincible armor which would shield she from all harm do not talk like that you unhappy girl it be nothing it be only another attack which will pass away get into bed again for mercy 's sake you old friend boutan be on he way here you will be up and well again to-morrow no no i be go to die it be all over she fall back in they arm they only have time to lay she on she bed and the thunderbolt fall : without a word without a glance in a few minute she die of congestion of the lung ah the imbecile thunderbolt ah the scythe which with a single stroke blindly cut down a whole springtide it be all so brutally sudden so utterly unexpected that at first the stupefaction of marianne and mathieu be greater than they despair in response to they cry the whole farm hasten up the fearful news fill the place and then all sink into the deep silence of death -- all work all life ceasing and the other child be there scare and overcome : little nicola who do not yet understand thing gregoire the page of the previous day louise madeleine and marguerite the three maid of honor and they elder claire and gervai who feel the blow more deeply and there be yet the other journey away blaise deni and ambroise travel to paris at that very moment in ignorance of the unforeseen frightful hatchet-stroke which have fall on the family where would the terrible tiding reach they in what cruel distress would they return and the doctor who would soon arrive too but all at once amid the terror and confusion there ring out the cry of frederic the poor dead girl 's affianced lover he shriek he despair aloud he be half mad he wish to kill himself say that he be the murderer and that he ought to have prevent rise from so rashly ride home through the storm he have to be lead away and watch for fear of some fresh misfortune he sudden frenzy have go to every heart sob burst forth and lamentation arise from the woful parent from the brother the sister from the whole of stricken chantebled which death thus visit for the first time ah god rise on that bed of mourning white cold and dead she the fairest the gayest the most love she before whom all the other be ever in admiration -- she of whom they be so proud so fond and to think that this blow should fall in the midst of hope bright hope in long life and sterling happiness but ten day before she wedding and on the morrow of that day of wild gayety all jest and laughter they could again see she full of life and so adorable with she happy youthful fancy -- that princely reception and that royal procession it have seem as if those two come wedding celebrate the same day would be like the supreme florescence of the family 's long happiness and prosperity doubtless they have often experienced trouble and have even weep at time but they have draw closer together and console one another on such occasion none have ever be cut off from the good-night embrace which heal every sore and now the best be go death have come to say that absolute joy exist for none that the most valiant the happiest never reap the fulness of they hope there be no life without death and they pay they share of the debt of human wretchedness pay it the more dearly since they have make for themselves a larger sum of life when everything germinate and grow around one when one have determine on unreserved fruitfulness on continuous creation and increase how awful be the recall to the ever-present dim abyss in which the world be fashion on the day when misfortune fall dig its first pit and carry off a loved one it be like a sudden snap a rending of the hope which seem to be endless and a feeling of stupefaction come at the discovery that one can not live and love forever ah how terrible be the two day that follow : the farm itself lifeless without sound save that of the breathing of the cattle the whole family gather together overcome by the cruel spell of wait ever in tear while the poor corpse remain there under a harvest of flower and there be this cruel aggravation that on the eve of the funeral when the body have be lay in the coffin it be bring down into that gallery where they have lunch so merrily while discuss how magnificently they might decorate it for the two wedding it be there that the last funeral watch the last wake take place and there be no evergreen shrub no garland of foliage merely four taper which burn there amid a wealth of white rose gather in the morning but already fading neither the mother nor the father be willing to go to bed that night they remain side by side near the child whom mother-earth be take back from they they could see she quite little again but sixteen month old at the time of they first sojourn at chanteble in the old tumbledown shooting-box when she have just be wean and they be wont to go and cover she up at nighttime they see she also later on in paris hasten to they in the morning climb up and pull they bed to piece with triumphant laughter and they see she yet more clearly grow and become more beautiful even as chantebled do as if indeed she herself bloom with all the health and beauty of that now fruitful land yet she be no more and whenever the thought return to they that they would never see she again they hand seek one another meet in a woful clasp while from they crushed and mingling heart it seem as if all life all future be flow away to nihility now that a breach have be make would not every other happiness be carry off in turn and though the ten other child be there from the little one five year old to the twin who be four-and-twenty all clothe in black all gather in tear around they sleep sister like a sorrow-stricken battalion render funeral honor neither the father nor the mother see or count they : they heart be rent by the loss of the daughter who have depart carry away with she some of they own flesh and in that long bare gallery which the four candle scarcely light the dawn at last arise upon that death watch that last leave-taking then grief again come with the funeral procession which spread out along the white road between the lofty poplar and the green corn that road over which rise have gallop so madly through the storm all the relation of the froment all they friend all the district have come to pay a tribute of emotion at so sudden and swift a death thus this time the cortege do stretch far away behind the hearse drape with white and bloom with white rose in the bright sunshine the whole family be present the mother and the sister have declare that they would only quit they loved one when she have be lower into she last resting-place and after the family come the friend the beauchene the seguin and other but mathieu and marianne worn out overcome by suffer no longer recognize people amid they tear they only remember on the morrow that they must have see morange if indeed it be really morange -- that silent unobtrusive almost shadowy gentleman who have weep while press they hand and in like fashion mathieu fancy that in some horrible dream he have see constance 's spare figure and bony profile drawing near to he in the cemetery after the coffin have be lower into the grave and address vague word of consolation to he though he fancy that she eye flash the while as if with abominable exultation what be it that she have say he no longer know of course she word must have be appropriate even as she demeanor be that of a mourning relative but a memory return to he that of other word which she have speak when promise to attend the two wedding she have then in bitter fashion express a wish that the good fortune of chantebled might continue but they the froment so fruitful and so prosperous be now stricken in they turn and they good fortune have perhaps depart forever mathieu shudder he faith in the future be shake he be haunt by a fear of see prosperity and fruitfulness vanish now that there be that open breach xvii a year later the first child bear to ambroise and andree a boy little leonce be christen the young people have be marry very quietly six week after the death of rose and that christen be to be the first outing for mathieu and marianne who have not yet fully recover from the terrible shock of they eldest daughter 's death moreover it be arrange that after the ceremony there should simply be a lunch at the parent ' home and that one and all should afterwards be free to return to he or she avocation it be impossible for the whole family to come and indeed apart from the grandfather and grandmother only the twin deni and blaise and the latter 's wife charlotte be expect together with the godparent beauchene the godfather have select madame seguin as he _ commere _ for since the death of maurice constance shudder at the bare thought of touch a child at the same time she have promise to be present at the lunch and thus there would be ten of they sufficient to fill the little dining-room of the modest flat in the rue de la boetie where the young couple reside pend fortune 's arrival it be a very pleasant morning although mathieu and marianne have be unwilling to set aside they black garment even for this rejoice they end by evince some gentle gayety before the cradle of that little grandson whose advent bring they a renewal of hope early in the winter a fresh bereavement have fall on the family blaise have lose he little christophe then two and a half year old through a attack of croup charlotte however be already at that time again _ enceinte _ and thus the grief of the first day have turn to expectancy fraught with emotion the little flat in the rue de la boetie seem very bright and fragrant it be perfumed by the fair grace of andree and illumine by the victorious charm of ambroise that handsome loving couple who arm in arm have set out so bravely to conquer the world during the lunch too there be the formidable appetite and jovial laughter of beauchene who give the greatest attention to he _ commere _ valentine jesting and pay she the most extravagant court which afford she much amusement prone as she still be to play a girlish part though she be already forty-five and a grandmother like marianne constance alone remain grave scarce condescend to bend she thin lip into a faint smile while a shadow of deep pain pass over she withered face every time that she glance round that gay table whence new strength base on the invincible future arise in spite of all the recent mourning at about three o'clock blaise rise from the table refuse to allow beauchene to take any more chartreuse it be true he be right my child beauchene end by exclaim in a docile way we be very comfortable here but it be absolutely necessary that we should return to the work and we must deprive you of deni for we need he help over a big building affair that be how we be we other we do not shirk duty constance have also rise the carriage must be wait say she will you take it no no we will go on foot a walk will clear we head the sky be overcast and as it grow darker and darker ambroise go to the window exclaim : you will get wet oh the rain have be threaten ever since this morning but we shall have time to get to the work it be then understand that constance should take charlotte with she in the brougham and set she down at the door of the little pavilion adjoining the factory as for valentine she be in no hurry and could quietly return to the avenue d'antin which be close by as soon as the sky might clear and with regard to marianne and mathieu they have just yield to andree 's affectionate entreaty and have arrange to spend the whole day and dine there return to chanteble by the last train thus the fete would be complete and the young couple be enrapture at the prospect the departure of the other be enliven by a curious incident a mistake which constance make and which seem very comical amid all the mirth promote by the copious lunch she have turn towards deni and look at he with she pale eye she quietly ask he blaise my friend will you give I my boa i must have leave it in the ante-room everybody begin to laugh but she fail to understand the reason and it be in the same tranquil way as before that she thank deni when he bring she the boa : i be oblige to you blaise you be very amiable thereupon come a explosion the other almost choke with laughter so droll do she quiet assurance seem to they what be the matter then why do they all laugh at she in that fashion she end by suspect that she have make a mistake and look more attentively at the twin ah yes it be not blaise but deni but it can not be help i be always mistake they since they have wear they beard trim in the same fashion thereupon marianne in she obliging way in order to take any sting away from the laughter repeat the well-known family story of how she herself when the twin be child and sleep together have be wont to awake they in order to identify they by the different color of they eye the other beauchene and valentine then intervene and recall circumstance under which they also have mistake the twin one for the other so perfect be they resemblance on certain occasion in certain light and it be amid all this gay animation that the company separate after exchange all sort of embrace and handshake once in the brougham constance speak but seldom to charlotte take as a pretext a violent headache which the prolonged lunch have increase with a weary air and she eye half close she begin to reflect after rose 's death and when little christophe likewise have be carry off a revival of hope have come to she for all at once she have feel quite young again but when she consult boutan on the matter he deal she a final blow by inform she that she hope be quite illusive thus for two month now she rage and despair have be increase that very morning at that christen and now in that carriage beside that young woman who be again expect to become a mother it be this which poison she mind fill she with jealousy and spite and render she capable of any evil deed the loss of she son the childlessness to which she be condemn all throw she into a state of morbid perversity fraught with dream of some monstrous vengeance which she dare not even confess to herself she accuse the whole world of be in league to crush she she husband be the most cowardly and idiotic of traitor for he betray she by let some fresh part of the work pass day by day into the hand of that fellow blaise whose wife no sooner lose a child than she have another she constance be enraged also at see she husband so gay and happy since she have leave he to he own base course he still retain he air of victorious superiority declare that he have remain unchanged and there be truth in this for though instead of be a active master as formerly he now too often show himself a senile prowler on the high road to paralysis he yet continue to be a practical egotist one who draw from life the greatest sum of enjoyment possible he be follow he destine road and if he take to blaise it be simply because he be delighted to have find a intelligent hard-working young man who spare he all the care and worry that be too heavy for he weary shoulder while still earn for he the money which he need for he pleasure constance know that something in the way of a partnership arrangement be about to be conclude indeed she husband must have already receive a large sum to enable he to make good certain loss and expense which he have hide from she and close she eye as the brougham roll along she poison she mind by ruminate all these thing scarce able to refrain from vent she fury by throw herself upon that young woman charlotte well-loved and fruitful spouse who sit beside she then the thought of deni occur to she why be he be take to the work do he also mean to rob she yet she know that he have refuse to join he brother as in he opinion there be not room for two at the establishment of the boulevard de grenelle indeed deni 's ambition be to direct some huge work by himself he possess a extensive knowledge of mechanic and this it be that render he a valuable adviser whenever a new model of some important agricultural machine have to be prepare at the beauchene factory constance promptly dismiss he from she thought in she estimation there be no reason to fear he he be a mere passer-by who on the morrow perhaps would establish himself at the other end of france then once more the thought of blaise come back to she imperative all-absorbing and it suddenly occur to she that if she make haste home she would be able to see morange alone in he office and ascertain many thing from he before the other arrive it be evident that the accountant must know something of the partnership scheme even if it be as yet only in a preliminary stage thereupon she become impassioned eager to arrive certain as she feel of obtain confidential information from morange whom she deem to be devote to she as the carriage roll over the jena bridge she open she eye and look out _ mon dieu _ say she what a time this brougham take if the rain would only fall it would perhaps relieve my head a little she be think however that a sharp shower would give she more time as it would compel the three man beauchene deni and blaise to seek shelter in some doorway and when the carriage reach the work she hastily stop the coachman without even conduct she companion to the little pavilion you will excuse I will not you my dear say she you only have to turn the street corner when they have both alight charlotte smile and affectionate take hold of constance 's hand and retain it for a few moment in she own of course she reply and many thanks you be too kind when you see my husband pray tell he that you leave I safe for he grow anxious at the slightest thing thereupon constance in she turn have to smile and promise with many profession of friendship that she would duly execute the commission then they part au revoir till to-morrow -- yes yes till to-morrow au revoir eighteen year have now already elapse since morange have lose he wife valerie and nine have go by since the death of he daughter reine yet it always seem as if he be on the morrow of those disaster for he have retain he black garb and still lead a cloister-like retired life give utterance only to such word as be indispensable on the other hand he have again become a good model clerk a correct painstaking accountant very punctual in he habit and root as it be to the office chair in which he have take he seat every morning for thirty year past the truth be that he wife and he daughter have carry off with they all he will-power all he ambitious thought all that he have momentarily dream of win for they sake -- a large fortune and a luxurious triumphant life he who be now so much alone who have relapse into childish timidity and weakness seek nothing beyond he humble daily task and be content to die in the shady corner to which he be accustom it be suspect however that he lead a mysterious maniacal life tinge with anxious jealousy at home in that flat of the boulevard de grenelle which he have so obstinately refuse to quit he servant have order to admit nobody and she herself know nothing if he give she free admittance to the dining - and drawing-room he do not allow she to set foot in he own bedroom formerly share by valerie nor in that which reine have occupy he himself alone enter these chamber which he regard as sanctuary of which he be the sole priest under pretence of sweeping or dust he would shut himself up in one or the other of they for hour at a time it be in vain that the servant try to glance inside in vain that she listen at the door when he spend he holiday at home she see nothing and hear nothing nobody could have tell what relic those chapel contain nor with what religious cult he honor they another cause of surprise be he niggardly avaricious life which as time go on have become more and more pronounced in such wise that he only expense be he rental of sixteen hundred franc the wages he pay to he servant and the few penny per day which she with difficulty extract from he to defray the cost of food and housekeeping he salary have now rise to eight thousand franc a year and he certainly do not spend half of it what become then of he big savings the money which he refuse to devote to enjoyment in what secret hole and for what purpose what secret passion do he conceal it nobody could tell but amid it all he remain very gentle and unlike most miser continue very cleanly in he habit keep he beard which be now white as snow very carefully tend and he come to he office every morning with a little smile on he face in such wise that nothing in this man of regular methodical life reveal the collapse within he all the ash and smolder fire which disaster have leave in he heart by degree a link of some intimacy have be form between constance and morange when after he daughter 's death she have see he return to the work quite a wreck she have be stir by deep pity with which some covert personal anxiety confusedly mingle maurice be destine to live five year longer but she be already haunt by apprehension and could never meet morange without experience a chill shudder for he as she repeat to herself have lose he only child ah god so such a catastrophe be possible then on be stricken herself on experience the horrible distress on smart from the sudden gaping incurable wound of she bereavement she have draw nearer to that brother in misfortune treat he with a kindness which she show to none other at time she would invite he to spend a evening with she and the pair of they would chat together or more often remain silent face to face share each other 's woe later on she have profit by this intimacy to obtain information from morange respect affair at the factory of which she husband avoid speak it be more particularly since she have suspect the latter of bad management blunder and debt that she endeavor to turn the accountant into a confidant even a spy who might aid she to secure as much control of the business as possible and this be why she be so anxious to return to the factory that day and profit by the opportunity to see morange privately persuade as she be that she would induce he to speak out in the absence of he superior she scarcely tarry to take off she glove and she bonnet she find the accountant in he little office seat in he wonted place and lean over the everlasting ledger which be open before he why be the christen finish he exclaim in astonishment forthwith she explain she presence in such a way as to enable she to speak of what she have at heart why yes that be to say i come away because i have such a dreadful headache the other have remain yonder and as we be alone here together it occur to I that it might do I good to have a chat with you you know how highly i esteem you ah i be not happy not happy at all she have sink upon a chair overcome by the tear which she have be restrain so long in the presence of the happiness of other quite upset at see she in this condition have little strength himself morange wish to summon she maid he almost fear that she might have a faint fit but she prevent he i have only you leave I my friend say she everybody else forsake I everybody be against I i can feel it i be be ruin folk be bent on annihilate I as if i have not already lose everything when i lose my child and since you alone remain to I you who know my torment you who have no daughter leave you pray for heaven 's sake help I and tell I the truth in that wise i shall at least be able to defend myself on hear she speak of he daughter morange also have begin to weep and now therefore she might question he it be certain that he would answer and tell she everything overpower as he be by the common grief which she have evoke thus he inform she that a agreement be indeed on the point of be sign by blaise and beauchene only it be not precisely a deed of partnership beauchene have draw large sum from the strong-box of the establishment for expense which he could not confess -- a horrible story of blackmail so it be rumor -- have be oblige to make a confidant of blaise the trusty and active lieutenant who manage the establishment and he have even ask he to find somebody willing to lend he some money thereupon the young man have offer it himself but doubtless it be he father mathieu froment who advance the cash well pleased to invest it in the work in he son 's name and now with the view of put everything in order it have be resolve that the property should be divide into six part and that one of these part or share should be attribute to blaise as reimbursement for the loan thus the young fellow would possess a interest of one sixth in the establishment unless indeed beauchene should buy he out again within a stipulate period the danger be that instead of free himself in this fashion beauchene might yield to the temptation of sell the other part one by one now that he be glide down a path of folly and extravagance constance listen to morange quiver and quite pale be this sign she ask no not yet but the papers be ready and will be sign shortly moreover it be a reasonable and necessary solution of the difficulty she be evidently of another opinion a feeling of revolt possess she and she strive to think of some decisive means of prevent the ruin and shame which in she opinion threaten she my god what be i to do how can i act she gasp and then in she rage at find no device at be powerless this cry escape she : ah that scoundrel blaise worthy morange be quite move by it still he have not fully understand and so in he quiet way he endeavor to calm constance explain that blaise have a very good heart and that in the circumstance in question he have behave in the best way possible do all that he could to stifle scandal and even display great disinterestedness and as constance have rise satisfied with know the truth and anxious that the three man might not find she there on they arrival the accountant likewise quit he chair and accompany she along the gallery which she have to follow in order to return to she house i give you my word of honor madame say morange that the young man have make no base calculation in the matter all the papers pass through my hand and nobody could know more than i know myself besides if i have entertain the slightest doubt of any machination i should have endeavor to requite you kindness by warn you she no longer listen to he however in fact she be anxious to get rid of he for all at once the long-threatening rain have begin to fall violently lash the glass roof so dark a mass of cloud have overspread the sky that it be almost night in the gallery though four o'clock have scarcely strike and it occur to constance that in presence of such a deluge the three man would certainly take a cab so she hasten she step still follow however by the accountant for instance he continue when it be a question of draw up the agreement -- but he suddenly pause give vent to a hoarse exclamation and stop she pull she back as if in terror take care he gasp there be a great cavity before they here at the end of the gallery before reach the corridor which communicate with the private house there be a steam lift of great power which be principally use for lower heavy article to the packing room it only work as a rule on certain day on all other the huge trap remain close when the appliance be work a watchman be always station there to superintend the operation take care take care morange repeat shudder with terror the trap be open and the huge cavity gape before they there be no barrier nothing to warn they and prevent they from make a fearful plunge the rain still pelt on the glass roof and the darkness have become so complete in the gallery that they have walk on without see anything before they another step would have hurl they to destruction it be little short of miraculous that the accountant should have become anxious in presence of the increase gloom in that corner where he have divine rather than perceive the abyss constance however still fail to understand she companion seek to free herself from he wild grasp but look he cry and he bent forward and compel she also to stoop over the cavity it descend through three floor to the very lowest basement like a well of darkness a damp odor arise : one could scarce distinguish the vague outline of thick ironwork alone right at the bottom burnt a lantern a distant speck of light as if the better to indicate the depth and horror of the gulf morange and constance draw back again blanch and now morange burst into a temper it be idiotic he exclaim why do not they obey the regulation as a rule there be a man here a man expressly tell off for this duty who ought not to stir from he post so long as the trap have not come up again where be he what on earth can the rascal be up to the accountant again approach the hole and shout down it in a fury : bonnard no reply come : the pit remain bottomless black and void bonnard bonnard and still nothing be hear not a sound the damp breath of the darkness alone ascend as from the deep silence of the tomb thereupon morange resort to action i must go down i must find bonnard can you picture we fall through that hole to the very bottom no no this can not be allow either he must close this trap or return to he post what can he be do where can he be morange have already betaken himself to a little wind staircase by which one reach every floor beside the lift when in a voice which gradually grow more indistinct he again call : i beg you madame pray wait for I remain there to warn anybody who might pass constance be alone the dull rattle of the rain on the glass above she continued but a little livid light be appear as a gust of wind carry off the cloud and in that pale light blaise suddenly appear at the end of the gallery he have just return to the factory with deni and beauchene and have leave he companion together for a moment in order to go to the workshop to procure some information they require preoccupy absorb once more in he work he come along with a easy step he head somewhat bent and when constance see he thus appear all that she feel in she heart be the smart of rancor a renewal of she anger at what she have learn of that agreement which be to be sign on the morrow and which would despoil she that enemy who be in she home and work against she a revolt of she whole be urge she to exterminate he and thrust he out like some usurper all craft and falsehood he draw nearer she be in the dense shadow near the wall so that he could not see she but on she side as he softly approach steep in a grayish light she could see he with singular distinctness never before have she so plainly divine the power of he lofty brow the intelligence of he eye the firm will of he mouth and all at once she be strike with fulgural certainty he be come towards the cavity without see it and he would assuredly plunge into the depths unless she should stop he as he pass but a little while before she like himself have come from yonder and would have fall unless a friendly hand have restrain she and the frightful shudder of that moment yet palpitate in she vein she could still and ever see the damp black pit with the little lantern far below the whole horror of it flash before she eye -- the ground fail one the sudden drop with a great shriek and the smash a moment afterwards blaise draw yet nearer but certainly such a thing be impossible she would prevent it since a little motion of she hand would suffice would she not always have time to stretch out she arm when he be there before she and yet from the recess of she be a very clear and frigid voice seem to ascend articulate brief word which ring in she ear as if repeat by a trumpet blast if he should die it would be all over the factory would never belong to he she who have bitterly lament that she could devise no obstacle have merely to let this helpful chance take its own course and this indeed be what the voice say what it repeat with keen insistence never add another syllable after that there would be nothing after that there would merely remain the shattered remnant of a suppress man and a pit of darkness splash with blood in which she discern foresaw nothing more what would happen on the morrow she do not wish to know indeed there would be no morrow it be solely the brutal immediate fact which the imperious voice demand he dead it would be all over he would never possess the work he draw nearer still and within she now there rage a frightful battle how long do it last -- day year doubtless but a few seconds she be still resolve that she would stop he as he pass certain as she feel that she would conquer she horrible thought when the moment come for the decisive gesture and yet those thought invade she become materialize within she like some physical craving thirst or hunger she hunger for that finish hunger to the point of suffer seize by one of those sudden desperate longing which beget crime such as when a passer-by be despoil and throttle at the corner of a street it seem to she that if she could not satisfy she craving she herself must lose she life a consuming passion a mad desire for that man 's annihilation fill she as she see he approach she could now see he still more plainly and the sight of he exasperate she he forehead he eye he lip tortured she like some hateful spectacle another step yet one more then another and he would be before she yes yet another step and she be already stretch out she hand in readiness to stop he as soon as he should brush past he come along what be it that happen o god when he be there so absorb in he thought that he brush against she without feel she she turn to stone she hand become icy cold she could not lift it it hang too heavily from she arm and amid she scorching fever a great cold shudder come upon she immobilizing and stupefy she while she be deafen by the clamorous voice rise from the depths of she be all demur be sweep away the craving for that death remain intense invincible beneath the imperious stubborn call of the inner voice which rob she of the power of will and action he would be dead and he would never possess the work and therefore stand stiff and breathless against the wall she do not stop he she could hear he light breathing she could discern he profile then the nape of he neck he have pass another step another step and yet if she have raise a call she might still have change the course of destiny even at that last moment she fancy that she have some such intention but she be clench she tooth tightly enough to break they and he blaise take yet a further step still advance quietly and confidently over that friendly ground without even a glance before he absorb as he be in thought of he work and the ground fail he and there be a loud terrible cry a sudden gust follow the fall and a dull crash down below in the depths of the black darkness constance do not stir for a moment she remain as if petrified still listen still wait but only deep silence arise from the abyss she could merely hear the rain pelt on the glass roof with renew rage and thereupon she flee turn into the passage re-enter she drawing-room there she collect and question herself have she desire that abominable thing no she will have have nought to do with it most certainly it have be paralyzed prevent from act if it have be possible for the thing to occur it have occur quite apart from she for assuredly she have be absent absent that word reassure she yes indeed that be the case she have be absent all she past life spread out behind she faultless pure of any evil action never have she sin never until that day have any consciousness of guilt weigh upon she conscience a honest and virtuous woman she have remain upright amidst all the excess of she husband a impassioned mother she have be ascend she calvary ever since she son 's death and this recollection of maurice alone draw she for a moment from she callousness choke she with a rise sob as if in that direction lay she madness the vainly seek explanation of the crime vertigo again fall upon she the thought of she dead son and of the other be master in he place all she perverted passion for that only son of hers the despoil prince all she poison ferment rage which have unhinge and madden she even to the point of murder have that monstrous vegetation grow within she reach she brain then a rush of blood suffice at time to bedim a conscience but she obstinately cling to the view that she have be absent she force back she tear and remain frigid no remorse come to she it be do and 'twas good that it should be do it be necessary she have not push he he himself have fall have she not be there he would have fall just the same and so since she have not be there since both she brain and she heart have be absent it do not concern she and ever and ever resound the word which absolve she and chant she victory he be dead and would never possess the work erect in the middle of the drawing-room constance listen strain she ear why be it that she hear nothing how long they be in go down to pick he up anxiously wait for the tumult which she expect the clamor of horror which would assuredly rise from the work the heavy footstep the loud call she hold she breath quiver at the slightest faintest sound several minute still elapse and the cosey quietude of she drawing-room please she that room be like a asylum of bourgeois rectitude luxurious dignity in which she feel protected save some little object on which she eye light a pocket scent-bottle ornament with a opal a paper-knife of burnish silver leave inside a book fully reassure she she be move almost surprise at the sight of they as if they have acquire some new and particular meaning then she shiver slightly and perceive that she hand be icy cold she rub they together gently wish to warm they a little why be it too that she now feel so tired it seem to she as if she have just return from some long walk from some accident from some affray in which she have be bruise she feel within she also a tendency to somnolence the somnolence of satiety as if she have feast too copiously off some spicy dish after too great a hunger amid the fatigue which benumb she limb she desire nothing more apart from she sleepiness all that she feel be a kind of astonishment that thing should be as they be however she have again begin to listen repeat that if that frightful silence continue she would certainly sink upon a chair close she eye and sleep and at last it seem to she that she detect a faint sound scarcely a breath far away what be it no there be nothing yet perhaps she have dream that horrible scene perhaps it have all be a nightmare that man march on that black pit that loud cry of terror since she hear nothing perhaps nothing have really happen be it true a clamor would have ascend from below in a grow wave of sound and a distract rush up the staircase and along the passage would have bring she the news then again she detect the faint distant sound which seem to draw a little nearer it be not the tramp of a crowd it seem to be a mere footfall perhaps that of some pedestrian on the quay yet no it come from the work and now it be quite distinct it ascend step and then speed along a passage and the step become quicker and a panting could be hear so tragical that she at last divine that the horror be at hand all at once the door be violently fling open morange enter he be alone beside himself with livid face and scarce able to stammer he still breathe but he head be smash it be all over what ail you she ask what be the matter he look at she agape he have hasten upstairs at a run to ask she for a explanation for he have quite lose he poor head over that unaccountable catastrophe and the apparent ignorance and tranquillity in which he find constance complete he dismay but i leave you near the trap say he near the trap yes you go down and i immediately come up here but before i go down he resume with despairing violence i begged you to wait for I and keep a watch on the hole so that nobody might fall through it oh dear no you say nothing to I or at all event i hear nothing understand nothing of that kind in he terror he peer into she eye assuredly she be lie calm as she might appear he could detect she voice tremble besides it be evident she must still have be there since he have not even have time to get below before it happen and all at once he recall they conversation the question she have ask he and she cry of hatred against the unfortunate young fellow who have now be pick up cover with blood in the depths of that abyss beneath the gust of horror which chill he morange could only find these word : well madame poor blaise come just behind you and break he skull she demeanor be perfect she hand quiver as she raise they and it be in a halting voice that she exclaim : good lord good lord what a frightful misfortune but at that moment a uproar arise through the house the drawing-room door have remain open and the voice and footstep of a number of people draw nearer become each moment more distinct order be be give on the stair man be strain and draw breath there be all the sign of the approach of some cumbrous burden carry as gently as possible what be he be bring up here to I exclaim constance turn pale and she involuntary cry would have suffice to enlighten the accountant have he need it he be be bring to I here it be not morange who answer he be stupefy by the blow but beauchene abruptly appear precede the body and he likewise be livid and beside himself to such a degree do this sudden visit of death thrill he with fear in he need of happy life morange will have tell you of the frightful catastrophe my dear say he fortunately deni be there for the question of responsibility towards he family and it be denis too who just as we be about to carry the poor fellow home to the pavilion oppose it say that give he wife 's condition we should kill she if we carry he to she in this die state and so the only course be to bring he here be it not then he quit he wife with a gesture of bewilderment and return to the landing where one could hear he repeat in a quivering voice : gently gently take care of the baluster the lugubrious train enter the drawing-room blaise have be lay on a stretcher provide with a mattress deni as pale as linen follow support the pillow on which rest he brother 's head a little streamlet of blood course over the die man 's brow he eye be close and four factory hand hold the shaft of the stretcher they heavy shoe crush down the carpet and fragile article of furniture be thrust aside anyhow to open a passage for this invasion of horror and of fright amid he bewilderment a idea occur to beauchene who continue to direct the operation no no do not leave he there there be a bed in the next room we will take he up very gently with the mattress and lay he with it on the bed it be maurice 's room it be the bed in which maurice have die and which constance with maternal piety have keep unchanged consecrate the room to she son 's memory but what could she say how could she prevent blaise from die there in he turn kill by she the abomination of it all the vengeance of destiny which exact this sacrilege fill she with such a feeling of revolt that at the moment when vertigo be about to seize she and the flooring begin to flee from beneath she foot she be lash by it and keep erect and then she display extraordinary strength will and insolent courage when the stricken man pass before she she puny little frame stiffen and grow she look at he and she yellow face remain motionless save for a flutter of she eyelid and a involuntary nervous twinge on the left side of she mouth which force a slight grimace but that be all and again she become perfect both in word and gesture do and say what be necessary without lavishness but like one simply thunderstruck by the suddenness of the catastrophe however the order have be carry out in the bedroom and the bearer withdraw greatly upset down below directly the accident have be discover old moineaud have be tell to take a cab and hasten to dr boutan 's to bring he back with a surgeon if one could be find on the way all the same i prefer to have he here rather than in the basement beauchene repeat mechanically as he stand before the bed he still breathe there see it be quite apparent who know perhaps boutan may be able to pull he through after all deni however entertain no illusion he have take one of he brother 's cold yielding hand in he own and he could feel that it be again become a mere thing as if break wrench away from life in that great fall for a moment he remain motionless beside the death-bed with the mad hope they he might perhaps by he clasp infuse a little of the blood in he own heart into the vein of the die man be not that blood common to they both have not they twin brotherhood drunk life from the same source it be the other half of himself that be about to die down below after raise a loud cry of heartrending distress he have say nothing now all at once he speak one must go to ambroise 's to warn my mother and father since he still breathe perhaps they will arrive soon

news to mamma and nothing must be do as yet with regard to charlotte we will see about that by and by when i come back i only hope that death will have a little patience so that i may find my poor brother still alive he lean forward and kiss blaise who with he eye close remain motionless still breathe faintly then distractedly deni print another kiss upon he hand and hurry off constance meantime be busy herself call the maid and request she to bring some warm water in order that they might wash the sufferer 's blood-stained brow it be impossible to think of take off he jacket they have to content themselves with do the little they could to improve he appearance pend the arrival of the doctor and during these preparation beauchene haunt worry by the accident again begin to speak of it it be incomprehensible one can hardly believe such a stupid mischance to be possible down below the transmission gear get out of order and this prevent the mechanician from send the trap up again then up above bonnard get angry call and at last decide to go down in a fury when he find that nobody answer he then morange arrive fly into a temper and go down in he turn exasperate at receive no answer to he call for bonnard poor bonnard he be sob he want to kill himself when he see the fine result of he absence at this point beauchene abruptly break off and turn to constance but what about you he ask morange tell I that he have leave you up above near the trap she be stand in front of she husband in the full light which come through the window and again do she eyelid beat while a

he leg fail he have sink upon a chair incapable of render any help he sit there silent await the end when he hear constance lie in that quiet fashion he look at she the assassin be herself he no longer doubt it and at that moment he feel a craving to proclaim it to cry it aloud why he think that he have beg you to remain there on the watch beauchene resume address he wife at all event he word never reach I constance duly answer should i have move if he have ask I to do that and turn towards the accountant she in she turn have the courage to fix she pale eye upon he just remember morange

return could he accuse she of such a atrocious crime he picture the consequence and then too he no longer know if he be right or not he poor maniacal mind be lose it be possible he stammer i may simply have think i speak and it must be so since it can not be otherwise then he relapse into silence with a gesture of utter lassitude the complicity demand be accept for a moment he think of rise to see if blaise still breathe but he do not dare deep peacefulness fall upon the room ah how great be the anguish the torture in the cab when blaise bring mathieu and marianne back with he he have at first speak to they simply of a accident a rather serious fall but as the vehicle roll along he have lose he self-possession weep and confess the truth in response to they despair question thus when they at last reach the factory they doubt no longer they child be dead work have just be stop and they recall they visit to the place on the morrow of maurice 's death they be return to the same stillness the same grave-like silence all the rumble life have suddenly cease the machine be cold and mute the workshop darken and desert not a sound remain not a soul not a puff of that steam which be like the very breath of the place he who have watch over its work be dead and it be dead like he then they affright increase when they pass from the factory to the house amid that absolute solitude the gallery steep in slumber the staircase quiver all the door upstairs open as in some uninhabited place long since desert in the ante-room they find no servant and it be indeed in the same tragedy of sudden death that they again participate only this time it be they own son whom they be to find in the same room on the same bed frigid pale and lifeless blaise have just expire boutan be there at the head of the bed hold the inanimate hand in which the final pulsation of blood be die away and when he see mathieu and marianne who have instinctively cross the disorderly drawing-room rush into that bedchamber whose odor of nihility they recognize he could but murmur in a voice full of sob : my poor friend embrace he you will yet have a little of he last breath that breath have scarce cease and the unhappy mother the unhappy father have already spring forward kiss those lip that exhale the final quiver of life and sobbing and cry they distress aloud they blaise be dead like rise he have

from they on the morrow to pay in turn the ransom of they happiness mathieu and marianne long remain sob on they knee beside the bed constance stand a few pace away silent with a air of quiver desolation beauchene as if to combat that fear of death which make he shiver have a moment previously seat himself at the little writing-table formerly use by maurice which have be leave in the drawing-room like a souvenir and he then strive to draw up a notice to he workpeople to inform they that the factory would remain closed until the day after the funeral he be vainly seek word when he perceive deni come out of the bedroom where he have weep all he tear and set he whole heart in the last kiss which he have bestow on he depart brother beauchene call he as if desirous of divert he

she recoil with fright on see deni seat there and write have not blaise resuscitate even as she have mistake the twin one for the other that very afternoon on rise from the gay baptismal lunch so now again she see blaise in deni the pair of they so similar physically that in former time they parent have only be able to distinguish they by the different color of they eye and thus it be as if blaise return and resume he place blaise who would possess the work although she have kill he she have make a mistake dead as he be he would nevertheless have the work she have kill one of those froment but behold another be bear when one die he brother fill up the breach and she crime then appear to she such a useless one such a stupid one that she be aghast at it the hair on the nape of she neck stand

soldier of life another be always ready to take the vacant post of combat but a last defeat await she mathieu and marianne reappear while morange seize with a need of motion come and go with a air of stupefaction quite lose he wit amid he dreadful suffering those awful thing which could but unhinge he narrow mind i be go down stammer marianne try to wipe away she tear and to remain erect i wish to see charlotte and prepare and tell she of the misfortune i alone can find the word to say so that she may not die of the shock circumstance as she be but mathieu full of anxiety seek to detain he wife

child 's head indeed all the member of the family in they childish day she have take they likeness from old photograph and she sketch of the oak tree be to serve as a background for the portrait of the two youngest scion of the house -- little benjamin and little guillaume mathieu and marianne be delighted with that fleet procession of little face all white and pink which they perfectly recognize as they see they pass before they eye there be the twin nestle in they cradle lock in one another 's arm there be rise the dear lose one in she little shift there be ambroise and gervai bare and wrestling on a patch of grass there be gregoire and nicola birdnesting there be claire and the three other girl louise madeleine and marguerite romp about the farm quarrel with the fowl spring upon the horse ' back but what particularly touch marianne be the sketch of she last-born little benjamin now nine month old whom charlotte have depict recline under the oak tree in the same little carriage as she own son guillaume who be virtually of the same age have be bear but eight day later the uncle and the nephew say mathieu jestingly all the same the uncle be the elder by a week as marianne stand there smile soft tear come into she eye and the sketch shake in she happy hand the dear say she my son and grandson with those dear little one i be once again a mother and a grandmother ah yes those two be the supreme consolation they have help to heal the wound it be they who have bring we back hope and courage this be true how overwhelming have be the mourning and sadness of the early day when charlotte flee the factory have seek refuge at the farm the tragedy by which blaise have be carry off have nearly kill she she first solace be to see that she daughter berthe who have be rather sickly in paris regain bright rosy cheek amid the open air of chantebled moreover she have settle she life : she would spend she remain year in that hospitable house devote herself to she two child and happy in have so affectionate a grandmother and grandfather to help and sustain she she have always show herself to be somewhat apart from life possess of a dreamy nature only ask to love and to be love in return so by degree she settle down once more install beside she grandparent in the old pavilion which mathieu fit up for the three of they and wish to occupy herself irrespective of she income from the factory she even set to work again and paint miniature which a dealer in paris readily purchase but she grief be mostly heal by she little guillaume that child bequeath to she by she dead husband in whom he resuscitate and it be much the same with marianne since the birth of benjamin a new son have replace the one she have lose and help to fill the void in she heart the two woman the two mother find infinite solace in nursing those babe for they they forget themselves they rear they together watch they grow side by side they give they the breast at the same hour and it be they desire to see they both become very strong very handsome and very good although one mother be almost twice as old as the other they become as it be sister the same nourishing milk flow from both they fruitful bosom and gleam of light penetrate they mourning : they begin to laugh when they see those little cherub laugh and nothing could have be gayer than the sight of that mother-in-law and that daughter-in-law side by side almost mingle have but one cradle between they amid a unceasing florescence of maternity be careful mathieu suddenly say to charlotte hide you drawing here be gervai and claire come about the table gervai at nineteen year of age be quite a colossus the tallest and the strongest of the family with short curly black hair large bright eye and a full broad-featured face he have remain he father 's favorite son the son of the fertile earth the one in whom mathieu foster a love for the estate a passion for skilful agriculture in order that later on the young man might continue the good work which have be begin mathieu already disburden himself on gervai of a part of he duty and be only wait to see he marry to give he the control of the whole farm and he often think of adjoining to he claire when she find a husband in some worthy sturdy fellow who would assume part of the labor two man agree well would be none too many for a enterprise which be increase in importance every day since marianne have again be nurse claire have be attend to she work though she have no beauty she be of vigorous health and quite strong for she seventeen year she busy herself more particularly with cookery and household affair but she also keep the account be shrewd-witted and very economically incline on which account the prodigal of the family often make fun of she and so it be here that the table be to be set say gervai i shall have to see that the lawn be mow then on she side claire inquire what number of people there would be at table and how she have better place they then gervai have call to frederic to bring a scythe the three of they go on discuss the arrangement after rose 's death frederic she betrothed have continue work beside gervai become he most active and intelligent comrade and helper for some month too marianne and mathieu have notice that he be revolve around claire as though since he have lose the elder girl he be willing to content himself with the younger one who be far less beautiful no doubt but withal a good and sturdy housewife this have at first sadden the parent be it possible to forget they dear daughter then however they feel move for the thought come to they that the family tie would be draw yet closer that the young fellow 's heart would not roam in search of love elsewhere but would remain with they so close they eye to what go on they smile for in frederic when claire should be old enough to marry gervai would find the brother-in-law and partner that he need the question of the table have just be settle when a sudden invasion burst through the tall grass around the oak tree skirt fly about and loose hair wave in the sunshine oh cry louise there be no rose no repeated madeleine not a single white rose and add marguerite we have inspect all the bush there be no white rose only red one thirteen eleven and nine such be they respective age louise plump and gay already look a little woman madeleine slim and pretty spend hour at she piano she eye full of dreaminess marguerite whose nose be rather too large and whose lip be thick have beautiful golden hair she would pick up little bird at winter time and warm they with she hand and the three of they after scour the back garden where flower mingle with vegetable have now rush up in despair at they vain search no white rose for a wedding that be the end of everything what could they offer to the bride and what could they set upon the table behind the three girl however appear gregoire with jeer mien and he hand in he pocket at fifteen he be very malicious the most turbulent worry member of the family a lad incline to the most diabolical device he pointed nose and he thin lip denote also he adventurous spirit he will power and he skill in effect he object and apparently much amuse by he sister ' disappointment he forget himself and exclaim by way of tease they : why i know where there be some white rose and fine one too where be that ask mathieu why at the mill near the wheel in the little enclosure there be three big bush which be quite white with rose as big as cabbage then he flush and become confuse for he father be eye he severely what do you still prowl round the mill say mathieu i have forbid you to do so as you know that there be white rose in the enclosure you must have go in eh no i look over the wall you climb up the wall that be the finish touch so you want to land I in trouble with those lepailleur who be decidedly very foolish and very malicious people there be really a devil in you my boy that which gregoire leave unsaid be that he repair to the enclosure in order that he might there join therese the miller 's fair-haired daughter with the droll laughing face who be also a terribly adventurous damsel for she thirteen year true they meeting be but childish play but at the end of the enclosure under the apple tree there be a delightful nook where one could laugh and chat and amuse oneself at one 's ease well just listen to I mathieu resume i will not have you go to play with therese again she be a pretty little girl no doubt but that house be not a place for you to go to it seem that they fight one another there now this be a fact when that young scamp antonin have recover he health he have be torment by a longing to return to pari and have do all he could with that object in view of resume a life of idleness and dissipation lepailleur greatly irritated at have be dupe by he son have at first violently oppose he plan but what could he do in the country with that idle fellow whom he himself have teach to hate the earth and to sneer at the old rot mill besides he now have he wife against he she be ever admire she son 's learning and so stubborn be she faith in he that she be convince that he would this time secure a good position in the capital thus the father have be oblige to give way and antonin be now finally wreck he life while fill some petty employment at a merchant 's in the rue du mail but on the other hand the quarrel increase in the home particularly whenever lepailleur suspect he wife of rob he in order to send money to that big lazybone they son from the bridge over the yeuse on certain day one could hear oath and blow fly about and here again be family life destroy strength waste and happiness spoilt carry off by perfect anger mathieu continue : to think of it people who have everything needful to be happy how can one be so stupid how can one seek wretchedness for oneself with such obstinacy as for that idea of theirs of a only son and they vanity in want to make a gentleman of he ah well they have succeed finely they must be extremely pleased to-day it be just like lepailleur 's hatred of the earth he old-fashioned system of cultivation he obstinacy in leave he bit of moorland barren and refuse to sell it to I no doubt by way of protest against we success can you imagine anything so stupid and it be just like he mill all folly and idleness he stand still look at it fall into ruin he at least have a reason for that in former time he use to say that as the region have almost renounce corn-growing the peasant do not bring he enough grain to set he mill-stone work but nowadays when thanks to we corn overflow on all side surely he ought to have pull down he old wheel and have replace it by a good engine ah if i be in he place i would already have a new and bigger mill there make all use of the water of the yeuse and connect it with janville railway station by a line of rail which would not cost so much to lay down gregoire stand listen well pleased that the storm should fall on another than himself and marianne see that she three daughter be still greatly grieve at have no white rose console they say : well for the table to-morrow morning you must gather those which be the lightest in color -- the pale pink one they will do very well thereupon mathieu calming down make the child laugh by add gayly : gather the red one too the reddest you find they will symbolize the blood of life marianne and charlotte be still linger there talk of all the preparation when other little foot come trip through the grass nicola quite proud of he seven year be lead he niece berthe a big girl of six they agree very well together that day they have remain indoors play at father and mother near the cradle occupy by benjamin and guillaume whom they call they baby but all at once the infant have awake clamor for nourishment and nicola and berthe quite alarmed have thereupon run off to fetch the two mother mamma call nicolas benjamin 's ask for you he be thirsty mamma mamma repeat berthe guillaume 's thirsty come quick he be in a hurry marianne and charlotte laugh true enough the morrow 's wedding have make they forget they pet and so they hastily return to the house on the follow day those happy nuptials be celebrate in affectionate intimacy there be but one-and-twenty at table under the oak tree in the middle of the lawn which gird with elm and hornbeam seem like a hall of verdure the whole family be present : first those of the farm then deni the bridegroom next ambroise and he wife andree who have bring they little leonce with they and apart from the family proper there be only the few invite relative beauchene and constance seguin and valentine with of course madame desvignes the bride 's mother there be twenty-one at table as have be say but besides those one-and-twenty there be three very little one present : leonce who at fifteen month have just be wean and benjamin and guillaume who still take the breast they little carriage have be draw up near so that they also belong to the party which be thus a round two dozen and the table flowery with rose send forth a delightful perfume under the rain of summer sunbeam which fleck it with gold athwart the cool shady foliage from one horizon to the other stretch the wondrous tent of azure of the triumphant July sky and marthe 's white bridal gown and the bright dress of the girl big and little all those gay frock and all that fine youthful health seem like the very florescence of that green nook of happiness they lunch joyously and end by clink glass in country fashion while wish all sort of prosperity to the bridal pair and to everybody present then while the servant be remove the cloth seguin who affect a interest in horse-breeding and cattle-raising wish mathieu to show he he stable he have talk nothing but horseflesh during the meal and be particularly desirous of see some big farm-horse whose great strength have be praise by he host he persuade beauchene to join he in the inspection and the three man be start when constance and valentine somewhat inquisitive with respect to that farm the great growth of which still fill they with stupefaction decide to follow leave the rest of the family install under the tree amid the smile peacefulness of that fine afternoon the cow-house and stable be on the right hand but in order to reach they one have to cross the great yard whence the entire estate could be see and here there be a halt a sudden stop inspire by admiration so grandly do the work accomplish show forth under the sun they have know that land dry and sterile cover with mere scrub they behold it now one sea of wave corn of crop whose growth increase at each successive season up yonder on the old marshy plateau the fertility be such thanks to the humus amass during long century that mathieu do not even manure the ground as yet then to right and to leave the former sandy slope spread out all greenery fertilize by the spring which ever bring they increase of fruitfulness and the very wood afar off skilfully arrange air by broad clearing seem to possess more sap as if all the surround growth of life have instil additional vigor into they with this vigor this power indeed the whole domain be instinct it be creation man 's labor fertilize sterile soil and draw from it a wealth of nourishment for expand humanity the conqueror of the world there be a long spell of silence at last seguin in he dry shrill voice with a tinge of bitterness bear of he own ruin remark : you have do a good stroke of business i should never have believe it possible then they walk on again but in the shed the cow-house the sheep-cote and all round the sensation of strength and power yet increase creation be there continue the cattle the sheep the fowl the rabbit all that dwelt and swarm there be incessantly increase and multiply each year the ark become too small and fresh pen and fresh building be require life increase life on all side there be fresh brood fresh flock fresh herd all the conquer wealth of inexhaustible fruitfulness when they reach the stable seguin greatly admire the big draught horse and praise they with the expression of a connoisseur then he return to the subject of breeding and cite some extraordinary result that one of he friend obtain by certain cross so far as the animal kingdom be concern he idea be sound enough but when he come to the consideration of human kind he be as erratic as ever as they walk back from the stable he begin to descant on the population question denounce the century and repeat all he old theory perhaps it be jealous rancor that impel he to protest against the victory of life which the whole farm around he proclaim so loudly depopulation why it do not extend fast enough pari which wish to die so people say be really take its time about it all the same he notice some good symptom for bankruptcy be increase on all side -- in science politics literature and even art liberty be already dead democracy by exasperate ambitious instinct and set class in conflict for power be rapidly lead to a social collapse only the poor still have large family the elite the people of wealth and intelligence have fewer and fewer child so that before final annihilation come there might still be a last period of acceptable civilization in which there would remain only a few man and woman of supreme refinement content with perfume for sustenance and mere breath for enjoyment he however be disgust for he now feel certain that he would not see that period since it be so slow in come if only christianity would return to the primitive faith he continue and condemn woman as a impure diabolical and harmful creature we might go and lead holy life in the desert and in that way bring the world to a end much sooner but the political catholicism of nowadays anxious to keep alive itself allow and regulate marriage with the view of maintain thing as they be oh you will say of course that i myself married and that i have child which be true but i be pleased to think that they will redeem my fault gaston say that a soldier 's only wife ought to be he sword and so he intend to remain single and as lucie on she side have take the veil at the ursuline i feel quite at ease my race be so to say already extinct and that delight I mathieu listen with a smile he be acquaint with that more or less literary form of pessimism in former day all such view as for instance the struggle of civilization against the birth-rate and the relative childlessness of the most intelligent and able member of the community have disturb he but since he have fight the cause of love he have find another faith thus he contented himself with say rather maliciously : but you forget you daughter andree and she little boy leonce oh andree reply seguin wave he hand as if she do not belong to he valentine however have stop short gaze at he fixedly since they household have be wreck and they have be lead life apart she no longer tolerate he sudden attack of insane brutality and jealousy by reason also of the squander of they fortune she have a hold on he for he fear that she might ask for certain account to be render she yes he grant there be andree but then girl do not count they be walk on again when beauchene who have hitherto contented himself with puff and chew he cigar for reserve be impose upon he by the frightful drama of he own family life be unable to remain silent any longer forgetful relapsing into the extraordinary unconsciousness which always set he erect like a victorious superior man he speak out loudly and boldly : i do not belong to seguin 's school but all the same he say some true thing that population question greatly interest I even now and i can flatter myself that i know it fully well it be evident that malthus be right it be not allowable for people to have family without know how they will be able to nourish they if the poor die of starvation it be they fault and not ours then he revert to he usual lecture on the subject the govern class alone be reasonable in keep to small family a country could only produce a certain supply of food and be therefore restricted to a certain population people talk of the faulty division of wealth but it be madness to dream of a utopia where there would be no more master but only so many brother equal worker and sharer who would apportion happiness among themselves like a birthday-cake all the evil then come from the lack of foresight among the poor though with brutal frankness he admit that employer readily avail themselves of the circumstance that there be a surplus of child to hire labor at reduce rate then lose all recollection of the past infatuated intoxicate with he own idea he go on talking of himself people pretend that we be not patriot because we do not leave troops of child behind we but that be simply ridiculous each serve the country in he own way if the poor folk give it soldier we give it we capital -- all the proceeds of we commerce and industry a fine lot of good would it do the country if we be to ruin ourselves with big family which would hamper we prevent we from get rich and afterwards destroy whatever we create by subdivide it with we law and custom there can be no substantial fortune unless a family be limit to one son and yes that be necessary but one son -- a only son -- that be the only wise course therein lie the only possible happiness it become so painful to hear he in he position speak in that fashion that the other remain silent full of embarrassment and he think that he be convince they go on triumphantly : thus i myself -- but at this moment constance interrupt he she have hitherto walk on with bow head amid that flow of chatter which bring she so much torture and shame a aggravation as it be of she defeat but now she raise she face down which two big tear be trickle alexandre she say what be it my dear he do not yet understand but on see she tear he end by feel disturb in spite of all he fine assurance he look at the other and wish to have the last word he add : ah yes we poor child but particular case have nothing to do with general theory idea be still idea silence fall between they they be now near the lawn where the family have remain and for the last moment mathieu have be think of morange whom he have also invite to the wedding but who have excuse himself from attend as if he be terrify at the idea of gaze on the joy of other and dread too lest some sacrilegious attempt should be make in he absence on the mysterious sanctuary where he worship would he morange -- so mathieu wonder -- have cling like beauchene to he former idea would he still have defend the theory of the only child that hateful calculate theory which have cost he both he wife and he daughter mathieu could picture he flit past pale and distract with the step of a maniac hasten to some mysterious end in which insanity would doubtless have its place but the lugubrious vision vanish and then again before mathieu 's eye the lawn spread out under the joyous sun offering between its belt of foliage such a picture of happy health and triumphant beauty that he feel impel to break the mournful silence and exclaim : look there look there be not that gay be not that a delightful scene -- all those dear woman and dear child in that setting of verdure it ought to be paint to show people how healthy and beautiful life be time have not be lose on the lawn since the beauchene and seguin have go off to visit the stable first of all there have be a distribution of the menu card which charlotte have adorn with such delicate water-color sketch this surprise of hers have enrapture they all at lunch and they still laugh at the sight of those pretty child 's head then while the servant clear the table gregoire achieve a great success by offer the bride a bouquet of splendid white rose which he draw out of a bush where he have hitherto keep it hidden he have doubtless be wait for some absence of he father 's they be the rose of the mill with therese 's assistance he must have pillage the bush in the enclosure marianne recognize how serious be the transgression wish to scold he but what superb white rose they be as big as cabbage as he himself have say and he be entitle to triumph over they for they be the only white rose there and have be secure by himself like the wander urchin he be with a spice of knight-errantry in he composition quite ready to jump over wall and cajole damsel in order to deck a bride with snowy bloom oh papa will not say anything he declare with no little self-assurance they be far too beautiful this make the other laugh but fresh emotion ensue for benjamin and guillaume awake and scream they hunger aloud it be gayly remark however that they be quite entitle to they turn of feast and as it be simply a family gathering there be no embarrassment on the part of the mother marianne take benjamin on she knee in the shade of the oak tree and charlotte place herself with guillaume on she right hand while on she left andree seat herself with little leonce who have be wean a week previously but be still very fond of caress it be at this moment that the beauchene and the seguin reappear with mathieu and stop short strike by the charm of the spectacle before they between a framework of tall tree under the patriarchal oak on the thick grass of the lawn the whole vigorous family be gather in a group instinct with gayety beauty and strength gervai and claire ever active be with frederic hurry on the servant who make no end of serve the coffee on the table which have just be clear for this table the three younger girl half bury in a heap of flower tea and blush and crimson rose be now with the help of knight gregoire devise new decoration then a few pace away the bridal pair deni and marthe be converse in undertone while the bride 's mother madame desvignes sit listen to they with a discreet and infinitely gentle smile upon she lip and it be in the midst of all this that marianne radiant white of skin still fresh ever beautiful with serene strength be give the breast to she twelfth child she benjamin and smile at he as he suck away while surrender she other knee to little nicola who be jealous of he younger brother and she two daughter-in-law seem like a continuation of herself there be andree on the leave with ambroise who have step up to tease he little leonce and charlotte on the right with she two child guillaume who hang on she breast and berthe who have seek a place among she skirt and here faith in life have yield prosperity ever-increasing overflow wealth all the sovereign florescence of happy fruitfulness seguin address himself to marianne ask she jestingly : and so that little gentleman be the fourteenth you have nurse she likewise laugh no i must not tell fib i have nurse twelve include this one that be the exact number beauchene who have recover he self-possession could not refrain from intervene once more : a full dozen eh it be madness i share you opinion say mathieu laughing in he turn at all event if it be not madness it be extravagance as we admit my wife and i when we be alone and we certainly do not think that all people ought to have such large family as ours but give the situation in france nowadays with we population dwindle and that of nearly every other country increase it be hardly possible to complain of even the largest family thus even if we example be exaggerate it remain a example i think for other to think over marianne listen still smile but with tear stand in she eye a feeling of gentle sadness be penetrate she she heart-wound have reopen even amid all she joy at see she child assemble around she yes say she in a tremble voice there have be twelve but i have only ten leave two be already sleep yonder wait for we underground there be no sign of dread however in that evocation of the peaceful little cemetery of janville and the family grave in which all the child hope some day to be lay one after the other side by side rather do that evocation come amid that gay wedding assembly seem like a promise of future bless peace the memory of the dear depart one remain alive and lend to one and all a kind of loving gravity even amid they mirth be it not impossible to accept life without accept death each come here to perform he task and then he work end go to join he elder in that slumber of eternity where the great fraternity of humankind be fulfil but in presence of those jester beauchene and seguin quite a flood of word rise to mathieu 's lip he would have like to answer they he would have like to triumph over the mendacious theory which they still dare to assert even in they hour of defeat to fear that the earth might become over-populated that excess of life might produce famine be this not idiotic other only have to do as he have do : create the necessary subsistence each time that a child be bear to they and he would have point to chanteble he work and to all the corn grow up under the sun even as he child grow they could not be charge with have come to consume the share of other since each be bear with he bread before he and million of new being might follow for the earth be vast : more than two-third of it still remain to be place under cultivation and therein lay endless fertility for unlimited humanity besides have not every civilization every progress be due to the impulse of number the improvidence of the poor have alone urge revolutionary multitude to the conquest of truth justice and happiness and with each succeed day the human torrent would require more kindliness more equity the logical division of wealth by just law regulate universal labor if it be true too that civilization be a check to excessive natality this phenomenon itself might make one hope in final equilibrium in the far-off age when the earth should be entirely populated and wise enough to live in a sort of divine immobility but all this be pure speculation beside the need of the hour the nation which must be build up afresh and incessantly enlarged pend the eventual definitive federation of mankind and it be really a example a brave and a necessary one that marianne and he be give in order that manners and custom and the idea of morality and the idea of beauty might be change full of these thought mathieu be already open he mouth to speak but all at once he feel how futile discussion would be in presence of that admirable scene that mother surround by such a florescence of vigorous child that mother nursing yet another child under the big oak which she have plant she be bravely accomplish she task -- that of perpetuate the world and hers be the sovereign beauty mathieu could think of only one thing that would express everything and that be to kiss she with all he heart before the whole assembly there dear wife you be the most beautiful and the best may all the other do as you have do then when marianne have gloriously return he kiss there arise a acclamation a tempest of merry laughter they be both of heroic mould it be with a great dash of heroism that they have steer they bark onward thanks to they full faith in life they will of action and the force of they love and constance be at last conscious of it : she could realize the conquer power of fruitfulness she could already see the froment master of the factory through they son deni master of seguin 's mansion through they son ambroise master too of all the countryside through they other child number spell victory and shrink consume with a love which she could never more satisfy full of the bitterness of she defeat though she yet hope for some abominable revenge of destiny she -- who never weep -- turn aside to hide the big hot tear which now burn she withered cheek meantime benjamin and guillaume be enjoy themselves like greedy little man whom nothing could disturb have there be less laughter one might have hear the trickle of they mother ' milk : that little stream flow forth amid the torrent of sap which upraise the earth and make the big tree quiver in the powerful July blaze on every side fruitful life be convey germ create and nourish and for its eternal work a eternal river of milk flow through the world xix one Sunday morning norine and cecile -- who though it be rightly a day of rest be nevertheless work on either side of they little table press as they be to deliver box for the approach new year season -- receive a visit which leave they pale with stupor and fright they unknown hidden life have hitherto follow a peaceful course the only battle be to make both end meet every week and to put by the rent money for payment every quarter during the eight year that the sister have be live together in the rue de la federation near the champ de mar occupy the same big room with cheerful window a room whose coquettish cleanliness make they feel quite proud norine 's child have grow up steadily between he two affectionate mother for he have end by confound they together : there be mamma norine and there be mamma cecile and he do not exactly know whether one of the two be more he mother than the other it be for he alone that they both live and toil the one still a fine good-looking woman at forty year of age the other yet girlish at thirty now at about ten o'clock that Sunday there come in succession two loud knock at the door when the latter be open a short thick-set fellow about eighteen step in he be dark-haired with a square face a hard prominent jaw and eye of a pale gray and he wear a ragged old jacket and a gray cloth cap discolor by long usage excuse I say he but be not it here that live mesdame moineaud who make cardboard box norine stand there look at he with sudden uneasiness she heart have contract as if she be menace she have certainly see that face somewhere before but she could only recall one old-time danger which suddenly seem to revive more formidable than ever as if threaten to spoil she quiet life yes it be here she answer without any haste the young man glance around the room he must have expect more sign of means than he find for he pout slightly then he eye rest on the child who like a well-behaved little boy have be amusing himself with reading and have now raise he face to examine the newcomer and the latter conclude he examination by direct a brief glance at the other woman who be present a slight sickly creature who likewise feel anxious in presence of that sudden apparition of the unknown i be tell the left-hand door on the fourth floor the young man resume but all the same i be afraid of make a mistake for the thing i have to say can not be say to everybody it be not a easy matter and of course i think it well over before i come here he speak slowly in a drawling way and after again make sure that the other woman be too young to be the one he seek he keep he pale eye steadily fix on norine the grow anguish with which he see she quiver the appeal that she be evidently make to she memory induce he to prolong thing for another moment then he speak out : i be the child who be put to nurse at rougemont my name be alexandre-honore there be no need for he to say anything more the unhappy norine begin to tremble from head to foot clasped and wring she hand while a ashen hue come over she distorted feature good heaven -- beauchene yes it be beauchene whom he resemble and in so strike a manner with he eye of prey he big jaw which proclaim a enjoyer consume by base voracity that she be now astonish that she have not be able to name he at she first glance she leg fail she and she have to sit down so it be you say alexandre as she continue shiver confess the truth by she manner but unable to articulate a word to such a point do despair and fright clutch she at the throat he feel the need of reassure she a little particularly if he be to keep that door open to he you must not upset yourself like that say he you have nothing to fear from I it be not my intention to give you any trouble only when i learn at last where you be i wish to know you and that be natural be not it i even fancy that perhaps you might be please to see I then too the truth be that i be precious badly off three year ago i be silly enough to come back to paris where i do little more than starve and on the day when one have not breakfast one feel inclined to look up one 's parent even though they may have turn one into the street for all the same they can hardly be so hard-hearted as to refuse one a plateful of soup tear rise to norine 's eye this be the finish stroke the return of that wretched cast-off son that big suspicious-looking fellow who accuse she and complain of starve annoyed at be unable to elicit from she any response but shiver and sob alexandre turn to cecile : you be she sister i know say he tell she that it be stupid of she to go on like that i have not come to murder she it be funny how pleased she be to see I yet i do not make any noise and i say nothing whatever to the door-porter downstairs i assure you then as cecile without answer he rise to go and comfort norine he again become interested in the child who likewise feel frightened and turn pale on see the grief of he two mamma so that lad be my brother thereupon norine suddenly spring to she foot and set herself between the child and he a mad fear have come to she of some catastrophe some great collapse which would crush they all yet she do not wish to be harsh she even seek kind word but amid it all she lose she head carry away by feeling of revolt rancor instinctive hostility you come i can understand it but it be so cruel what can i do after so many year one do not know one another one have nothing to say and besides as you can see for yourself i be not rich alexandre glance round the room for the second time yes i see he answer and my father can not you tell I he name she remain thunderstruck by this question and turn yet paler while he continue : because if my father should have any money i should know very well how to make he give I some people have no right to fling child into the gutter like that all at once norine have see the past rise up before she : beauchene the work and she father who now have just quit they owe to he infirmity leave he son victor behind he and a sort of instinctive prudence come to she at the thought that if she be to give up beauchene 's name she might compromise all she happy life since terrible complication might ensue the dread she feel of that suspicious-looking lad who reek of idleness and vice inspire she with a idea : you father he have long be dead say she he could have know nothing have learn nothing on that point for in presence of the energy of she answer he express no doubt whatever of she veracity but contented himself with make a rough gesture which indicate how angry he feel at see he hungry hope thus destroy so i have get to starve he growl norine utterly distract be possess by one painful desire -- a desire that he might take himself away and cease torture she by he presence to such a degree do remorse and pity and fright and horror now wring she bleeding heart she open a drawer and take from it a ten-franc piece she savings for the last three month with which she have intend to buy a new year 's present for she little boy and give those ten franc to alexandre she say : listen i can do nothing for you we live all three in this one room and we scarcely earn we bread it grieve I very much to know that you be so unfortunately circumstanced but you must not rely on I do as we do -- work he pocket the ten franc and remain there for another moment sway about and say that he have not come for money and that he could very well understand thing for he part he always behave properly with people when people behave properly with he and he repeat that since she show herself good-natured he have no idea of create any scandal a mother who do what she could perform she duty even though she might only give a ten-sous piece then as he be at last go off he inquire : will not you kiss I she kiss he but with cold lip and lifeless heart and the two smack kiss which with noisy affectation he give she in return leave she cheek quiver and au revoir eh say he although one may be poor and unable to keep together each know now that the other 's in the land of the living and there be no reason why i should not come up just now and again to wish you good day when i be pass when he have at last disappear long silence fall amid the infinite distress which he short stay have bring there norine have again sink upon a chair as if overwhelm by this catastrophe cecile have be oblige to sit down in front of she for she also be overcome and it be she who amid the mournfulness of that room which but a little while ago have hold all they happiness speak out the first to complain and express she astonishment but you do not ask he anything we know nothing about he say she where have he come from what be he do what do he want and in particular how do he manage to discover you these be the interesting thing to learn oh what would you have reply norine when he tell I he name he knock all the strength out of I i feel as cold as ice oh it be he there be no doubt of it you recognize he likeness to he father do not you but you be right we know nothing and now we shall always be live with that threat over we head in fear that everything will crumble down upon we all she strength all she courage be go and she begin to sob stammer indistinctly : to think of it a big fellow of eighteen fall on one like that without a word of warning and it be quite true that i do not love he since i do not even know he when he kiss I i feel nothing i be icy cold as if my heart be frozen o god o god what trouble to be sure and how horrid and cruel it all be then as she little boy on see she weep run up and fling himself frightened and tearful against she bosom she wildly catch he in she arm my poor little one my poor little one if only you do not suffer by it if only my sin do not fall on you ah that would be a terrible punishment really the best course be for folk to behave properly in life if they do not want to have a lot of trouble afterwards in the evening the sister have grow somewhat calmer decide that they best course would be to write to mathieu norine remember that he have call on she a few year previously to ask if alexandre have not be to see she he alone know all the particulars of the business and where to obtain information and indeed as soon as the sister ' letter reach he mathieu make haste to call on they in the rue de la federation for he be anxious with respect to the effect which any scandal might have at the work where beauchene 's position be become worse every day after question norine at length he guess that alexandre must have learn she address through la couteau though he could not say precisely how this have come about at last after a long month of discreet research conversation with madame menoux celeste and la couteau herself he be able in some measure to explain thing the alert have certainly come from the inquiry intrust to the nurse-agent at rougemont that visit which she have make to the hamlet of saint-pierre in quest of information respect the lad who be suppose to be in apprenticeship with montoir the wheelwright she have talk too much say too much particularly to the other apprentice that richard another foundling and one of such bad instinct too that seven month later he have take flight like alexandre after purloin some money from he master then year elapse and all trace of they be lose but later on most assuredly they have meet one another on the paris pavement in such wise that the big carroty lad have tell the little dark fellow the whole story how he relative have cause a search to be make for he and perhaps too who he mother be the whole intersperse with tittle-tattle and ridiculous invention still this do not explain everything and to understand how alexandre have procure he mother 's actual address mathieu have to presume that he have secure it from la couteau whom celeste have acquaint with so many thing indeed he learn at broquette 's nurse-agency that a short thickset young man with pronounced jaw-bone have come there twice to speak to la couteau nevertheless many point remain unexplained the whole affair have take place amid the tragic murky gloom of parisian low life whose mire it be not healthy to stir mathieu end by rest content with a general notion of the business for he himself feel frightened at the charge already hang over those two young bandit who live so precariously drag they idleness and they vice over the pavement of the great city and thus all he research have result in but one console certainty which be that even if norine the mother be know the father 's name and position be certainly not suspect by anybody when mathieu see norine again on the subject he terrify she by the few particulars which he be oblige to give she oh i beg you i beg you do not let he come again she plead find some means prevent he from come here it upset I too dreadfully to see he mathieu of course could do nothing in this respect after mature reflection he realize that the great object of he effort must be to prevent alexandre from discover beauchene what he have learn of the young man be so bad so dreadful that he wish to spare constance the pain and scandal of be blackmail he could see she blanching at the thought of the ignominy of that lad whom she have so passionately desire to find and he feel ashamed for she sake and deem it more compassionate and even necessary to bury the secret in the silence of the grave still it be only after a long fight with himself that he come to this decision for he feel that it be hard to have to abandon the unhappy youth in the street be it still possible to save he he doubt it and besides who would undertake the task who would know how to instil honest principle into that waif by teach he to work it all mean yet another man cast overboard forsake amid the tempest and mathieu 's heart bleed at the thought of condemn he though he could think of no reasonable means of salvation my opinion he say to norine be that you should keep he father 's name from he for the present later on we will see but just now i should fear worry for everybody she eagerly acquiesce oh you need not be anxious she respond i have already tell he that he father be dead if i be to speak out everything would fall on my shoulder and my great desire be to be leave in peace in my corner with my little one with sorrowful mien mathieu continue reflect unable to make up he mind to utterly abandon the young man if he would only work i would find he some employment and i would even take he on at the farm later when i should no longer have cause to fear that he might contaminate my people however i will see what can be do i know a wheelwright who would doubtless employ he and i will write to you in order that you may tell he where to apply when he come back to see you what when he come back she cry in despair so you think that he will come back o god o god i shall never be happy again he do indeed come back but when she give he the wheelwright 's address he sneer and shrug he shoulder he know all about the pari wheelwright a set of sweater a parcel of lazy rogue who make poor people toil and moil for they besides he have never finish he apprenticeship he be only fit for run errand in which capacity he be willing to accept a post in a large shop when mathieu have procure he such a situation he do not remain in it a fortnight one fine evening he disappear with the parcel of goods which he have be tell to deliver in turn he try to learn a baker 's call become a mason 's hodman secure work at the market but without ever fix himself anywhere he simply discourage he protector and leave all sort of roguery behind he for other to liquidate it become necessary to renounce the hope of save he when he turn up as he do periodically emaciate hungry and in rag they have to limit themselves to provide he with the means to buy a jacket and some bread thus norine live on in a state of mortal disquietude for long week alexandre seem to be dead but she nevertheless start at the slightest sound that she hear on the landing she always feel he to be there and whenever he suddenly rap on the door she recognize he heavy knock and begin to tremble as if he have come to beat she he have notice how he presence reduce the unhappy woman to a state of abject terror and he profit by this to extract from she whatever little sum she hide away when she have hand he the five-franc piece which mathieu as a rule leave with she for this purpose the young rascal be not content but begin search for more at time he make he appearance in a wild haggard state declare that he should certainly be send to prison that evening if he do not secure ten franc and talk the while of smash everything in the room or else of carry off the little clock in order to sell it and it be then necessary for cecile to intervene and turn he out of the place for however puny she might be she have a brave heart but if he go off it be only to return a few day later with fresh demand threaten that he would shout he story to everybody on the stair if the ten franc be not give to he one day when he mother have no money in the place and begin to weep he talk of rip up the mattress where say he she probably keep she hoard briefly the sister ' little home be become a perfect hell the greatest misfortune of all however be that in the rue de la federation alexandre make the acquaintance of alfred norine 's youngest brother the last bear of the moineaud family he be then twenty and thus two year the senior of he nephew no worse prowler than he exist he be the genuine rough with pale beardless face blinking eye and twisted mouth the real gutter-weed that sprout up amid the parisian manure-heap at seven year of age he rob he sister beat cecile every Saturday in order to tear she earnings from she mother moineaud wear out with hard work and unable to exercise a constant watch over he have never manage to make he attend school regularly or to keep he in apprenticeship he exasperate she to such a degree that she herself end by turn he into the street in order to secure a little peace and quietness at home he big brother kick he about he father be at work from morning till evening and the child thus morally a waif grow up out of door for a career of vice and crime among the swarm of lad and girl of he age who all rot there together like apple fall on the ground and as alfred grow he become yet more corrupt he be like the sacrifice surplus of a poor man 's family the surplus pour into the gutter the spoilt fruit which spoil all that come into contact with it like alexandre too he nowadays only live chancewise and it be not even know where he have be sleep since mother moineaud have die at a hospital exhaust by she long life of wretchedness and family care which have prove far too heavy for she she be only sixty at the time of she death but be as bent and as wear out as a centenarian moineaud two year older bent like herself he leg twist by paralysis a lamentable wreck after fifty year of unjust toil have be oblige to quit the factory and thus the home be empty and its few poor stick have be cast to the four wind of heaven moineaud fortunately receive a little pension for which he be indebted to deni 's compassionate initiative but he be sink into second childhood wear out by he long and constant effort and not only do he squander he few copper in drink but he could not be leave alone for he foot be lifeless and he hand shake to such a degree that he run the risk of set all about he on fire whenever he try to light he pipe at last he find himself strand in the home of he daughter norine and cecile the only two who have heart enough to take he in they rent a little closet for he on the fifth floor of the house over they own room and they nurse he and buy he food and clothes with he pension-money to which they add a good deal of they own as they remark in they gay courageous way they now have two child a little one and a very old one which be a heavy burden for two woman who earn but five franc a day although they be ever make box from morn till night there be a touch of soft irony in the circumstance that old moineaud should have be unable to find any other refuge than the home of he daughter norine -- that daughter whom he have formerly turn away and curse for she misconduct that hussy who have dishonor he but whose very hand he now kiss when for fear lest he should set the tip of he nose ablaze she help he to light he pipe all the same the shaky old nest of the moineaud be destroy and the whole family have fly off dispersed chancewise irma alone thanks to she fine marriage with a clerk live happily play the part of a lady and so full of vanity that she no longer condescend to see she brother and sister victor meantime be lead at the factory much the same life as he father have lead work at the same mill as the other and in the same blind stubborn way he have marry and though he be under six-and-thirty he already have six child three boy and three girl so that he wife seem fate to much the same existence as he mother la moineaude both of they would finish break down and they child in they turn would unconsciously perpetuate the swarm and accursed starvele race at euphrasie 's destiny the inevitable show itself more tragic still the wretched woman have not be lucky enough to die she have gradually become bedridden quite unable to move though she live on and could hear and see and understand thing from that open grave she bed she have behold the final break-up of what remain of she sorry home she be nothing more than a thing insult by she husband and tortured by madame joseph who would leave she for day together without water and fling she occasional crust much as they might be fling to a sick animal whose litter be not even change terror-stricken and full of humility amid she downfall euphrasie resign herself to everything but the worst be that she three child she twin daughter and she son be abandon to themselves sink into vice the all-corrupting life of the street benard tire out distract by the wreck of he home have take to drink with madame joseph and afterwards they would fight together break the furniture and drive off the child who come home muddy in rag and with they pocket full of steal thing on two occasion benard disappear for a week at a time on the third he do not come back at all when the rent fall due madame joseph in she turn take herself off and then come the end euphrasie have to be remove to the hospital of la salpetriere the last refuge of the aged and the infirm while the child henceforth without a home in name be drive into the gutter the boy never turn up again it be as if he have be swallow by some sewer one of the twin girl find in the street die in a hospital during the ensue year and the other toinette a fair-haired scraggy hussy who however puny she might look be a terrible little creature with the eye and the tooth of a wolf live under the bridge in the depths of the stone quarry in the dingy garret of haunt of vice so that at sixteen she be already a expert thief she fate be similar to alfr 's here be a girl morally abandon then contaminate by the life of the street and carry off to a criminal career and indeed the uncle and the niece have meet by chance end by consort together they favorite refuge it be think be the limekiln in the direction of les moulineaux one day then it happen that alexandre upon call at norine 's there encounter alfr who come at time to try to extract a half-franc from old moineaud he father the two young bandit go off together chat and meet again and from that chance encounter there spring a band alexandre be live with richard and alfr bring toinette to they thus they be four in number and the customary development follow : beg at first the girl put out she hand at the instigation of the three prowler who remain on the watch and draw alms by force at nighttime from belated bourgeois encounter in dark corner next come vulgar vice and its wonted attendant blackmail and then theft petty larceny to begin with the pilfering of thing display for sale by shopkeeper and afterwards more serious affair premeditate expedition map out like real war plan the band sleep wherever it could now in suspicious dingy doss-house now on waste ground in summer time there be endless saunter through the wood of the environs pend the arrival of night which hand pari over to they predatory design they find themselves at the central market among the crowd on the boulevard in the low tavern along the desert avenue -- indeed wherever they sniff the possibility of a stroke of luck the chance of snatch the bread of idleness or the pleasure of vice they be like a little clan of savage on the war-path athwart civilization live outside the pale of the law they suggest young wild beast beat the ancestral forest they typify the human animal relapsing into barbarism forsake since birth and evince the ancient instinct of pillage and carnage and like noxious weed they grow up sturdily become bolder and bolder each day exact a bigger and bigger ransom from the fool who toil and moil ever extend they theft and march along the road to murder never should it be forget that the child bear chancewise and then cast upon the pavement without supervision without prop or help rot there and become a terrible ferment of social decomposition all those little one throw to the gutter like superfluous kitten be fling into some sewer all those forsake one those wanderer of the pavement who beg and thieve and indulge in vice form the dung-heap in which the worst crime germinate childhood leave to wretchedness breed a fearful nucleus of infection in the tragic gloom of the depths of paris those who be thus imprudently cast into the street yield a harvest of brigandage -- that frightful harvest of evil which make all society totter when norine through the boasting of alexandre and alfr who take pleasure in astonishing she begin to suspect the exploit of the band she feel so frightened that she have a strong bolt place upon she door and when night have fall she no longer admit any visitor until she know he name she torture have be last for nearly two year she be ever quiver with alarm at the thought of alexandre rush in upon she some dark night he be twenty now he speak authoritatively and threaten she with atrocious revenge whenever he have to retire with empty hand one day in spite of cecile he throw himself upon the wardrobe and carry off a bundle of linen handkerchief towel napkin and sheet intend to sell they and the sister do not dare to pursue he down the stair despair weep overwhelm by it all they have sink down upon they chair that winter prove a very severe one and the two poor workwoman pillage in this fashion would have perish in they sorry home of cold and starvation together with the dear child for whom they still do they best have it not be for the help which they old friend madame angelin regularly bring they she be still a lady-delegate of the poor relief service and continue to watch over the child of unhappy mother in that terrible district of grenelle whose poverty be so great but for a long time past she have be unable to do anything officially for norine if she still bring she a twenty-franc piece every month it be because charitable people intrust she with fairly large amount know that she could distribute they to advantage in the dreadful inferno which she function compel she to frequent she set she last joy and find the great consolation of she desolate childless life in thus remit alms to poor mother whose little one laugh at she joyously as soon as they see she arrive with she hand full of good thing one day when the weather be frightful all rain and wind madame angelin linger for a little while in norine 's room it be barely two o'clock in the afternoon and she be just begin she round on she lap lay she little bag bulge out with the gold and the silver which she have to distribute old moineaud be there install on a chair and smoking he pipe in front of she and she feel concerned about he need and explain that she would have greatly like to obtain a monthly relief allowance for he but if you only know she add what suffer there be among the poor during these winter month we be quite swamp we can not give to everybody there be too many and after all you be among the fortunate one i find some lie like dog on the tiled floor of they room without a scrap of coal to make a fire or even a potato to eat and the poor child too good heaven child in heap among vermin without shoe without clothes all grow up as if destine for prison or the scaffold unless consumption should carry they off madame angelin quiver and close she eye as if to escape the spectacle of all the terrifying thing that she evoke the wretchedness the shame the crime that she elbow during she continual perambulation through that hell of poverty vice and hunger she often return home pale and silent have reach the uttermost depths of human abomination and never daring to say all at time she tremble and raise she eye to heaven wonder what vengeful cataclysm would swallow up that accursed city of paris ah she murmur once more they suffering be so great may they sin be forgive they moineaud listen to she in a state of stupor as if he be unable to understand at last with difficulty he succeed in take he pipe from he mouth it be indeed quite a effort now for he to do such a thing and yet for fifty year he have wrestle with iron -- iron in the vice or on the anvil there be nothing like good conduct he stammer huskily when a man work he be reward then he wish to set he pipe between he lip once more but be unable to do so he hand deform by the constant use of tool tremble too violently so it become necessary for norine to rise from she chair and help he poor father exclaim cecile who have not cease work cut out the cardboard for the little box she make : what would have become of he if we have not give he shelter it be not irma with she stylish hat and she silk dress who would have care to have he at she place meantime norine 's little boy have take he stand in front of madame angelin for he know very well that on the day when the good lady call there be some dessert at supper in the evening he smile at she with the bright eye which light up he pretty fair face crown with tumbled sunshiny hair and when she notice with what a merry glance he be wait for she to open she little bag she feel quite move come and kiss I my little friend say she she know no sweeter reward for all that she do than the kiss of the child in the poor home whither she bring a little joy when the youngster have boldly throw he arm round she neck she eye fill with tear and address herself to he mother she repeat : no no you must not complain there be other who be more unhappy than you i know one who if this pretty little fellow could only be she own would willingly accept you poverty and paste box together from morning till night and lead a recluse 's life in this one room which he suffice to fill with sunshine ah good heaven if you be only willing if we could only change for a moment she become silent afraid that she might burst into sob the wound deal she by she childlessness have always remain open she and she husband be now grow old in bitter solitude in three little room overlook a courtyard in the rue de lille in this retirement they subsist on the salary which she the wife receive as a lady-delegate join to what they have be able to save of they original fortune the former fan-painter of triumphant mien be now completely blind a mere thing a poor suffering thing

child he could no longer eat he could no longer go to bed without she help he have only she left he he be she child as he would say at time with a despairing irony which make they both weep a child ah yes she have end by have one and it be he a old child bear of disaster one who appear to be eighty though he be less than fifty year old and who amid he black and ceaseless night ever dream of sunshine during the long hour which he be compel to spend alone and madame angelin do not only envy that poor workwoman she little boy she also envy she that old man smoking he pipe yonder that infirm relic of labor who at all event see clearly and still live do not worry the lady say norine to she son for she feel anxious quite move indeed at see the other so disturbed with she heart so full run

render she timid and deferent each time that she see she arrive tall and distinguished ever clothe in black and show the remnant of she former beauty which sorrow have wreck already though she be barely six-and-forty year of age for norine the lady-delegate be like some queen who have fall from she throne amid frightful and undeserved suffering run away go and play my darling norine repeat to she boy : you be tire madame tiring I oh no exclaimed madame angelin conquer she emotion on the contrary he do I good kiss I kiss I again my pretty fellow then she begin to bestir and collect herself well it be get late and i have so many place to go to between now and this evening this be what i can do for you she be at last take a gold coin from she little bag but at that very moment a heavy blow as if deal by a fist resound on the door and norine turn ghastly pale for she have recognize alexandre 's brutal knock what could she do if she do not open the door the bandit would go on knock and raise a scandal she be oblige to open it but thing do not take the violent tragical turn which she have fear surprised at see a lady there alexandre do not even open he mouth he simply slip inside and station himself bolt upright against the wall the lady-delegate have raise she eye and then carry they elsewhere understand that this young fellow must be some friend probably some relative and without thought of concealment she go on : here be twenty franc i can not do more only i promise you that i will try to double the amount next month it will be the rent month and i have already apply for help on all side and people have promise to give I the utmost they can but shall i ever have enough so many application be make to I she little bag have remain open on she knee and alexandre with he glittering eye be search it weigh in fancy all the treasure of the poor that it contain all the gold and silver and even the copper money that distend its side still in silence he watch madame angelin as she close it slip its little chain round she wrist and then finally rise from she chair well au revoir till next month then she resume i shall certainly call on the 5th and in all probability i shall begin my round with you but it be possible that it may be rather late in the afternoon for it happen to be my poor husband 's name-day and so be brave and work well norine and cecile have likewise rise in order to escort she to the door here again there be a outpouring of gratitude and the child once more kiss the good lady on both cheek with all he little heart the sister so terrify by alexandre 's arrival at last begin to breathe again in point of fact the incident terminate fairly well for the young man show himself accommodate when cecile return from obtain change for the gold he contented himself with take one of the four five-franc piece which she bring up with she and he do not tarry to torture they as be he wont but immediately go off with the money he have levy whistle the while the air of a hunting-song the 5th of the ensue month a Saturday be one of the gloomiest most rainy day of that wretched mournful winter darkness fall rapidly already at three o'clock in the afternoon and it become almost night at the desert end of rue de la federation there be a expanse of waste ground a building site for long year enclose by a fence which dampness have end by rot some of the board be miss and at one part there be quite a breach all through that afternoon in spite of the constantly recur downpour a scraggy girl remain station near that breach wrap to she eye in the ragged remnant of a old shawl doubtless for protection against the cold she seem to be wait for some chance meet the advent it might be of some charitably disposed wayfarer and she impatience be manifest for while keep close to the fence like some animal lie in wait she continually peer through the breach thrust out she taper weasel 's head and watch yonder in the direction of the champ de mar hour go by three o'clock strike and then such dark cloud roll over the livid sky that the girl herself become blur obscure as if she be some mere piece of wreckage cast into the darkness at time she raise she head and watch the sky darken with eye that glitter as if to thank it for throw so dense a gloom over that desert corner that spot so fit for a ambuscade and just as the rain have once more begin to fall a lady could be see approach a lady clothe in black quite black under a open umbrella while seek to avoid the puddle in she path she walk on quickly like one in a hurry who go about she business on foot in order to save herself the expense of a cab from some precise description which she have obtain toinette the girl appear to recognize this lady from afar off she be indeed none other than madame angelin come quickly from the rue de lille on she way to the home of she poor with the little chain of she little bag encircle she wrist and when the girl espy the gleaming steel of that little chain she no longer have any doubt but whistle softly and forthwith cry and moan arise from a dim corner of the vacant ground while she herself begin to wail and call distressfully astonish disturb by it all madame angelin stop short what be the matter my girl she ask oh madame my brother have fall yonder and broken he leg what fall what have he fall from oh madame there be a shed yonder where we sleep because we have not any home and he be use a old ladder to try to prevent the rain from pour in on we and he fall and break he leg thereupon the girl burst into sob ask what be to become of they stammer that she have be stand there in despair for the last ten minute but could see nobody to help they which be not surprising with that terrible rain fall and the cold so bitter and while she stammer all this the call for help and the cry of pain become louder in the depths of the waste ground though madame angelin be terribly upset she nevertheless hesitate as if distrustful you must run to get a doctor my poor child say she i can do nothing oh but you can madame come with I i pray you i do not know where there be a doctor to be find come with I and we will pick he up for i can not manage it by myself and at all event we can lay he in the shed so that the rain sha 'n' t pour down on he this time the good woman consent so truthful do the girl 's accent seem to be constant visit to the vilest den where crime sprout from the dunghill of poverty have make madame angelin brave she be oblige to close she umbrella when she glide through the breach in the fence in the wake of the girl who slim and supple like a cat glide on in front barehead in she ragged shawl give I you hand madame say she take care for there be some trench it be over yonder at the end can you hear how he be moan poor brother ah here we be then come swift and overwhelming savagery the three bandit alexandre richard and alfr who have be crouch low spring forward and throw themselves upon madame angelin with such hungry wolfish violence that she be throw to the ground alfr however be a coward then leave she to the two other and hasten with toinette to the breach in order to keep watch alexandre who have a handkerchief roll up all ready thrust it into the poor lady 's mouth to stifle she cry they intention be to stun she only and then make off with she little bag but the handkerchief must have slip out for she suddenly raise a shriek a loud and terrible shriek and at that moment the other near the breach give the alarm whistle : some people be doubtless drawing near it be necessary to finish alexandre knot the handkerchief round the unhappy woman 's neck while richard with he fist force she shriek back into she throat red madness fall upon they they both begin to twist and tighten the handkerchief and drag the poor creature over the muddy ground until she stir no more then as the whistle sound again they take the bag leave the body there with the handkerchief around the neck and gallop all four of they as far as the grenelle bridge whence they fling the bag into the seine after greedily thrust the copper and the white silver and the yellow gold into they pocket when mathieu read the particulars of the crime in the newspaper he be seize with fright and hasten to the rue de la federation the murder woman have be promptly identify and the circumstance that the crime have be commit on that plot of vacant ground but a hundred yard or so from the house where norine and cecile live upset he fill he with a terrible presentiment and he immediately realize that he fear be justify when he have to knock three time at norine 's door before cecile have recognize he voice remove the article with which it have be barricade and admit he inside norine be in bed quite ill and as white as she sheet she begin to sob and shudder repeatedly as she tell he the story : madame angelin 's visit the previous month and the sudden arrival of alexandre who have see the bag and have hear the promise of further help at a certain hour on a certain date besides norine could have no doubt for the handkerchief find round the victim 's neck be one of hers which alexandre have steal : a handkerchief embroider with the initial letter of she christian name one of those cheap fancy thing which be sell by thousand at the big linendrapery establishment that handkerchief too be the only clew to the murderer and it be such a very vague one that the police be still vainly seek the culprit quite lose amid a variety of scent and despairing of success mathieu sit near the bed listen to norine and feeling icy cold good god that poor unfortunate madame angelin he could picture she in she younger day so gay and bright over yonder at

become rich since she little share in the factory profit stipulate by deni have be increase year by year but nevertheless she continue work for she dealer in miniature this work bring she pocket-money she gayly say and would enable she to make she child a present whenever they might marry there be indeed already some thought of berthe marry and assuredly she would be the first of mathieu and marianne 's grandchild to enter into the state of matrimony they smile softly at the idea of become great-grandparent before very long perhaps after the lapse of four year gregoire first of the younger child fly away there be a great deal of trouble quite a little drama in connection with the affair which mathieu and marianne have for some time be anticipate gregoire be anything but reasonable short but robust with a pert face in which glitter the brightest of eye he have always be the turbulent member of the family the one who cause the most anxiety he childhood have be spend in play truant in the wood of janville and he have afterwards make a mere pretence of study in pari return home full of health and spirit but unable or unwilling to make up he mind with respect to any particular trade or profession already four-and-twenty he know little more than how to shoot and fish and trot about the country on horseback he be certainly not more stupid or less active than another but he seem bent on living and amusing himself accord to he fancy the worst be that for some month past all the gossip of janville have be relate that he have renew he former boyish friendship with therese lepailleur the miller 's daughter and that they be to be meet of a evening in shady nook under the pollard-willow by the yeuse one morning mathieu wish to ascertain if the young covey of partridge be plentiful in the direction of mareuil take gregoire with he and when they find themselves alone among the plantation of the plateau he begin to talk to he seriously you know i be not please with you my lad say he i really can not understand the idle life which you lead here while all the rest of we be hard at work i shall wait till October since you have positively promise I that you will then come to a decision and choose the call which you most fancy but what be all this tittle-tattle which i hear about appointment which you keep with the daughter of the lepailleur do you wish to cause we serious worry gregoire quietly begin to laugh oh father you be surely not go to scold a son of yours because he happen to be on friendly term with a pretty girl why as you may remember it be i who give she she first bicycle lesson nearly ten year ago and you will recollect the fine white rose which she help I to secure in the enclosure by the mill for deni ' wedding gregoire still laugh at the memory of that incident and live afresh through all he old time sweethearting -- the escapade with therese along the river bank and the banquet of blackberry in undiscoverable hiding-place deep in the wood and it seem too that the love of childhood have revive and be now burst into consume fire so vividly do he cheek glow and so hotly do he eye blaze as he thus recall those distant time poor therese we have be at dagger draw for year and all because one evening on come back from the fair at vieux-bourg i push she into a pool of water where she dirty she frock it be true that last spring we make it up again on finding ourselves face to face in the little wood at monval over yonder but come father do you mean to say that it be a crime if we take a little pleasure in speak to one another when we meet render the more anxious by the fire with which gregoire seek to defend the girl mathieu speak out plainly a crime no if you just wish one another good day and good evening only folk relate that you be to be see at dusk with you arm round each other 's waist and that you go stargaze through the grass alongside the yeuse then as gregoire this time without reply laugh yet more loudly with the merry laugh of youth he father gravely resume : listen my lad it be not at all to my taste to play the gendarme behind my son but i will not have you draw some unpleasant business with the lepailleur on we all you know the position they would be delighted to give we trouble so do not give they occasion for complain leave they daughter alone oh i take plenty of care cry the young man thus suddenly confess the truth poor girl she have already have she ear box because somebody tell she father that i have be meet with she he answer that rather than give she to I he would throw she into the river ah you see conclude mathieu it be understand be it not i shall rely on you good behavior thereupon they go they way scour the field as far as the road to mareuil covey of young partridge still weak on the wing start up both to the right and to the leave the shooting would be good then as the father and the son turn homeward slacken they pace a long spell of silence fall between they they be both reflect i do not wish that there should be any misunderstanding between we mathieu suddenly resume you must not imagine that i shall prevent you from marry accord to you taste and that i shall require you to take a heiress we poor blaise marry a portionless girl and it be the same with deni besides which i give you sister claire in marriage to frederic who be simply one of we farm hand so i do not look down on therese on the contrary i think she charming she be one of the prettiest girl of the district -- not tall certainly but so alert and determine with she little pink face shine under such a wild crop of fair hair that one might think she powdered with all the flour in the mill yes be not that so father interrupted gregoire enthusiastically and if you only know how affectionate and courageous she be she be worth a man any day it be wrong of they to smack she for she will never put up with it whenever she set she mind on anything she be bind to do it and it be not i who can prevent she absorb in some reflection of he own mathieu scarcely hear he son no no he resume i certainly do not look down on they mill if it be not for lepailleur 's stupid obstinacy he would be draw a fortune from that mill nowadays since corn-growing have again be take up all over the district thanks to we victory he might have get a good pile of crown together if he have simply change the old mechanism of he wheel which he leave rot under the moss and better still i should like to see a good engine there and a bit of a light railway line connect the mill with janville station in this fashion he continue explain he idea while gregoire listen again quite lively and take thing in a jest way well father the young man end by say as you wish that i should have a call it be settle if i marry therese i 'll be a miller mathieu protest in surprise : no no i be merely talk and besides you have promise I my lad that you will be reasonable so once again for the sake of the peace and quietness of all of we leave therese alone for we can only expect to reap worry with the lepailleur the conversation cease and they return to the farm that evening however the father tell the mother of the young man 's confession and she who already entertain various misgiving feel more anxious than ever still a month go by without anything serious happen then one morning marianne be astounded at find gregoire 's bedroom empty as a rule he come to kiss she perhaps he have rise early and have go on some excursion in the environs but she tremble slightly when she remember how lovingly he have twice catch she in he arm on the previous night when they be all retire to bed and as she look inquisitively round the room she notice on the mantelshelf a letter address to she -- a prettily word letter in which the young fellow beg she to forgive he for cause she grief and ask she to excuse he with he father for it be necessary that he should leave they for a time of he reason for do so and he purpose however no particulars be give this family rend this bad conduct on the part of the son who have be the most spoilt of all and who in a fit of sudden folly be the first to break the tie which unite the household together be a very painful blow for marianne and mathieu they be the more terrify since they divine that gregoire have not go off alone they piece together the incident of the deplorable affair charlotte remember that she have hear gregoire go downstairs again almost immediately after enter he bedroom and before the servant have even bolt the house-door for the night he have certainly rush off to join therese in some coppice whence they must have hurry away to vieux-bourg station which the last train to pari quit at five-and-twenty minute past midnight and it be indeed this which have take place at noon the froment already learn that lepailleur be create a terrible scandal about the flight of therese he have immediately go to the gendarme to shout the story to they and demand that they should bring the guilty hussy back chained to she accomplice and both of they with gyve about they wrist he on he side have find a letter in he daughter 's bedroom a plucky letter in which she plainly say that as she have be strike again the previous day she have have enough of it and be go off of she own free will indeed she add that she be take gregoire with she and be quite big and old enough now that she be two-and-twenty to know what she be about lepailleur 's fury be largely due to this letter which he do not dare to show abroad besides which he wife ever at war with he respect they son antonin not only roundly abused therese but sneeringly declare that it might all have be expect and that he the father be the cause of the gad-about 's misconduct after that they engage in fisticuffs and for a whole week the district do nothing but talk about the flight of one of the chantebled lad with the girl of the mill to the despair of mathieu and marianne the latter of whom in particular grieve over the sorry business five day later a Sunday matter become even worse as the search for the runaway remain fruitless lepailleur boil over with rancor go up to the farm and from the middle of the road -- for he do not venture inside -- pour forth a flood of ignoble insult it so happen that mathieu be absent and marianne have great trouble to restrain gervai as well as frederic both of whom wish to thrust the miller 's scurrilous language back into he throat when mathieu come home in the evening he be extremely vex to hear of what have happen it be impossible for this state of thing to continue he say to he wife as they be retire to rest it look as if we be hide as if we be guilty in the matter i will go to see that man in the morning there be only one thing and a very simple one to be do those unhappy child must be marry for we part we consent be it not so and it be to that man 's advantage to consent also to-morrow the matter must be settle on the follow day Monday at two o'clock in the afternoon mathieu set out for the mill but certain complication a tragic drama which he could not possibly foresee await he there for year now a stubborn struggle have be go on between lepailleur and he wife with respect to antonin while the farmer have grow more and more exasperated with he son 's idleness and life of low debauchery in paris the latter have support she boy with all the obstinacy of a illiterate woman who be possess of a blind faith in he fine handwriting and feel convinced that if he do not succeed in life it be simply because he be refuse the money necessary for that purpose in spite of she sordid avarice in some matter the old woman continue bleeding herself for she son and even rob the house promptly thrust out she claw and set she tooth ready to bite whenever she be catch in the act and have to defend some twenty-franc piece or other which she have be on the point of send away and each time the battle begin afresh to such a point indeed that it seem as if the shaky old mill would some day end by fall on they head then all at once antonin a perfect wreck at thirty-six year of age fall seriously ill lepailleur forthwith declare that if the scamp have the audacity to come home he would pitch he over the wheel into the water antonin however have no desire to return home he hold the country in horror and fear too that he father might chain he up like a dog so he mother place he with some people of batignolle pay for he board and for the attendance of a doctor of the district this have be go on for three month or so and every fortnight la lepailleur go to see she son she have do so the previous Thursday and on the Sunday evening she receive a telegram summon she to batignolle again thus on the morning of the day when mathieu repair to the mill she have once more go to pari after a frightful quarrel with she husband who ask if they good-for-nothing son ever mean to cease fool they and spend they money when he have not the courage even to turn a spit of earth alone in the mill that morning lepailleur do not cease storm at the slightest provocation he would have hammer he plough to piece or have rush axe in hand and mad with hatred on the old wheel by way of avenge he misfortune when he see mathieu come in he believe in some act of bravado and almost choke come neighbor say the master of chantebled cordially let we both try to be reasonable i have come to return you visit since you call upon I yesterday only bad word never do good work and the best course since this misfortune have happen be to repair it as speedily as possible when would you have we marry off those bad child thunderstruck by the quiet good nature of this frontal attack lepailleur do not immediately reply he have shout over the house roof that he would have no marriage at all but rather a good lawsuit by way of send all the froment to prison nevertheless when it come to reflection a son of the big farmer of chanteble be not to be disdain as a son-in-law marry they marry they he stammer at the first moment yes by fasten a big stone to both they neck and throw they together into the river ah the wretch i 'll skin they i will she as well as he at last however the miller grow calmer and be even show a disposition to discuss matter when all at once a urchin of janville come run across the yard what do you want eh call the master of the premise please monsieur lepailleur it be a telegram all right give it here the lad well pleased with the copper he receive as a gratuity have already go off and still the miller instead of open the telegram stand examine the address on it with the distrustful air of a man who do not often receive such communication however he at last have to tear it open it contain but three word : you son dead and in that brutal brevity that prompt hasty bludgeon-blow one could detect the mother 's cold rage and eager craving to crush without delay the man the father yonder whom she accuse of have cause she son 's death even as she have accuse he of be responsible for she daughter 's flight he feel this full well and stagger beneath the shock stun by the word that appear on that strip of blue paper read they again and again till he end by understand they then he hand begin to tremble and he burst into oath thunder and blaze what again be this here be the boy die now everything 's go to the devil but he heart dilate and tear appear in he eye unable to remain standing he sink upon a chair and again obstinately read the telegram you son dead -- you son dead as if seek something else the particulars indeed which the message do not contain perhaps the boy have die before he mother 's arrival or perhaps she have arrive just before he die such be he stammered comment and he repeat a score of time that she have take the train at ten minute past eleven and must have reach batignolle about half-past twelve as she have hand in the telegram at twenty minute past one it seem more likely that she have find the lad already dead curse it curse it he shout a cursed telegram it tell you nothing and it murder you she might at all event have send somebody i shall have to go there ah the whole thing 's complete it be more than a man can bear lepailleur shout those word in such accent of rageful despair that mathieu full of compassion make bold to intervene the sudden shock of the tragedy have stagger he and he have hitherto wait in silence but now he offer he service and speak of accompany the other to pari he have to retreat however for the miller rise to he foot seize with wild exasperation at perceive he still there in he house ah yes you come and what be it you be say to I that we ought to marry off those wretched child well you can see that i be in proper trim for a wedding my boy 's dead you have choose you day well be off with you be off with you i say if you do not want I to do something dreadful he raise he fist quite madden as he be by the presence of mathieu at that moment when he whole life be wreck it be terrible indeed that this bourgeois who have make a fortune by turn himself into a peasant should be there at the moment when he so suddenly learn the death of antonin that son whom he have dream of turn into a monsieur by fill he mind with disgust of the soil and send he to rot of idleness and vice in paris it enrage he to find that he have err that the earth whom he have slander whom he have tax with decrepitude and barrenness be really a living youthful and fruitful spouse to the man who know how to love she and nought but ruin remain around he thanks to he imbecile resolve to limit he family : a foul life have kill he only son and he only daughter have go off with a scion of the triumphant farm while he be now utterly alone weep and howl in he desert mill that mill which he have likewise disdain and which be crumble around he with old age you hear I he shout therese may drag herself at my foot but i will never never give she to you thief of a son you would like it would not you so that folk might mock I all over the district and so that you might eat I up as you have eat up all the other this finish to it all have doubtless appear to he confusedly in a sudden threatening vision : antonin be dead it be gregoire who would possess the mill if he should marry therese and he would possess the moorland also that enclosure hitherto leave barren with such savage delight and so passionately covet by the farm and doubtless he would cede it to the farm as soon as he should be the master the thought that chanteble might yet be increase by the field which he lepailleur have withhold from it bring the miller 's delirious rage to a climax you son i 'll send he to the galley and you if you do not go i 'll throw you out be off with you be off mathieu who be very pale slowly retire before this furious madman but as he go off he calmly say : you be a unhappy man i forgive you for you be in great grief besides i be quite easy sensible thing always end by take place again a month go by then one rainy morning in October madame lepailleur be find hang in the mill stable there be folk at janville who relate that lepailleur have hang she there the truth be that she have give sign of melancholia ever since the death of antonin moreover the life lead at the mill be no longer bearable day by day the husband and wife reproach one another for they son 's death and they daughter 's flight battle ragefully together like two abandon beast shut up in the same cage folk be merely astonished that such a harsh avaricious woman should have be willing to quit this life without take she goods and chattel with she as soon as therese hear of she mother 's death she hasten home repentant and take she place beside she father again unwilling as she be that he should remain alone in he two-fold bereavement at first it prove a terrible time for she in the company of that brutal old man who be exasperate by what he term he bad luck but she be a girl of sterling courage and prompt decision and thus after a few week she have make she father consent to she marriage with gregoire which as mathieu have say be the only sensible course the news give great relief at the farm whither the prodigal son have not yet dare to return it be believe that the young couple after elope together have live in some out of the way district of pari and it be even suspect that ambroise who be liberally mind have in a brotherly way help they with he purse and if on the one hand lepailleur consent to the marriage in a churlish distrustful manner -- like one who deem himself rob and be simply influence by the egotistical dread of some day find himself quite alone again in he gloomy house -- mathieu and marianne on the other side be delighted with a arrangement which put a end to a equivocal situation that have cause they the greatest suffering grieve as they be by the rebellion of one of they child curiously enough it come to pass that gregoire once marry and install at the mill in accordance with he wife 's desire agree with he father-in-law far better than have be anticipate this result in particular from a certain discussion during which lepailleur have wish to make gregoire swear that after he death he would never dispose of the moorland enclosure hitherto keep uncultivated with peasant stubbornness to any of he brother or sister of the farm gregoire take no oath on the subject but gayly declare that he be not such a fool as to despoil he wife of the best part of she inheritance particularly as he propose to cultivate those moor and within two or three year ' time make they the most fertile land in the district that which belong to he do not belong to other and people would soon see that he be well able to defend the property which have fall to he lot thing take a similar course with respect to the mill where gregoire at first contented himself with repair the old mechanism for he be unwilling to upset the miller 's habit all at once and therefore postpone until some future time the installation of a engine and the lay down of a line of rail to janville station -- all those idea formerly propound by mathieu which henceforth fermented in he audacious young mind in this wise then people find themselves in presence of a new gregoire the madcap have become wise only retain of he youthful folly the audacity which be needful for successful enterprise and it must be say that he be admirably second by the fair and energetic therese they be both enrapture at now be free to love each other in the romantic old mill garland with ivy pend the time when they would resolutely fling it to the ground to install in its place the great white meal store and huge new mill-stone which with they conquer ambition they often dream of during the year that follow mathieu and marianne witness other departure the three daughter louise madeleine and marguerite in turn take they flight from the family nest all three find husband in the district louise a plump brunette all gayety and health with abundant hair and large laughing eye marry notary mazaud of janville a quiet pensive little man whose occasional silent smile alone denote the perfect satisfaction which he feel at have find a wife of such joyous disposition then madeleine whose chestnut tress be tinge with gleaming gold and who be slimmer than she sister and of a more dreamy style of beauty she character and disposition refine by she musical taste make a love match which be quite a romance herbette the architect who become she husband be a handsome elegant man already celebrate he own near monvel a park-like estate where he come to rest at time from the fatigue of he labor in pari at last marguerite the least pretty of the girl -- indeed she be quite plain but derive a charm from she infinite goodness of heart -- be choose in marriage by dr chambouvet a big genial kindly fellow who have inherit he father 's practice at vieux-bourg where he live in a large white house which have become the resort of the poor and thus the three girl be marry the only one who remain with mathieu and marianne in the slowly empty nest be they two last boy nicola and benjamin at the same time however as the youngster fly away and install themselves elsewhere there come other little one a constant swarm due to the many family marriage in eight year deni who reign at the factory in paris have be present by he wife with three child two boy lucien and paul and a girl hortense then leonce the son of ambroise who be conquer such a high position in the commercial world now have a brother charle and two little sister pauline and sophie at the farm moreover gervai be already the father of two boy leon and henrus while claire he sister could count three child a boy joseph and two daughter lucile and angele there be also gregoire at the mill with a big boy who have receive the name of robert and there be also the three last married daughter -- louise with a girl two year old madeleine with a boy six month of age and marguerite who in anticipation of a happy event have decide to call she child stanisla if it be a boy and christine if it should be a girl thus upon every side the family oak spread out its branch its trunk fork and multiply and bough sprout from bough at each successive season and withal mathieu be not yet sixty and marianne not yet fifty-seven both still possess flourishing health and strength and gayety and be ever in delight at see the family which have spring from they thus grow and spread invade all the country around even like a forest bear from a single tree but the great and glorious festival of chanteble at that period be the birth of mathieu and marianne 's first great-grandchild -- a girl call angeline daughter of they granddaughter berthe in this little girl all pink and white the ever-regretted blaise seem to live again so closely do she resemble he that charlotte he widow already a grandmother in she forty-second year weep with emotion at the sight of she madame desvignes have die six month previously pass away even as she have live gently and discreetly at the termination of she task which have chiefly consist in rear she two daughter on the scanty means at she disposal still it be she who before quit the scene have find a husband for she granddaughter berthe in the person of philippe havard a young engineer who have recently be appoint assistant-manager at a state factory near mareuil it be at chantebled however that berthe 's little angeline be bear and on the day of the church the whole family assemble together there once more to glorify the great-grandfather and great-grandmother ah well say marianne gayly as she stand beside the babe 's cradle if the young one fly away there be other bear and so the nest will never be empty never never repeat mathieu with emotion proud as he feel of that continual victory over solitude and death we shall never be leave alone yet there come another departure which bring they many tear nicola the youngest but one of they boy who be approach he twentieth birthday and thus nigh the cross-road of life have not yet decide which one he would follow he be a dark sturdy young man with a open laughing face as a child he have adore tale of travel and far-away adventure and have always evince great courage and endurance return home enrapture from interminable ramble and never utter complaint however badly he foot might be blister and withal he possess a most orderly mind ever carefully arrange and classify he little belongings in he drawer and look down with contempt on the haphazard way in which he sister keep they thing later on as he grow up he become thoughtful as if he be vainly seek around he some means of realize he two-fold craving that of discover some new land and organize it properly one of the last-born of a numerous family he no longer find space enough for the amplitude and force of he desire he brother and sister have already take all the surround land and he stifle threaten also as it be with famine and ever seek the broad expanse that he dream of where he might grow and reap he bread no more room no more food at first he know not in which direction to turn but grope and hesitate for some month nevertheless he hearty laughter continue to gladden the house he weary neither he father nor he mother with the care of he destiny for he know that he be already strong enough to fix it himself there be no corner leave for he at the farm where gervai and claire take up all the room at the beauchene work deni be all sufficient reign there like a conscientious toiler and nothing justify a younger brother in claim a share beside he at the mill too gregoire be as yet barely establish and he kingdom be so small that he could not possibly cede half of it thus a opening be only possible with ambroise and nicola end by accept a oblige offer which the latter make to take he on trial for a few month by way of initiate he into the higher branch of commerce ambroise 's fortune be become prodigious since old uncle du hordel have die leave he he commission business year by year the new master increase he trade with all the country of the world thanks to he lucky audacity and broad international view he be enrich himself with the spoil of the earth and though nicola again begin to stifle in ambroise 's huge store-house where the riches of distant country the most varied clime be collect together it be there that he real vocation come to he for a voice suddenly arise call he away yonder to dim unknown region vast stretch of country yet sterile which need to be populate and clear and sow with the crop of the future for two month nicola keep silent respect the design which he be now mature he be extremely discreet as be all man of great energy who reflect before they act he must go that be certain since neither space nor sufficiency of sunlight remain for he in the cradle of he birth but if he go off alone would that not be go in a imperfect state deficient in the means need for the heroic task of populate and clear a new land he know a girl of janville one lisbeth moreau who be tall and strong and whose robust health seriousness and activity have charm he she be nineteen year of age and like nicola she stifle in the little nook to which destiny have confine she for she crave for the free and open air yonder afar off a orphan and long dependent on a aunt who be simply a little village haberdasher she have hitherto from feeling of affection remain cloistered in a small and gloomy shop but she aunt have lately die leave she some ten thousand franc and she dream be to sell the little business and go away and really live at last one October evening when nicola and lisbeth tell one another thing that they have never previously tell anybody they come to a understanding they resolutely take each other 's hand and plight they troth for life for the hard battle of create a new world a new family somewhere on the earth 's broad surface in those mysterious far away clime of which they know so little 'twa a delightful betrothal full of courage and faith only then everything have be settle do nicolas speak out announce he departure to he father and mother it be a autumn evening still mild but fraught with winter 's first shiver and the twilight be fall intense grief wring the parent ' heart as soon as they understand they son this time it be not simply a young one fly from the family nest to build he own on some neighbor tree of the common forest it be flight across the sea forever severance without hope of return

door for the last time wish he victory benjamin in wild grief seek a refuge beside he mother who be blind by she tear and she catch he up with a passionate clasp as if seize with fear that he also might leave she he be the only one now leave to they in the family nest xxi at the factory in she luxurious house on the quay where she have long reign as sovereign mistress constance for twelve year already have be wait for destiny remain rigid and stubborn amid the continual crumble of she life and hope during those twelve year beauchene have pursue a downward course the descent of which be fatal he be right at the bottom now in the last state of degradation after begin simply as a rove husband festively inclined he have end by live entirely away from he home principally in the company of two woman aunt and niece he be now but a pitiful human rag fast approach some shameful death and large as he fortune have be it have not suffice he as he grow older he have squander money yet more and more lavishly immense sum be swallow up in disreputable adventure the scandal of which it have be necessary to stifle thus he at last find himself poor receive but a small portion of the ever-increasing profit of the work which be in full prosperity this be the disaster which bring so much suffer to constance in she incurable pride beauchene since the death of he son have quite abandon himself to a dissolute life thinking of nothing but he pleasure and take no further interest in he establishment what be the use of defend it since there be no longer a heir to whom it might be transmit enlarged and enriched and thus he have surrender it bit by bit to deni he partner whom by degree he allow to become the sole master on arrive at the work deni have possess but one of the six share which represent the totality of the property accord to the agreement and beauchene have even reserve to himself the right of repurchase that share within a certain period but far from be in a position to do so before the appoint date be pass he have be oblige to cede yet another share to the young man in order to free himself of debt which he could not confess from that time forward it become a habit with beauchene to cede deni a fresh share every two year a third follow the second then come the turn of the fourth and the fifth in such wise indeed that after a final arrangement he have not even keep a whole share for himself but simply some portion of the sixth and even that be really fictitious for deni have only acknowledge it in order to have a pretext for provide he with a certain income which by the way he subdivide hand half of it to constance every month she therefore be ignorant of nothing she know that as a matter of fact the work would belong to that son of the hate froment whenever he might choose to close the door on they old master who as it happen be never see now in the workshop true there be a clause in the covenant which admit so long as that covenant should not be break the possibility of repurchase all the share at one and the same time be it then some mad hope of do this a fervent belief in a miracle in the possibility of some savior descend from heaven that keep constance thus rigid and stubborn await destiny those twelve year of vain waiting -- and increase decline do not seem to have diminish she conviction that in spite of everything she would some day triumph no doubt she tear have gush forth at chanteble in presence of the victory of mathieu and marianne but she soon recover she self-possession and live on in the hope that some unexpected occurrence would at last prove that she the childless woman be in the right she could not have say precisely what it be she wish she be simply bent on remain alive until misfortune should fall upon the over-numerous family to exculpate she for what have happen in she own home the loss of she son who be in the grave and the downfall of she husband who be in the gutter -- all the abomination indeed which have be so largely work by herself but which fill she with agony however much she heart might bleed over she loss she vanity as a honest bourgeoise fill she with rebellious thought for she could not admit that she have be in the wrong and thus she await the revenge of destiny in that luxurious house which be far too large now that she alone inhabit it she only occupy the room on the first floor where she shut herself up for day together with a old serve woman the sole domestic that she have retain gown in black as if bent on wear eternal mourning for maurice always erect stiff and haughtily silent she never complain although she covert exasperation have greatly affect she heart in such wise that she experience at time most terrible attack of stifle these she keep as secret as possible and one day when the old servant venture to go for doctor boutan she threaten she with dismissal she would not even answer the doctor and she refuse to take any remedy certain as she feel that she would last as long as the hope which buoy she up yet what anguish it be when she suddenly begin to stifle all alone in the empty house without son or husband near she she call nobody since she know that nobody would come and the attack over with what unconquerable obstinacy do she rise erect again repeat that she presence suffice to prevent deni from be the master from reign alone in full sovereignty and that in any case he would not have the house and install himself in it like a conqueror so long as she have not sink to death under the final collapse of the ceiling amid this retired life constance haunt as she be by she fixed idea have no other occupation than that of watch the factory and ascertain what go on there day by day morange whom she have make she confidant give she information in all simplicity almost every evening when he come to speak to she for a moment after leave he office she learn everything from he lip -- the successive sale of the share into which the property have be divide they gradual acquisition by deni and the fact that beauchene and herself be henceforth live on the new master 's liberality moreover she so organize she system of espionage as to make the old accountant tell she unwittingly all that he know of the private life lead by deni he wife marthe and they child lucien paul and hortense all indeed that be do and say in the modest little pavilion where the young people in spite of they increase fortune be still reside evince no ambitious haste to occupy the large house on the quay they do not even seem to notice what scanty accommodation they have in that pavilion while she alone dwell in the gloomy mansion which be so spacious that she seem quite lose in it and she be enraged too by they deference by the tranquil way in which they wait for she to be no more for she have be unable to make they quarrel with she and be oblige to show herself grateful for the means they give she and to kiss they child whom she hate when they bring she flower thus month and year go by and almost every evening when morange for a moment call on constance he find she in the same little silent salon gown in the same black dress and stiffen into a posture of obstinate expectancy though no sign be give of destiny 's revenge of the patiently hoped-for fall of misfortune upon other she never seem to doubt of she ultimate victory on the contrary when thing fall more and more heavily upon she she draw herself yet more erect defy fate buoy up by the conviction that it would at last be force to prove that she be right thus she remain immutable superior to fatigue and ever rely on a prodigy each evening when morange call during those twelve year the conversation invariably begin in the same way nothing fresh since yesterday dear madame no my friend nothing well the chief thing be to enjoy good health one can wait for better day oh nobody enjoy good health still one wait all the same and now one evening at the end of the twelve year as morange go in to see she he detect that the atmosphere of the little drawing-room be change quiver as it be with restrained delight amid the eternal silence nothing fresh since yesterday dear madame yes my friend there be something fresh something favorable i hope then something pleasant that you have be wait for something that i have be wait for -- yes what one know how to wait for always come he look at she in surprise feeling almost anxious when he see how altered she be with glitter eye and quick gesture what fulfilment of she desire after so many year of immutable mourning could have resuscitate she like that she smile she breathe vigorously as if she be relieve of the enormous weight which have so long crushed and immure she but when he ask the cause of she great happiness she say : i will not tell you yet my friend perhaps i do wrong to rejoice for everything be still very vague and doubtful only somebody tell I this morning certain thing which i must make sure of and think over when i have do so i shall confide in you you may rely on it for i tell you everything besides which i shall no doubt need you help so have a little patience some evening you shall come to dinner with I here and we shall have the whole evening before we to chat at we ease but ah _ mon dieu _ if it be only true if it be only the miracle at last more than three week elapse before morange hear anything further he see that constance be very thoughtful and very feverish but he do not even question she absorb as he himself be in the solitary not to say automatic life which he have make for himself he have lately complete he sixty-ninth year thirty year have go by since the death of he wife valerie more than twenty since he daughter reine have join she and he still ever live on in he methodical punctual manner amid the downfall of he existence never have man suffer more than he pass through greater tragedy experience keener remorse and withal he come and go in a careful correct way ever and ever prolong he career of mediocrity like one whom many may have forget but whom keenness of grief have preserve nevertheless morange have evidently sustain some internal damage of a nature to cause anxiety he be lapse into the most singular mania while obstinately retain possession of the over-large flat which he have formerly occupy with he wife and daughter he now live there absolutely alone for he have dismiss he servant and do he own marketing cooking and cleaning for ten year nobody but himself have be inside he room and the most filthy neglect be suspect there but in vain do the landlord speak of repair he be not allow even to cross the threshold moreover although the old accountant who be now white as snow with a long streaming beard remain scrupulously clean of person he wear a most wretched threadbare coat which he must have spend he evening in repair such too be he maniacal sordid avarice that he no longer spend a farthing on himself apart from the money which he pay for he bread -- bread of the commonest kind which he purchase every four day and eat when it be stale in order that he might make it last the longer this greatly puzzle the people who be acquaint with he and never a week go by without the house-porter propound the question : when a gentleman of such quiet habit earn eight thousand franc a year at he office and never spend a cent what can he do with he money some folk even try to reckon up the amount which morange must be pile in some corner and think that it might perhaps run to some hundred of thousand of franc but more serious trouble declare itself he be twice snatch away from certain death one day when deni be return homewards across the grenelle bridge he perceive morange lean far over the parapet watch the flow of the water and all ready to make a plunge if he have not be grasp by he coat-tail the poor man on recover he self-possession begin to laugh in he gentle way and talk of have feel giddy then on another occasion at the work victor moineaud push he away from some machinery in motion at the very moment when as if hypnotize he be about to surrender himself to its devour clutch then he again smile and acknowledge that he have do wrong in pass so near to the wheel after this he be watch for people come to the conclusion that he occasionally lose he head if deni retain he as chief accountant this be firstly from a feeling of gratitude for he long service but apart from that matter the extraordinary thing be that morange have never discharge he duty more ably obstinately trace every doubtful centime in he book and display the greatest accuracy over the longest addition always show a calm and restful face as though no tempest have ever assail he heart he cling tightly to he mechanical life like a discreet maniac who though people might not know it ought perhaps to have be place under restraint at the same time it should be mention that for some few year already there have be quite a big affair in morange 's life although he be constance 's confidant although she have make he she creature by the force of she despotic will he have gradually conceive the greatest affection for deni 's daughter hortense as this child grow up he fancy that he find in she he own long-mourned daughter reine she have recently complete she ninth year and each time that morange meet she he be throw into a state of emotion and adoration the more touching since it be all a divine illusion on he part for the two girl in no wise resemble each other the one have be extremely dark and the other be nearly fair in spite of he terrible avarice the accountant load hortense with doll and sweetmeat on every possible occasion and at last he affection for the child absorb he to such a degree that constance feel offend by it she thereupon give he to understand that whosoever be not entirely on she side be in reality against she to all appearance he make he submission in reality he only love the child the more for the thwarting of he passion and he watch for she in order to kiss she in secret in he daily intercourse with constance in show apparent fidelity to the former mistress of the work he now simply yield to fear like the poor weak be he be one whom constance have ever bent beneath she stern hand the pact between they be a old one it date from that monstrous thing which they alone know that complicity of which they never speak but which bind they so closely together he with he weak good nature seem from that day to have remain annihilated tame cow like a frightened animal since that day too he have learn many other thing and now no secret of the house remain unknown to he this be not surprising he have be live there so many year he have so often walk to and fro with he short discreet maniacal step hearing see and surprising everything however this madman who know the truth and who remain silent -- this madman leave free amid the mysterious drama enact in the beauchene ' home be gradually come to a rebellious mood particularly since he be compel to hide himself to kiss he little friend hortense he heart growl at the thought of it and he feel ready to explode should he passion be interfere with all at once one evening constance keep he to dinner and he suspect that the hour of she revelation have come on see how she quiver and how erectly she carry she little figure like a fighter henceforth certain of victory nevertheless although the servant leave they alone after bring in at one journey the whole of the frugal repast she do not broach the great affair at table she speak of the factory and then of deni and he wife marthe whom she criticise and she be even so foolish as to declare that hortense be badly behave ugly and destitute of grace the accountant like the coward he be listen to she never daring to protest in spite of the irritation and rebellion of he whole be well we shall see she say at last when one and all be put back into they proper place then she wait until they return to the little drawing-room and the door be shut behind they and it be only then near the fire amid the deep silence of the winter evening that she speak out on the subject which she have at heart : as i think i have already tell you my friend i have need of you you must obtain employment at the work for a young man in whom i be interested and if you desire to please I you will even take he into you own office morange who be seat in front of she on the other side of the chimney-piece give she a look of surprise but i be not the master he reply apply to the master he will certainly do whatever you ask no i do not wish to be indebted to deni in any way besides that would not suit my plan you yourself must recommend the young man and take he as a assistant coaching he and give he a post under you come you surely have the power to choose a clerk besides i insist on it she speak like a sovereign and he bow he back for he have obey people all he life first he wife then he daughter and now that dethrone old queen who terrify he in spite of the dim feeling of rebellion which have be grow within he for some time past no doubt i might take the young man on he say but who be he constance do not immediately reply she have turn towards the fire apparently for the purpose of raise a log of wood with the tong but in reality to give herself time for further reflection what good would it do to tell he everything at once she would some day be force to tell it he if she wish to have he entirely on she side but there be no hurry and she fancy that it would be skilful policy if at present she merely prepare the ground he be a young man whose position have touch I on account of certain recollection she reply perhaps you remember a girl who work here -- oh a very long time ago some thirty year at the least -- a certain norine moineaud one of old moineaud 's daughter morange have hastily raise he head and as sudden light flash on he memory he look at constance with dilated eye before he could even weigh he word he let everything escape he in a cry of surprise : alexandre-honore norine 's son the child of rougemont quite thunderstruck by those word constance drop the tong she be hold and gaze into the old man 's eye diving to the very depths of he soul ah you know then she say what be it you know you must tell I hide nothing speak i insist on it what he know why he know everything he speak slowly and at length as from the depths of a dream he have witness everything learn everything -- norine 's trouble the money give by beauchene to provide for she at madame bourdieu 's the child carry to the foundling hospital and then put out to nurse at rougemont whence he have flee after steal three hundred franc and the old accountant be even aware that the young scamp after strand on the pavement of pari have lead the vilest of life there but who tell you all that how do you know all that cry constance who feel full of anxiety he wave he arm with a vague sweeping gesture as if to take in all the surround atmosphere the whole house he know those thing because they be thing pertain to the place which people have tell he of or which he have guess he could no longer remember exactly how they have reach he but he know they well you understand say he when one have be in a place for more than thirty year thing end by come to one naturally i know everything everything constance start and deep silence fall he with he eye fix on the ember have sink back into the dolorous past she reflect that it be after all preferable that the position should be perfectly plain since he be acquaint with everything it be only needful that she with all determination and bravery should utilize he as she docile instrument alexandre-honore the child of rougemont she say yes that be the young man whom i have at last find again but be you also aware of the step which i take twelve year ago when i despaired of find he and actually think he dead morange nod affirmatively and she again go on speak relate that she have long since renounce she old plan when all at once destiny have reveal itself to she imagine a flash of lightning she exclaim it be on the morning of the day when you find I so move my sister-in-law seraphine who do not call on I four time a year come here to my great surprise at ten o'clock she have become very strange as you be aware and i do not at first pay any attention to the story which she begin to relate to I -- the story of a young man whom she have become acquaint with through some lady -- a unfortunate young man who have be spoil by bad company and whom one might save by a little help then what a blow it be my friend when she all at once speak out plainly and tell I of the discovery which she have make by chance i tell you it be destiny awaking and strike the story be indeed curious prematurely aged though she be seraphine amid she grow insanity continue to lead a wild rackety life and the strangest story be relate of she a singular caprice of hers give she own viciousness be to join as a lady patroness a society whose purpose be to succor and moralize young offender on they release from prison and it be in this wise that she have become acquaint with alexandre-honore now a big fellow of two-and-thirty who have just complete a term of six year ' imprisonment he have end by tell she he true story speaking of rougemont name norine he mother and relate the fruitless effort that he have make in former year to discover he father who be some immensely wealthy man in the midst of it seraphine suddenly understand everything and in particular why it be that he face have seem so familiar to she he striking resemblance to beauchene suffice to throw a vivid light upon the question of he parentage for fear of worry she herself tell he nothing but as she remember how passionately constance have at one time strive to find he she go to she and acquaint she with she discovery he know nothing as yet constance explain to morange my sister-in-law will simply send he here as if to a lady friend who will find he a good situation it appear that he now ask nothing better than to work if he have misconduct himself the unhappy fellow there have be many excuse for it and besides i will answer for he as soon as he be in my hand he will then only do as i tell he all that constance know respect alexandre 's recent year be a story which he have concoct and retail to seraphine -- a story to the effect that he owe he long term of imprisonment to a woman the real culprit who have be he mistress and whom he have refuse to denounce of course that imprisonment whatever its cause only account for six out of the twelve year which have elapse since he disappearance and the six other of which he say nothing might conceal many a act of ignominy and crime on the other hand imprisonment at least seem to have have a restful effect on he he have emerge from he long confinement calmer and keener-witted with the intention of spoil he life no longer and cleansed clad and school by seraphine he have almost become a presentable young man morange at last look up from the glowing ember at which he have be stare so fixedly well what do you want to do with he he inquire do he write a decent hand yes he handwriting be good no doubt however he know very little it be for that reason that i wish to intrust he to you you will polish he up for I and make he conversant with everything my desire be that in a year or two he should know everything about the factory like a master at that last word which enlighten he the accountant 's good sense suddenly awake amid the mania which be wreck he mind he have remain a man of figure with a passion for arithmetical accuracy and he protest well madame since you wish I to assist you pray tell I everything tell I in what work we can employ this young man here really now you surely can not hope through he to regain possession of the factory re-purchase the share and become sole owner of the place then with the greatest logic and clearness he show how foolish such a dream would be enumerate figure and fully set forth how large a sum of money would be need to indemnify deni who be install in the place like a conqueror besides dear madame i do not understand why you should take that young man rather than another he have no legal rights as you must be aware he could never be anything but a stranger here and i should prefer a intelligent honest man acquaint with we line of business constance have set to work poke the fire log with the tong when she at last look up she thrust she face towards the other 's and say in a low voice but violently : alexandre be my husband 's son he be the heir he be not the stranger the stranger be that deni that son of the froment who have rob we of we property you rend my heart you make it bleed my friend by force I to tell you this the answer she thus give be the answer of a conservative bourgeoise who hold that it would be more just if the inheritance should go to a illegitimate scion of the house rather than to a stranger doubtless the woman the wife the mother within she bleed even as she herself acknowledge but she sacrifice everything to she rancor she would drive the stranger away even if in do so she own flesh should be lacerate then too it vaguely seem to she that she husband 's son must be in some degree she own since he father be likewise the father of the son to whom she have give birth and who be dead besides she would make that young fellow she son she would direct he she would compel he to be hers to work through she and for she you wish to know how i shall employ he in the place she resume i myself do not know it be evident that i shall not easily find the hundred of thousand of franc which may be require you figure be accurate and it be possible that we may never have the money to buy back the property but all the same why not fight why not try and besides -- i will admit it -- suppose we be vanquish well then so much the worse for the other for i assure you that if this young man will only listen to I he will then become the agent of destruction the avenger and punisher implant in the factory to wreck it with a gesture which summon ruin athwart the wall she finish express she abominable hope among she vague plan rear upon hate be that of employ the wretched alexandre as a destructive weapon whose ravages would bring she some relief should she lose all other battle that would assuredly be the final one and she have attain to this pitch of madness through the boundless despair in which the loss of she only son have plunge she withered consume by a love which she could not content then demented pervert to the point of crime morange shudder when with she stubborn fierceness she conclude : for twelve year past i have be wait for a stroke of destiny and here it be i would rather perish than not draw from it the last chance of good fortune which it bring I this mean that deni 's ruin be decide on and would be effect if destiny be willing and the old accountant could picture the disaster : innocent child strike down in the person of they father a great and most unjust catastrophe which make he kindly heart rise in rebellion would he allow that fresh crime to be commit without shout aloud all that he know doubtless the memory of the other crime the first one the monstrous bury crime about which they both keep silence return at that horrible moment and shine out disturbingly in he eye for she herself shudder as if she could see it there while with the view of master he she gaze at he fixedly for a moment as they peer into one another 's eye they live once more beside the murderous trap and shiver in the cold gust which rise from the abyss and this time again morange like a poor weak man overpower by a woman 's will be vanquish and do not speak so it be agree my friend she softly resume i rely on you to take alexandre in the first place as a clerk you can see he here one evening at five o'clock after dusk for i do not wish he to know at first what interest i take in he shall we say the day after to-morrow yes the evening of the day after to-morrow if it please you dear madame on the morrow morange display so much agitation that the wife of the door-porter of the house where he reside a woman who be ever watch he impart she fear to she husband the old gentleman be certainly go to have a attack for he have forget to put on he slipper when he come downstairs to fetch some water in the morning and besides he go on talk to himself and look dreadfully upset the most extraordinary incident of the day however be that after lunch morange quite forget himself and be a hour late in return to he office a lack of punctuality which have no precedent which in the memory of everybody at the work have never occur before as a matter of fact morange have be carry away as by a storm and walk straight before he have once more find himself on the grenelle bridge where deni have one day save he from the fascination of the water and some force some impulse have carry he again to the very same spot and make he lean over the same parapet gaze in the same way as previously at the flow river ever since the previous evening he have be repeat the same word word which he stammer in a undertone and which haunt and tortured he would he allow that fresh crime to be commit without shout aloud what he know no doubt it be those word of which he could not rid himself that have make he forget to put on he slipper in the morning and that have just now again daze he to the point of prevent he from return to the factory as if he no longer recognize the entrance as he pass it and if he be at present lean over that water have he not be impel thither by a unconscious desire to have do with all he trouble a instinctive hope of drown the torment into which he be throw by those stubbornly recur word down below at the bottom of the river those word would at last cease he would no longer repeat they he would no longer hear they urge he to a act of energy for which he could not find sufficient strength and the call of the water be very gentle and it would be so pleasant to have to struggle no longer to yield to destiny like a poor soft-hearted weakling who have live too long morange lean forward more and more and in fancy could already feel the sonorous river seize he when a gay young voice in the rear recall he to reality what be you look at monsieur morange be there any big fish there it be hortense look extremely pretty and tall already for she ten year whom a maid be conduct on a visit to some little friend at auteuil and when the distract accountant turn round he remain for a moment with tremble hand and eye moist with tear at the sight of that apparition that dear angel who have recall he from so far what be it you my pet he exclaim no no there be no big fish i think that they hide at the bottom because the water be so cold in winter be you go on a visit you look quite beautiful in that fur-trimmed cloak the little girl begin to laugh well pleased at be flatter and love for she old friend 's voice quiver with adoration yes yes i be very happy there be to be some private theatricals where i be go oh it be amusing to feel happy she speak those word like he own reine might formerly have speak they and he could have go down on he knee to kiss she little hand like a idol 's but it be necessary that you should always be happy he reply you look so beautiful i must really kiss you oh you may monsieur morange i be quite willing ah you know the doll you give I she name 's margot and you have no idea how good she be come to see she some day he have kiss she and with glowing heart ready for martyrdom he watch she as she go off in the pale light of winter what he have think of would be too cowardly : besides that child must be happy he slowly quit the bridge while within he the haunting word ring out with decisive distinctness demand a reply : would he allow that fresh crime to be commit without shout aloud what he know no no it be impossible : he would speak he would act nevertheless he mind remain clouded befogged how could he speak how could he act then to crown he extravagant conduct utterly break away from the habit of forty year he no sooner return to the office than instead of immediately plunge into he everlasting addition he begin to write a long letter this letter which be address to mathieu recount the whole affair -- alexandre 's resurrection constance 's plan and the service which he himself have promise to render she these thing be set down simply as he impulse dictate like a kind of confession by which he relieve he feeling he have not yet come to any positive decision as to how he should play the part of a justiciar which seem so heavy to he shoulder he one purpose be to warn mathieu in order that there might be two of they to decide and act and he simply finish by ask the other to come to see he on the follow evening though not before six o'clock as he desire to see alexandre and learn how the interview pass off and what constance might require of the young man the ensue night the ensue day must have be full of abominable torment for morange the doorkeeper 's wife recount later on that the fourth-floor tenant have hear the old gentleman walk about overhead all through the night door be slam and furniture be drag about as if for a removal it be even think that one could detect cry sob and the monologue of a madman address phantom some mysterious rendering of worship to the dead who haunt he and at the work during the day which follow morange give alarming sign of distress of the final sinking of he mind into a flood of gloom ever dart troubled glance around he he be tortured by internal combat which without the slightest motive make he descend the stair a dozen time linger before the machinery in motion and then return to he addition up above with the bewildered distract air of one who could not find what he seek so painfully when the darkness fall about four o'clock on that gloomy winter day the two clerk whom he have with he in he office notice that he altogether cease work from that moment indeed he wait with he eye fix upon the clock and when five o'clock strike he once more make sure that a certain total be correct then rise and go out leave the ledger open as if he mean to return to check the next addition he follow the gallery which lead to the passage connect the workshop with the private house the whole factory be at that hour light up electric lamp cast the brightness of daylight over it while the stir of work ascend and the wall shake amid the rumble of machinery and all at once before reach the passage morange perceive the lift the terrible cavity the abyss of murder in which blaise have meet he death fourteen year previously subsequent to that catastrophe and in order to prevent the like of it from ever occur again the trap have be surround by a balustrade with a gate in such wise that a fall become impossible unless one should open the gate expressly to take a plunge at that moment the trap be lower and the gate be close and morange yield to some superior force bent over the cavity shudder the whole scene of long ago rise up before he he be again in the depths of that frightful void he could see the crushed corpse and he could feel the gust of terror chill he in the presence of murder accept and conceal since he suffer so dreadfully since he could no longer sleep since he have promise he dear dead one that he would join they why should he not make a end of himself two day previously while lean over the parapet of the grenelle bridge a desire to do so have take possession of he he merely have to lose he equilibrium and he would be liberate lay to rest in the peaceful earth between he wife and he daughter and all at once as if the abyss itself suggest to he the frightful solution for which he have be vainly grope in he grow madness for two day past he think that he could hear a voice call he from below the voice of blaise which cry : come with the other one come with the other one he start violently and draw himself erect decision have fall on he in a lightning flash insane as he be that appear to he to be the one sole logical mathematical sensible solution which would settle everything it seem to he so simple too that he be astonish that he have seek it so long and from that moment this poor soft-hearted weakling whose wretched brain be unhinge give proof of iron will and sovereign heroism assist by the clearest reasoning the most subtle craft in the first place he prepare everything set the catch to prevent the trap from be send up again in he absence and also assure himself that the balustrade door open and close easily he come and go with a light aerial step as if carry off he foot with he eye ever on the alert anxious as he be to be neither see nor hear at last he extinguish the three electric lamp and plunge the gallery into darkness from below through the gaping cavity the stir of the work factory the rumble of the machinery ever ascend and it be only then everything be ready that morange turn into the passage to betake himself to the little drawing room of the mansion constance be there wait for he with alexandre she have give instruction for the latter to call half-an-hour earlier for she wish to confess he while as yet tell he nothing of the real position which she mean he to take in the house she be not dispose to place herself all at once at he mercy and have therefore simply express she willingness to give he employment in accordance with the recommendation of she relative the baroness de lowicz nevertheless she study he with restrained ardor and be well pleased to find that he be strong sturdy and resolute with a hard face light by terrible eye which promise she a avenger she would finish polish he up and then he would suit she perfectly for he part without plainly understand the truth he scented something divine that he fortune be at hand and be quite ready to wait awhile for the certain feast like a young wolf who consent to be domesticate in order that he may later on devour the whole flock at he ease when morange go in only one thing strike he alexandre 's resemblance to beauchene that extraordinary resemblance which have already upset constance and which now send a icy chill through the old accountant as if in purposing to carry out he idea he have condemn he old master i be wait for you my friend you be late you who be so punctual as a rule say constance yes there be a little work which i wish to finish but she have merely be jest she feel so happy and she immediately settle everything : well here be the gentleman whom i speak about she say you will begin by take he with you and make he acquaint with the business even if in the first instance you can merely send he about on commission for you it be understand be it not quite so dear madame i will take he with I you may rely on I then as she give alexandre he dismissal say that he might come on the morrow morange offer to show he out by way of he office and the workshop which be still open in that way he will form a acquaintance with the work and can come straight to I to-morrow constance laugh again so fully do the accountant 's obligingness reassure she that be a good idea my friend she say thank you and au revoir monsieur we will take charge of you future if you behave sensibly at this moment however she be thunderstruck by a extravagant and seemingly senseless incident morange have show alexandre out of the little salon in advance of himself turn round towards she with the sudden grimace of a madman reveal he insanity by the distortion of he countenance and in a low familiar sneering voice he stammer in she face : ha ha blaise at the bottom of the hole he speak he have speak to I ha ha the somersault you would have the somersault and you shall have it again the somersault the somersault then he disappear follow alexandre she have listen to he agape with wonder it be all so unforeseen so idiotic that at first she do not understand it but afterwards what a flash of light come to she that which morange have refer to be the murder yonder -- the thing to which they have never refer the monstrous thing which they have keep bury for fourteen year past which they glance only have confess but which all of a sudden he have cast in she tooth with the grimace of a madman what be the meaning of the poor fool 's diabolical rebellion the dim threat which she have feel pass like a gust from a abyss she turn frightfully pale she intuitively foresee some frightful revenge of destiny that destiny which only a moment previously she have believe to be she minion yes it be surely that and she feel herself carry fourteen year backward and she remain stand quiver icy cold listen to the sound which arise from the work wait for the awful thud of the fall even as on the distant day when she have listen and wait for the other to be crush and kill meantime morange with he discreet short step be lead alexandre away and speak to he in a quiet good-natured voice i must ask you pardon for go first but i have to show you the way oh this be a very intricate place with stair and passage whose turn and twist never end the passage now turn to the leave you see then on reach the gallery where the darkness be complete he affect anger in the most natural manner possible ah well that be just they way they have not yet light up this part the switch be at the other end fortunately i know where to step for i have be go backwards and forwards here for the last forty year mind follow I carefully thereupon at each successive step he warn the other what he ought to do guide he along in he oblige way without the faintest tremor in he voice do not let go of I turn to the leave -- now we merely have to go straight ahead -- only wait a moment a barrier intersect the gallery and there be a gate -- there we be i be open the gate you hear -- follow I i 'll go first morange quietly step into the void amid the darkness and without a cry he fall alexandre who be close in the rear almost touch he so as not to lose he certainly detect the void and the gust which follow the fall as with sudden horror the flooring fail beneath they but force of motion carry he on he step forward in he turn howl and likewise fall head over heel both be smash below both kill at once true morange still breathe for a few seconds alexandre for he part lay with he skull break to piece and he brain scatter on the very spot where blaise have be pick up horrible be the stupefaction when those body be find there nobody could explain the catastrophe morange carry off he secret the reason for that savage act of justice which he have accomplish accord to the chance suggestion of he dementia perhaps he have wish to punish constance perhaps he have desire to repair the old wrong : deni long since stricken in the person of he brother and now save for the sake of he daughter hortense who would live happily with margot the pretty doll who be so good by suppress the criminal instrument the old accountant have indeed avert the possibility of a fresh crime sway by he fixed idea however he have doubtless never reason that cataclysmic deed of justice which be above reason and which pass by with the impassive savagery of a death-dealing hurricane at the work there be but one opinion morange have assuredly be mad and he alone could have cause the accident particularly as it be impossible to account otherwise than by a act of madness for the extinguishing of the light the opening of the balustrade-door and the plunge into the cavity which he know to be there and into which have follow he the unfortunate young man he companion moreover the accountant 's madness be no longer doubt by anybody a few day later when the doorkeeper of he house related he final eccentricity and a commissary of police go to search he room he have be mad mad enough to be place in confinement to begin nobody have ever see a flat in such a extraordinary condition the kitchen a perfect stable the drawing-room in a state of utter abandonment with its loui xiv furniture gray with dust and the dining-room all topsy-turvy the old oak table and chair be pile up against the window as if to shut out every ray of light though nobody could tell why the only properly keep room be that in which reine have formerly sleep which be as clean as a sanctuary with its pitch-pine furniture as bright as if it have be polish every day but the apartment in which morange 's madness become unmistakably manifest be he own bedchamber which he have turn into a museum of souvenir cover its wall with photograph of he wife and daughter above a table there the wall face the window quite disappear from view for a sort of little chapel have be set up deck with a multitude of portrait in the center be photograph of valerie and reine both of they at twenty year of age so that they look like twin sister while symmetrically dispose all around be a extraordinary number of other portrait again show valerie and reine now as child now as girl and now as woman in every sort of position too and every kind of toilet and below they on the table like a offering on a altar be find more than one hundred thousand franc in gold and silver and even copper indeed the whole fortune which morange have be save up for several year by eat only dry bread like a pauper at last then one know what he have do with he savings he have give they to he dead wife and daughter who have remain he will passion and ambition haunt by remorse at have kill they while dream of make they rich he reserve for they that money which they have so keenly desire and which they would have spend with so much ardor it be still and ever for they that he earn it and he take it to they lavish it upon they never devote even a tithe of it to any egotistical pleasure absorb as he be in he vision-fraught worship and eager to pacify and cheer they spirit and the whole neighborhood gossip endlessly about the old mad gentleman who have let himself die of wretchedness by the side of a perfect treasure pile coin by coin upon a table and for twenty year past tender to the portrait of he wife and daughter even as flower might have be offer to they memory about six o'clock when mathieu reach the work he find the place terrify by the catastrophe ever since the morning he have be render anxious by morange 's letter which have greatly surprised and worried he with that extraordinary story of alexandre turn up once more be welcome by constance and introduce by she into the establishment plain as be the greater part of the letter it contain some singularly incoherent passage and dart from one point to another with incomprehensible suddenness mathieu have read it three time indulge on each occasion in fresh hypothesis of a gloomier and gloomier nature for the more he reflect the more do the affair seem to he to be fraught with menace then on reach the rendezvous appoint by morange he find himself in presence of those bleed body which victor moineaud have just pick up and lay out side by side silent chill to he bone mathieu listen to he son deni who have hasten up to tell he of the unexplainable misfortune the two man fall one atop of the other first the old mad accountant and then the young fellow whom nobody know and who seem to have drop from heaven mathieu for he part have immediately recognize alexandre and if pale and terrify he keep silent on the subject it be because he desire to take nobody not even he son into he confidence give the fresh supposition the frightful supposition which now arise in he mind from out of all the darkness he listen with grow anxiety to the enumeration of the few point which be certain : the extinguishing of the electric light in the gallery and the opening of the balustrade door which be always keep closed and could only have be open by some habitue since to turn the handle one have to press a secret spring which keep it from move and all at once as victor moineaud point out that the old man have certainly be the first to fall since one of the young man 's leg have be stretch across he stomach mathieu be carry fourteen year backward he remember old moineaud pick up blaise on the very spot where victor the son have just pick up morange and alexandre blaise at the thought of he dead boy fresh light come to mathieu a frightful suspicion blaze up amid the terrible obscurity in which he have be grope and doubt and thereupon leave deni to settle everything down below he decide to see constance up above however when mathieu be on the point of turn into the communicate passage he pause once more this time near the lift it be there fourteen year previously that morange find the trap open have go down to warn and chide the workman while constance accord to she own account have quietly return into the house at the very moment when blaise come from the other end of the dim gallery plunge into the gulf everybody have eventually accept that narrative as be accurate but mathieu now feel that it be mendacious he could recall various glance various word various spell of silence and sudden certainty come upon he a certainty base on all the petty thing which he have not then understand but which now assume the most frightful significance yes it be certain even though round it there hover the monstrous vagueness of silent crime cowardly crime over which a shadow of horrible mystery always lurk moreover it explain the sequel those two body lie below as far that be as logical reasoning can explain a madman 's action with all its gap and mysteriousness nevertheless mathieu still strive to doubt before anything else he wish to see constance show a waxy pallor she have remain erect motionless in the middle of she little drawing-room the waiting of fourteen year previously have begin once more lasting on and on and fill she with such anxiety that she hold she breath the better to listen nothing no stir no sound of footstep have yet ascend from the work what could be happen then be the hateful thing the dreaded thing merely a nightmare after all yet morange have really sneer in she face she have fully understand he have not a howl the thud of a fall just reach she ear and now have not the rumble of the machinery cease it be death the factory silent chill and lose for she all at once she heart cease beat as she detect a sound of footstep draw nearer and nearer with increase rapidity the door open and it be mathieu who come in she recoil livid as at the sight of a ghost he o god why he how be it he be there of all the messenger of misfortune he be the one whom she have least expect have the dead son rise before she she would not have shudder more dreadfully than she do at this apparition of the father she do not speak he simply say : they make the plunge they be both dead -- like blaise then though she still say nothing she look at he for a moment they eye meet and in she glance he read everything : the murder be begin afresh effect consummate over yonder lay the body dead one atop of the other wretched woman to what monstrous perversity have you fall and how much blood there be upon you by a effort of supreme pride constance be able to draw herself up and even increase she stature still wish to conquer and cry aloud that she be indeed the murderess that she have always thwart he and would ever do so but mathieu be already overwhelming she with a final revelation you do not know then that that ruffian alexandre be one of the murderer of you friend madame angelin the poor woman who be rob and strangle one winter afternoon i compassionately hide that from you but he would now be at the galley have i speak out and if i be to speak to-day you would be there too that be the hatchet-stroke she do not speak but drop all of a lump upon the carpet like a tree which have be fell this time she defeat be complete destiny which she await have turn against she and throw she to the ground a mother the less pervert by the love which she have set on she one child a mother dupe rob and madden who have glide into murder amid the dementia bear of inconsolable motherliness and now she lay there stretch out scraggy and withered poison by the affection which she have be unable to bestow mathieu become anxious and summon the old servant who after procure assistance carry she mistress to she bed and then undress she meantime as constance give no sign of life seize as she be by one of those faint fit which often leave she quite breathless mathieu himself go for boutan and meeting he just as he be return home for dinner be luckily able to bring he back at once boutan who be now nearly seventy-two and be quietly spend he last year in serene cheerfulness bear of he hope in life have virtually cease practise only attend a very few old patient he friend however he do not refuse mathieu 's request when he have examine constance he make a gesture of hopelessness the meaning of which be so plain that mathieu he anxiety increase bethought himself of try to find beauchene in order that the latter might at least be present if he wife should die but the old servant on be question begin by raise she arm to heaven she do not know where monsieur might be monsieur never leave any address at last feeling frighten herself she make up she mind to hasten to the abode of the two woman aunt and niece with whom beauchene spend the greater part of he time she know they address perfectly well as she mistress have even send she thither in press emergency but she learn that the lady have go with monsieur to nice for a holiday whereupon not desire to return without some member of the family she be seize on she way back with the fine idea of call on monsieur 's sister the baroness de lowicz whom she bring almost by force in she cab it be in vain that boutan attempt treatment when constance open she eye again she look at he fixedly recognize he no doubt and then lower she eyelid and from that moment she obstinately refuse to reply to any question that be put to she she must have hear and have know that people be there try to succor she but she would have none of they succor she be stubbornly intent on die on give no further sign of life neither do she raise she eyelid nor do she lip part again it be as if she have already quit the world amid the mute agony of she defeat that evening seraphine 's manner be extremely strange she reek of ether for she drink ether now when she hear of the two-fold accident the death of morange and that of alexandre which have bring on constance 's cardiacal attack she simply give a insane grin a kind of involuntary snigger and stammer : ah that be funny though she remove neither she hat nor she glove she install herself in a armchair where she sit wait with she eye wide open and stare straight before she -- those brown eye fleck with gold whose living light be all that she have retain of she massacred beauty at sixty-two she look like a centenarian she bold insolent face be ravine as it be by she stormy life and the glow of she sun-like hair have be extinguish by a shower of ash and time go on midnight approach and she be still there near that death-bed of which she seem to be ignorant in that quiver chamber where she forget herself similar to a mere thing apparently no longer even know why she have be bring thither mathieu and boutan have be unwilling to retire since monsieur be at nice in the company of those lady the aunt and the niece they decide to spend the night there in order that constance might not be leave alone with the old servant and towards midnight while they be chat together in undertone they be suddenly stupefy at hear seraphine raise she voice after preserve silence for three hour he be dead you know say she who be dead at last they understand that she refer to dr gaude the celebrated surgeon have indeed be find in he consulting-room strike down by sudden death the cause of which be not clearly know in fact the strangest the most horrible and tragical story be current on the subject accord to one of they a patient have wreak vengeance on the doctor and mathieu full of emotion recall that one day long ago seraphine herself have suggest that all gaude 's unhappy patient ought to band themselves together and put a end to he when seraphine perceive that mathieu be gaze at she as in a nightmare move by the shudder silence of that death-watch she once more grin like a lunatic and say : he be dead we be all there it be insane improbable impossible and yet be it true or be it false a cold terrifying quiver sweep by the icy quiver of mystery of that which one know not which one will never know boutan lean towards mathieu and whisper in he ear : she will be rave mad and shut up in a padded cell before a week be over and indeed a week later the baroness de lowicz be wear a straight waistcoat in she case dr gaude 's treatment have lead to absolute insanity mathieu and boutan watch beside constance until daybreak she never open she lip nor raise she eyelid as the sun rise up she turn towards the wall and then she die xxii still more year pass and mathieu be already sixty-eight and marianne sixty-five when amid the increase good fortune which they owe to they faith in life and they long courageous hopefulness a last battle the most dolorous of they existence almost strike they down and send they to the grave despairing and inconsolable one evening marianne go to bed quiver utterly distract quite a rend be take place in the family a disastrous and hateful quarrel have set the mill where gregoire reign supreme against the farm which be manage by gervai and claire and ambroise on be select as arbiter have fan the flame by judge the affair in a purely business way from he pari counting-house without take into account the various passion which be kindle it be on return from a secret application to ambroise prompt by a maternal longing for peace that marianne have take to she bed wound to the heart and terrify by the thought of the future ambroise have receive she roughly almost brutally and she have go back home in a state of intense anguish feeling as if she own flesh be lacerate by the quarrelling of she ungrateful son and she have keep she bed beg mathieu to say nothing and explain that a doctor 's service would be useless since she do not suffer from any malady she be fading away however as he could well detect she be day by day take leave of he carry off by she bitter grief be it possible that all those loving and well-loved child who have grow up under they care and they caress who have become the joy and pride of they victory all those child bear of they love unite in they fidelity a sacred brotherly sisterly battalion gather close around they be it possible that they should now disband and desperately seek to destroy one another if so it be true then that the more a family increase the greater be the harvest of ingratitude and still more accurate become the say that to judge of any human being 's happiness or unhappiness in life one must wait until he be dead ah say mathieu as he sit near marianne 's bed hold she feverish hand to think of it to have struggle so much and to have triumph so much and then to encounter this supreme grief which will bring we more pain than all the other decidedly it be true that one must continue battle until one 's last breath and that happiness be only to be win by suffer and tear we must still hope still triumph and conquer and live marianne however have lose all courage and seem to be overwhelm no say she i have no energy leave I i be vanquish i be always able to heal the wound which come from without but this wound come from my own blood my blood pour forth within I and stifle I all we work be destroy we joy we health we strength have at the last day become mere lie then mathieu whom she grievous fear of a disaster gain go off to weep in the adjoining room already picture he wife dead and himself in utter solitude it be with reference to lepailleur 's moorland the plot intersect the chantebled estate that the wretched quarrel have break out between the mill and the farm for many year already the romantic ivy-covered old mill with its ancient mossy wheel have cease to exist gregoire at last put he father 's idea into execution have throw it down to replace it by a large steam mill with spacious meal-store which a light railway-line connect with janville station and he himself since he have be make a big fortune -- for all the wheat of the district be now send to he -- have greatly change with nothing of he youthful turbulence leave save a quick temper which he wife therese with she brave loving heart alone could somewhat calm on a score of occasion he have almost break off all relation with he father-in-law lepailleur who certainly abuse he seventy year though the old miller in spite of all he prophecy of ruin have be unable to prevent the building of the new establishment he none the less sneer and jeer at it exasperate as he be at have be in the wrong he have in fact be beat for the second time not only do the prodigious crop of chantebled disprove he theory of the bankruptcy of the earth that villainous earth in which like a obstinate peasant weary of toil and eager for speedy fortune he assert nothing more would grow but now that mill of he which he have so disdain be bear as it be afresh grow to a gigantic size and become in he son-in-law 's hand a instrument of great wealth the worst be that lepailleur so stubbornly live on experience continual defeat but never willing to acknowledge that he be beat one sole delight remain to he the promise give and keep by gregoire that he would not sell the moorland enclosure to the farm the old man have even prevail on he to leave it uncultivated and the sight of that sterile tract intersect the wavy greenery of the beautiful estate of chanteble like a spot of desolation well pleased he spiteful nature he be often to be see stroll there like a old king of the stone and the bramble draw up he tall scraggy figure as if he be quite proud of the poverty of that soil in go thither one of he object doubtless be to find a pretext for a quarrel for it be he who in the course of one of these promenade when he display such provoke insolence discover a encroachment on the part of the farm -- a encroachment which he comment magnify to such a degree that disastrous consequence seem probable as it be all the happiness of the froment be for a time destroy in business matter gregoire invariably show the rough impulsiveness of a man of sanguine temperament obstinately determine to part with no fraction of he rights when he father-in-law tell he that the farm have impudently clear some seven acre of he moorland with the intention no doubt of carry this fine robbery even further if it be not promptly stop gregoire at once decide to inquire into the matter declare that he would not tolerate any invasion of that sort the misfortune then be that no boundary stone could be find thus the people of the farm might assert that they have make a mistake in all good faith or even that they have remain within they limit but lepailleur ragefully maintain the contrary enter into particulars and trace what he declare to be the proper frontier line with he stick swearing that within a few inch it be absolutely correct however matter go altogether from bad to worse after a interview between the brother gervai and gregoire in the course of which the latter lose he temper and indulge in unpardonable language on the morrow too he begin a action-at-law to which gervai reply by threaten that he would not send another grain of corn to be ground at the mill and this rupture of business relation mean serious consequence for the mill which really owe its prosperity to the custom of chanteble from that moment matter grow worse each day and conciliation soon seem to be out of the question for ambroise on be solicit to find a basis of agreement become in he turn impassion and even end by enrage both party thus the hateful ravages of that fratricidal war be increase : there be now three brother up in arm against one another and do not this forebode the end of everything might not this destructive fury gain the whole family overwhelming it as with a blast of folly and hatred after so many year of sterling good sense and strong and healthy affection mathieu naturally try to intervene but at the very outset he feel that if he should fail if he paternal authority should be disregard the disaster would become irreparable without renounce the struggle he therefore wait for some opportunity which he might turn to good account at the same time each successive day of discord increase he anxiety it be really all he own life-work the little people which have spring from he the little kingdom which he have found under the benevolent sun that be threaten with sudden ruin a work such as this can only live by force of love the love which create it can alone perpetuate it it crumble as soon as the bond of fraternal solidarity be break thus it seem to mathieu that instead of leave he work behind he in full florescence of kindliness joy and vigor he would see it cast to the ground in fragment soil and dead even before he be dead himself yet what a fruitful and prosperous work have hitherto be that estate of chantebled whose overflow fertility increase at each successive harvest and that mill too so enlarged and so flourishing which be the outcome of he own inspiring suggestion to say nothing of the prodigious fortune which he conquer son have acquire in paris yet it be all this admirable work which faith in life have create that a fratricidal onslaught upon life be about to destroy one evening in the mournful gloaming of one of the last day of September the couch on which marianne lay die of silent grief be by she desire roll to the window charlotte alone nurse she and of all she son she have but the last one benjamin beside she in the now over-spacious house which have replace the old shooting-box since the family have be at war she have keep the door close intent on open they only to she child when they become reconcile if they should then seek to make she happy by come to embrace one another beneath she roof but she virtually despair of that sole cure for she grief the only joy that would make she live again that evening as mathieu come to sit beside she and they linger there hand in hand accord to they wont they do not at first speak but gaze straight before they at the spreading plain at the estate whose interminable field blended with the mist far away at the mill yonder on the bank of the yeuse with its tall smoking chimney and at paris itself on the horizon where a tawny cloud be rise as from the huge furnace of some forge the minute slowly pass away during the afternoon mathieu have take a long walk in the direction of the farm of mareuil and lillebonne in the hope of quiet he torment by physical fatigue and in a low voice as if speak to himself he at last say : the plough could not take place under better condition yonder on the plateau the quality of the soil have be much improve by the recent method of cultivation and here too on the slope the sandy soil have be greatly enrich by the new distribution of the spring which gervai devise the estate have almost double in value since it have be in he hand and claire 's there be no break in the prosperity labor yield unlimited victory what be the good of it if there be no more love murmur marianne then too continued mathieu after a pause i go down to the yeuse and from a distance i see that gregoire have receive the new machine which deni have just build for he it be be unloaded in the yard it seem that it impart a certain movement to the mill-stone which save a good third of the power need with such appliance the earth may produce sea of corn for innumerable nation they will all have bread and that mill-engine with its regular breath and motion will produce fresh wealth also what use be it if people hate one another marianne exclaim at this mathieu drop the subject but in accordance with a resolution which he have form during he walk he tell he wife that he mean to go to pari on the morrow and on notice she surprise he pretend that he wish to see to a certain business matter the settlement of a old account but the truth be that he could no longer endure the spectacle of he wife 's linger agony which bring he so much suffer he wish to act to make a supreme effort at reconciliation at ten o'clock on the follow morning when mathieu alight from the train at the pari terminus he drive direct to the factory at grenelle before everything else he wish to see deni who have hitherto take no part in the quarrel for a long time now indeed ever since constance 's death deni have be install in the house on the quay with he wife marthe and they three child this occupation of the luxurious dwelling set apart for the master have be like a final entry into possession with respect to the whole work true beauchene have live several year longer but he name no longer figure in that of the firm he have surrender he last shred of interest in the business for a annuity and at last one evening it be learn that he have die that day strike down by a attack of apoplexy after a over-copious lunch at the residence of he lady-friend the aunt and the niece he have previously be sink into a state of second childhood the outcome of he life of fast and furious pleasure and this then be the end of the egotistical debauchee ever go from bad to worse and finally sweep into the gutter why what good wind have blow you here cry deni gayly when he perceive he father have you come to lunch i be still a bachelor you know for it be only next Monday that i shall go to fetch marthe and the child from dieppe where they have spend a delightful September then on hearing that he mother be ail even in danger he become serious and anxious mamma ill and in danger you amaze I i think she be simply trouble with some little indisposition but come father what be really the matter be you hide something be something worry you thereupon he listen to the plain and detailed statement which mathieu feel oblige to make to he and he be deeply move by it as if the dread of the catastrophe which it foreshadow would henceforth upset he life what he angrily exclaim my brother be up to these fine prank with they idiotic quarrel i know that they do not get on well together i have hear of thing which sadden I but i never imagine that matter have go so far and that you and mamma be so affect that you have shut yourselve up and be die of it all but thing must be set to rights one must see ambroise at once let we go and lunch with he and finish the whole business before start he have a few order to give so mathieu go down to wait for he in the factory yard and there during the ten minute which he spend walk about dreamily all the distant past arise before he eye he could see himself a mere clerk cross that courtyard every morning on he arrival from janville with thirty sous for he lunch in he pocket the spot have remain much the same there be the central building with its big clock the workshop and the shed quite a little town of gray structure surmount by two lofty chimney which be ever smoking true he son have enlarged this city of toil the stretch of ground border by the rue de la federation and the boulevard de grenelle have be utilize for the erection of other building and face the quay there still stand the large brick house with dressing of white stone of which constance have be so proud and where with the mien of some queen of industry she have receive she friend in she little salon hang with yellow silk eight hundred man now work in the place the ground quiver with the ceaseless trepidation of machinery the establishment have grow to be the most important of its kind in paris the one whence come the finest agricultural appliance

that princely mansion of the avenue d'antin there as at the factory he could see himself arrive in poverty as a needy tenant beg he landlord to repair a roof in order that the rain might no longer

ambroise a man of creative energy whose victory have be seek by the very force of life which have make he triumph there install he as the master in the home of the vanquish when mathieu and deni arrive ambroise be absent but be expect home for lunch they wait for he and as the former again cross the ante-room the better to judge of some new arrangement that have be make he be surprise at be stop by a lady who be sit there patiently and whom he have not previously notice i see that monsieur froment do not recognize I she say mathieu make a vague gesture the woman have a tall plump figure and be certainly more than sixty year of age but she evidently take care of she person and have a smile mien with a long full face and almost venerable white hair one might have take she for some worthy well-to-do provincial bourgeoise in full dress celeste say she celeste madame seguin 's former maid thereupon he fully recognize she but hide he stupefaction at find she so fortunately circumstance at the close of she career he have imagine that she be bury in some sewer in a gay placid way she proceed to recount she happiness : oh i be very pleased she say i have retire to

surely remember madame menoux the little haberdasher close by -- well there be a woman now who never have any luck she lose she second child and she lose that big fellow she husband whom she be so fond of and she herself die of grief six month afterwards i do at one time think of take she to rougemont where the air be so good for one 's health there be old folk of ninety living there take la couteau for instance she will live as long as she like oh yes it be a very pleasant part indeed a perfect paradise at these word the abominable rougemont the bloody rougemont arise before mathieu 's eye rear its peaceful steeple above the low plain with its cemetery pave with little parisian where wild flower bloom and hide the victim of so many murder but celeste be rattle on again say : you remember madame bourdieu whom you use to know in the rue de miromesnil she die very near we village on some property where she go to live when she give up business a good many year ago she be luckier than she colleague la rouche who be far too good-natured with people you must have read about she case in the newspaper she be send to prison with a medical man name sarraille la rouche sarraille yes mathieu have certainly read the trial of those two social pest who be fate to meet at last in they work of iniquity and what a echo do those name awaken in the past : valerie morange reine morange already in the factory yard mathieu have fancy that he could see the shadow of morange glide past he -- the punctual timid soft-hearted accountant whom misfortune and insanity have carry off into the darkness and suddenly the unhappy man here again appear to mathieu like a wander phantom the restless victim of all the imbecile ambition all the desperate craving for pleasure which animated the period a poor weak mediocre be so cruelly punish for the crime of other that he be doubtless unable to sleep in the tomb into which he have fling himself bleed with broken limb and before mathieu 's eye there likewise pass the spectre of seraphine with the fierce and pain-fraught face of one who be rack and kill by insatiate desire well excuse I for have venture to stop you monsieur froment celeste conclude but i be very very pleased at have meet you again he be still look at she and as he quit she he say with the indulgence bear of he optimism : may you keep happy since you be happy happiness must know what it do nevertheless mathieu remain disturbed as he think of the apparent injustice of impassive nature the memory of he marianne strike down by such deep grief pine away through the impious quarrel of she son return to he and as ambroise at last come in and gayly embrace he after receive celeste 's thanks he feel a thrill of anguish for the decisive moment which would save or wreck the family be now at hand indeed deni after invite himself and mathieu to lunch promptly plunge into the subject we be not here for the mere pleasure of lunch with you say he mamma be ill do you know it ill say ambroise not seriously ill yes very ill in danger and be you aware that she have be ill like this ever since she come to speak to you about the quarrel between gregoire and gervai when it seem that you treat she very roughly i treat she roughly we simply talk business and perhaps i speak to she like a business man a little bluntly then ambroise turn towards mathieu who be wait pale and silent : be it true father that mamma be ill and cause you anxiety and as he father reply with a long affirmative nod he give vent to he emotion even as deni have do at the work immediately on learn the truth but dash it all he say this affair be become quite idiotic in my opinion gregoire be right and gervai wrong only i do not care a fig about that they must make it up at once so that poor mamma may not have another moment 's suffering but then why do you shut yourselve up why do you not let we know how grieve you be every one would have reflect and understand thing then all at once ambroise embrace he father with that promptness of decision which he display to such happy effect in business as soon as ever a ray of light illumined he mind after all father say he you be the cleverest you understand thing and foresee they even if gregoire be within he rights in bring a action against gervai it would be idiotic for he to do so because far above any petty private interest there be the interest of all of we the interest of the family which be to remain united compact and unattackable if it desire to continue invincible we sovereign strength lie in we union -- and so it be simple enough we will lunch as quickly as possible and take the first train we shall go deni and i to chanteble with you peace must be conclude this evening i will see to it laugh and well pleased to find he own feeling share by he two son mathieu return ambroise 's embrace and while wait for lunch to be serve they go down to see the winter garden which be be enlarged for some fete which ambroise wish to give he take pleasure in add to the magnificence of the mansion and in reign there with princely pomp at lunch he apologize for only offer he father and brother a bachelor 's pot-luck though truth to tell the fare be excellent indeed whenever andree and the child absent themselves ambroise still keep a good cook to minister to he need for he hold the cuisine of restaurant in horror well for my part say deni i go to a restaurant for my meal for since marthe and all the other have be at dieppe i have virtually shut up the house you be a wise man you see ambroise answer with quiet frankness for my part as you be aware i be a enjoyer now make haste and drink you coffee and we will start they reach janville by the two o'clock train they plan be to repair to chanteble in the first instance in order that ambroise and deni might begin by talk to gervai who be of a gentler nature than gregoire and with whom they think they might devise some means of conciliation then they intend to betake themselves to the mill lecture gregoire and impose on he such peace condition as they might have agree upon as they draw nearer and nearer to the farm however the difficulty of they undertaking appear to they and seem to increase in magnitude a arrangement would not be arrive at so easily as they have at first imagine so they gird they loin in readiness for a hard battle suppose we begin by go to see mamma deni suggest we should see and embrace she and that would give we some courage ambroise deem the idea a excellent one yes let we go by all means particularly as mamma have always be a good counsellor she must have some idea they climb to the first floor of the house to the spacious room where marianne spend she day on a couch beside the window and to they stupefaction they find she seat on that couch with gregoire standing by she and hold both she hand while on the other side be gervai and claire laughing softly why what be this exclaimed ambroise in amazement the work be do and we who despair of be able to accomplish it declare deni with a gesture of bewilderment mathieu be equally stupefied and delighted and on notice the surprise occasion by the arrival of the two big brother from pari he proceed to explain the position i go to pari this morning to fetch they he say and i have bring they here to reconcile we all a joyous peal of laughter resound the big brother be too late neither they wisdom nor they diplomacy have be need they themselves make merry over it feel the while greatly relieve that the victory should have be win without any battle marianne whose eye be moist and who feel divinely happy so happy that she seem already well again simply reply to mathieu : you see my friend it be do but as yet i know nothing further gregoire come here and kiss I and wish I to send for gervai and claire at once then of he own accord he tell they that they be all three mad in cause I such grief and that they ought to come to a understanding together thereupon they kiss one another and now it be do it be all over but gregoire gayly intervene wait a moment just listen i cut too fine a figure in the story as mamma relate it and i must tell you the truth i be not the first to desire the reconciliation the first be my wife therese she have a good sterling heart and the very brain of a mule in such wise that whenever she be determine on anything i always have to do it in the end well yesterday evening we have a bit of a quarrel for she have hear i do not know how that mamma be ill with grief and this pained she and she try to prove to I how stupid the quarrel be for we should all of we lose by it this morning she begin again and of course she convince I more particularly as with the thought of poor mamma lie ill through we fault i have hardly sleep all night but father lepailleur still have to be convinced and therese undertake to do that also she even hit upon something extraordinary so that the old man might imagine that he be the conqueror of conqueror she persuade he at last to sell you that terrible enclosure at such a insane price that he will be able to shout ` victory ' over all the house-top then turn to he brother and sister gregoire add in a jocular tone my dear gervai my dear claire let yourselve be rob i beg of you the peace of my home be at stake give my father-in-law the last joy of believe that he alone have always be in the right and that we have never be anything but fool oh as much money as he like reply gervai laughing besides that enclosure have always be a dishonor for the estate streak it with stone and bramble like a nasty sore we have long dream of see the property spotless with its crop wave without a break under the sun and chanteble be rich enough to pay for its glory thus the affair be settle the wheat of the farm would return to the mill to be ground and the mother would get well again it be the force of life the need of love the union necessary for the whole family if it be to continue victorious that have impose true brotherliness on the son who for a moment have be foolish enough to destroy they power by assail one another the delight of find themselves once more together there deni ambroise gervai gregoire the four big brother and claire the big sister all reconcile and again invincible increase when charlotte arrive bring with she the other three daughter louise madeleine and marthe who have marry and settle in the district louise have hear that she mother be ill have go to fetch she sister in order that they might repair to chanteble together and what a hearty laugh there be when the procession enter let they all come cry ambroise in a jocular way let 's have the family complete a real meeting of the great privy council you see mamma you must get well at once the whole of you court be at you knee and unanimously decide that it can no longer allow you to have even a headache then as benjamin put in a appearance the very last behind the three sister the laughter break out afresh and to think that we be forget benjamin mathieu exclaim come little one come and kiss I in you turn say marianne affectionately in a low voice the other jest because you be the last of the brood but if i spoil you that only concern ourselves do it not tell they that you spend the morning with I and that if you go out for a walk it be because i wish you to do so benjamin smile with a gentle and rather sad expression but i be downstairs mamma i see they go up one after the other i wait for they all to kiss before come up in my turn he be already one-and-twenty and extremely handsome with a bright face large brown eye long curly hair and a frizzy downy beard though he have never be ill he mother would have it that he be weak and insist on coddling he all of they moreover be very fond of he both for he grace of person and the gentle charm of he disposition he have grow up in a kind of dream full of a desire which he could not put into word ever seek the unknown something which he know not do not possess and when he parent see that he have no taste for any profession and that even the idea of marry do not appeal to he they evince no anger but on the contrary they secretly plot to keep this son they last-born life 's final gift to themselves have they not surrender all the other would they not be forgive for yield to the egotism of love by reserve one for themselves one who would be theirs entirely who would never marry or toil and moil but would merely live beside they and love they and be love in return this be the dream of they old age the share which in return for long fruitfulness they would have like to snatch from devour life which though it give one everything yet take everything away oh just listen benjamin ambroise suddenly resume you be interested in we brave nicola i know would you like to have some news of he i hear from he only the day before yesterday and it be right that i should speak of he since he be the only one of the brood as mamma put it who can not be here benjamin at once become quite excited asking be it true have he write to you what do he say what be he do he could never think without emotion of nicola 's departure for senegal he be twelve year old at that time and nearly nine year have go by since then yet the scene with that eternal farewell that flight as it be into the infinite of time and hope be ever present in he mind you know that i have business relation with nicola resume ambroise oh if we have but a few fellow as intelligent and courageous as he be in we colony we should soon rake in all the scatter wealth of those virgin land well nicola as you be aware go to senegal with lisbeth who be the very companion and helpmate he need thanks to the few thousand franc which they possess between they they soon establish a prosperous business but i divine that the field be still too small for they and that they dream of clearing and conquer a larger expanse and now all at once nicolas write to I that he be start for the soudan the valley of the niger which have only lately be open he be take he wife and he four child with he and they be all go off to conquer as fortune may will it like valiant pioneer beset by the idea of found a new world i confess that it amaze I for it be a very hazardous enterprise but all the same one must admit that we nicola be a very plucky fellow and one can not help admire he great energy and faith in thus set out for a almost unknown region fully convince that he will subject and populate it silence fall a great gust seem to have sweep by the gust of the infinite come from the far away mysterious virgin plain and the family could picture that young fellow one of themselves go off through the desert carry the good seed of humanity under the spreading sky into unknown clime ah say benjamin softly he eye dilate and gaze far far away as if to the world 's end ah he be happy for he see other river and other forest and other sun than ours but marianne shudder no no my boy say she there be no other river than the yeuse no other forest but we wood of lillebonne no other sun but that of chantebled come and kiss I again -- let we all kiss once more and i shall get well and we shall never be part again the laughter begin afresh with the embrace it be a great day a day of victory the most decisive victory which the family have ever win by refuse to let discord destroy it henceforth it would be invincible at twilight on the evening of that day mathieu and marianne again find themselves as on the previous evening hand in hand near the window whence they could see the estate stretch to the horizon that horizon behind which arise the breath of paris the tawny cloud of its gigantic forge but how little do that serene evening resemble the other and how great be they present felicity they trust in the goodness of they work do you feel better mathieu ask he wife do you feel you strength return do you heart beat more freely oh my friend i feel cure i be only pine with grief to-morrow i shall be strong then mathieu sink into a deep reverie as he sit there face to face with he conquest -- that estate which spread out under the setting sun and again as in the morning do recollection crowd upon he he remember a morning more than forty year previously when he have leave marianne with thirty sous in she purse in the little tumbledown shooting-box on the verge of the wood they live there on next to nothing they owe money they typify gay improvidence with the four little mouth which they already have to feed those child who have spring from they love they faith in life then he recall he return home at night time the three hundred franc a month 's salary which he have carry in he pocket the calculation which he have make the cowardly anxiety which he have feel disturbed as he be by the poisonous egotism which he have encounter in pari there be the beauchene with they factory

behave sensibly like themselves who be content with have but two child a boy and a girl and even those poor morange have talk to he of give a royal dowry to they one daughter reine dream at that time of a appointment that would bring in twelve thousand franc a year and full of contempt for the misery which a numerous family entail and then the very lepailleur the people of the mill have evince distrust because there be twelve franc owe to they for milk and egg for it have seem to they doubtful whether a bourgeois insane enough to have so many child could possibly pay he debt ah the view of the other have then appear to be correct he have repeat to himself that he would never have a factory nor a mansion nor even a mill and that in all probability he would never earn twelve thousand franc a year the other have everything and he nothing the other the rich behave sensibly and do not burden themselves with offspring whereas he the poor man already have more child than he could provide for what madness it have seem to be but forty year have roll away and behold he madness be wisdom he have conquer by he divine improvidence the poor man have vanquish the wealthy he have place he trust in the future and now the whole harvest be garner the beauchene factory be he through he son deni the seguin ' mansion be he through he son ambroise the lepailleur ' mill be he through he son

thought that we work be very great and good and beautiful since it be the creation of another france the sovereign france of to-morrow from that moment dominique pause no more there be no longer any need to question he he pour forth all the beauty and grandeur in he mind he speak of djenny the ancient queen city whose people and whose monument come from egypt the city which even yet reign over the valley he speak of four other centre bamakoo niamina segu and sansandig big village which would some day be great town and he speak particularly of timbuctoo the glorious so long unknown with a veil of legend cast over it as if it be some forbid paradise with its gold its ivory its beautiful woman all rise like a mirage of inaccessible delight beyond the devour sand he speak of timbuctoo the gate of the sahara and the western soudan the frontier town where life end and meet and mingle whither the camel of the desert bring the weapon and merchandise of europe as well as salt that indispensable commodity and where the pirogue of the niger land the precious ivory the surface gold the ostrich feather the gum the crop all the wealth of the fruitful valley he speak of timbuctoo the

date its stuff its iron-ware and particularly its slab of rock salt bring on the back of beast of burden from taudenus the frightful saharian city of salt whose soil be salt for league around a infernal mine of that salt which be so precious in the soudan that it serve as a medium of exchange as money more precious even than gold and finally he speak of timbuctoo impoverished fall from its high estate the opulent and resplendent city of former time now almost in ruin hide remnant of its treasure behind crack wall in fear of the robber of the desert but withal apt to become once more a city of glory and fortune royally seat as it be between the soudan that granary of abundance and the sahara the road to europe as soon as france shall have open that road have connect the province of she new empire and have found that huge new france of which the ancient fatherland will be but the direct mind that be the dream cry dominique that be the gigantic work which the future will achieve algerium connect with timbuctoo by the sahara railway line over which electric engine will carry the whole of old europe through the far expanse of sand timbuctoo connect with senegal by flotilla of steam vessel and yet other railway all intersect the vast empire on every side new france connect with mother france the old land by a wondrous development of the means of communication and found and get ready for the hundred million of inhabitant who will some day spring up there doubtless these thing can not be do in a night the trans-saharian railway be not yet lay down there be two thousand five hundred kilometre \* of bare desert to be cross which can hardly tempt railway company and a certain amount of prosperity must be develop by start cultivation seek and work mine and increase exportation before a pecuniary effort can be possible on the part of the motherland moreover there be the question of the native mostly of gentle race though some be ferocious bandit whose savagery be increase by religious fanaticism thus render the difficulty of we conquest all the greater until the terrible problem of islamism be solve we shall always be come in conflict with it and only life long year of life can create a new nation adapt it to the new land blend diverse element together and yield normal existence homogeneous strength and genius proper to the clime but no matter from this day a new france be bear yonder a huge empire and it need we blood -- and some must be give it in order that it may be people and be able to draw its incalculable wealth from the soil and become the

in he eye ah the healthy life the noble life the other life the whole mission and work of which he have as yet but confusedly dream again he ask a question : and be there many french family there colonize like yours dominique burst into a loud laugh oh no say he there be certainly a few colonist in we old possession of senegal but yonder in the niger valley beyond djenny there be i think only ourselves we be the pioneer the vanguard the risker full of faith and hope and there be some merit in it for to sensible stay-at-home folk it all seem like defy common sense can you picture it a french family install among savage and unprotected save for the vicinity of a little fort where a french officer command a dozen native soldier -- a french family which be sometimes call upon to fight in person and which establish a farm in a land where the fanaticism of some head tribesman may any day stir up trouble it seem so insane that folk get angry at the mere thought of it yet it enrapture we and give we gayety and health and the courage to achieve victory we be open the road we be give the example we be carry we dear old france yonder take to ourselves a huge expanse of virgin land which will become a province we have already found a village which in a hundred year will be a great town in the colony no race be more fruitful than the french though it seem to become barren on its

couple already have they own nest and all those young folk be already too strongly root to the old land by the tie of they race -- a race which after display such adventurous instinct have now fall asleep as it be at its own fireside but what a marvellous story it all be -- a story to which big and little alike have listen in rapture and which to-morrow would doubtless arouse within they a passion for glorious enterprise far away the seed of the unknown be sow and would grow into a crop of fabulous magnitude for the moment benjamin be the only one who cry amid the enthusiasm which drown he word : yes yes i want to live take I take I with you but dominique resume by way of conclusion : and there be one thing grandfather which i have not yet tell you my father have give the name of chanteble to we farm yonder he often tell we how you found you estate here in a impulse of far-seeing audacity although everybody jeer and shrug they shoulder and declare that you must be mad and yonder my father have to put up with the same derision the same contemptuous pity for people declare that the good niger will some day sweep away we village even if a band of prowl native do not kill and eat we but i be easy in mind about all that we shall conquer as you conquer for what seem to be the folly of action be really divine wisdom there will be another kingdom of the froment yonder another huge chantebled of which you and my grandmother will be the ancestor the distant patriarch worship like deity and i drink to you health grandfather and i drink to yours grandmother on behalf

but increase the human capital the free happiness of a life in which the child of some will no longer be beast of burden or food for slaughter or for vice to serve the egotism of the child of other and life will then again prove the conqueror there will come the renascence of life honor and worship the religion of life so long crushed beneath the hateful nightmare of roman catholicism from which on diver occasion the nation have seek to free themselves by violence and which they will drive away at last on the now near day when cult and power and sovereign beauty shall be vest in the fruitful
