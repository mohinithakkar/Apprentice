kalitan we go there too it be a dandy place do you remember the fringe of white mountain back of the harbor the people say the wood be full of game but we do not have time to go hunting there be a few shop there but it seem to I a very small place to have be build since 1834 in the state whole town grow up in two or three week huh say kalitan with a quick shrug of he shoulder quick grow sun fade and wind blow down i do not think the sun could ever fade in wrangel laugh ted they tell I there it have not shone but fifteen day in three month it rain all the time rain be nothing say kalitan it be when the ice spirit speak in the north wind 's roar and in the crackling of the floe that we tremble the glacier be the child of the mountain spirit whom we father worship he be angry and lo he hurl down iceberg in he wrath he toss they about upon the stream he toss the _ kyak _ like feather and wash the land with the wave of sitth when we people be bury in the ground instead of be burn with the fire they must go for ever to the place of sitth of everlasting cold where never sun abide nor rain nor warmth ted have listen spellbound to this poetic speech and gaze at kalitan in open-mouthed amazement a boy who could talk like that be a new and delightful playmate and he say : tell I more about thing kalitan but the indian be silent ashamed of have speak what do you do all day when you be at home persist the american in winter there be nothing to do but to hunt and fish say kalitan sometimes we do not find much game then we think of how when a thlinkit die he have plenty if he have live as a good tribesman he kyak glide smoothly over the silver water into the sunset until o'er gently flow current it reach the place of the mighty forest a bad warrior 's canoe pass dark whirlpool and terrible rapid until he reach the place we speak not of where reign sitth in the summer-time we still hunt and fish many have learn to till the ground and we gather berry and wood for the winter the other side of the inlet the tree-trunk drift from the yukon and be strand on the island so there be plenty for firewood but upon we island the woman gather a vine and dry it they collect seaweed for food in the early spring and dry it and press it into square cake which make good food after they have hang long in the sun they make basket and sell they to the white people often my uncle and i take they to valdez and once we bring back fifty dollar for those my mother make there be always much to do do not you get terribly cold hunting in the winter ask ted thlinkit boy not a baby say kalitan a trifle scornfully we begin to be harden when we be baby when i be five year old i leave my father and go to my uncle to be teach every morning i bathed in the ocean even if i have to break ice to find water and then i roll in the snow after that my uncle brush I with a switch bundle and not lightly for he arm be strong i must not cry out no matter if he hurt for a chief 's son must never show pain nor fear that would give he people shame do not you get sick ask ted who feel cold all over at the idea of be treat in such a heroic manner the _ kooshta _ -lrb- 3 -rrb- come sometimes say kalitan the shaman -lrb- 4 -rrb- use to cast he out but now the white doctor can do it unless the _ kooshta _ be too strong -lrb- footnote 3 : kooshta a spirit in animal 's form which inhabit the body of sick person and must be cast out accord to thlinkit belief -rrb- -lrb- footnote 4 : shaman native medicine-man -rrb- ted be puzzle as to kalitan 's exact meaning but do not like to ask too many question for fear of be impolite so he only say : be sick be not very nice anyhow to be bewitch be the most terrible say kalitan gravely how do that happen asked ted eagerly but kalitan shake he head it be not good to hear he say the medicine-man must come with he drum and rattle and he be very terrible if the white man will not allow any more the punish of the witch they should send more of the white medicine-man if we be not to have any more of we own boy should not talk about big thing say the old chief suddenly he have be sit quietly over the fire and speak so suddenly that kalitan collapse into silence ted too quiet down at the old chief stern voice and manner and both boy sit and listen to the man talk while the snow still swirl about they tyee klake tell mr strong many interesting thing about the coast country and give he valuable information as to the route he should pursue in he search for interesting thing in the mountain it will be two week before the snow will break so you can travel in comfort he say camp with we we remain here one week then we go to the island we can take you there you will see many thing and you boy will hunt with kalitan where be you island ask mr strong ted say nothing but he eye be fix eagerly upon he father it be easy to see that he wish to accept the invitation out there tyee klake point toward where the white coast-line seem to fade into silvery blue there be many island on some life no one but we have a village soon it will be nearly desert for many of we people reeve during the summer and wander from one camping-ground to another seek the best game or fish but kalitan 's people remain always on the island he i take with I to hunt the whale and seal to gather the berry and to trap the little animal who bear fur we find even seal upon we shore though fewer since you people have come among we which be the best russian or american ask mr strong curious to see what the old indian would say but the tyee be not to be catch nap man all alike he say thlinkit russian american some good some bad russian use indian more give they hunting and fishing and only take part of the skin american like to hunt and fish all themselves and leave nothing for the indian russian teach _ quass _ american teach whiskey before white man come indian be healthy they eat fish game berry now they must have other food and they be not good for indian here -- he touch he stomach indian use to dress in skin and fur now he must copy white man and shiver with cold he soon have the cough sickness and then he go into the unknown but the government of the american be best because it try to do some thing for the indian it teach we boy useful thing in the school and if some of its people be bad some indian be bad too man all alike he repeat with the calm stoicism of he race the government be far away say mr strong and should not be blame for the doings of all its servant i should like to see this island home of yours and think we must accept you invitation shall we ted he smile at the boy yes indeed thank you sir say ted and he and kalitan grin at each other happily we shall stay in camp until the blue jay come say the old chief smile and then seek the village of my people what do the blue jay mean ask ted timidly for he be very much in awe of this grave old man kalitan say something in thlinkit to he uncle and the old chief look kindly at the boy reply with a nod : i will tell you the story of the blue jay he say my story be of the far far north beside a salmon stream there dwelt people rich in slave these catch and dry the salmon for the winter and nothing be better to eat than dry salmon dip in seal oil all the fish be catch and store away when lo the whiteness fall from heaven and the snow be upon they it be the time of snow and they should not have complain but the chief be evil and he curse the whiteness no one should dare to speak evil of the snow spirit which come from the unknown deeper and deeper grow the snow it fly like feather about the _ eglu _ -lrb- 5 -rrb- and the slave have many trouble in put in limb for the fire then the snow come in flake so large they seem like the wing of bird and the house be cover and they could no longer keep they _ kyak _ on top of the snow all be shut tight in the house and they fire and food run low they know not how many day they be shut in for there be no way to tell the day from night only they know they be sore hungry and that the snow spirit be angry and terrible in he anger -lrb- footnote 5 : hut -rrb- but each one speak not he only choose a place where he should lie down and die when he could bear no more only the chief speak and he once ` snow spirit ' he say aloud ' i alone be evil these be not so slay I and spare ' but the snow spirit answer not only the wind scream around the _ eglu _ and he scream be terrible and sad then hope leave the heart of the chief and he prepare to die with all he people and all he slave but on the day when they last bit of food be go lo something peck at the top of the smoke-hole and it sing ` nuck-tee ' and it be a blue jay the chief hear and see and wonder and look ` neath the smoke-hole he see a scarlet something upon the floor pick it up he find it be a bunch of indian tomato berry red and ripe and quickly hope spring in he breast ` somewhere be summer ' he cry ` let we up and away ' then the slave hasten to dig out the canoe and they draw it with mighty labor for they be weak from fast over the snow to the shore and there they launch it without sail or paddle with all the people rejoice and after a time the wind carry they to a beach where all be summer bird sing flower bloom and berry gleam scarlet in the sun and there be salmon jump in the blue water they eat and be satisfy for it be summer on the earth and summer in they heart that be how the thlinkit come to we island and so we say when the snow break that now come the blue jay thank you for tell we such a dandy story cry ted who have not lose a word of this quaint tale tell so graphically over the camp-fire of the old chief klake chapter iii to the glacier ted sleep soundly all night wrap in the bearskin from the sledge in the little tent he share with he father when the morning break he spring to he foot and hurry out of door hopeful for the day 's pleasure the snow have stop but the ground be cover with a thick white pall and the mountain be turn to rise color in the morning sun which be rise in a blaze of glory good morning kalitan shout ted to he indian friend whom he spy heaping wood upon the camp-fire be not it dandy what can we do to-day have breakfast say kalitan briefly then do what tyee say well i hope he 'll say something exciting say ted think good day to hunt say kalitan as he prepare thing for the morning meal where do you get the fish ask ted break ice-hole and fish when i get up say the thlinkit you do not mean you have be fishing already exclaim the lazy ted and kalitan smile as he say : white people like fish tyee say : ` catch fish for boston man 's breakfast ' and i go do you always mind he like that ask ted he generally obey he father but there be time when he be not anxious to and argue a little about it kalitan look at he in astonishment he chief he say simply what will we do with the camp if we all go hunting ask ted nothing say kalitan leave chetwoof to watch i suppose i continue ted watch why ask kalitan why everything some one will steal we thing say ted thlinkit not steal say kalitan with dignity maybe white man come along and steal from he brother indian not if we go away to long hunt we _ cache _ blanket and no one would touch what do you mean by _ cache _ ask ted we build a mound hut near the house and put there the blanket and store sometime they stay there for year but no one would take from a _ cache _ if one have plenty of wood by the seashore or in the forest he may cord it and go he way and no one will touch it a deer hang on a tree where dog may not reach it but no stray hunter would slice even a piece we be not thief it be a pity you could not send missionary to the state you thlinkit my boy say mr strong who have come up in time to hear kalitan 's word i be afraid white people be less honest teddy do you know we be to have some hunting to-day and that you 'll get you first experience with a glacier hurrah shout ted dance up and down in excitement tyee klake say we can hunt toward the base of the glacier and i shall try to go a little way upon it and see how the land lie or rather the ice it be get warmer and if it continue a few day the snow will melt enough to let we go over to that island you be so anxious to see ted 's eye shine and the amount of breakfast he put away quite prepared he for he day 's work which pleasant though it might be certainly be hard work the chief say they must seek the glacier first before the sun get hot for it be blind on the snow so they set out soon after breakfast leave chetwoof in charge of the camp and with order to catch enough fish for dinner we 'll be ready to eat they head and tail say ted and he father add laughingly : ` bible bone and hymn-book too ' what do that mean ask ted as kalitan look up inquiringly once a writer name macaulay say he could make a rhyme for any word in the english language and a man reply ` you can not rhyme timbuctoo ' but he answer without a pause : if i be a cassowary on the plain of timbuctoo i would eat up a missionary bible bone and hymn-book too ted laugh but kalitan say grimly : not good to eat boston missionary he all skin and bone where do they get the name alaska ask ted as they tramp over the snow toward the glacier al-ay-ck-sa -- great country say kalitan it certainly be say ted it be fine i never see anything like this at home point as he speak to the scene in front of he a group of evergreen tree fir and the alaska spruce so useful for fire and torch fringe the edge of the ice-field green and verdant in contrast to the gleaming snow of the mountain which rise in a gentle slope at first then precipitously in a dazzling and enchanting combination of color it be as if some marble palace of old rise before they against the heaven for the ice be cut and serrate into spire and gable turret and tower all seem to be ornament with fretwork where the sun 's ray strike the peak and turn they into silver and gold lower down the ice look like animal so twisted be it into fantastic shape fierce sea monster with yawning mouth seem ready to devour bear and wolf whale gigantic elephant and snowy tiger tropic beast look strangely out of place in this arctic clime deep crevice cut the ice-field and in they green-blue depths lurk death for the least misstep would dash the traveller into a abyss which have no bottom beyond the glacier itself the snow-capped mountain rise grand and serene they glittering peak clear against the blue sky which hue the glacier reflect and play with in a thousand glint shades from purple amethyst to lapi lazulus and turquoise as they gaze spellbound a strange thing occur a thing of such wonder and beauty that ted could but grasp he father 's arm in silence suddenly the peak seem to melt away the white ice-pinnacles become real turret house and cathedral appear and before they arise a wonderful city of white marble dream-like and shadowy but beautiful as aladdin 's palace in the arabian night at last ted could keep silent no longer what be it he cry and the old chief answer gravely : the city of the dead but he father say : a mirage my boy they be often see in these region but you be fortunate in see one of the finest i have ever witness what be a mirage demand ted a optical delusion say he father and one i be sure i could not explain so that you would understand it the queer thing about a mirage be that you usually see the very thing most unlikely to be find in that particular locality in the sahara man see flower and tree and fountain and here on this glacier we see a splendid city it certainly be queer what make glacier daddy ted be even more interested than usual in he father 's talk because of kalitan whose dark eye never leave mr strong 's face and who seem to drink in every word of information as eagerly as a thirsty bird drink water the dictionary tell you that glacier be field of ice or snow and ice form in the region of perpetual snow and move slowly down the mountain slope or valley many people say the glacier be the father of the iceberg which float at sea and that these be break off the glacial stream but other deny this when the glacial ice and snow reach a point where the air be so warm that the ice melt as fast as it be push down from above the glacier end and a river begin these be the finest glacier in the world except perhaps those of the himalaya this bid fair to be a wonderfully interesting place for my work ted and i be glad you be likely to be satisfy with you new friend for i shall have to go to many place and do a lot of thing less interesting than the thing kalitan can show you see these block of fine marble and those superb mass of porphyry and chalcedony -- but there be something which will interest you more take my gun and see if you can not bring down a bird for supper wild duck be fly low across the edge of the glacier and quite near to the boy and ted grasp he father 's gun in wild excitement he be never allow to touch a gun at home dearly as he love he mother it have always seem very strange to he that she should show such poor taste about firearm and refuse to let he have any and now that he have a gun really in he hand he could hardly hold it he be so excited of course it be not the first time for he father have allow he to practice shooting at a mark ever since they have reach alaska but this be the first time he have try to shoot a living target he select he duck aim quickly and fire bang off go the gun and wonder of wonder two duck fall instead of one well do ted that duck be twin cry he father laugh almost as excite as the boy himself and they run to pick up the bird kalitan smile too and quietly pick up one say : this one kalitan 's show as he speak he arrow through the bird 's side for he have discharge a arrow as ted fire he gun too bad ted i think you be a mighty hunter a nimrod who kill two bird with one stone say mr strong but ted laugh and say : so i get the one i shoot at i do not care they have wild duck at supper that night for chetwoof pluck the bird and roasted they on a hot stone over the spruce log and ted tired and wet and hungry thought he have never taste such a delicious meal in he life chapter iv ted meet mr bruin it seem to ted as if he have scarcely touch the pillow on the night which follow before it be daylight and he would awake to find the sun streaming in at he tent flap he always mean to go fishing with kalitan before breakfast so the moment he wake up he jump out of bed if he pile of fragrant pine bough cover with skin could be call a bed and hurry through he toilet quick as he try to be however he be never ready before kalitan for when ted appear the indian boy have always have he roll in the snow and be prepare he line kalitan be perfectly fascinate with the american boy he think he the most wonderful specimen of a boy that he have ever see he know so much that kalitan do not and talk so brightly that be with ted be to the indian like have a book without the bother of reading there be some thing about he that kalitan could not understand to be sure ted talk to he father just as if he be another boy he even speak to tyee klake on occasion when that August personage have not only not ask he a question but be not speak at all from the thlinkit point of view this be a most remarkable performance on ted 's part but kalitan think it must be all right for a boston boy for even the stern old chief seem to regard happy-go-lucky ted with approval ted on the other hand think kalitan the most remarkable boy he have ever meet in all he life he have not be much with boy he lady mother as he always call the gentle brown-eyed be who rule he father and himself have not care to have she little galahad mingle with the rougher city boy who throng the street and have keep he with herself a great deal ted have love book and he and he little sister judith have live in a pleasant atmosphere of refinement playing happily together until the boy have grow almost to dread anything common or low he mother know he have moral courage and would face any issue pluckily but he father fear he would grow up a milksop and think he need harden mr strong object to the harden process if it consist in turn she boy loose to learn the way of the city street but have consent to he go with he father urge thereto by fear for he health which be not of the best and the knowledge that he have reach the bear and indian age and it be certainly a good thing for he to have he experience first-hand to ted the whole thing be perfectly delightful when he lay down at night he would often like to see mother and ju but he be generally so tired that he be asleep before he have time to think enough to be really homesick during the day there be too much do to have any think time and since he have meet this boy friend he think of little else but he and what they be to do next the tyee have assure mr strong that it be perfectly safe for the boy to go about together kalitan know all the trail he say he take care of white brother anything come call chetwoof as mr strong be very anxious to penetrate the glacier under klake 's guidance and want ted to enjoy himself to the full he leave the boy to themselves the only stipulation be that they should not go on the water without chetwoof there seem to be always something new to do as the day grow warmer the ice break in the river and the boy tramp all over the country ted learn to use the bow and arrow and bring down many a bird for supper and proud he be when he serve up for he father a wild duck shot pluck and cook all by himself they fish in the stream by day and set line by night they trap rabbit and hare in the wood and one day even get a silver fox a skin greatly prize by the fur trader on account of its rarity kalitan insist that ted should have it though he could have get forty dollar for it from a white trader and ted be rejoice at the idea of take it home to make a set of fur for judith one day ted have a strange experience and not a very pleasant one which might have be very serious have it not be for kalitan he have notice a queer-looking plant on the riverbank the day before and have stop to pick it up when he receive such a sudden and unexpected pricking as to cause he to jump back and shout for kalitan he hand feel as if it have be pierce by a thousand needle and he fly to a snow-bank to rub it with snow i must have get hold of some kind of a cactus he say to kalitan who only reply : huh pick hedgehog as he point to where ted 's cactus be amble indignantly away with every quill rattle and set straight out in anger at have he morning nap disturbed kalitan wrap ted 's hand in soft mud which take the pain out but he could not use it much for the next few day and do not feel eager to hunt when he father and the tyee start out in the morning kalitan remain with he although he eye look wistful for he have hear the chief talk about bear track have be see the day before bear be quite a rarity but sometimes a old cinnamon or even a big black bruin would venture down in search of fresh fish which he would catch cleverly with he great paw kalitan and ted fish awhile and then ted wander away a little wonder what lay around a point of rock which he have never yet explore something lay there which he have by no means expect to see and he scarcely know what to make of it on the river-bank close to the edge of the stream be a black figure a indian fishing as he suppose and he pause to watch the fisherman be cover with fur from head to foot and as ted watch he he seem to have no line or rod go nearer the boy grow even more puzzle and though the man 's back be toward he he could easily see that there be something unusual about the figure just as he be within hail distance and about to shout the figure make a quick dive toward the water and spring back again with a fish between he paw and ted saw that it be a huge bear he give a sharp cry and then stand stock-still the creature look around and stand gnawing he fish and stare at ted as stupidly as the boy stare at he then ted hear a halloo behind he and kalitan 's voice : run for chetwoof quick ted obey as the animal start to move off he run toward the camp hear the report of kalitan 's gun as he run chetwoof hear the noise hurry out and it be but a few moment before he be at kalitan 's side to ted it seem like a day before he could get back and see what be happen but he arrive on the scene in time to see chetwoof despatch the animal hurrah cry ted you have kill a bear but chetwoof only grunt crossly very bad luck he say and kalitan explain : indian do not like to kill bear or raven spirit in they maybe ancestor ted look at he in great astonishment but kalitan explain : once long ago a thlinkit girl laugh at a bear track in the snow and say : ` ugly animal must have make that track ' but a bear hear and be angry he seize the maiden and bear she to he den and turn she into a bear and she dwell with he until one day she brother kill the bear and she be free and from that day thlinkit speak respectfully of bear and do not try to kill they for they know not whether it be a bear or a friend who hide within the shaggy skin the tyee and mr strong be greatly surprise when they come home to see the huge carcass of mr bruin and they listen to the account of kalitan 's bravery the old chief say little but he look approvingly at kalitan and say hya kloshe -lrb- very good -rrb- which unwonted praise make the boy 's face glow with pleasure they have a great discussion as to whom the bear really belong ted have find he kalitan have shoot he first and chetwoof have kill he so they decide to go share ted want the skin to take home and think it would make a splendid rug for he mother 's library so he father pay kalitan and chetwoof what each would have receive as they share have the skin be sell to a trader and they all have bear meat for supper ted think it finer than any beefsteak he have ever eat and over it kalitan smack he lip audibly chapter v a monster of the deep the big bear occupy considerable attention for several day he have to be carefully skin and part of the meat dry for future use alaskan never use salt for preserve meat indeed they seem to dislike salt very much it have take ted some time to learn to eat all he meat and fish quite fresh without a taste of salt but he have grow to like it there be something in the sun and wind of alaska which cure meat perfectly and the bear 's meat be string on stick and dry in the sun so that they might enjoy it for a long time it seem as if the adventure with bruin be enough to last the boy for several day for ted 's hand still pained he from the porcupine 's quill and he feel tired and lazy he lay by the camp-fire one afternoon listen to kalitan 's tale of he island home when he father come in from a long tramp and look at he a little anxiously ask : what be the matter son nothing i be only tire say ted but kalitan say : porcupine quill poison hand well in a few day so you live cactus be get in he work be he i be glad it be not the bear you mistake for a alaskan posy and try to pick i be tired myself and mr strong throw himself down to rest daddy how do we come to have alaska anyway well that be a long story say he father but a interesting one do tell we about it urge ted i know we buy it but what do we pay the indian for it i should not have think they would have sell such a fine country kalitan look up quickly and there be a sudden gleam in he dark eye that ted have never see before thlinkit never sell he say russian steal mr strong put he hand kindly on the boy 's head you be right kalitan he say the russian never conquer the thlinkit the bravest tribe in all alaska you see teddy it be this way a great many year ago about 1740 a danish sailor name bering who be in the service of the russian sail across the ocean and discover the strait name for he and a number of island some of these be not inhabit other have indian or esquimo on they but after the manner of the early discoverer ber take possession of they all in the name of the emperor of russium it do not seem right as we look at thing now but in those day ` might make right ' and it be just the same way the english do when they come to america the russian settle here find the fishing and fur fine thing for trade and drive the indian who would not yield to they farther and farther inland in 1790 the czar make alexander baranoff manager of the trading company baranoff establish trading-post in various place and settle at sitka where you can see the ruin of the splendid castle he build the russian also send missionary to convert the indian to the greek church which be the church of russium the indian however never learn to care for the russian and often be cruelly treat by they the russian however try to do something for they education and establish several school one as early as 1775 on kadiak island have thirty pupil who study arithmetic reading navigation and four of the mechanical trade and this be a better record than the american purchaser can show i be sorry to say one of the recent traveller -lrb- 6 -rrb- in alaska say that he meet in the country ` american citizen who never in they life hear a prayer for the president of the united state nor of the fourth of July nor the name of the capital of the nation but who have be teach to pray for the emperor of russium to celebrate he birthday and to commemorate the victory of ancient greece ' in march 1867 the russian sell alaska to the united state for $ 7200000 in gold it be buy for a song almost when we consider the immense amount of money make for the government by the seal fishery the cod and salmon industry and the opening of the gold field the resource of the country be not half-known and the government be begin to see this that be one of the reason they have send I here with the other man to find out what the earth hold for those who do not know how to look for its treasure gold be not the best thing the earth produce there be land in alaska little known full of coal and other useful mineral other land be cover with magnificent timber which could be ship to all part of the world there be pasture-land where stock will fatten like pig without any other feeding there be fertile soil which will raise almost any crop and there be intelligent indian who can be teach to work and be useful member of society i do not mean drag off to the united state to learn thing they could never use in they home life but who should be educate here to make the best of they talent in they home surroundings -lrb- footnote 6 : dr sheldon jackson general agent of education in the territory -rrb- that be one cry shame to we government that they have neglect the alaskan citizen forty year have be waste but we be begin to wake up now and twenty year more will see the indian of kalitan 's generation industrious man and woman not only clever hunter and fisherman but lumberman cooper furniture maker farmer miner and stock-raiser at this moment they quiet conversation be interrupt by a wild shout from the shore and spring to they foot they see chetwoof gesticulate wildly and shout to the tyee who have be mend he canoe by the riverbank kalitan drop everything and run without a word scud like the arrow from which he take he name before ted could follow or ask what be the matter from the ocean a huge body rise ten foot out of the water spout jet of spray twenty foot into the air the sun striking he side and turn they to glisten silver then it fall back the water churn into frothy foam for a mile around it be a whale ted sure as you live luck certainly be come you way say he father but at the word whale ted have start after kalitan lose no time in get to the scene of action as fast as possible watch the tyee call kalitan over he shoulder as both boy run down to the water 's edge the old chief be launch he _ kiak _ into the seething water and to ted it seem incredible that he mean to go in that frail bark in pursuit of the mighty monster the old man 's face however be as calm as though start on a pleasure-trip in peaceful water and ted watch in breathless admiration to see what would happen next klake paddle swiftly out to sea drawing as near as he dare to where the huge monster splash idly up and down like a great puppy at play he stop the _ kiak _ and watch then poise he spear and throw it and so swift and graceful be he gesture that ted exclaim in amazement tyee klake best harpoon-thrower of all the thlinkit say kalitan proudly watch ted need no such instruction he keen eye pass from fish to man and back again and no movement of the tyee escape he the instant the harpoon be throw the tyee paddle furiously away for when a harpoon strike a whale he be likely to lash violently with he tail and may destroy he enemy and this be a moment of terrible danger to the harpooner but the whale be too much astonished to fight and with a terrific splash he dive deep deep into the water to get rid of that stinging thing in he side in the cold green water below -lrb- illustration : away go another stinging lance -rrb- the tyee wait he grim face tense and earnest it might have be fifteen minute for whale often stay under water for twenty minute before come to the surface to breathe but to kalitan and ted it seem a hour then the spray dash high into the air again and the instant the huge body appear klake draw near and away go another stinging lance again swift and oh so sure of aim this time the whale strike out wildly and kalitan hold he breath while ted gasp at the tyee 's danger for he _ kiak _ rock like a shell and then be quite hide from they sight by the spray which be dash heavenward like cloud of white smoke once more the creature dive and this time he stay down only a few minute and when he come up blood spout into the air and dye the sea crimson and kalitan exclaim : pierce he lung now he must die there be one more bright glancing weapon fly through the air and ted notice attach to it by a thong a curious-looking bulb and ask kalitan : what be on that lance sealskin buoy say kalitan we make the bag and blow it up tie it to the harpoon and when the lance stick into the whale the buoy make it very hard for he to dive after awhile he die and drift ashore the water about the whale be grow red and the carcass seem drift out to sea and at last the tyee seem satisfied he send a last look toward the huge body then turn he _ kiak _ toward the watcher on the bank if it only come to shore say kalitan what will you do with it ask ted oh there be lot of thing we can do with a whale say kalitan the blubber be the best thing to eat in all the world then we use the oil in a bowl with a bit of pith in it to light we hut the bone be all useful in build we house whale be once bear but they play too much on the shore and run away to sea so they wear off all they fur on the rock and have they foot nibble off by the fish well this one do not have he tail nibble off at any rate laugh ted i see it flap at the tyee and think that be the last of he sure tyee much big chief say kalitan and just then the old man 's _ kiak _ draw near they and he step ashore as calmly as though he have not just be through so exciting a scene with a mighty monster of the deep chapter vi the island home of kalitan swift and even be the stroke of the paddle as the canoe speed over the water toward kalitan 's island home ted be so excited that he could hardly sit still and tyee klake give he a warning glance and a muttered kooletchika -lrb- 7 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 7 : dangerous channel -rrb- the day before a big canoe have come to the camp the paddler bear message for the tyee and he have have a long conversation with mr strong the result be astonishing to teddy for he father tell he that he be to go for a month to the island with kalitan this delighted he greatly but he be a little frightened when he find that he father be to stay behind it be just this way son mr strong explain to he i be here in government employ take government pay to do government work i must do it and do it well in the shortest time possible you will have a far better time on the island with kalitan than you could possibly have loaf around the camp here you could not go to many place where i be go and if my mind be easy about you i can take chetwoof and do my work in half the time i 'll come to the island in three or four week and we 'll take a week 's vacation together and then we 'll hit the trail for the gold-field be you satisfy with this arrangement yes sir ted 's tone be dubious but he face soon clear up a month will not be very long father no i 'll wager you 'll be sorry to leave when i come for you try and not make any trouble of course indian way be not ours but you 'll get use to it all and enjoy it it be a chance most boy would be crazy over and you 'll have tale to tell when you get home to make you playmate envy you i be glad i have a son i can trust to keep straight when he be out of my sight and he lay he hand affectionately on the boy 's shoulder ted look he father squarely in the eye but give only a little nod in answer then he laugh he clear ringing laugh would not mother have spasm he exclaim mr strong laugh too but say : you 'll be just as well off tumble around with kalitan as fall off a glacier or two as you would be certain to do if you be with I teddy feel a little blue when he say good-bye to he father but kalitan quickly dispel he gloom by a great piece of news great time on island he say as the canoe glide toward the dim outline of land to which ted 's thought have so often turn tyee 's whale come ashore we go to see he cut up hurrah cry ted delighted to think i shall see all that what else will we do kalitan hunt fish hear old kala-kash story see berry dance if you stay long enough perhaps a potlatch do many thing say the indian one of the indian paddler say something to kalitan and he laugh a little and ted ask curiously : what do he say say kalitan tena learn to talk as much as a boston boy say kalitan laughing heartily and ted laugh too the canoe be near the shore of a wooded island and ted see a fringe of tree and some native house cluster picturesquely against they at the crest of a small hill which slope down to the water 's edge where stand a group of people await the canoe my home say kalitan point to the largest house my people there be a great deal of pride in he tone and look and he receive a warm welcome as the canoe touch land and they occupant spring on shore the boy crowd around the young indian and chatter and gesticulate toward ted while a bright-looking little malamute spring upon kalitan and nearly knock he down cover he face with eager puppy kiss the girl be less boisterous and regarded teddy with shy curiosity some of they be quite pretty and the baby be as cunning as the puppy they bark every time the dog do in a funny hoarse little way and indeed alaskan baby learn to bark long before they learn to talk the tyee 's wife receive teddy kindly and he soon find himself quite at home among these hospitable people who seem always friendly and natural nearly all speak some english and he rapidly add to he store of chinook so that he have no trouble in make himself understand or in understanding of course he miss he father but he have little time to be lonely life in the village be anything but uneventful at first there be the whale to be attend to and all the village turn out for that the huge creature have drift ashore on the farther side of the island and ted be much interested in see he gradually dispose of great mass of blubber be strip from the side to be use later both for food and fuel the whalebone be carefully secure to be sell to the trader and it seem to ted that there be not one thing in that vast carcass for which the indian do not have some use ted soon tired of watch the many thing do with the whale but there be plenty to do and see in the village the village house be all alike there be one large room in which the people cook eat and sleep the girl have blanket string across one corner behind which be they bed teddy be give one also for he corner of the great room in the tyee 's house he learn to eat the food and to like it very much there be dry fish heron ' egg berry or those put up in seal oil which be obtain by fry the fat out of the blubber of the seal the alaskan use this oil in nearly all they cooking and be very fond of it ted eat also dry seaweed chop and boil in seal oil which taste very much like boil and salt leather but he like it very well indeed he grow so strong and well out-of-doors all day in the clear air and bright sunshine of the alaskan June that he could eat anything and tramp all day without be too tired to sleep like a top all night and wake ready for a new day with a zest he never feel at home fresh fish be plentiful the boy catch salmon smelt and whitefish and many be dry for the come winter while clam gum-boot sea-cucumber and devil-fish find on the rock of the shore be every-day diet kalitan 's sister and ted become great friend she be older than kalitan and though only fifteen be soon to be marry to tah-ge-ah a fine young indian who be ready to pay high for she which be not strange for she be both pretty and sweet at the next full moon say kalitan there will be a potlatch and tanana will be sell to tah-ge-ah he say he will give four hundred blanket for she and my uncle be well pleased many only pay ten blanket for a wife but of course we would not sell my sister for that she be of high caste chief 's daughter niece and sister the boy speak proudly and ted answer : she be so pretty too she be not like the indian girl i see at wrangel and juneau why there the woman sit around as dirty as dog on the sidewalk and do not seem to care how they look they have basket to sell and be too lazy to care whether any one buy they or not they be not a bit like tanana she be as pretty as a japanese kalitan smile well pleased and ted add i guess the thlinkit must be the best indian in alaska kalitan laugh outright at this thlinkit pretty good he say tanana good girl she learn much good at the mission school marry tah-ge-ah and make people better she can weave blanket make fine basket and keep house like a white girl she be all right say ted but kalitan what be a potlatch potlatch be a good-will feast say he friend very fine thing but white man do not like say indian feast be all bad why be it bad when a indian give away all he goods for other that be what a great potlatch be when white man give we whiskey and it be drunk too much then it be very bad but tyee will not have that for tanana 's feast we will drink only quass -lrb- 8 -rrb- as my people make it before they learn evil drink and fire-water which make they crazy -lrb- footnote 8 : quass be a native drink harmless and acid make with rye and water ferment the bad indian mix it with sugar flour dry apple and hop and make a terribly intoxicating drink -rrb- i guess tyee klake be right when he say all man be alike say ted sagely it seem to I that there be good and bad one in all country it be a pity you have have such bad white one here in alaska but i guess you have have good one too plenty good plenty bad thlinkit man and boston man say kalitan all same chapter vii twilight tale and totem once a small girl child go by night to bring water in the sky above she see the moon shine brightly pale and placid and she put forth she tongue at it which be a evil thing for the moon be old and a thlinkit child should show respect for age so the moon would not endure so rude a thing from a girl child and it come down from the sky and take she thither she cry out in fear and catch at the long grass to keep herself from go up but the moon be strong and take she with she water-bucket and she bunch of grass and she never come back she mother weep for she but she father say : ` cease we have other girl child she be now wed to the moon to he we need not give a potlatch ' you may see she still if you will look at the moon there grass in one hand bucket in the other and when the new moon tip to one side and the water spill from the cloud and it be the month of rain it be the bad moon maiden tip over she water-bucket upon the earth no thlinkit child would dare ever to put she tongue forth at the moon for fear of a like fate to that of squiance the moon maiden tanana 's voice be soft and low and she look very pretty as she sit in the moonlight at the door of the hut and tell kalitan and ted quaint old story ted be delighted with she tale and beg for another and yet another and tanana tell the quaint story of kagamil a mighty _ toyon _ -lrb- 9 -rrb- dwelt on the island of kagamil by name he be kat-haya-koochat and he be of great strength and much to be fear he have long have a death feud with people of the next totem but the bold warrior yakaga chieftain of the tribe marry the toyon 's daughter and there be no more feud zampa be the son of kat-haya-koochat and he pride he build for this son a fine _ bidarka _ -lrb- 10 -rrb- and the boy launch it on the sea he father watch he sail and call he to return lest evil befall but zampa hear not he father 's voice and pursued diving bird -lrb- 11 -rrb- and lo he be far from land and the dark fall he sail to the nearest shore and behold the village of yakaga where the people of he sister 's husband make he welcome though yakaga be not within he hut there be feast and merry-making and accord to they custom he the stranger be give a chieftain 's daughter to wife and she name be kitt-a-youx and zampa love she and she he and he return not home but kitt-a-youx 's father like he not and treat he with rudeness because of the old enmity with he tyee father so zampa say to kitt-a-youx : ` let we go hence we can not be happy here let we go from you father who be unfriendly to I and seek the _ barrabora _ of my father the mighty chief that happiness may come upon we ' and kitt-a-youx say : ` what my lord say be well ' -lrb- footnote 9 : chieftain -rrb- -lrb- footnote 10 : canoe -rrb- -lrb- footnote 11 : duck -rrb- then zampa place she in he canoe and alone beneath the star they sail and it be well and zampa 's arm be strong at he paddle but lo they hear another paddle and one come after they and soon arrow fly about they arrow swift and cruel and one strike he paddle from he hand and he canoe be overturn the pursuer come and place kitt-a-youx in he canoe seek too for zampa but alas zampa be drown and when he pursuer drag he body to the surface he give a mighty cry for lo it be he brother-in-law whom he have pursue for he be yakaga then fear the terrible rage of zampa 's father he dare not return with the body so he leave it with the overturn canoe in the kelp and weed kitt-a-youx he bear with he to he own island there she be sad as the sea-gull 's scream for the lord she love be dead and she father give she to another _ toyon _ who be cruel to she and she life be as a slave 's and she loathe she life until zampa 's child be bear to she and for it she live alas it be a girl child and she husband hate it and kitt-a-youx see nothing for it but to be sell as a slave as be she herself and she look by day and by night at the sea and its cold cold wave seem warmer to she than the arm of man ` with my girl child i shall go hence ' she whisper to herself ` and the great unknown spirit will be kind ' so by night she steal away in a canoe and steer to sea ere she know where she be reach the seaweed where she have journey with she young husband the morning break and she see the weed and the kelp where she lover have go from she sight and with a glad sigh she clasp zampa 's child to she breast and sink down among the weed where he have die so she tired spirit be at rest for a woman be happier who die with he she love now zampa 's father have find he boy 's body and mourn over it and bury it in a mighty cave the which he have once make for he fur and store with it he place bow and arrow and many valuable in respect for the dead and zampa 's sister go to he funeral feast fall upon a stone with she child so that both be kill then break the old chief 's heart beside she brother he lay she in the cave and give order that he himself should be place there as well when grief should have make way with he then he die of sorrow for he child and he people inter he in he burial cave and with he they put much wealth and blanket and weapon when therefore the people of he tribe find the body of kitt-a-youx and she child among the kelp have hear of she love for zampa they bear they to the same cave and wrap they in fur they place kitt-a-youx beside she beloved husband and in she burial she find she home and feel the kindness of the great spirit this then be the story of the burial cave of kagamil and since that day no man dwell upon the island and it be know as the ` island of the dead ' i would like to see it i can tell you say ted be there any burial cave around here the thlinkit do not bury in cave say tanana we use to burn we dead but often we place they in totem-pole i think those great pole by you door be totem say ted puzzle yes say the girl they be caste totem and all who be of any rank have they as we belong to the raven or bear or eagle clan we have the carve pole to show we rank but the totem of the dead be quite different it do not stand beside the door but far away it be alone as the soul of the dead in whose honor it be make it be but little carve a square hole be cut at the back of the pole and the body of the dead wrap in a matting of cedar bark be place within a board be nail so that the body will not fall to the ground a potlatch be give and food from the feast be put in the fire for the dead person it seem queer to put weapon and blanket and thing to eat on people 's grave say ted why do they do it of the dead we know nothing say tanana perhaps the warrior spirit wish he arrow in the land of the great unknown yes but he can not come back for they persist ted at wrangel boston man put flower on he girl 's grave say kalitan drily she come back and smell posy have no answer ready ted change the subject and ask : why do you have the raven at the top of you totem pole indian can not marry same totem say kalitan my father be eagle totem my mother be raven totem he carve she totem at the top of the pole then he totem and those of the family be carve below the greater the family the taller the totem how do you get these totem demand ted clan totem we take from we parent but a man may choose he own totem before he become a man he must go alone into the forest to fast and there he choose he totem and he be brother to that animal all he life and may not kill it when he come forth he may take part in all the ceremony of he tribe why it be something like knighthood and the vigil at arm and escutcheon and all those round-table thing exclaim ted in delight for he dearly love the stir tale of king arthur and he knight and the doughty deed of camelot tell we about that say kalitan so ted tell they many tale in the moonlight as they sit beneath the shadow of the quaint and curious totem-pole of kalitan 's tribe chapter viii the berry dance teddy 's month upon the island stretch out into two he father come and go find the boy so happy and well that he leave he with a easy mind ted 's fair skin be tan to a warm brown and clad in indian clothes save for he aureole of copper-coloured hair so strong a contrast to the straight black lock of he indian brother he could hardly be tell from one of the island lad who roam all day by wood and shore they call he yakso pil chicamin -lrb- 12 -rrb- and all the village like he -lrb- footnote 12 : copper hair -rrb- tanana 's marriage-feast be hold and she and tah-ge-ah go to housekeeping in a little hut where the one room be as clean and neat as could be and not a bit like the dirty room of some of the native tanana spend all she spare time weave beautiful basket for she slim finger be very skillful some of the basket which she make out of the inner bark of the willow-tree be weave so closely that they would hold water and teddy never tire of watch she weave the gay color in and out nor of see the wonderful pattern grow tahgeah would take they to the mainland when she have enough make and sell they to the traveller from the state meantime tah-ge-ah himself be very very busy carve the totem-pole for he new home for tanana be a chieftain 's daughter and he too be of high caste and they totem must be carve and stand one hundred foot high beside they door lest they be reproach ted also enjoy see old kala-kash carve for he be the finest carver among the indian and it be wonderful to see he cut strange figure out of bone wood horn fish-bone and anything he gnarled old finger could get hold of and he would carve grasshopper bear minnow whale sea-gull baby or idol he make too a canoe for ted a real alaskan dugout shape the shell from a log and make it soft by steam fill the hole with water and throw in red-hot stone the wood be then leave to season and ted could hardly wait patiently until sun and wind and rain have make he precious craft seaworthy then it be paint with paint make by rub a certain rock over the surface of a coarse stone and the powder mix with oil or water at last it be do a shapely thing more beautiful in ted 's eye than any launch or yacht he have ever see at home he canoe have a carve stern and a sharp prow which come out of the water and which have carve upon it a fine eagle kalakash have not ask ted what he totem be but suppose that the american eagle on the button of the boy 's coat be he emblem have carve the rampant bird upon the canoe as the boy 's totem ted learn to paddle and to fish never so well as kalitan of course for he be bear to it but still he do very well and enjoy it hugely happily wane the summer day and then come the time of the berry dance which kalitan have speak of so often that ted be very anxious to see it the salmon-berry be fully ripe a large and luscious berry find in two color yellow and dark red besides these there be other small berry maruskin like the new england dewberry huckleberry and whortleberry we have five kind of berry on we island say kalitan all good the bird fly from the mainland first bring the seed and we berry grow larger than almost any place in alaska they be certainly good say ted he mouth full as he speak these salmon-berry be a kind of a half-way between we blackberry and strawberry i never see anything prettier than the way the red and yellow berry grow so thick on the same bush -- there come the canoe interrupted kalitan and the two boy run down to the water 's edge eager to be the first to greet the visitor tyee klake be give a feast to the people of the neighbouring island and a dozen canoe glide over the water from different direction the canoe be all gaily decorate and they come swiftly onward to the weird chant of the paddler which the breeze waft to the listener ' ear in a monotonous melody every one in the village have be astir since daybreak prepare for the great event parallel line have be string from the chief 's house to the shore and from these be hung gay blanket piece of bright calico and festoon of leaf and flower as the canoe land they occupant the dancer throng to welcome they guest the great drum sound its loud note and the dancer array in wonderful blanket weave in all manner of fanciful design and trim with long woollen fringe sway back and forth up and down to and fro in a very graceful manner keep time to the music in the center of the largest canoe stand the tyee of a neighbouring island a tall indian dress in a superb blanket with fringe a foot long fringed leggin and moccasin of walrus hide and the chief hat to show he rank it be a peculiar head-dress half a foot high trim in down and feather the tyee in perfect time to the music sway back and forth never cease for a moment shake he head so that the down be waft in a snowy cloud all over he as the canoe reach the shallows the shore indian dash into the water to draw they up to land and the company be joyously receive teddy be delighted for in one of the canoe be he father whom he have not see for several week after the greeting be over the dancer arrange themselves in opposite line man on one side woman on the other and sway they body while the drum keep up its unceasing tum-tum-tum it be a little bit like square dance at home say ted it be ever so pretty be not it first they sway to the right then to the leave over and over and over then they bend they body forward and backward without bend they knee then sway again and bend to one side and then the other singing all the time be not it odd father it certainly be but it be very graceful say mr strong some of the girl be quite pretty gentle-looking creature but the older woman be ugly the very old woman look like the mummy in the museum at home say ted there be one old woman over a hundred year old whose skin be like a piece of parchment and she wear the hideous lip-button which most of the thlinkit have stop use kalitan say all the woman use to wear they the girl use to make a cut in they chin between the lip and the chin and put in a piece of wood change it every few day for a piece a little larger until the opening be stretch like a second mouth when they grow up a wooden button like the bowl of a spoon be set in the hole and constantly enlarged the largest i have see be three inch long be not it a curious idea father it certainly be but there be no tell what woman will admire a chinese lady bind she foot and a american she waist a maori woman slit she nose and a english belle pierce she ear it be on the same principle that you thlinkit friend slit they chin for the lip-button i be mighty glad they do not do it now for tanana 's as pretty as a pink and it would be a shame to spoil she face that way say ted the dancing have stop father let 's see what they 'll do next there come kalitan a feast of berry be to follow the dance and kalitan lead mr strong and ted to the chief 's house which be gaily decorate with blanket and bit of bright cloth a table cover with a cloth be lay around three side of the room and on this be spread hardtack and huge bowl of berry of different color these be beat up with sugar into a foamy mixture pink purple and yellow accord to the color of the berry which taste good and look pretty ted and kalitan have help gather the berry and they appetite be quite of the best mr strong smile to see how the once fussy little gentleman help himself with a right good-will to the indian dainty of he friend many piece of goods have be provide for the potlatch and these be give away give and receive with dignified politeness there be laugh and merriment with the feast and when it be all over the canoe float away as they have come into the sunset which gilded all the sea to rosy golden beauty ted 's share of the potlatch be a beautiful blanket of tanana 's weave and he be delighted beyond measure you be a lucky boy ted say he father people pay as high as sixty-five dollar for a alaskan blanket and not always a perfect one at that many of the indian be use dye yarn to weave they but yours be the genuine article make from white goat 's wool long and soft and dye only in the native red and black we shall have to do something nice for tanana when you leave i would like to give she something and kalitan too ted 's face look very grave when do i have to go father right away i be afraid be the reply i have let you stay as long as possible and now we must start for we northern trip if you be to see anything at all of mine and esquimo before we start home the mail-steamer pass nuchek day after to-morrow and we must go over there in time to take it yes sir say ted forlornly he want to see the mine and all the wonderful thing of the far north but he hate to leave he indian friend what be the trouble ted he father lay he hand on he shoulder dislike to see the bright face so clouded i be only thinking of kalitan say ted suppose we take kalitan with we say mr strong oh daddy could we really ted jump in excitement i 'll ask the tyee if he will lend he to we for a month say mr strong and in a few minute it be decide and ted with one great bear 's hug to thank he father rush off to find he friend and tell he the glorious news chapter ix on the way to nome well boy we be off for a long sail and i be afraid you will be rather tire with the steamer before you be do with she say mr strong they have board the mail-steamer late the night before and go right to bed have waken early next day and rush on deck to find the August sun shine in brilliant beauty the island quite out of sight and nought but sea and sky around and above they oh i do not know we 'll find something to do say teddy you 'll have to tell we lot about the place we pass and if there be not any other boy on board kalitan and i will be together what be the first place we stop we pass the kenaus peninsula in the night i wish you could have catch a glimpse of some of the waterfall volcano and glacier they be as fine as any in alaska say mr strong we next stop will be kadiak island kadiak island be once near the mainland say kalitan there be only the narrowest passage of water but a great kenai otter try to swim the pass and be catch fast he struggle so that he make it wider and wider and at last push kadiak way out to sea he must have be a whopper say ted to push it so far away be that the island yes say he father there be no splendid forest on the island as there be on the mainland but the grass be superb for the fog and rain here keep they green as emerald what a queer canoe that indian have exclaim ted it be not a bit like yours kalitan it be _ bidarka _ say kalitan kadiak people make canoe out of walrus hide they stretch it over frame of driftwood it hold two people they sit in small hatch with apron all around they body and the _ bidarka _ go over the roughest sea and float like a bladder big _ bidarka _ call a _ oomiak _ and hold whole family some one have call the _ bldarka _ the ` cossack of the sea ' say mr strong they skim along like swallow and be as perfectly build as any vessel i ever see what be those huge building on the small island ask ted as the steamer wound through the shallows ice-house say he father before people learn to manufacture ice immense cargo be ship from here to as far south as san francisco it be fun to see they go fishing for ice from the steamer when we come up to skaguay say ted the sailor go out in a boat slip a net around a block of ice and tow it to the side of the ship then it be hitch to a derrick and swing on deck huh say kalitan what people want ice for store up think they would store sunshine if you could invent a way to do that you could make a fortune my boy say mr strong laugh the next place of any interest be karluk it be around on the other side of the island in shelikoff strait and be famous for its salmon cannery nearly half of the entire salmon pack of alaska come from kadiak island most of the fish come from the karluk river very bad for indian say kalitan use to have plenty fish tyee klake say salmon use to come up this river in shoal sixteen mile long and now boston man take they all it do seem a pity that the indian do not even have a chance to earn they living in the cannery say mr strong the largest cannery in the world be at karluk there be thousand of man employ and in one year over three million salmon be packed yet with all this work for busy hand to do the cannery employ chinese greek portuguese and american workman in preference to the indian bring they by the shipload from san francisco what other place do we pass ask ted a lot of very interesting one and i wish we could coast along stop wherever we feel like it say mr strong the shumagin island be where ber the great discoverer and explorer land in 1741 to bury one of he crew codfish be find there and captain cook in he ` voyage and discovery ' speak of the same fish there be a famous fishery there now call the davidson bank and the codfishing fleet have its headquarters on popoff island million of codfish be catch here every year these island be also a favorite haunt of the sea otter belofsky at the foot of mt pavloff be the center of the trade what kind of fur be otter ask ted whose mind be so inquire that he father often call he the living catechism it be the court fur of china and russium and at one time the common people be forbid by law to wear it say mr strong it be a rich purplish brown sprinkle with silver-tipped hair and the skin be very costly at one time any one could have otter say kalitan we hunt they with spear and bow and arrow now they be very few and we find they only in dangerous spot hide on rock or float kelp sometimes the hunter have to lie in hide for day watch they only indian can kill the otter boston man can if they marry indian woman that make they indian rather put otter at a discount and woman at a premium laugh mr strong now we pass along near the alaska peninsula past countless isle and islet through the fox island to unalaska and then into the ber sea one of the most interesting thing in this region be call the ` pacific ring of fire ' a chain of volcano which stretch along the coast often the passenger can see from the ship at night a strange red glow over the sky and know that the fire mountain be burn the most beautiful of these volcano be mt shishaldin nearly nine thousand foot high and almost as perfect a cone in shape as fujus yama which the japanese love so much and call ` the honorable mountain ' at unalaska or ilinlink the ` curving beach ' we stop if we could stay over for awhile there be a great many interesting thing we could see a old greek church and the government school be in the town and bogoslov 's volcano and the sea-lion rookery be on the island of st john which rise right up out of the sea in 1796 after a day 's roaring and rumble and thunder in 1815 there be a similar performance and from time to time the island have grow larger ever since one fine day in 1883 there be a great shower of ash and when the cloud have roll away two peak be see where only one have be separate by a sandy isthmus this last be reduce to a fine thread by the earthquake of 1891 and i do not know what new freak it may have develop by now i know some friend of mine land there not long ago and cook egg over the jet of steam which gush out of the mountainside do you ever hear of use a volcano for a cook-stove well i should say not say ted amuse these alaskan volcano be great thing the one call makushin have a crater fill with snow in a part of which there be always a cloud of sulphurous smoke that be make extreme meet be not it yehl -lrb- 13 -rrb- make many strange thing say kalitan who have be take in all this information even more eagerly than teddy he first dwell on nass river and turn two blade of grass into the first man and woman then the thlinkit grow and prosper till darkness fall upon the earth a thlinkit steal the sun and hide it in a box but yehl find it and set it so high in the heaven that none could touch it then the thlinkit grow and spread abroad but a great flood come and all be sweep away save two who toss long upon the flood on a raft of log until yehl pity and carry they to mt edgecomb where they dwell until the water fall -lrb- footnote 13 : yehl embody in the raven be the thlinkit great spirit -rrb- old kala-kash tell this story and he say that one of these people when very old go down through the crater of the mountain and give long life by yehl stay there always to hold up the earth out of the water but the other life in the crater as the thunder bird hahtlum whose wing-flap be the thunder and whose glance be the lightning the osprey be he totem and he face glare in we blanket and totem i have wonder what that fierce bird be say teddy who be always quite carry away with kalitan 's strange legend well what else do we see on the way to nome father the most remarkable thing happen in the ber sea be the seal industry but i do not think we pass near enough to the island to see any of that you would better run about and see the ship now and the boy need no second permission it be not many day before they know everybody on board from captain to deck hand and be prime favorite with they all ted and kalitan enjoy every moment there be always something new to see or hear and ere they reach they journey 's end they have hear all about seal and seal although the famous pribylov island be too far to the west of the vessel 's route for they to see they they sight the united state revenue cutter which ply about the seal island to keep off poacher for no one be allow to kill seal or to land on this government reservation except from government vessel the scent of the rookery where million of seal have be kill in the last hundred year be notice far out at sea and often the bark of the animal can be hear by pass vessel why be sealskin so valuable father ask ted it have always be admire because it be so warm and soft reply mr strong all the lady fancy it and it never seem to go out of fashion there be a time when the pribylov island be first discover that sealskin be so plentiful that they sell in alaska for a dollar apiece hunter kill so many kill old and young that soon there be scarcely any leave so a law be pass by the russian government forbid any kill for five year since the american have own alaska they have protect the seal allow they to be kill only at certain time and only male seal from two to four year old be kill the indian be always the killer and be wonderfully swift and clever never miss a blow and always kill instantly so that there be almost no suffer how do they know where to find the seal ask ted for half the year the seal swim about the sea but in may they return to they favorite haunt in these rookery family of they herd on the rock the male staying at home with he funny little black puppy while the mother swim about seek food the seal be very timid and will rush into the water at the least strange noise a story be tell that the bark of a little pet dog belong to a russian at one of the rookery lose he a hundred thousand dollar for the seal take fright and scurry away before any one could say ` jack robinson ' rather a expensive pup comment ted but what about the seal daddy you seem to think i be a encyclopedia on the seal question say he father there be not much else to tell you how can they manage always to kill the right one demand ted the gay bachelor seal herd together away from the rest and sleep at night on the rock early in the morning the aleut slip in between they and the herd and drive they slowly to the killing-ground where they be quickly kill and skin and the skin take to the salting-house the indian use the flesh and blubber and the climate be such that before another year the hollow bone be lose in the grass and earth what become of the skin after they be salt they be usually send to london where they be prepare for market the work be all do by hand which be one reason that they be so expensive they be first work in saw-dust clean scrape wash shave pluck dye with a hand-brush from eight to twelve time wash again and free from the least speck of grease by a last bath in hot sawdust or sand i do not wonder a sealskin coat cost so much say ted if they have get to go through all that performance i wish we could have see the island but i would hate to see the seal kill it do not seem like hunting just to knock they on the head it be too much like the stock-yard at home yes but it be a satisfaction to know that it be do in the easiest possible way for the animal what a lot you be learn way up here in alaska be not you son to-morrow we 'll be at nome and then you head will be so stuff with mine and mining that you will forget all about everything else i do not want to forget any of it say ted it be all bully chapter x in the gold country a low sandy beach without a tree to break its level row of plain frame-house some tent and wooden shanty scatter about the surf break over the shore in splendid foam -- this be teddy 's first impression of nome they have sail over from st michael 's to see the great gold-field and both the boy be full of eagerness to be on land it seem however as if they desire be not to be realize for landing at nome be a difficult matter nome be on the south shore of that part of alaska know as seward peninsula and it have no harbor it be on the open seacoast and catch all the fierce storm that sweep northward over ber sea generally seacoast town be build in certain spot because there be a harbor but nome be not really build it je ' grow for when gold be find there the miner sit down to gather the harvest caring nothing about a harbor ship can not go within a mile of land and passenger have to go ashore in small lighter sometimes when they arrive they can not go ashore at all but have to wait several day take refuge behind a small island ten mile away lest they drag they anchor and be dash to piece on the shore there have be a tremendous storm at nome the day before ted arrive and landing be more difficult than usual but impatient as the boy be at last it seem safe to venture and the party leave the steamer to be put on a rough barge flat-bottomed and stout which be haul by cable to shore until it ground on the sand they be then put in a sort of wooden cage let down by chain from a huge wooden beam and swing round in the air like the unload crane of a great city over the surf to a high platform on the land well this be a new way to land cry ted who have be rather quiet during the performance and he father think a trifle frightened it be a sort of a balloon ascension be not it it must be rather hard for the miner who have be wait week for they mail when the boat can not land she bag at all say mr strong that sometimes happen from November to may nome be cut off from the world by snow and ice the only news they receive be by the monthly mail when it come over at kronstadt the russian have ice-breaking boat which keep the baltic clear enough of ice for navigation and plow they way through ice fourteen foot thick for two hundred mile the nome miner be very anxious for the government to try this ice-boat service at nome why do people settle here in such a forlorn place ask ted as they make they way to the town which they find anything but civilized i like the indian house on the island better than this you island be more picturesque say mr strong but people come here for what they could get in 1898 gold be discover on anvil creek which run into snake river and this turn people 's eye in the direction of nome miner rush here and set to work in the gulch inland but it be not till the summer of 1899 that gold be find on the beach a soldier from the barracks -- you know this be part of a united state military reservation -- find gold while digging a well near the beach and a old miner take out $ 1200 worth in twenty day then a perfect frenzy seize the people they flock to nome from far and near they camp on the beach in hundred and stake they claim between one and two thousand man be at work on the beach at one time yet so good-natured be they that no quarrel seem to have occur doctor lawyer barkeeper and all drop they business and go to-rocking as they call beach-mining oh dad let 's hurry and go and see it cry ted as they hurry through they dinner at the hotel i think gold come out of deep mine like copper and have to be melt out or something but this seem to be different do they just walk along the beach and pick it up i wish i could well it be not quite so simple as that say mr strong laughing we 'll go and see and then you 'll understand and they go down the crooked street to the sandy beach man be stand about talk and laugh other work hard all manner of man be there scatter over the _ tundra _ -lrb- 14 -rrb- and ted become interested in two who be work together in silence -lrb- footnote 14 : the name give to the boggy soil of the beach -rrb- -lrb- illustration : ` let 's watch those two man they have evidently stake a claim together ' -rrb- what be they do he ask he father i can not see how they expect to get anything worth have out of this mess beach-mining be quite different from any other say he father let 's watch those two man they have evidently stake a claim together which mean that nobody but these two can work on the ground they have stake out and that they must share all the gold they find they come here to prospect and evidently find a block of ground which suit they they then dig a prospect hole down two to five foot until they strike ` bedrock ' which happen to be clay around here they pass through several layer of sand and gravel before reach this and these be carefully examine to see how much gold they contain upon reach a layer which seem to be a good one the gravel on top be strip off and throw aside and the ` pay streak ' work with the rocker what be that ask ted who be all ear while kalitan be take in everything with he sharp black eye that arrangement that look like a square pan on a saw-buck be the rocker the rocker usually have copper bottom and there be a great demand for sheet copper at nome but often there be not enough of it and the miner have be know to cover they with silver coin that man you be watch have silver dollar in he about fifty i should say it seem extravagant do not it but he 'll take out many time that amount if he have good luck the man who have glance up at they smile at that and say : and if i do not have luck i be break anyhow so fifty or sixty plunk will not make much difference you go to be a miner youngster not this trip say ted with a smile say i would like to know how you get the gold out with that at first we use to put a blanket in the rocker and wash the pay dirt on that we prospect hole have water in it and we can use it over and over some of the hole be dry and there the man have to pack they pay dirt down to the shore and use surf water for wash most of we gold be so fine that the blanket do not stop it so now we use ` quick ' i reckon you would call it mercury but we call it quick you see it save time and work-time up here be so short on account of winter setting in so early that we have to save up we spare minute and not waste 'em on long word ted grin cheerfully and ask : what do you do with the quick we paint it over the bottom of the rocker and it act like a charm and catch every speck of gold that come its way as the dirt be wash over it the quick and the gold make a sort of amalgam but how do you get at the gold after it amalgam or whatever you call it ask ted sure we fry it in the frying-pan and it be elegant pancake it make say the man see here and he pull from he pocket several flat mass that look like piece of yellow sponge this be pure gold all the quick have go off and this be the real stuff just as good as money a ounce will buy sixteen dollar ' worth of anything in nome it look mighty pretty say ted seem to I it be redder than any gold i ever see it be say he father nome beach gold be redder and brighter than any other alaskan gold i guess i 'll have to get you each a piece for a souvenir and both boy be make happy by the present of a quaintly shaped nugget buy by mr strong from the very miner who have mine it which of course add to its value you be gather quite a lot of souvenir ted say he father it be a great relief that you have not ask I for anything alive yet i have be expect a modest request for a maiamute or a husky pup or perhaps a pet reindeer to take home but so far you have be quite moderate in you demand kalitan never ask for anything say ted i ask he once why it be and he say indian boy never get what they ask for that sometimes they have thing give to they that they have not ask for but if he ask the tyee for anything all he get be ` good indian get thing for himself ' and he have to go to work to get the thing he want i guess it be a pretty good plan too for i notice that i get just as much as i do when i use to tease you for thing teddy add sagely wise boy say he father you be certainly more agreeable to live with the next thing you be to have be a visit to a esquimo village and if i can find some of the esquimo carving you shall have something to take home to mother kalitan what would you like to remember the esquimo by kalitan smile and reply simply _ mukluk _ what be _ mukluk _ demand ted esquimo moccasin say mr strong well you shall both have a pair and they be rather pretty thing too as the esquimo make they chapter xi afternoon tea in a eglu the esquimo village be reach across the _ tundra _ and teddy and kalitan be much interested in the queer house build for the long winter of six or eight month when it be impossible to do anything out-of-door the _ eglu _ -lrb- 15 -rrb- seem quite comfortable from the esquimo point of view but very strange to they american cousin -lrb- footnote 15 : the _ eglu _ be the esquimo house often they occupy tent during the summer but return to the hut the first cool night -rrb- i think the esquimo live in snow house say ted as they look at the queer little hut and kalitan exclaim : huh innuit queer indian no say mr strong he hut be build by digging a hole about six foot deep and standing log up side by side around the hole on the top of these be place log which rest even with the ground stringer be put across these and other log and moss and mud roof over it leave a opening in the middle about two foot square this be cover with a piece of walrus entrail so thin and transparent that light easily pass through it and it serve as a window the only one they have a smoke-hole be cut through the roof but there be no door for the hut be enter through another room build in the same way fifteen or twenty foot distant and connect by a underground passage about two foot square with the main room the entrance-room be enter through a hole in the roof from which a ladder reach the bottom of the passage can we go into a hut ask ted i 'll ask that woman cooking over there say mr strong as they go up to a woman who be cooking over a peat fire hold over the coal a old battered skillet in which she be frying fish she nod and smile at the boy and as esquimo be always friendly and hospitable soul tell they to go right into she _ iglu _ which be close by they climb down the ladder crawl along the narrow passage to where a skin hang before a opening and push it aside enter the living-room here they find a old man busily engage in carve a walrus tooth another sew _ mukluk _ while a girl be sing a quaint lullaby to a child of two in the corner the young girl rise and put the baby down on a pile of skin speak to they in good english say quietly : you be welcome i be alalik may we see you wares we wish to buy say mr strong courteously you may see whether you buy or not she say with a smile which show a mouth full of even white tooth and she spread out before they a collection of esquimo goods there be all kind of carving from walrus tusk grass basket moccasin of walrus hide stone bowl and cup _ parka _ make of reindeer skin and one superb one of bird feather _ ramleika _ and all manner of carve trinket the most charming of which to ted 's eye be a tiny _ oomiak _ with a esquimo in it make to be use as a breast-pin this he buy for he mother and a carve of a baby for judith while he father make he and kalitan happy with present where do you learn such english ask mr strong of alalik wonder too where she learn she pretty modest way for esquimo woman be commonly free and easy i be for two year at the mission at holy cross she say there i learn much that be good then my mother die and i come home she speak simply and mr strong wonder what would be the fate of this sweet-faced girl do you learn to sew from the sister ask ted who have be look at the garment she have make in which the stitch though make in skin and sewn with deer sinew be as even as though do with a machine oh no she say we learn that at home when i be no larger than zaksriner there my mother teach I to braid thread from deer and whale sinew and we must sew very much in winter if we have anything to sell when summer come it be very hard to get enough to live since the boston man come we people waste the summer in idleness so we have nothing store for the winter 's food hundred die and many sickness come upon we in the village where my people live in each house lay the dead of what the boston man call measles and there be not leave enough live to bury the dead only we escape and a black gown come from the mission to help and he take I and antisarlook my brother to the school the rest come here where we live very well because there be in the summer people who buy what we make in the winter how do you get you skin so soft ask ted feel the exquisite texture of a bag she have just finish it be a beautiful bit of work a tobacco-pouch or tee-rum-i-ute make of reindeer skin decorate with bead and the soft creamy fur of the ermine in its summer hue we scrape it a very long time and pull and rub she say plenty of time for patience in winter you hand be too small and slim i should not think you could do much with those stiff skin say teddy alalik smile at the compliment and a little flush creep into the clear olive of she skin she be clean and neat and the _ eglu _ though close from be shut up be neater than most of the esquimo house the bowl fill with seal oil which serve as fire and light be unlighted and alalik 's father motion to she and say something in innuit to which she smilingly reply : my father wish you to eat with we she say and produce she flint bag in this be some wad of fibrous material use for wick roll a piece of this in wood ash she hold it between she thumb and a flint strike she steel against the stone and spark fly out which light the fiber so that it burst into flame this be throw into the bowl of oil and she deftly begin prepare tea she serve it in cup of grass and ted think he have never taste anything nicer than the cup of afternoon tea serve in a _ eglu _ alalik what be you singing as we come in ask ted a song my mother always sing to we she reply it be call ` ahmi ' and be a esquimo slumber song will you sing it now ask mr strong and she smile in assent and sing the quaint croon lullaby of she esquimo mother -- the wind blow over the yukon my husband hunt the deer on the koyukun mountain ahmi ahmi sleep little one wake not long since my husband depart why do he wait in the mountain ahmi ahmi sleep little one softly where be my own do he lie starve on the hillside why do he linger come he not soon i will seek he among the mountain ahmi ahmi sleep little one sleep the crow have come laugh he beak be red he eye glisten the false one ` thanks for a good meal to kuskokala the shaman on the sharp mountain quietly lie you husband ' ahmi ahmi sleep little one wake not ` twenty deer ' tongue tie to the pack on he shoulder not a tongue in he mouth to call to he wife with wolf fox and raven be fight for morsel tough and hard be the

tongue in he belt go gather wood old woman off fly the crow liar cheat and deceiver wake little sleeper and call to you father he bring you back fat marrow and venison fresh from the mountain tired and worn he have carve a toy of the deer 's horn while he be sit and wait long for the deer on the hillside wake and see the crow hide himself from the arrow wake little one wake for here be you father thank alalik for the quaint song sing in a sweet touching voice they all take they departure laden with purchase and delighted with they visit but you must not think this be a fair sample of esquimo hut or esquimo life say mr strong to the boy these be near enough civilized to show the best side of they race but theirs must be a terrible existence who be inland or on island where no one ever come and whose only idea of life be a constant struggle for food i think i would rather be a american remark ted while kalitan say briefly : i like thlinkit chapter xii the splendor of saghalie tyee the _ tundra _ be greenish-brown in color and look like a great meadow stretch from the beach like a new moon gently upward to the cone of volcanic mountain far away the ground frozen solid all the year thaw out for a foot or two on the surface during the warm month and here and there be scatter wild flower spring beauty purple primrose yellow anemone and saxifrage bloom in beauty and wild honey-bee gay bumblebee and fat mosquito buzz and hum everywhere ted and kalitan be go to see the reindeer farm at port clarence and as this be to be they last jaunt in alaska they be determine to make the best of it next day they be to take ship from cape prince of wale and go straight to sitka here ted be to start for home and mr strong be to leave kalitan at the mission school for a year 's schooling which to kalitan 's great delight be to be a present to he from he american friend tell we about the reindeer farm daddy have they always be here demand ted as they tramp over the _ tundra _ cover with moss grass and flower no say he father they be quite recent arrival in alaska the esquimo use to live entirely upon the game they kill before the whites come there be many walrus which they use for many thing whale too they could easily capture before the whaler drive they north and then they hunt the wild reindeer until now there be scarcely any leave there be little left for they to eat but small fish for you see the whites have take away or destroy they food supply one day in 1891 a american vessel discover a entire village of esquimo starve be reduce to eat they dog and it be think quite time that the government do something for these people whose land they have buy finding that people of the same race in siberium be prosperous and healthy they send to investigate condition and find that the siberian esquimo live entirely by means of the reindeer the government decide to start a reindeer farm and see if it would not benefit the native how do it work ask ted very well indeed say he father at first about two hundred animal be bring over and they increase about fifty per cent the first year everywhere in the arctic region the _ tundra _ give the reindeer the moss he live on it be never dry in summer because the frost prevent any underground drainage and even in winter the animal feed upon it and thrive there be it be say hundred of thousand of square mile of reindeer moss in alaska and reindeer station have be establish in many place and as the native be the only one allow to raise they it seem as if this might be the way find to help the industrious esquimo to help themselves but if it all belong to the government how can it help the native ask ted of course they have to be teach the business say mr strong the government bring over some lapp and finlander to care for the deer at first and these take young esquimo to train each one serve five year as herder have a certain number of deer set apart for he each year and at the end of he service go into business for himself why i think that be fine cry ted oh daddy what be that it look like a queer tangle up forest all bare branch in the summer that be a reindeer herd lie down for they noonday rest what you see be they antler how would you like to be in the midst of that forest of branch ask mr strong no thank you say teddy but kalitan say : reindeer very gentle they will not hurt unless very much frighten what queer-looking animal they be say ted as they approach nearer a sort of a cross between a deer and a cow perhaps they be more useful than handsome but i think there be something picturesque about they especially when hitch to sled and skim over the frozen ground the farm at teller be certainly a interesting spot teddy see the deer feed and milk the lapland woman be expert in that line and find the herder in they quaint _ parka _ tie around the waist and conical cap scarcely less interesting than the deer two funny little lapp baby he take to ride on a large reindeer which proceeding do not frighten the baby half so much as do the white boy who put they on the deer a reindeer be to they a everyday occurrence but a boston boy be quite another matter better than the reindeer however teddy and kalitan like the draught dog who haul the water at the station a great cask on wheel be pull by five magnificent dog beautiful fellow with bright alert face they be the most faithful creature in the world say mr strong devoted to they master even though the master be cruel to they reindeer can work all day without a mouthful to eat live on one meal at night of seven pound of corn-meal mush with a pound or so of dry fish cook into it on long journey they can live on dry fish and snow and five dog will haul four hundred pound thirty-five mile a day they carry the united state mail all over alaska i should think the dog would be worth more than the reindeer say ted many alaskan traveller say he be by far the best for travel but he can not feed himself on the _ tundra _ nor can he be eat himself if necessary the jarvi expedition prove the value of the reindeer say mr strong what be that ask ted some year ago a whale fleet be catch in the ice near point barrow and in danger of starve to death and word of this be send to the government the president order the revenue cutter _ bear _ to go as far north as possible and send a relief party over the ice by sledge with provision when the _ bear _ could go no farther she commander land lieutenant jarvi who be familiar with the region and a relief party they be to seek the nearest reindeer station and drive a reindeer herd to the relief of the starving people the party reach cape nome and secure some deer and the rescue be make but under such difficulty that it be one of the most heroic story of the age these man drive four hundred reindeer over two thousand mile north of the arctic circle over frozen sea and snow-covered mountain and find the starve sailor who eat the fresh reindeer meat which last until the ice melt in the spring and set they free i think that be fine say ted but it seem a little hard on the reindeer do not it to tramp all that distance just to be eat animal
