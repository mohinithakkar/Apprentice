orchid & c & c _ 1897 preface to first edition 1893 this book have be write and be publish with the distinct object in view of bring home to the mind of planter of hardy tree and shrub the fact that the monotonous repetition in at least nine-tenth of we park and garden of such tree as the elm the lime and the oak and such shrub as the cherry laurel and the privet be neither necessary nor desirable there be quite a host of choice and beautiful flowering species which though at present not generally know be yet perfectly hardy of the simplest culture and equally well adapt for the ornamentation of we public and private park and garden of late year with the marked decline in the cultivation of coniferous tree many of which be ill adapt for the climate of this country the interest in we lovely flowering tree and shrub have be greatly revive this fact have be well exemplify in the numerous enquiry after these subject and the space devote to they description and mode of cultivation in the horticultural press in the hope too of help to establish a much-desired standard of nomenclature i have follow the generic name adopt by the author of _ the genus plantarum _ and the specific name and orthography as far as i have be able of the _ index kewensis _ and where possible i have give the synonym the date of introduction and the native country the alphabetical arrangement that have be adopt both with regard to the genus and species it be hope will greatly facilitate the work of reference to its page the descriptive note and hint on cultivation the select list of tree and shrub for various special purpose and the calendarial list which indicate the flowering season of the different species may be consider all the more valuable for be concisely write and make readily accessible by means of the index no work write on a similar plan and treat solely of hardy ornamental flowering tree and shrub have hitherto be publish and it be not suppose for a moment that the present one will entirely supply the deficiency but should it meet with any measure of public approval it may be the means of pave the way towards the publication of a more elaborate work -- and one altogether more worthy of the interesting and beautiful flowering tree and shrub that have be find suitable for plant in the climate of the british isle of the fully thirteen hundred species and variety of tree and shrub enumerate all may be depend upon as be hardy in some part of the country several of they and particularly those introduce from china and japan have not before be include in a book of this character trial for the special purpose of test the hardiness of the more tender kind have be institute and carry out in several favored part of england and ireland adw hollydale woburn preface to second and cheap edition 1897 the first edition of hardy ornamental flowering tree and shrub have be sell out it have be consider desirable to run off a second and cheap edition on exactly similar line to the first and previous to the more elaborate illustrated edition which be now in hand adw boxmoor hert 1897 hardy ornamental flowering tree & shrub abelium abelium

double-flowered a variegated and several lobed and cut-leaved form the tree need no description the spike of pinky-white flower which be produce in great abundance and ample foliage render it one of if not the handsomest tree of we acquaintance it give a please shade and form a impose and picturesque object in the landscape especially where the condition of soil -- a rich free loam -- be provide ae hippocastanum alba flore-pleno -lrb- the double white horse chestnut -rrb- have a decidedly pyramidal habit of growth and the flower which be larger than those of the species be perfectly double it be a very distinct and desirable large grow tree ae hippocastanum lacinia and ae hippocastanum digitali be valuable for they divide leaf while ae hippocastanum folii variegati have the foliage rather
