that create all that be there -- not a hundred heart glow with the adoration that such a appeal to the sens and understand ought naturally to produce this indifference in a great measure come of familiarity the thing that we so constantly have before we become as a part of the air we breathe and as little regarded one of the consequence of this disposition to disregard the almighty hand as it be so plainly visible in all around we be that of substitute we own power in its stead in this period of the world in enlighten country and in the absence of direct idolatry few man be so hardy as to deny the existence and might of a supreme be but this fact admit how few really feel that profound reverence for he that the nature of we relation justly demand it be the want of a due sense of humility and a sad misconception of what we be and for what we be create that mislead we in the due estimate of we own insignificance as compare with the majesty of god very few man attain enough of human knowledge to be fully aware how much remain to be learn and of that which they never can hope to acquire we hear a great deal of god-like mind and of the far-reaching faculty we possess and it may all be worthy of we eulogium until we compare ourselves in these as in other particulars with he who produce they then indeed the utter insignificance of we means become too apparent to admit of a cavil we know that we be bear and that we die science have be able to grapple with all the phenomenon of these two great physical fact with the exception of the most material of all -- those which should tell we what be life and what be death something that we can not comprehend lie at the root of every distinct division of natural phenomenon thus far shalt thou go and no farther seem to be imprint on every great fact of creation there be a point attain in each and all of we acquisition where a mystery that no human mind can scan take the place of demonstration and conjecture this point may lie more remote with some intellect than with other but it exist for all arrest the induction of all conceal all we be aware that the more learn among those who disbelieve in the divinity of christ suppose themselves to be sustain by write authority contend for error of translation mistake and misapprehension in the ancient text nevertheless we be incline to think that nine-tenth of those who refuse the old and accept the new opinion do so for a motive no better than a disinclination to believe that which they can not comprehend this pride of reason be one of the most insinuate of we foible and be to be watch as a most potent enemy how completely and philosophically do the venerable christian creed embrace and modify all these workings of the heart we say philosophically for it be not possible for mind to give a juster analysis of the whole subject than st paul 's most comprehensive but brief definition of faith it be this faith which form the mighty feature of the church on earth it equalize capacity condition mean and end hold out the same encouragement and hope to the least as to the most gifted of the race count gift in they ordinary and more secular point of view it be when health or the usual means of success abandon we that we be make to feel how totally we be insufficient for the achievement of even we own purpose much less to qualify we to reason on the deep mystery that conceal the beginning and the end it have often be say that the most successful leader of they fellow man have have the clearest view of they own insufficiency to attain they own object if napoleon ever say as have be attribute to he _ je propose et je dispose _ it must have be in one of those fleeting moment in which success blind he to the fact of he own insufficiency no man have a deeper reliance on fortune cast the result of great event on the decree of fate or more anxiously watch the rise and set of what he call he star this be a faith that could lead to no good but it clearly denote how far the boldest design the most ample means and the most vaulting ambition fall short of give that sublime consciousness of power and its fruit that distinguish the reign of

science which employ the seaman of the four greatest maritime state of christendom make discovery that have render the polar circle much more familiar to this age than to any that have precede it so far as exist record show we say exist record for there be much reason for believe that the ancient have a knowledge of we hemisphere though less for suppose that they ever brave the danger of the high latitudes many be just at this moment much disposed to believe that ophir be on this continent though for a reason no better than the circumstance of the recent discovery of much gold such savan should remember that ` peacock ' come from ancient ophir if this be in truth that land the adventurer of israel cause it to be denude of that bird of beautiful plumage such name as those of parry

shall drink naught but brine _ tempest _ while there be less of that high polish in america that be obtain by long intercourse with the great world than be to be find in nearly every european country there be much less positive rusticity also there the extreme of society be widely separated repel rather than attract each other while among ourselves the tendency be to gravitate towards a common center thus it be that all thing in america become subject to a mean law that be productive of a mediocrity which be probably much above the average of that of most nation possibly of all england except but which be only a mediocrity after all in this way excellence in nothing be justly appreciate nor be it often recognize and the suffrage of the nation be pretty uniformly bestow on quality of a secondary class number have sway and it be as impossible to resist they in decide on merit as it be to deny they power in the ballot-box time alone with its great curative influence supply the remedy that be to restore the public mind to a healthful state and give equally to the pretender and to he who be worthy of renown he proper place in the page of history the activity of american life the rapidity and cheapness of intercourse and the migratory habit both have induce leave little of rusticity and local character in any particular section of the country distinction that a acute observer may detect do certainly exist between the eastern and the western man between the northerner and the southerner the yankee and middle state ' man the bostonian manhattanese and philadelphian the tuckahoe and the cracker the buckeye or wolverine and the jersey blue nevertheless the world can not probably produce another instance of a people who be derive from so many different race and who occupy so large a extent of country who be so homogeneous in appearance character and opinion there be no question that the institution have have a material influence in produce this uniformity while they have unquestionably lower the standard to which opinion be submit by refer the decision to the many instead of make the appeal to the few as be elsewhere do still the direction be onward and though it may take time to carve on the social column of america that graceful and ornamental capital which it form the just boast of europe to possess when the task shall be achieve the work will stand on a base so broad as to secure its upright attitude for age notwithstanding the general character of identity and homogenity that so strongly mark the picture of american society exception be to be meet with in particular district that be not only distinct and incontrovertible but which be so peculiar as to be worthy of more than a pass remark in we delineation of national custom we present purpose lead we into one of these secluded district and it may be well to commence the narrative of certain deeply interesting incident that it be we intention to attempt to portray by first refer to the place and people where and from whom the principal actor in we legend have they origin every one at all familiar with the map of america know the position and general form of the two island that shelter the well-known harbor of the great emporium of the commerce of the country these island obtain they name from the dutch who call they nassau and staten but the english with little respect for the ancient house whence the first of these appellation be derive and consult only the homely taste which lead they to a practical rather then to a poetical nomenclature in all thing have since virtually drop the name of nassau altogether substitute that of long island in its stead long island or the island of nassau extend from the mouth of the hudson to the eastern line of connecticut form a sort of sea-wall to protect the whole coast of the latter little territory against the wave of the broad atlantic three of the oldest new york county as they name would imply king queen and suffolk be on this island king be originally people by the dutch and still possess as many name derive from holland as from england if its town which be of recent origin be take from the account queen be more of a mixture have be early invade and occupy by adventurer from the other side of the sound but suffolk which contain nearly if not quite two-third of the surface of the whole island be and ever have be in possession of a people derive originally from the puritan of new england of these three county king be much the smallest though next to new york itself the most populous county in the state a circumstance that be owe to the fact that two suburban offset of the great emporium brooklyn and williamsburg happen to stand within its limit on the water of what be improperly call the east river a arm of the sea that have obtain this appellation in contradistinction to the hudson which as all manhattanese well know be as often call the north river as by its proper name in consequence of these two town or suburb of new york one of which contain nearly a hundred thousand soul while the other must be draw on towards twenty thousand king county have lose all it ever have of peculiar or local character the same be true of queen though in a diminish degree but suffolk remain suffolk still and it be with suffolk alone that we present legend require we to deal of suffolk then we purpose to say a few word by way of preparatory explanation although it have actually more sea-coast than all the rest of new york unite suffolk have but one sea-port that be ever mention beyond the limit of the county itself nor be this port one of general commerce its shipping be principally employ in the hardy and manly occupation of whaling as a whaling town sag harbor be the third or fourth port in the country and maintain something like that rank in importance a whaling haven be nothing without a whaling community without the last it be almost hopeless to look for success new york can and have often fitted whaler for sea have seek officer in the regular whaling port but it have be seldom that the enterprise have be reward with such return as to induce a second voyage by the same party it be as indispensable that a whaler should possess a certain _ esprit de corps _ as that a regiment or a ship of war should be animated by its proper spirit in the whaling community this spirit exist to a extent and in a degree that be wonderful when one remember the great expansion of this particular branch of trade within the last five-and-twenty year it may be a little lessened of late but at the time of which we be write or about the year 1820 there be scarcely a individual who follow this particular call out of the port of sag harbor whose general standing on board ship be not as well know to all the woman and girl of the place as it be to he shipmate success in take the whale be a thing that make itself feel in every fiber of the prosperity of the town and it be just as natural that the single-minded population of that part of suffolk should regard the bold and skilful harpooner or lancer with favor as it be for the belle at a watering-place to bestow she smile on one of the young hero of contrera or churubusco he peculiar merit whether with the oar lance or harpoon be bruit about as well as the number of whale he may have succeed in make fast to or those which he cause to spout blood it be true that the great extension of the trade within the last twenty year by draw so many from a distance into its pursuit have in a degree lessen this local interest and local knowledge of character but at the time of which we be about to write both be at they height and nantucket itself have not more of this intelligence office propensity or more of the true whaling _ esprit de corps _ than be to be find in the district of country that surround sag harbor long island fork at its eastern end and may be say to have two extremity one of these which be much the shortest of the two leg thus form go by the name of oyster pond point while the other that stretch much farther in the direction of blok island be the well-known cape call montauk within the fork lie shelter island so name from the snug berth it occupy between shelter island and the longest or southern prong of the fork be the water which compose the haven of sag harbor a estuary of some extent while a narrow but deep arm of the sea separate this island from the northern prong that terminate at oyster pond the name of oyster pond point be formerly apply to a long low fertile and pleasant reach of land that extend several mile from the point itself westward towards the spot where the two prong of the fork unite it be not easy during the first quarter of the present century to find a more secluded spot on the whole island than oyster pond recent enterprise have since convert it into the terminus of a railroad and green port once call sterling be a name well know to traveller between new york and boston but in the earlier part of the present century it seem just as likely that the _ santa casa _ of loretto should take a new flight and descend on the point as that the improvement that have actually be make should in truth occur at that out-of-the-way place it require indeed the keen eye of a railroad projector to bring this spot in connection with anything nor could it be do without have recourse to the water by which it be almost surround use the last it be true means have be find to place it in a line between two of the great mart of the country and thus to put a end to all its seclusion its simplicity its peculiarity and we have almost say its happiness it be to we ever a painful sight to see the rustic virtue rudely throw aside by the intrusion of what be term improvement a railroad be certainly a capital invention for the traveller but it may be question if it be of any other benefit than that of pecuniary convenience to the place through which it pass how many delightful hamlet pleasant village and even tranquil county town be lose they primitive character for simplicity and contentment by the passage of these fiery train that drag after they a sort of bastard elegance a pretension that be destructive of peace of mind and a uneasy desire in all who dwell by the way-side to pry into the mystery of the whole length and breadth of the region it traverse we be write of the year of we lord one thousand eight hundred and nineteen in that day oyster pond be in one of the best acceptation of the word a rural district it be true that its inhabitant be accustom to the water and to the sight of vessel from the two-decker to the little shabby-looking craft that bring ash from town to meliorate the sandy land of suffolk only five year before a english squadron have lie in gardiner 's bay here pronounce ` gar ` ner 's ' watch the race or eastern outlet of the sound with a view to cut off the trade and annoy they enemy that game be up for ever no hostile squadron english french dutch or all unite will ever again blockade a american port for any serious length of time the young hercule pass too rapidly from the gristle into the bone any longer to suffer antic of this nature to be play in front of he cradle but such be not he condition in the war of 1812 and the good people of oyster pond have become familiar with the checkered side of two-deck ship and the venerable and beautiful ensign of old england as it float above they nor be it only by these distant view and by means of hostility that the good folk on oyster pond be acquaint with vessel new york be necessary to all on the coast both as a market and as a place to procure supplies and every creek or inlet or basin of any sort within a hundred league of it be sure to possess one or more craft that ply between the favorite haven and the particular spot in question thus be it with oyster pond there be scarce a better harbor on the whole american coast than that which the narrow arm of the sea that divide the point from shelter island present and even in the simple time of which we be write sterling have its two or three coaster such as they be but the true maritime character of oyster pond as well as that of all suffolk be derive from the whaler and its proper nucleus be across the estuary at sag harbor thither the youth of the whole region resort for employment and to advance they fortune and generally with such success as be apt to attend enterprise industry and daring when exercise with energy in a pursuit of moderate gain none become rich in the strict signification of the term though a few get to be in reasonably affluent circumstance many be place altogether at they ease and more be make humbly comfortable a farm in america be well enough for the foundation of family support but it rarely suffice for all the grow want of these day of indulgence and of a desire to enjoy so much of that which be formerly leave to the undisputed possession of the unquestionably rich a farm with a few hundred _ per annum _ derive from other source make a good base of comfort and if the hundred be convert into thousand you farmer or agriculturalist become a man not only at he ease but a proprietor of some importance the farm on oyster pond be neither very extensive nor have they owner of large income to support they on the contrary most of they be make to support they owner a thing that be possible even in america with industry frugality and judgment in order however that the name of place we may have occasion to use shall be understand it may be well to be a little more particular in we preliminary explanation the reader know that we be now write of suffolk county long island new york he also know that we open scene be to be on the shorter or most northern of the two prong of that fork which divide the eastern end of this island give it what be properly two cape the smallest territorial division that be know to the law of new york in rural district be the ` township ' as it be call these township be usually larger than the english parish correspond more properly with the french canton they vary however greatly in size some contain as much as a hundred square mile which be the largest size while other do not contain more than a tenth of that surface the township in which the northern prong or point of long island lie be name southold and include not only all of the long low narrow land that then go by the common name of oyster pond sterling & c but several island also which stretch off in the sound as well as a broader piece of territory near riverhead oyster pond which be the portion of the township that lie on the ` point ' be or _ be _ for we write of a remote period in the gallop history of the state only a part of southold and probably be not then a name know in the law at all we have a wish also that this name should be pronounced properly it be not call oyster _ pond _ as the uninitiated would be very apt to get it but _ oyster _ pùnd the last word have a sound similar to that of the cockney 's ` pound ' in he two pùnd two this discrepancy between the spelling and the pronunciation of proper name be agreeable to we for it show that a people be not put in lead string by pedagogue and that they make use of they own in they own way we remember how great be we satisfaction once on enter holme ' hole a well-known bay in this very vicinity in we youth to hear a boatman call the port ` hum ` se hull ' it be get to be so rare to meet with a american below the higher class who will consent to cast this species of veil before he school-day acquisition that we acknowledge it give we pleasure to hear such good homely old-fashioned english as gar ` ner 's island hum ` se hull and oyster pund this plainness of speech be not the only proof of the simplicity of former day that be to be find in suffolk in the first quarter of the century the eastern end of long island lie so much out of the track of the rest of the world that even the new railroad can not make much impression on its inhabitant who get they pig and poultry butter and egg a little earlier to market than in the day of the stage-wagon it be true but they fortunately as yet bring little back except it be the dross that set every thing in motion whether it be by rail or through the sand in the former toilsome mode the season at the precise moment when we desire to take the reader with we to oyster pond be in the delightful month of September when the earlier promise of the year be fast mature into performance although suffolk as a whole can scarcely be deem a productive county be generally of a thin light soil and still cover with a growth of small wood it possess nevertheless spot of exceed fertility a considerable portion of the northern prong of the fork have this latter character and oyster pond be a sort of garden compare with much of the sterility that prevail around it plain but respectable dwelling with numerous out-building orchard and fruit-tree fence carefully preserve a pains-taking tillage good road and here and there a meeting-house give the fork a air of rural and moral beauty that aid by the water by which it be so nearly surround contribute greatly to relieve the monotony of so dead a level there be height in view on shelter island and bluff towards riverhead which if they would not attract much attention in switzerland be by no means overlook in suffolk in a word both the season and the place be charming though most of the flower have already fade and the apple and the pear and the peach be take the place of the invite cherry fruit abound notwithstanding the close vicinity of the district to salt water the air from the sea be break or somewhat temper by the land that lay to the southward we have speak of the coaster that ply between the emporium and all the creek and bay of the sound as well as of the numberless river that find a outlet for they water between sandy hook and rockaway wharf be construct at favourable point _ inside _ the prong and occasionally a sloop be see at they load its truck or discharge its ash or street manure the latter be a very common return cargo for a long island coaster at one wharf however now lay a vessel of a different mould and one which though of no great size be manifastly intend to go _ outside _ this be a schooner that have be recently launch and which have advance no farther in its first equipment than to get in its two principal spar the rigging of which hang suspend over the mast-head in readiness to be set up for the first time the day be Sunday work be suspend and this so much the more because the owner of the vessel be a certain deacon pratt who dwell in a house within half a mile of the wharf and who be also the proprietor of three several parcel of land in that neighborhood each of which have its own building and convenience and be properly enough dignified with the name of a farm to be sure neither of these farm be very large they acre unite amount to but little more than two hundred but owe to they condition the native richness of the soil and the mode of turn they to account they have make deacon pratt a warm man for suffolk there be two great species of deacon for we suppose they must all be refer to the same _ genus _ one species belong to the priesthood and become priest and bishop pass away as priest and bishop be apt to do with more or less of the savor of godliness the other species be purely laymen and be _ suus generi _ they be _ ex officio _ the most pious man in a neighborhood as they sometimes be as it would seem to we _ ex officio _ also the most grasp and mercenary as we be not in the secret of the sect to which these lay deacon belong we shall not presume to pronounce whether the individual be elevated to the deaconate because he be prosperous in a worldly sense or whether the prosperity be a consequence of the deaconate but that the two usually go together be quite certain : which be the cause and which the effect we leave to wiser head to determine deacon pratt be no exception to the rule a tighter fisted sinner do not exist in the county than this pious soul who certainly not only wear but wear out the form of godliness while he be devoted heart and hand to the daily increase of worldly gear no one speak disparagingly of the deacon notwithstanding so completely have he get to be interweave with the church -- ` meeting ' we ought to say -- in that vicinity that speak disparagingly of he would have appear like assail christianity it be true that many a unfortunate fellow-citizen in suffolk have be make to feel how close be the gripe of he hand when he find himself in its grasp but there be a way of practise the most ruthless extortion that serve not only to deceive the world but which would really seem to mislead the extortioner himself phrase take the place of deed sentiment those of fact and grimace those of benevolent look so ingeniously and so impudently that the wrong often fancy that they be the victim of a severe dispensation of providence when the truth would have show that they be simply rob we do not mean however that deacon pratt be a robber he be merely a hard man in the management of he affair never cheat in a direct sense but seldom concede a cent to generous impulse or to the duty of kind he be a widower and childless circumstance that render he love of gain still less pardonable for many a man who be indifferent to money on he own account will toil and save to lay up hoard for those who be to come after he the deacon have only a niece to inherit he effect unless he might choose to step beyond that degree of consanguinity and bestow a portion of he means on cousin the church -- or to be more literal the ` meeting ' -- have a eye on he resource however and it be whisper it have actually succeed by means know to itself in squeeze out of he tight grasp no less a sum than one hundred dollar as a donation to a certain theological college it be conjecture by some person that this be only the beginning of a religious liberality and that the excellent and godly-minded deacon would bestow most of he property in a similar way when the moment should come that it could be no longer of any use to himself this opinion be much in favor with diver devout female of the deacon 's congregation who have daughter of they own and who seldom fail to conclude they observation on this interesting subject with some such remark as well in _ that _ case and it seem to I that every thing point that way mary pratt will get no more than any other poor man 's daughter little do mary the only child of israel pratt a elder brother of the deacon think of all this she have be leave a orphan in she tenth year both parent die within a few month of each other and have live beneath she uncle 's roof for nearly ten more year until use and natural affection and the custom of the country have make she feel absolutely at home there a less interested or less selfish be than mary pratt never exist in this respect she be the very antipode of she uncle who often stealthily rebuke she for she charity and act of neighbourly kindness which he be wont to term waste but mary keep the even tenor of she way seemingly not hear such remark and do she duty quietly and in all humility suffolk be settle originally by emigrant from new england and the character of its people be to this hour of modify new england habit and notion now one of the marked peculiarity of connecticut be a indisposition to part with anything without a _ quid pro quo _ those little service offering and convenience that be elsewhere part with without a thought of remuneration go regularly upon the day-book and often reappear on a ` settlement ' year after they have be forget by those who receive the favor even the man who keep a carriage will let it out for hire and the manner in which money be accept and even ask for by person in easy circumstance and for thing that would be gratuitous in the middle state often cause disappointment and sometimes disgust in this particular scottish and swiss thrift both notorious and the latter particularly so be nearly equal by new england thrift more especially in the close estimate of the value of service render so marked indeed be this practice of look for requital that even the language be infect with it thus should a person pass a few month by invitation with a friend he visit be term ` board ' it be regard as a matter of course that he pay he way it would scarcely be safe indeed without the precaution of pass receipt on quit for one to stay any time in a new england dwelling unless prepare to pay for he board the free and frank habit that prevail among relative and friend elsewhere be nearly unknown there every service have its price these custom be exceedingly repugnant to all who have be educate in different notion yet be they not without they redeeming quality that might be point out to advantage though we limit will not permit we at this moment so to do little do mary pratt suspect the truth but habit or covetousness or some vague expectation that the girl might yet contract a marriage that would enable he to claim all he advance have induce the deacon never to bestow a cent on she education or dress or pleasure of any sort that the money be not regularly charge against she in that nefarious work that he call he day-book as for the self-respect and the feeling of caste which prevent a gentleman from practise any of these tradesman 's trick the deacon know nothing of they he would have set the man down as a fool who defer to any notion so unprofitable with he not only every _ man _ but every _ thing _ have its price and usually it be a good price too at the very moment when we tale open there stand charge in he book against he unsuspecting and affectionate niece item in the way of schooling dress board and pocket-money that amount to the considerable sum of one thousand dollar money fairly expend the deacon be only intensely mean and avaricious while he be as honest as the day not a cent be overcharge and to own the truth mary be so great a favorite with he that most of he charge against _ she _ be rather of a reasonable rate than otherwise chapter ii marry i see you niece do more favor to the count 's serving-man than ever she bestow upon I i see it i ' the orchard _ twelfth night _ on the Sunday in question deacon pratt go to meeting as usual the building in which divine service be hold that day stand less than two mile from he residence but instead of remain for the afternoon 's preach as be he wont he get into he one-horse chaise the vehicle then in universal use among the middle class though now so seldom see and skir away homeward as fast as a active well-fed and powerful switch-tailed mare could draw he the animal be accompany in she rapid progress by a colt of some three month ' existence the residence of the deacon be unusually invite for a man of he narrow habit it stand on the edge of a fine apple-orchard have a door-yard of nearly two acre in its front this door-yard which have be twice mow that summer be prettily embellish with flower and be shaded by four row of noble cherry-tree the house itself be of wood as be almost uniformly the case in suffolk where little stone be to be find and where brick construction be apt to be think damp : but it be a respectable edifice with five window in front and of two story the siding be of unpainted cedar-shingle and although the house have be erect long previously to the revolution the siding have be renew but once about ten year before the opening of we tale and the whole building be in a perfect state of repair the thrift of the deacon render he careful and he be thoroughly convince of the truth of the familiar adage which tell we that a stitch in time save nine all around the house and farm be in perfect order prove the application of the say as for the view it be sufficiently pleasant the house have its front towards the east while its end window look the one set in the direction of the sound and the other in that of the arm of the sea which belong properly to peconic bay we believe all this water some of which be visible over point and among island together with a smile and fertile though narrow stretch of foreground could not fail of make a agreeable landscape it be little however that deacon pratt thought of view or beauty of any sort as the mare reach the open gate of he own abode mary be stand in the stoop or porch of the house and appear to be anxiously await she uncle 's return the latter give the rein to a black one who be no longer a slave but who be a descendant of some of the ancient slave of the pratt and in that character consent still to dawdle about the place work for half price on alight the uncle approach the niece with somewhat of interest in he mariner well mary say the former how do he get on now oh my dear sir he can not possibly live i think and i do most earnestly entreat that you will let I send across to the harbor for dr sage by the harbor be mean sag 's and the physician name be one of merit celebrity in old suffolk so healthy be the country in general and so simple be the habit of the people that neither lawyer nor physician be to be find in every hamlet as be the case to-day both be to be have at riverhead as well as at sag harbor but if a man call out squire or doctor in the highway of suffolk sixteen man do not turn round to reply as be say to be the case in other region one half answering to the one appellation and the second half to the other the deacon have two objection to yield to he niece 's earnest request the expense be one though it be not in this instance the greatest there be another reason that he keep to himself but which will appear as we narrative proceeds a few week previously to the Sunday in question a sea-going vessel inward bind have bring up in gardiner 's bay which be a usual anchorage for all sort of craft a worn-out and battered seaman have be put ashore on oyster pond by a boat from this vessel which sail to the westward soon after proceed most probably to new york the stranger be not only well advance in life but he be obviously waste away with disease the account give of himself by this seaman be sufficiently explicit he be bear on martha 's vineyard but as be customary with the boy of that island he have leave home in he twelfth year and have now be absent from the place of he birth a little more than half a century conscious of the decay which beset he and fully convince that he day be few and number the seaman who call himself tom daggett have feel a desire to close he eye in the place where they have first be open to the light of day he have persuade the commander of the craft mention to bring he from the west indy and to put he ashore as related the vineyard be only a hundred mile or so to the eastward of oyster pond point he trust to luck to give he the necessary opportunity of overcome these last hundred mile daggett be poor as he admit as well as friendless and unknown he have with he nevertheless a substantial sea-chest one of those that the sailor of that day uniformly use in merchant-vessel a man-of-war compelling they to carry they clothes in bag for the convenience of compact stowage the chest of daggett however be a regular inmate of the forecastle and from its appearance have make almost as many voyage as its owner the last indeed be hear to say that he have succeed in save it from no less than three shipwreck it be a reasonably heavy chest though its contents when open do not seem to be of any very great value a few hour after landing this man have make a bargain with a middle-aged widow in very humble circumstance and who dwell quite near to the residence of deacon pratt to receive he as a temporary inmate or until he could get a chance across to the vineyard at first daggett keep about and be much in the open air while able to walk he meet the deacon and singular nay unaccountable as it seem to the niece the uncle soon contract a species of friendship for not to say intimacy with this stranger in the first place the deacon be a little particular in not have intimate among the necessitous and the widow white soon let it be know that she guest have not even a red cent he have chattel however that be of some estimation among seaman and roswell gardiner or gar ` ner as he be call the young seaman _ par excellence _ of the point one who have be not only a whaling but who have also be a seal and who at that moment be on board the deacon 's schooner in the capacity of master have be apply to for advice and assistance by the agency of mr gar ` ner as the young mate be then term sundry palm set of sail-needle a fid or two and various other similar article that obviously could no longer be of any use to daggett be send across to the ` harbor ' and dispose of there to advantage among the many seaman of the port by these mean the stranger be for a few week enable to pay he way the board he get be both poor and cheap a much better result attend this intercourse with gardiner than that of raise the worn-out seaman 's immediate way and mean between mary pratt and roswell gardiner there exist a intimacy of long standing for they year as well as of some peculiar feature to which there will be occasion to advert hereafter mary be the very soul of charity in all its signification and this gardiner know when therefore daggett become really necessitous in the way of comfort that even money could not command beneath the roof of the widow white the young man let the fact be know to the deacon 's niece who immediately provide sundry delicacy that be acceptable to the palate of even disease as for she uncle nothing be at first say to he on the subject although he intimacy with daggett go on increase and they be daily more and more together in long and secret conference not a suggestion be ever make by the deacon in the way of contribute to he new friend 's comfort to own the truth to give be the last idea that ever occur to this man 's thought mary pratt be observant and of a mind so constitute that its observation usually lead she to safe and accurate deduction great be the surprise of all on the point when it become know that deacon pratt have purchase and put into the water the new sea-going craft that be build on speculation at southold not only have he do this but he have actually buy some half-worn copper and have it place on the schooner 's bottom as high as the bend ere he have she launch while the whole neighborhood be exercise with conjecture on the motive which could induce the deacon to become a ship-owner in he age mary do not fail to impute it to some secret but powerful influence that the sick stranger have obtain over he he now spend nearly half he time in private communication with daggett and on more than one occasion when the niece have take some light article of food over for the use of the last she find he and she uncle examine one or two dirty and well-worn chart of the ocean as she enter the conversation invariably be change nor be mrs white ever permit to be present at one of these secret conference not only be the schooner purchase and copper and launch and preparation make to fit she for sea but young gar ` ner be appoint to command she as respects roswell gardiner or gar ` ner as it would be almost think a breach of decorum in suffolk not to call he there be no mystery six-and-twenty year before the opening of we legend he have be bear on oyster pond itself and of one of its best family indeed he be know to be a descendant of lyon gardiner that engineer who have be send to the settlement of the lord saye and seal and brook since call saybrook near two century before to lay out a town and a fort this lyon gardiner have purchase of the indian the island in that neighborhood which still bear he name this establishment on the island be make in 1639 and now at a interval of two hundred and nine year it be in possession of its ninth owner all have be of the name and blood of its original patentee this be great antiquity for america which while it have produce many family of greater wealth and renown and importance than that of the gardiner have seldom produce any of more permanent local respectability this be a feature in society that we so much love to see and which be so much endanger by the uncertain and migratory habit of the people that we pause a moment to record this instance of stability so please and so commendable in a age and country of change the descendant of any family of two century stand will as a matter of course be numerous there be exception certainly but such be the rule thus be it with lyon gardiner and he progeny who be now to be number in score include person in all class of life though it carry with it a stamp of caste to be know in suffolk as have come direct from the loin of old lyon gardiner roswell of that name if not of that ilk the island then be the sole property of david johnson gardiner the predecessor and brother of its present proprietor be allow to have this claim though it would exceed we genealogical knowledge to point out the precise line by which this descent be claim young roswell be of respectable blood on both side without be very brilliantly connect or rich on the contrary early leave a orphan fatherless and motherless as be the case with mary pratt he have be take from a country academy when only fifteen and send to sea that he might make he own way in the world hitherto he success have not be of a very flattering character he have rise notwithstanding to be the chief mate of a whaler and bear a excellent reputation among the people of suffolk have it only be a year or two later when speculation take hold of the whaling business in a larger way he would not have have the least difficulty in obtain a ship as it be however great be he delight when deacon pratt engage he as master of the new schooner which have be already name the sea lion -- or sea lyon as roswell sometimes affect to spell the word in honor of he old progenitor the engineer mary pratt have note all these proceedings partly with pain partly with pleasure but always with great interest it pained she to find she uncle in the decline of life engage in a business about which he know nothing it pained she still more to see one whom she love from habit if not from moral sympathy waste the few hour that remain for prepare for the last great change in attempt to increase possession that be already much more than sufficient for he want this consideration in particular deeply grieved mary pratt for she be profoundly pious with a conscience that be so sensitive as materially to interfere with she happiness as will presently be show while she uncle be merely a deacon it be one thing to be a deacon and another to be devote to the love of god and to that love of we species which we be tell be the consequence of a love of the deity the two be not incompatible neither be they identical this mary have be make to see in spite of all she wish to be blind as respects the particular subject from whom she have learn the unpleasant lesson the pleasure feel by we heroine for such we now announce mary pratt to be be derive from the preferment bestow on roswell gardiner she have many a palpitation of the heart when she hear of he good conduct as a seaman as she always do whenever she hear he professional career allude to at all on this point roswell be without spot as all suffolk know and confess on oyster pond he be regard as a species of sea lion himself so numerous and so exciting be the incident that be related of he prowess among the whale but there be a dark cloud before all these glory in the eye of mary pratt which for two year have disincline she to listen to the young man 's tale of love which have induce she to decline accept a hand that have now be offer to she with a seaman 's ardor a seaman 's frankness and a seaman 's sincerity some twenty time at least which have induce she to struggle severely with she own heart which she have long find to be a powerful ally of she suitor that cloud come from a species of infidelity that be get to be so widely spread in america as no longer to work in secret but which lift its head boldly among we claim openly to belong to one of the numerous sect of the land mary have reason to think that roswell gardiner deny the divinity of christ while he profess to honor and defer to he as a man far elevated above all other man and as one whose blood have purchase the redemption of he race we will take this occasion to say that we legend be not polemical in any sense and that we have no intention to enter into discussion or argument connect with this subject beyond those that we may conceive to be necessary to illustrate the picture which it be we real aim to draw -- that of a confide affectionate nay devoted woman 's heart in conflict with a deep sense of religious duty still mary rejoice that roswell gardiner be to command the sea lion whither this little vessel a schooner of about one hundred and forty ton measurement be to sail she have not the slightest notion but go where it might she thought and prayer be certain to accompany it these be woman 's means of exert influence and who shall presume to say that they be without result and useless on the contrary we believe they to be most efficacious and thrice happy be the man who as he tread the maze and wiles of the world go accompany by the petition of such gentle and pure-minded being 's at home as seldom think of approach the throne of grace without also think of he and of he necessity the romanist say and say it rightly too could one only believe in they efficacy that the prayer they offer up in behalf of depart friend be of the most endearing nature but it would be difficult to prove that petition for the soul of the dead can demonstrate greater interest or bind the party more closely together in the unity of love than those that be constantly offer up in behalf of the live the interest that mary pratt feel in roswell 's success need little explanation in all thing he be most agreeable to she but in the one just mention they age they social position they habit they orphan condition even they prejudice -- and who that dwell aside from the world be without they when most of those who encounter its collision still cherish they so strongly -- all unite to render they of interest to each other nor be deacon pratt at all oppose to the connection on the contrary he appear rather to favor it the objection come solely from mary whose heart be nearly ready to break each time that she be require to urge they as for the uncle it be not easy to say what could induce he to acquiesce in to favor indeed the address to he niece and nearest relative of one who be know not to possess five hundred dollar in the world as he opinion on this subject be well know to all on oyster pond they have excite a good deal of speculation exercise the whole neighborhood as be very apt to be the case whenever anything occur in the least out of the ordinary track the several mode of reasoning be something like these : -- some be of opinion that the deacon foresee a successful career to and eventual prosperity in the habit and enterprise of the young mate and that he be willing to commit to he keep not only he niece but the three farm he money at use and certain share he be know to own in a whaler and no less than three coaster as well as a interest in a store at southold that be to say to commit they all to the keep of young gar ` ner when he be himself dead for no one believe he would part with more than mary in he own lifetime other fancy he be desirous of get the orphan off he hand in the easiest possible way that he might make a bequest of he whole estate to the theological institution that have be coquet with he now for several year through its recognize agent and to which he have already make the liberal donation of one hundred dollar it be well ascertain that the agent of that institution openly talk of get deacon pratt to sit for he portrait in order that it might be suspend among those of other of its benefactor a third set reason differently from both the foregoing the gar ` ner be a better family than the pratt and the deacon be so well to do it be believe by these person that he be dispose to unite money with name and thus give to he family consideration from a source that be somewhat novel in its history this class of reasoner be quite small however and mainly consist of those who have rarely be off of oyster pond and who pass they day with gar ` ner 's island directly before they eye a few of the gossip of this class pretend to say that they own young sailor stand next in succession after the immediate family actually in possession should run out of which there be then some prospect and that the deacon sly fellow know all about it for this surmise to prevent useless expectation in the reader it may be well to say at once there be no foundation whatever roswell 's connection with the owner of the island be much too remote to give he any chance of succeed to that estate or to anything else that belong to he there be a fourth and last set among those who speculate on the deacon 's favor towards young gar ` ner and these be they who fancy that the old man have open he heart towards the young couple and be dispose to render a deserving youth and a beloved niece happy this be the smallest class of all and what be a little remarkable it contain only the most reckless and least virtuous of all those who dwell on oyster pond the parson of the parish or the pastor as he be usually term belong to the second category that good man be firmly impressed that most if not all of deacon pratt 's worldly effect would eventually go to help propagate the gospel such be the state of thing when the deacon return from meeting as related in the opening chapter at he niece 's suggestion of send to the harbor for dr sage he have demur not only on account of the expense but for a still more cogent reason to tell the truth he be exceedingly distrustful of any one 's be admit to a communication with daggett who have reveal to he matter that he deem to be of great importance but who still retain the key to he most material mystery nevertheless decency to say nothing of the influence of what folk would say the archimedean lever of all society of puritanical origin exhort he to consent to he niece 's proposal it be such a round-about road to get to the harbor mary the uncle slowly object after a pause boat often go there and return in a few hour yes yes -- _ boat _ but i be not certain it be lawful to work boat of a sabbath child i believe sir it be deem lawful to do good on the lord 's day yes if a body be certain it _ would _ do any good to be sure sage be a capital doctor -- as good as any go in these part -- but half the time money pay for doctor 's stuff be throw away still i think it we duty to try to serve a fellow-creature that be in distress and daggett i fear will not go through the week if indeed he go through the night i should be sorry to have he die exclaim the deacon look really distressed at this intelligence right sorry should i be to have he die -- just yet the last two word be utter unconsciously and in a way to cause the niece to regret that they have be utter at all but they have come notwithstanding and the deacon see that he have be too frank the fault could not now be remedy and he be fain to allow he word to produce they own effect die he will i fear uncle return mary after a short pause and sorry should i be to have it so without we feel the consolation of know we have do all in we power to save he or to serve he it be so far to the harbor that no good might come of a messenger and the money pay _ he _ would be throw away too i dare say roswell gardner would be glad to go to help a fellow-creature who be suffer _ he _ would not think of demand any pay yes that be true i will say this for gar ` ner that he be as reasonable a young man when he do a odd job as any one i know i like to employ he mary understand this very well it amount to neither more nor less than the deacon 's perfect consciousness that the youth have again and again give he he time and he service gratuitously and that too more than once under circumstance when it would have be quite proper that he should look for a remuneration a slight color steal over the face of the niece as memory recall to she mind these different occasion be that sensitive blush owe to she perceive the beset weakness of one who stand in the light of a parent to she and towards whom she endeavor to feel the affection of a child we shall not gainsay this so far as a portion of the feeling which produce that blush be concerned but certain it be that the thought that roswell have exert himself to oblige _ she _ uncle obtrude itself somewhat vividly among she other recollection well sir the niece resume after another brief pause we can send for roswell if you think it best and ask he to do the poor man this act of kindness you messenger after doctor be always in such a hurry i dare say gar ` ner would think it necessary to hire a horse to cross shelter island and then perhaps a boat to get across to the harbor if no boat be to be find it might be another horse to gallop away round the head of the bay why five dollar would scarce meet the cost of such a race if five dollar be need roswell would pay they out of he own pocket rather than ask another to assist he in do a act of charity but no horse will be necessary the whale-boat be at the wharf and be ready for use at any moment true i have forget the whale-boat if that be home the doctor might be bring across at a reasonable rate especially if gar ` ner will volunteer i dare say daggett 's effect will pay the bill for attendance since they have answer as yet to meet the widow white 's charge as i live here come gar ` ner at this moment and just as we want he i know of no other to ask to cross the bay sir and send for roswell before you return have you not get back as you do i should have take on myself the duty of send for the doctor in which case girl you would have make yourself liable i have too many demand on my means to be scatter dollar broadcast but here be gar ` ner and i dare say all will be make right gardiner now join the uncle and niece who have hold this conversation in the porch have hasten up from the schooner the instant he receive mary 's summons he be reward by a kind look and a friendly shake of the hand each of which be slightly more cordial than those that prudent and thoughtful young woman be accustom to bestow on he he see that mary be a little earnest in she manner and look curious as well as interested to learn why he have be summon at all Sunday be keep so rigidly at the deacon 's that the young man do not dare visit the house until after the sun have set the new england practice of commence the sabbath of a Saturday evening and bring it to a close at the succeed sunset prevail among most of the people of suffolk the episcopalian form nearly all the exception to the usage Sunday evening consequently be in great request for visit it be the favorite time for the young people to meet as they be not only certain to be unemployed but to be in they best roswell gardiner be in the practice of visit mary pratt on Sunday evening but he would almost as soon think of desecrate a church as think of enter the deacon 's abode on the sabbath until after sunset or sun_down _ to use the familiar americanism that be commonly apply to this hour of the day here he be now however wonder and anxious to learn why he have be send for roswell say mary earnestly slightly color again as she speak we have a great favor to ask you know the poor old sailor who have be stay at the widow while 's this month or more -- he be now very low so low we think he ought to have better advice than can be find on oyster pond and we wish to get dr sage over from the harbor how to do it have be the question when i thought of you if you could take the whale-boat and go across the poor man might have the benefit of the doctor 's advice in the course of a few hour yes put in the uncle and i shall charge nothing for the use of the boat so that if _ you _ volunteer gar ` ner it will leave so much towards settle up the man 's account when settle day come roswell gardiner understand both uncle and niece perfectly the intense selfishness of the first be no more a secret to he than be the entire disinterestedness of the last he gaze a moment in fervent admiration at mary then he turn to the deacon and profess he readiness to volunteer know the man so well he take care distinctly to express the word so as to put the mind of this votary of mammon at ease gar ` ner will _ volunteer _ then rejoin the uncle and i shall charge nothing for the use of the boat this be ` do as we would be do by ' and be all right consider that daggett be sick and among stranger the wind be fair or nearly fair to go and to come back and you 'll make a short trip of it yes it will cost nothing and may do the poor man good now go at once roswell say mary in a entreat manner and show the same skill in manage the boat that you do the day you win the race against the harbor oarsman i will do all a man can to oblige you mary as well as to serve the sick if dr sage should not be at home be i to look for another physician mr pratt sage _ must _ be at home -- we can employ no other you old long-established physician understand how to consider practice and do not make mistake -- by the way gar ` ner you need not mention _ my _ name in the business at all just say that a sick man at the widow white 's need he service and that you have _ volunteer _ to take he across _ that _ will bring he -- i know the man again gardiner understand what the deacon mean he be just as desirous of not pay the physician as of not pay the messenger mary understand he too and with a face still more sad than anxiety have previously make it she walk into the house leave she uncle and lover in the porch after a few more injunction from the former in the way of prudent precaution the latter depart hurry down to the water-side in order to take to the boat chapter iii all that glister be not gold often have you hear that tell many a man he life have sell but my outside to behold _ merchant of venice _ no sooner be deacon pratt leave alone than he hasten to the humble dwelling of the widow white the disease of daggett be a general decay that be not attend with much suffering he be now seat in a homely armchair and be able to converse he be not aware indeed of the real danger of he case and still have hope of survive many year the deacon come in at the door just as the widow have pass through it on she way to visit another crone who live hard by and with whom she be in the constant habit of consult she have see the deacon in the distance and take that occasion to run across the road have a sort of instinctive notion that she presence be not require when the two man confer together what be the subject of they frequent private communication the widow white do not exactly know but what she imagine will in part appear in she discourse with she neighbor the widow stone here be the deacon ag ` in cry the widow white as she bolt hurriedly into she friend 's presence this make the third time he have be at _ my _ house since yesterday morning what _ can _ he mean oh i dare say betsy he mean no more than to visit the sick as he pretend be the reason of he many visit you forget it be sabba ' day add the widow white with emphasis the better day the better deed betsy i know that but it be dreadful often for a _ man _ to visit the sick -- three time in twenty-four hour yes ' t would have be more nat ` ral for a woman a body must own return the widow stone a little drily have the deacon be a woman i dare say betsy you would not have think so much of he visit i should think nothing of they at all rejoin the sister widow innocently enough but it be dreadful odd in a _ man _ to be visit about among the sick so much -- and he a deacon of the meeting yes it be not as common as it might be particularly among deacon but come in betsy and i will show you the text from which minister preach this morning it be well worth attend to for it touch on we forlorn state hereupon the two relict enter a inner room where we shall leave they to discuss the merit of the sermon interrupt by many protestation on the part of the widow white concern the dreadful character of deacon pratt 's many visit to _ she _ cottage sabba ' day as well as week day in the meanwhile the interview between the deacon himself and the sick mariner have its course after the first salutation and the usual inquiry the visiter with some parade of manner allude to the fact that he have send for a physician for the other 's benefit i do it of my own head add the deacon or i might better say of my own heart it be unpleasant to I to witness you suffering without do something to alleviate they to alleviate sorrow and pain and the throe of conscience be one of the most pleasant of all the christian office yes i have send young gar ` ner across the bay to the harbor and three or four hour hence we may look for he back with dr sage in he boat i only hope i shall have the means to pay for all this expense and trouble deacon return daggett in a sort of doubt way that for a moment render he friend exceedingly uncomfortable go i know i must sooner or later but could i only live to get to the vineyard twould be find that my share of the old homestead would make up for all my want i _ may _ live to see the end of the other business among the other tale of daggett be one which say that he have never yet receive he share of he father 's property a account that be true enough though the truth might have show that the old man have leave nothing worth divide he have be a common mariner like the son and have leave behind he a common mariner 's estate the deacon muse a moment and then he take a occasion to advert to the subject that have now be uppermost in he thought ever since he have be in the habit of hold secret conference with the sick man what that subject be will appear in the course of the conversation that ensue have you think of the chart daggett ask the deacon and give a eye to that journal both sir you kindness to I have be so great that i be not a man apt to forget it i wish you would show I yourself the precise place on the chart where they island be to be find there be nothing like see a thing with one 's own eye you forget my oath deacon pratt every man on we take he bible oath not to point out the position of the island until a ` ter the year 1820 then each and all on we be at liberty to do as he please but the chart be in my chest and not only the island but the key be so plainly lay down that any mariner could find 'em with that chest however i can not part so long as i live get I well and i will sail in the sea lion and tell you captain gar ` ner all he will have occasion to know the man 's fortune will be make who first get to either of they place yes i can imagine that easy enough from you account daggett -- but how be i to be certain that some other vessel will not get the start of I because the secret be now my own there be but seven on we in that brig all tell of they seven four die at the island of the fever homeward bind and of the other three the captain be drown in the squall i tell you of when he be wash overboard that leave only jack thompson and I and jack i think must be the very man whose death i see would six month since as be kill by a whale on the false bank jack thompson be so common a name a body never know besides if he be kill by that whale he may have tell the secret to a dozen before the accident there be he oath ag ` in it jack be swear as well as all on we and he be a man likely to stand by what he swear to this be none of you custom-house oath of which a chap might take a dozen of a morning and all should be false but it be a oath that put a seaman on he honor since it be a good-fellowship affair all round deacon pratt do not _ tell _ daggett that thompson might have as good reason for disregard the oath as he have himself but he _ think _ it these be thing that no wise man utter on such occasion and this opinion touch the equality of the obligation of that oath be one of they there be another hold upon jack continue daggrett after reflect a moment he never could make any fist of latitude and longitude at all and he keep no journal now should he get it wrong he and he friend might hunt a year without find either of the place you think there be no mistake in the pirate 's account of that key and of the bury treasure ask the deacon anxiously i would swear to the truth of what _ he _ say as freely as if i have see the box myself they be necessitate as you may suppose or they never would have leave so much gold in sich a uninhabited place but leave it they do on the word of a die man die -- you mean the pirate i suppose to be sure i do we be shut up in the same prison and we talk the matter over at least twenty time before he be swing off when they be satisfied i have nothing to do with the pirate i be clear and i be on my way to the vineyard to get some craft or other to go a ` ter these two treasure -lrb- for one be just as much a treasure as t ` other -rrb- when i be put ashore here it be much the same to I whether the craft sail from oyster pond or from the vineyard of course well as much to oblige you and to put you mind at rest as anything else i have buy this sea lion and engage young roswell gar ` ner to go out in she as she master she 'll be ready to sail in a fortnight and if thing turn out as you say a good voyage will she make all interested in she will have reason to rejoice i see but one thing needful just now and that be that you should give I the chart at once in order that i may study it well before the schooner sail do you mean to make the v ` y' ge yourself deacon ask daggett in some surprise not in person certainly be the answer i be get somewhat too old to leave home for so long a time and though bear and bring up in sight of salt-water i have never try it beyond a trip to york or one to boston still i shall have my property in the adventure and it be nat ` ral to keep a eye on _ that _ now the chart well study before-hand would be much more useful it seem to I than it can possibly be if take up at a late hour there will be time enough for captain gar ` ner to overhaul he chart well afore he reach either of he port return the mariner evasively if i sail with he as i suppose i _ must _ nothing will be easier than for I to give all the course and distance this reply produce a long and brooding silence by this time the reader will have get a clue to the nature of the secret that be discuss so much and so often between these two man daggett finding himself sick poor and friendless among stranger have early cast about he for the means of obtain a interest with those who might serve he he have soon get a insight into the character of deacon pratt from the pass remark of the widow white who be induce to allude to the uncle in consequence of the charitable visit of the niece one day when matter appear to be at a very low ebb with he and shortly after he have be put ashore the sick mariner request a interview with the deacon himself the request have be reluctantly grant but during the visit daggett have manage so well to whet he visiter 's appetite for gain that henceforth there be no trouble in procure the deacon 's company little by little have daggett let out he fact always keep enough in reserve to render himself necessary until he have get he new acquaintance in the highest state of feverish excitement the schooner be purchase and all the arrangement necessary to she outfit be press forward as fast as prudence would at all allow the chart and the latitude and longitude be the circumstance over which daggett retain the control these he keep to himself though he aver that he have lay down on the chart that be in he chest the two important point which have be the subject of he communication although this man have be wily in make he revelation and have choose he confidant with caution and sagacity most of that which he relate be true he have belong to a sealer that have be in a very high southern latitude where it have make some very important discovery touch the animal that form the object of its search it be possible to fill a vessel in those island in a few week and the master of the sealer daggett have be he mate have make all he people swear on they bible oath not to reveal the fact except under prescribe circumstance he own vessel be full when he make the discovery but misfortune befel she on she homeward-bound passage until she be herself totally lose in the west indy and that in a part of the ocean where she have no business to be in consequence of these several calamity daggett and one more man be the sole living depository of the important information these man separate and as state daggett have reason to think that he former shipmate have be recently kill by a whale the life and movement of a sailor be usually as eccentric as the career of a comet after the loss of the sealing-vessel daggett remain in the west indy and on the spanish main for some time until fall into evil company he be imprison on a charge of piracy in company with one who better deserve the imputation while in the same cell the pirate have make a relation to daggett of all the incident of a very eventful life among other thing reveal be the fact that on a certain occasion he and two other have deposit a very considerable amount of treasure on a key that he describe very minutely and which he now bestow on daggett as some compensation for he present unmerited suffering he companion have both be drown by the upset of they boat on the return from the key in question subsequently this pirate have be execute and daggett liberate he be not able to get to the key without make friend and confidant on whom he could rely and he be actually make the best of he way to martha 's vineyard with that intent when put ashore on oyster pond in most of that which this man have relate to the deacon therefore he have tell the truth though it be the truth embellish as be so apt to be the case with man of vulgar mind he might have be mislead by the narrative of the pirate but it be he own opinion that he have not be the man be a scot prudent wary and sagacious and in the revelation he make he appear to be govern by a conviction that he own course be run and that it be best that he secret should not die with he daggett have render he certain service too and gratitude might have have some influence my mind have be much exercise with this matter of the hidden gold resume the deacon after the long pause already mention you will remember that there may be lawful owner of that money should gar ` ner even succeed in find it ' t would be hard for 'em to prove they claim sir if what mcgosh tell I be true accordin ' to he account the gold come from all side -- starboard and larboard as a body might say -- and it be jumble together and so mixed that a young girl could not pick out she lover 's keepsake from among the other piece ' t be the ` arnin be of three year cruisin ' as i understand he to say and much of the stuff have be exchange in port especially to get the custom-house officer and king 's officer out of its wake there be king 's officer among they bloody spaniard deacon pratt all the same as among the english be temperate in you language friend a rough speech be unseemly particularly of the lord 's day daggett roll the tobacco over he tongue and he eye twinkle with a sort of leer which indicate that the fellow be not without some humor he submit patiently to the rebuke however make no remonstrance against its reception no no he add presently a starn chase they say be a long chase and the owner of they doubloon if owner they can now be call must be out of sight long before this accordin ' to mcgosh some of the gold r ` aally capture have pass back through the hand of they that send it to sea and they do not know they own child it be certainly hard to identify coin and it would be a bold man who should stand up in open court and make oath to its be the same he have once hold i have hear of the same gold 's have answer the purpose of twenty bank one piece be so like another ay ay sir gold be gold and any of it be good enough for I though doubloon be my favour_ites _ when a fellow have get half-a-dozen doubloon alongside of he rib he can look the landlord full in the eye and no one think of say to sich as he ` it be time to think of shipping ag ` in ' from the nature of this discourse it will not be easy for the reader to imagine the real condition of daggett at the very moment he be thus converse of money and incidentally manifest he expectation of accompany roswell gardiner in the expedition that be about to sail the man have not actually four-and-twenty hour of life in he mary pratt have foresee he true state accustom as she be to administer to the want of the die but no one else appear to be aware of it not even the deacon it be true that the fellow speak as it might be from he throat only and that he voice be hollow and sometimes reduce to a whisper but he ascribe this himself to the circumstance that he have take a cold whether the deacon believe this account or not it might be difficult to say but he appear to give it full credit perhaps he mind be so much occupy with the subject of he discussion with daggett that it do not sufficiently advert to the real condition of the man twice that afternoon do deacon pratt go between the cottage of the widow white and he own dwelling as often do the relict fly across the way to express she wonder to the widow stone at the frequency of the rich man 's visit the second time that he come be when he see the whale-boat round the end of shelter island and he perceive by means of he glass that dr sage be in it at this sight the deacon hurry off to the cottage again have something to say to daggett that could no longer be delay the whale-boat will soon be in he observe as soon as he have take he seat and we shall shortly have the doctor here that young gar ` ner do what he have to do always with a jerk there be no such haste but he seem to be ever in a hurry do what be to be do at once and then lie by be the sailor 's rule deacon rejoin the mariner squall and gust and reefin ' and brailin ' up and haulin ' down will not wait for the seaman 's leisure _ he _ work must be do at once or it will not be do at all i be not afeard of the doctor so let he come as soon as he please medicine can not hurt a body if he do not take it there be one thing i wish to say to you daggett before dr sage come in talk too much may excite you especially talk of matter that be of interest and you may give he a false impression of you state should you get the pulse up and the cheek flush by over-talking i understand you deacon my secret be my secret and no doctor shall get it out of I as long as i know what i say i be not so friendly with they as to seek counsel among doctor then it be the lord 's day add the pharisee and it be not seemly to dwell too much on worldly interest on the sabbath a novice might have be surprise after what have pass at the exceed coolness with which the deacon utter this sentiment daggett be not so in the least however for he have take the measure of he new confidant 's conscience and have live long enough to know how marked be the difference between profession and practice nothing indeed be more common than to meet with those who denounce that in other which be of constant occurrence with themselves and who rail at vice that be so interwoven with they own moral be as to compose integral portion of they existence as for the deacon he really think it would be unseemly and of evil example for daggett to converse with dr sage touch these doubloon of the lord 's day : while he have feel no scruple himself a short hour before to make they the theme of a long and interesting discussion in he own person it might not repay we for the trouble to look for the salve that the worthy man apply to he own conscience by way of reconcile the apparent contradiction though it probably be connect with some fancy and especial duty on he part of take care of the sick man 's secret sickness it be well known form the apology for many a error both of omission and commission dr sage now arrive a shrewd observant intelligent man who have formerly represent the district in which he live in congress he be skilful in he profession and soon make up he mind concern the state of he patient as the deacon never leave he for a moment to he he first communicate he opinion after the visit as the two walk back towards the well-known dwelling of the pratt this poor man be in the last stage of a decline say the physician coolly and medicine can do he no good he _ may _ live a month though it would not surprise I to hear of he death in a hour do you think he time so short exclaim the deacon i be in hope he might last until the sea lion go out and that a voyage might help to set he up nothing will ever set he up again deacon you may depend on that no sea-voyage will do he any good and it be better that he should remain on shore on account of the greater comfort he will get do he belong on oyster pond he come from somewhere east answer the deacon careful not to let the doctor know the place whence the stranger have come though to little purpose as will presently be see he have neither friend nor acquaintance here though i should think he effect sufficient to meet all charge should they not be he be welcome to my visit answer the doctor promptly for he well understand the deacon 's motive in make the remark i have enjoy a pleasant sail across the bay with young gar ` ner who have promise to take I back again i like boat and be always better for one of these sailing excursion could i carry my patient along half of they would be benefit by the pure air and the exercise it be a grateful thing to meet with one of you temperament doctor -- but daggett -- be this man name daggett interrupt the physician i _ believe _ that be what he call himself though a body never be certain of what such people say that be true deacon you rambling houseless sailor be commonly a great liar -- at least so have i always find he most of they log-book will not do to read or for that matter to be write out in full but if this man 's name be really daggett he must come from the vineyard there be daggett there in score yes he must be a vineyard man there be daggett in connecticut as i know of a certainty -- we all know that for it be a name of weight there but the vineyard be the cradle of the breed the man have a vineyard look about he too i dare say now he have not be home for many a day the deacon be in a agony he be menace with the very thing he be in the hope of stave off or a discussion on the subject of the sick man 's previous life the doctor be so mercurial and quick of apprehension that once fairly on the scent he be nearly certain he would extract every thing from the patient this be the principal reason why the deacon do not wish to send for he the expense though a serious objection to one so niggardly be of secondary consideration when so many doubloon be at stake it be necessary however to talk on boldly as any appearance of hesitation might excite the doctor 's distrust the answer therefore come instantaneously it may be as you say doctor return the deacon for they vineyard folk -lrb- anglice folk -rrb- be great wanderer that be they i have occasion to pass a day there a few year since on my way to boston and i find five woman on the island to one man it must be a particularly conscientious person who could pass a week there and escape commit the crime of bigamy as for you bachelor i have hear that a poor wretch of that description who unluckily find himself cast ashore there be marry three time the same morning as the doctor be a little of a wag deacon pratt do not deem it necessary religiously to believe all that now escape he but he be glad to keep he in this vein in order to prevent he get again on the track of daggett 's early life the device succeed martha 's vineyard be a standing joke for all in that quarter of the world on the subject of the lady mary be in the porch to receive she uncle and the physician it be unnecessary for she to ask any question for she speaking countenance say all that be require in order to obtain a answer he be in a bad way certainly young lady observe the doctor take a seat on one of the bench and i can give no hope how long he may live be another matter if he have friend whom he wish to see or if he have any affair to settle the truth should be tell he at once and no time lose he know nothing of he friend interrupt the deacon quite throw off he guard by he own eagerness and unconscious at the moment of the manner in which he be commit himself on the subject of a knowledge of the sick man 's birth-place not have be on the vineyard or hear from there since he first leave home quite fifty year since the doctor see the contradiction and it set he think and conjecture but he be too discreet to betray himself a explanation there probably be and he trust to time to ascertain it what have become of captain gar ` ner he ask look curiously around as if he expect to find he tie to the niece 's apron-string mary blush but she be too innocent to betray any real confusion he have go back to the schooner in order to have the boat ready for you return and that return must take place young lady as soon as i have drunk two cup of you tea i have patient at the harbor who must yet be visit this evening and the wind go down with the sun let the poor man take the draught i have leave for he -- they will soothe he and help he breathing -- more than this my skill can do nothing for he deacon you need say nothing of this visit -- i be sufficiently repay by the air the sail and miss mary 's welcome i perceive that she be glad to see I and that be something between so young a woman and so old a man and now for the two cup of tea the tea be drunk and the doctor take he leave shake he head as he repeat to the niece that the medical science could do nothing for the sick man let he friend know he situation at once deacon he say as they walk towards the wharf where the whale-boat be all ready for a start there be not a hour to lose now i think of it the flash captain smith be to take a cargo of oil to boston and sail to-morrow i can write a line by she as it be ten to one she will go into the hole all we craft get into that hole or into tarpaulin cove before they venture across the shoal and a letter address to any person of the name of daggett might find the right man i 'll write it this very evening the announcement of this intention throw the deacon into a cold-sweat but he do not think it prudent to say aught against it he have buy the sea lion engage roswell gardiner and otherwise expend a large sum of money in the expectation of handle those doubloon to say nothing of the fur and here be a chance of all he calculation be defeat by the interference of impertinent and greedy relative there be no remedy but patience and this the deacon endeavor to exercise deacon pratt do not accompany the doctor beyond the limit of he own orchard it be not deem seemly for a member of the meeting to be see walk out on the sabbath and this be remember in season to prevent neighbourly comment it be true the _ doctor _ might furnish a apology but you strictly religious people when they undertake the care of other people 's conscience do not often descend to these particulars no sooner have gardiner and the physician re-embarked than the deacon return to the cottage of the widow white here he have another long and search discourse with the sick mariner poor daggett be wearied with the subject but dr sage 's prediction of a early termination of the case and the possibility that kinsman might cross over from the ` vineyard ' in order to learn what the long absent man have in he possession act on he as keen incentive by learn the most material fact now the sea lion might get so far ahead of all competitor as to secure the prize even should daggett let other into the secret and start another vessel on the same expedition he own schooner be nearly ready for sea whereas time would be need in order to make a entire outfit but daggett do not appear to be dispose to be more communicative than heretofore he go over the narrative of the discovery of the sealing-island and give a graphic account of the number and tame condition of the animal who frequent it a man might walk in they midst without give the smallest alarm in a word all that a gang of good hand would have to do would be to kill and skin and secure the oil it would be like pick up dollar on a sea-beach sadly sadly indeed be the deacon 's cupidity excite by this account a vivid picture of whale or seal have some such effect on the imagination of a true suffolk county man or more properly on that of a east-ender as those who live beyond riverhead be term as a glowing account of a prairie cover with wheat have on that of a wolverine or a buck eye or a enumeration of cent per cent have on the feeling of a wall-street broker never before have deacon pratt be so much exercise with a love of mammon the pirate 's tale which be also recapitulate with much gusto scarce excited he as much as daggett 's glowing account of the number condition and size of the seal nothing be withhold but the latitudes and longitude no art of the deacon 's and he practice many could extort from the mariner these most material fact without which all the rest be useless and the old man work himself into a fever almost as high as that which soon come over daggett in the effort to come at these fact -- but all in vain at that hour the pulse of the sick man usually quicken but on this occasion it fairly thump he have excite himself as well as he listener and the inconsiderate manner in which both have yield up they energy to these entice image of wealth contribute largely to increase the evil at length exhaustion come to put a end to the scene which be get to be dramatic as well as revolting so conscious be the deacon on return home that evening that he mind be not in such a condition as it behove he to keep it in on the lord 's day that he be afraid to encounter the placid eye of he devout and single-minded niece instead of join she and unite in the service that be customary at that hour he walk in the adjoining orchard until near nine o'clock mammon be uppermost in the place of the deity and habit offer too strong a barrier to permit he to bring as it be the false god openly into the presence of the true chapter iv oh mourn not for they they grief be o'er oh weep not for they they weep no more for deep be they sleep though cold and hard they pillow may be in the old kirk-yard bayly early on the succeed morning the whole household of deacon pratt himself include be up and do it be as the sun come up out of the water that mary and she uncle meet in the porch as if to greet each other yonder come the widow white and seemingly in a great hurry say the niece anxiously i be afraid she patient be worse he seem better when i leave he last evening though a little tired with talk return the uncle the man _ would _ talk do all i could to stop he i want to get but two or three word from he and he use a thousand without once use the few i wish most to hear a talk man be that daggett i can tell you mary he 'll never talk ag ` in deacon exclaim the widow white who have get so near as to hear the conclude word of the last speaker -- he 'll never say good or evil more the deacon be so confound as to be speechless as for mary she express she deep regret that the summons should have be so sudden and that the previous preparation be so small matter that give she far more concern than any other consideration they be not long leave to conjecture the voluble widow soon supply all the fact that have occur it appear that daggett die in the night the widow have find he stiff and cold on visit he bed-side a few minute before that this somewhat unexpected event as to the time at least be hasten by the excitement of the conversation mention there can be little doubt though no comment be make on the circumstance the immediate cause of death be suffocation from the effect of suppuration as so often occur in rapid consumption it would be represent deacon pratt as a worse man than he actually be to say that this sudden death have no effect on he feeling for a short time it bring he back to a sense of he own age and condition and prospects for half a hour these consideration trouble he but the power of mammon gradually resume its sway and the unpleasant image slowly disappear in other that he find more agreeable then he begin seriously to bethink he of what the circumstance require to be do as there be nothing unusual in the death of daggett the investigation of the coroner be not require it be clearly a natural though a sudden death it remain therefore only to give direction about the funeral and to have a eye to the safe-keeping of the effect of the decease the deacon assume the duty of take charge of everything the chest of daggett be remove to he house for safe-keep the key have be take from the pocket of he vest and the necessary order be give for the final disposition of the body the deacon have another serious and even painful half hour when he first look upon the corpse there it lay a senseless shell desert by its immortal tenant and totally unconscious of that subject which have so lately and so intensely interested they both it appear as if the ghastly countenance express its sense of the utter worthlessness of all earthly scheme of wealth and happiness eternity seem stamp upon the pinch and sunken feature not eternity in the sense of imperishable matter but in the sense of the fate of man have all the gold of the indy lie within he reach the arm of daggett be now powerless to touch it he eye could no longer gloat upon treasure nor any part of he corporeal system profit by its possession a more striking commentary on the vanity of human wish could not just then have be offer to the consideration of the deacon he moral being be very strangely constitute from early childhood he have be accustom to the cant of religion and in many instance impression have be make on he that produce effect that it be easy to confound with the fruit that real piety bring forth this be a result that we often find in a state of society in which appearance be make to take the place of reality what be more it be a result that we may look for equally among the formalist of established sect and among the descendant of those who once desert the home of they father in order to escape from the impiety of so meretricious a abuse of the substance of godliness in the case of the latter appearance occupy the mind more than that love of god which be the one great test of human conversion from sin to a improve state of that holiness without which we be tell no man shall see he creator without which indeed no man could endure to look upon that dread be face to face the deacon have all the form of godliness in puritanical perfection he have never take the name of he god in vain throughout the course of a long life but he have abstain from this revolting and gratuitous sin more because it be a part of the teaching of he youth so to do and because the neighbor would have be shock at its commission than because he feel the deep reverence for he maker which it become the insignificant be that be the work of he hand to entertain and which would of itself most effectually have prevent any wanton use of he holy name let the neighbor feel or think as they might on the subject in this way deacon pratt might be say to have respect most of the command of the decalogue not however because the spirit of god impel he through love to reverence and obey but because he have be bring up in a part of the country where it be consider seemly and right to be moral to the sens at least if not to the all-seeing eye above it be in this way that the deacon have arrive at he preferment in the meeting he have all the usual sectarian term at the end of he tongue never utter a careless expression be regular at meeting apparently perform all the duty that he church require of its professor in the way of mere religious observance yet be he as far from be in that state which st paul have describe succinctly as for I to live in christ and to die be gain as if he have be a pagan it be not the love of god that be active in he soul but the love of self and he happen to exhibit he passion under these restrain and deceptive form simply because he have be bear and educate in a state of society where they compose a integral part of existence covetousness be the deacon 's beset sin and as it be a vice that may be pretty well conceal with a little attention to appearance it be the less likely to expose he to comment than almost any other sin it be true that the neighborhood sometimes fancy he ` close ' or as they express it cluss and man get to look sharply to they own interest in they dealings with he but on the whole there be perhaps more reason to apprehend in such a community that the example of so good a man should be accept as authority than that he act should impeach he character or endanger he stand very different be the situation feeling and motive of the niece she devoutly love god and as a consequence all of those whom he have create and place around she she meek and gentle spirit lead she to worship in sincerity and truth and all that she think say and do be under the correction of the principle such motive could best produce she woman 's love for roswell gardiner alone trouble she otherwise happy and peaceful existence that indeed have cause she more than once to falter in she way but she struggle with the weakness and have strong hope of be able to overcome it to accept of any other man as a husband be in she eye impossible with the feeling she be fully conscious of entertaining towards he it would have be both in-delicate and unjust : but to accept _ he _ while he regard the redeemer as only man however pure and exalted she feel would be put herself willingly or wilfully into the hand of the great enemy of she salvation often and often have she pray for she lover even more devoutly and with hotter tear than she have ever pray for herself but so far as she could discover without any visible fruit he opinion remain unchanged and he frank nature forbid he from conceal they state from mary in this way then be unhappiness steal on the early and innocent hour of one who might otherwise have be so contented and bless it form a somewhat peculiar feature in she case that she uncle favor the view of she suitor this render the trial of the niece so much the more severe as she have no other judgment to sustain she than she own fortify as that be however by the consciousness of right and the support of that great power which never desert the faithful such be the state of feeling among some of the principal actor of we tale when the sudden death of daggett occur the body be not remove from the house of the widow white but the next morning it be convey to the grave-yard -- ` church-yard ' would have sound too episcopal -- and inter in a corner that be bestow on the unhonoured and unknown it be then only that the deacon believe he be the sole depository of the important secret he have the chart in he possession and no more revelation could pass the lip of daggett should the friend of the deceased sailor hear of he death and come to look after he effect there be very little probability of they finding anything among they to furnish a clue to either the new sealing-ground or to the bury treasure of the pirate in order to be secure he even go a little beyond he usual precaution actually discharge all indebtedness of the decease to the widow white out of he own pocket by give to she the sum of ten dollar this be handsome compensation in she eye as well as in he and he quiet the suspicion so great and unusual a act of liberality would be apt to awaken by say he would look to the friend or if they fail he to the effect for he return for it be better he should lose by the stranger than a lone widow he also pay for the coffin the digging of the grave and the other light expense of the interment in a word the deacon endeavor to hush all impertinent inquiry by apply the salve of silver wherever it be need the chest have be remove to a large light closet that communicate with the deacon 's own room when all he account be settle thither he repair arm with the key that be to expose so much treasure to he longing eye some slight qualm arise after he have lock himself in the room touch the propriety of he open the chest it be not he certainly but he put such a construction on the nature of the revelation of daggett as he think would fully justify he in proceed he have purchase the schooner expressly to go in quest of the seal and the treasure this he have do with daggett 's knowledge and acquiescence nor do he conceive that he own rights be lessen by the mariner 's decease as for himself the deacon have never believe that the martha 's vineyard man could accompany the expedition so that he presence or absence could have no influence on he own rights it be true the deacon possess no direct legal transfer of the chart but he infer that all the previous circumstance give he sufficient claim to justify he in at least look into they contents it be a solemn as well as a anxious moment to the deacon when he first raise the lid of the chest solemn because it be not possible to forget the recent decease of its late owner and anxious inasmuch as he have no certainty that he should find even on the chart the place of which he seek the latitudes and longitude certainly nothing like treasure present itself to he eye when all that daggett have leave behind he lay expose to view the chest of a common sailor be usually but ill-furnished unless it may be just after he return from a long and well-paid voyage and before he have have time to fall back on he purchase of clothes as a fund to supply he craving for personal gratification this of daggett 's form no exception to the rule the few clothes it contain be of the lightest sort have be procure in warm climate and be well worn in addition the palm needle and shell and carve in whale-bone have all be sell to meet they owner 's want and nothing of that sort remain there be two old dirty and ragged chart and on these the deacon lay he hand much as the hawk in its swoop descend on its prey as it do however a tremor come over he that actually compel he to throw himself into a chair and to rest for a moment the first of the chart open the deacon see at a glance be that of the antarctic circle there sure enough be lay down in ink three or four speck for island with lat -- ° -- and long -- ° -- write out at its side we be under obligation not to give the figure that stand on the chart for the discovery be deem to be important by those who possess the secret even to the present hour we be at liberty to tell the whole story with this one exception and we shall proceed to do so with a proper regard to the pledge make in the premise the deacon scarcely breathe as he assure himself of the important fact just mention and he hand tremble to such a degree as to fairly cause the paper of the chart to rattle then he have recourse to a expedient that be strictly characteristic of the man he write the latitude and longitude in a memorandum-book that he carry on he person after which he again sit down and with great care erase the island and the write from the chart with the point of a penknife this do he mind feel infinitely relieve nor be this all chart purchase for the schooner be lie on a table in he own room and he project on one of they as well as he skill would allow the sealing-island he have just remove from the chart leave by daggett there he also write in pencil the important figure that we be command not to reveal the second chart be then open it be of the west indy and particularly of certain key one of these last be point out in a way to leave no doubt that it be mean for the key indicate by the pirate the same prohibition exist as to this key that exist in respect to the sealing-island we can not be more explicit the write near this key be in pencil it be effectually remove by means of india-rubber when this be do the deacon use the precaution to rub some material on the clean place make by he knife on the other chart when he believe no eye could detect what have just be do have mark the proper key on he own chart of the west indy he replace the chart of daggett in the chest and lock all up again the verbal account of the sick mariner he have already transfer to paper and he now believe himself secure of all the information that be necessary to render he the richest man in suffolk when they next meet mary be surprise at the gaiety of she uncle and that so soon after a funeral he have a lighten heart however for after lead he on step by step until he have go so far as to purchase and fit out the schooner daggett have pertinaciously refuse to enter into those minute particulars which it be even now forbid we to state and a want of which would have render he previous expenditure useless death however have lift the veil and the deacon now believe himself secure in he knowledge a hour or two later deacon pratt and he niece be seat in company with two other at the dinner-table the fare be simple but good fish enter largely into the domestic consumption of all those who dwell near the water in that part of the country and on that particular occasion the uncle have in the lightness of he heart indulge in what for he be a piece of extravagance in all such region there be broken-down elderly man who live by take fish liquor have usually be they great enemy and all have the same generic character of laziness shiftless and ill-regulated exertion follow by much idleness and fit of intemperance that in the end commonly cause they death such a man fish between oyster pond and shelter island be know to all who dwell within he beat by the familiar appellation of bait joe shortly after the discovery of the latitudes and longitude on the chart the deacon have go to the wharf in he impatience to see how roswell gardiner get on with the sea lion the young man with he gang of hand be hard at work and a very material difference be to be observe in the state of the schooner from that in which she be describe in we opening chapter she rigging have all be set up every spar be in its place and altogether she have a look of preparation and completeness she water be take in and from time to time a country wagon or a ox-cart deliver alongside article belong to she store of cargo proper there be none or next to none a sealer carry little besides salt and she store in a word the work be rapidly advance and captain gar ` ner tell he impatient owner that the craft would be ready to put to sea in all that week i have succeed in engage the first officer i want add the young man and he be now busy in look up and shipping hand at stonington we must get half-a-dozen reliable man on the main and then we can take some of we neighbor here as beginner just to please they yes ship a goodly number of green hand say the deacon zealously they work at cheap ` lay ' and leave the owner the greater profit well well captain gar ` ner thing seem to be do well in you hand and i will leave you about two hour after dinner i shall want to have a word with you in private and will thank you just to step across to the house where you will be certain to find I bait joe seem to have hooked something there in ` arnest that have he i 'll answer for it that he have a sheepshead at the end of he line that will weigh eight or ten pound the word of gardiner prove true for joe actually pull in a fish of the description and weight he have just mention it be this sight that in the lightness of he heart tempt the deacon to a little extravagance joe be call ashore and after a good deal of chaffer the deacon buy the prize for half a dollar as mary be celebrate for she skill in prepare this particular fish the deacon before he leave the wharf with the sheepshead hang from one hand fairly invite captain gar ` ner so to time he visit to the house as to be present at the feast nor be this all before the deacon have settle with joe the rev mr whittle come on the wharf confessedly in quest of something to eat the regular occupation of this divine be write sermon preach hold conference marry christen and bury and hunting up something to eat about half of he precious time be consume in the last of these pursuit we do not wish to represent this clergyman as have a undue gastronomic propensity but as have a due one and a salary that be so badly pay as quite to disable he from furnish he larder or cellar with anything worth mention in advance now he be short of flour then the potato be out next the pork be consume and always there be a great scarcity of grocery and other necessaries of that nature this neglect on the part of the parishioner couple with a certain improvidence on that of the pastor leave the clergyman 's family completely in that state which be usually describe as be in the from hand to mouth condition and which consequently occupy so large a portion of the good man 's time in provide deacon pratt feel a little conscious and awkward at encounter the rev mr whittle it be not the fish that cause the first any concern fifty time have he meet and go by he pastor run about with a perplexed and hungry look when he own hand or chaise or wagon as the case might be contain enough to render the divine 's family happy and contented for a week no compunction of that sort ever trouble the deacon 's breast but he have miss the afternoon 's meeting the last sabbath a delinquency for which he feel a awkwardness in accounting while he see its necessity the salutation pass as usual the one party think intently on the absence from service and the other of the sheepshead now it happily occur to the deacon to invite he pastor also to partake of the fish there be enough for all and though no one on oyster pond be much in the habit of entertaining at dinner it be by no means unusual for the parishioner to have they pastor for a guest this lucky invitation so occupy the party that nothing be say about a occurrence so very unusual as the deacon 's absence from meet the last sabba ' day afternoon by these simple mean the party at table consist of the deacon himself mary roswell gardiner and the rev mr whittle the fish be excellent be so fresh and so skilfully prepared and mary be highly compliment by all who eat of it for she share in the entertainment but mary pratt seem sad she have not yet recover from the melancholy feeling awaken by the recent death and funeral and then she thought recur with few interruption to the long voyage of roswell and most especially to the unhappy state of religious belief in which he would undertake so hazardous a expedition several time have she hint to the clergyman she desire that he would ` talk to roswell ' but the good man though well-enough inclined have really so much to do in ` provide ' that it be not a very easy matter for he to go beyond the beaten track in order to probe the conscience of particular individual he promise fairly but always forget to perform and in this he imitate closely the example set he by he parishioner in reference to he own salary roswell gardiner therefore remain in he unbelief or what be tantamount to it under the influence of a set of opinion that conflict with all that the church have teach since the time of the apostle -- at least so think mary and so think we on the contrary the pastor and the deacon be particularly gay for man of they habitual sobriety although those be not the day of temperance _ par excellence _ neither of the guest be what might be term even a moderate drinker for a novelty in a sailor roswell gardiner seldom touch anything but water while the other two take they rum and water but it be in moderation as all the gift of god should be use as for the intemperate cry which make it a sin to partake of any liquor however prudently it be then never hear in the land on the whole the clergy of all denomination might be set down as brandy-and-water man a few occasionally carry out they principle to exaggeration but the rev mr whittle be a sober man and though he see no great harm in enliven he heart and cheer he spirit with brandy take in small quantity he be never know to be any the worse for he libation it be the same with the deacon though _ he _ drink rum-and-water of choice and no other beverage mary 's currant-wine and cider except be ever see on he table one thing may be say of liquor whether it be in its favor or not it usually bring out all there be of the facetious in a man render he conversable and pleasant for the time be at least this be apt to be peculiarly the case with the rev mr whittle and he deacon in they ordinary intercourse with they fellow-creature these good people have take up the idea that in order to be religious they countenance must be sombre and that care and anxiety should be stamp on they face just as if they have no confidence in the efficacy of the redemption few indeed be they who vindicate they profession by live at peace with god and man at oyster pond it be much the fashion to imagine that the more a person become impressed with the truth of _ he _ and articularly with those of _ she _ lose condition the more it become the party to be cynical and to pry into and comment on the backsliding of the entire community this weakness however be characteristic of neither the pastor nor the deacon each of whom regard he profession too much in the light of a regular business transaction to descend into these little abuse as for mary good creature she humility be so profound as to cause she to believe herself among the weakest and least favor of all who belong to meeting i be sorry that my late journey into connecticut prevent my see the poor man who be so suddenly take away from the house of widow white observe the rev mr whittle some little time after he have make he original attack on the sheepshead they tell I it be a hopeless case from the first so dr sage consider it answer the deacon captain gar ` ner volunteer to go across for the doctor in _ my _ boat -- with a heavy emphasis on the possessive pronoun -- and we have he to look at the patient but if the salt-water _ be _ good for consumptive people as some pretend i think there be generally little hope for seaman whose lung once give way the poor man be a mariner be he i do not know he call but have rather get the impression that he be a husbandman do he belong to oyster pond no we have none of the name of daggett here which be a tribe on the vineyard most of the daggett be seafare folk -lrb- folk _ anglice _ -rrb- and this man be one of that class _ i believe _ though i know nothing of he or of he pursuit except by a word here and there drop in discourse the deacon think himself safe in venture this little departure from the literal truth inasmuch as no one have be present or he _ think _ no one have ever be present at he many secret conference with the deceased mariner little however do he understand the character of the widow white if he flatter himself with hold any discourse under she roof in which she be not to participate in its subject so far from this have be the case the good woman have contrived to obtain not only a listening-place but a peeping-hole where she both hear and see most of that which pass between she guest and the deacon have she power of comprehension be equal to she will or have not she mind be prepossess with the notion that the deacon _ must _ be after herself old suffolk would have ring with the marvel that be thus reveal not only would a unknown sealing-island be lay before the east-ender but twenty such island and key without number each of which contain more hidden treasure than ` gar ` ner 's island ' oyster pond the plumb and fisher 's and all the coast of the sound put together enrich as each and all of these place be think to be by the hidden deposit of kidd nothing but a accident have prevent these rumor from be circulate it happen that on only one occasion daggett be explicit and connect in he narrative at all other time he discourse be break consist more in allusion to what have be previously say than in direct and clear revelation the widow most unfortunately for she means of information be with neighbor stone when the connected narrative be give and all that she know be disjointed obscure and a little contradictory still it be sufficient to set she thinking intensely and sufficient to produce a material influence on the future fortune of the sea lion as will appear in the sequel it be always a misfortune for a human be to take he departure away from home and friend observe the rev mr whittle here be a immortal soul leave to take its last great flight unsupported i dare say except by the prayer of a few pious neighbor i regret have be absent during the time he be here get home of a Friday only i be compel to devote Saturday to preparation for the sabbath and sabbath-night as i understand it he depart we be all in the hand of divine providence say the deacon with a sober mien and it be we duty to submit to my think oyster pond catch more of its share of the poor and needy who be land from vessel pass east and west and add considerably to we burthen this be say of a spot as much favor by divine providence in the way of abundance as any other in highly-favoured america some eight or ten such event as the landing of a stranger have occur within the last half-century and this be the only instance in which either of they have cost the deacon a cent but so little be he accustom and so little be he dispose to give that even a threaten danger of that sort amount in he eye nearly to a loss well exclaim the literal roswell gardiner i think deacon that we have no great reason to complain southold shelter island and all the island about here for that matter be pretty well off as to poor and it be little enough that we have to pay for they support that be the idea of a young man who never see the tax-gatherer return the deacon however there be island captain gar ` ner that be better off still and i hope you will live to find they be we young friend to sail in the sea lion in quest of any such inquire the pastor a little curiously the deacon now repent he of the allusion but he heart have warm with the subject and the rum-and-water have unlock some of its ward so timid and nervous have he become however that the slightest indication of anything like a suspicion that he secret be know throw he into a sweat not at all -- not at all -- the captain go on well-known and beaten ground -- sam what be want now here be bait joe come up from the wharf want to see master return a grey-headed negro who have formerly be a slave and who now live about the place give he service for he support bait joe he be not after he sheepshead i hope -- if he be he be somewhat late in the day ay ay put in the young sailor laughing -- tell he sam that no small part of it be bind to the southward meaning to cross the line in my company and that right soon i pay joe he half-dollar certainly -- _ you _ see I pay he captain gar ` ner i do not think it be any sich thing master there be a stranger with joe that he have ferry across from shelter island and _ he be _ come up from the wharf too yes -- that be it master a stranger who could it be a command be give to admit he and no sooner do mary get a sight of he person than she quietly arise to procure a plate in order that he too might have he share of the fish chapter v stranger i flee the home of grief at connoeht moran 's tomb to fall i find the helmet of my chief he bow still hang on we wall campbell amphibious exclaimed roswell gardiner in a aside to mary as the stranger enter the room follow baiting joe 's lead the last only come for he glass of rum-and-water serve with which by the aid of the negro he pass the back of he hand across he mouth napkin-fashion nod he good-day and withdraw as for the stranger roswell gardiner 's term be particularly significant it may be well to make a brief explanation the word amphibious be or rather _ be _ well apply to many of the seaman whaler and sealer who dwell on the eastern end of long island or the vineyard around stonington and perhaps we might add in the vicinity of new bedford the nantucket man have not base enough in the way of terra firma to come properly within the category the class to which the remark strictly apply be sailor without be seaman in the severe signification of the term while they could do all that be indispensably necessary to take care of they vessel be surpass by no other mariner in enterprise and daring and hardihood they know little about crowning cable carrick-bend and all the mystery of knot graffing and splicing a regular delaware-bay seaman would have turn up he nose in contempt at many of they way and at much of they real ignorance but when it come to the drag or to the oar or to hold out in bad weather or to any of the more manly quality of the business he would be certain to yield he respect to those at whom it have originally be he disposition to laugh it might best describe these man to say that they bear some such relation to the thorough-bred tar as the volunteer bear to the regular soldier as a matter of course the stranger be invite to take he seat at the table this he do without use many phrase and mary have reason to believe by he appetite that he think well of she culinary skill there be very little of the sheepshead leave when this its last assailant shove he plate back the signal that he could do no more he then finish a glass of rum-and-water and seem to be in a good condition to transact the business that have bring he there until this moment he have make no allusion to the motive of he visit leave the deacon full of conjecture the fish of peconic and gar ` ner 's be as good as any i know coolly observe this worthy after certainly have establish some claim to give a opinion on the subject we think ourselves pretty well off in this respect on the vineyard -- on the vineyard interrupt the deacon without wait to hear what be to follow yes sir on martha 's vineyard -- for that be the place i come from perhaps i ought to have introduce myself a little more particularly -- i come from martha 's vineyard and my name be daggett the deacon fairly permit the knife with which he be spread some butter to fall upon he plate daggett and the vineyard sound ominously could it be that dr sage have manage to get a message so far in so short a time and have this amphibious inhabitant of the neighbouring island come already to rob he of he treasure the perception of the deacon at first be far from clear and he even imagine that all he have expend on the sea lion be throw away and that he might be even call on to give some sort of a account in a court of chancery of the information obtain from the decease a little reflection however suffice to get the better of this weakness and he make a civil inclination of he head as much as to tell the stranger notwithstanding he name and place of residence that he be welcome of course no one but the deacon himself know of the thought that trouble he and after a very brief delay the guest proceed with he explanation of the object of he visit the daggett be pretty numerous on the vineyard continue the stranger and when you name one of they it be not always easy to tell just what family he belong to one of we coaster come into the hull -lrb- holme ' hole be mean -rrb- a few week since and report that she speak a inward-bound brig off new haven from which she hear that the people of that craft have put ashore at oyster pond a seafaring man who belong to the vineyard and who be bind home arter a absence of fifty year and whose name be thomas daggett the word pass through the island and a great stir it make among all we daggetts there be plenty of we vineyard people wander about the ` arth and sometimes one drop in upon the island just to die as most of they that come back bring something with they it be gen ` rally think a good sign to hear of they arrival after cast about and talk with all the old folk it have be conclude that this thoma daggett must be a brother of my father 's who go to sea about fifty year since and have never be see or hear of since he be the only person of the name for whom we can not account and the family have get I to come across to look he up i be sorry mr daggett that you be so late answer the deacon slowly as if unwilling to give pain have you come last week you might have see and converse with you relation or have you come early this morning only you might have attend he funeral he come among we a stranger and we endeavor to imitate the conduct of the good samaritan i believe he have all the comfort that oyster pond can give and certainly he have the best advice dr sage of sag harbor attend he in he last illness -- dr sage of the harbor : doubtless you have hear _ he _ mention i know he by reputation and make no doubt all be do that could be do as the sloop i name lay by the brig some time in a calm the two captain have a long talk together and ours have prepare we to hear of we kinsman 's speedy dissolution he be in a decline when he land and we suppose that no human skill could have save he as he have so skilful a physician and one who come so far i suppose my uncle must have leave property this be a home-thrust but fortunately for the deacon he have already prepare himself with a answer sea-faring man that be land on point and cape from inward-bound vessel be not very apt to be overload with worldly goods he say smile when a man prosper in that call he usually come ashore at a wharf in some large place and get into he coach to ride up to some grand tavern i have remark pastor that sea-faring man love comfort and free-living unaccountably when they can fairly get a chance at 'em that be natural deacon -- quite natural and what be natural be very likely to happen the natural man love all sort of indulgence and these among other as there be no gainsay this commonplace commentary on the species it be permit to pass unanswered i hope my kinsman have not be a burthen to any on oyster pond say the nephew inquiringly i can not say that he have return the deacon he be at little cost at first and get along by sell a few odd thing that he own as providence have place he in the dwelling of a poor widow i think it might be please to the friend -- and every man have _ some _ friend i suppose -- to settle with _ she _ this i do this very morning take she receipt in full as you can see pass the paper to the stranger as a sort of security for my advance i have the chest of the deceased remove to this house and it be now up-stairs ready to be examine it feel light and i do not think much silver or gold will be find in it to own the truth the vineyard seaman look a little disappointed it be so natural that a man who have be absent fifty year should bring back the fruit of he labor that he have expect some slight reward for the trouble he be now take to be bestow in this particular form this however be not the specific object of he visit as will appear as we proceed keep in view he real motive the nephew continue he inquiry always put he question a little indirectly and receive answer that be as evasive and cautious as he own interrogatory all this be characteristic of the wary people from which both have spring who seldom speak in a matter of business without bear in mind all the possible construction of what they be say after a discourse of some fifteen minute in which the history of the chest in its outline be fully give and during which the stranger produce write evidence of he right to interfere it be determine to make a inventory on the spot of the property leave by daggett for the benefit of all who might have any interest in it accordingly the whole party include mary be soon assemble in the deacon 's own room with the sea-chest place invitingly in the center all eye be fasten on the lid in curious anticipation of the contents for the deacon except all suppose that those contents be a profound secret the widow white could have tell they better she have rummage that chest a dozen time at least though without abstract even a pin curiosity have be she ruling motive far more than cupidity it be true the good woman have a prudent regard to she own interest and feel some anxiety to learn the prospects of she receive the stipulate price for board -- only $ 150 per week -- but the sale of the needle and palm and carve whale-bone have keep she account reasonably square solicitude on this particular interest be not at be height no : curiosity pure female curiosity a little quicken by the passion which be engender among the vulgar by the possession of a slight degree of instruction be really at the bottom of she research not only have she handle every article in the chest but she have read and re-read every paper it contain half-a-dozen letter include and make she own surmise on they nature still the good woman be very little the wiser for she inquiry of the great secret she know absolutely nothing unless the broken hint collect in she many listening could be so consider but here she ignorance cease every hole in a shirt every patch in a pair of trousers and every darn in a stock have be examine and its probable effect on the value of the garment duly estimate the only thing that have escape she scrutiny be a small till that be lock into that she could not look and there be moment when she would have part with a finger in order to overhaul it this jacket might sell for a dollar have the widow white calculated but for the hole in the elbow and that well patch would bring seventy-five cent they trowser must have cost two dollar but they ar 'n' t worth half price now that pee-jacket be the best article in the chest and send across to the harbor about the time the ship be go out it would bring enough to maintain daggett a month such have be the character of the widow 's visitation to the chest though no one know anything of she discovery not even she sister-relict neighbor stone here be the key say the deacon produce that instrument from the drawer of a table as if he have lay it carefully aside for some such moment i dare say it will be find to fit for i remember to have see daggett use it once or twice myself roswell gardiner as the youngest man and the one on whom the labor oar ought to fall now take the key apply it to the lock turn it without difficulty and then lift the lid disappointment appear on every face but that of the deacon at the meager prospect before the company not only be the chest more than half empty but the article it do contain be of the coarsest material well worn sea-clothes that have see they best day and which have never be more than the coarse common attire of a foremast hand there be little here to pay a man for cross from the vineyard observe roswell gardiner a little drily for he do not half like the appearance of cupidity that shine through the nephew 's tardy concern for the fate of the uncle the last voyage have not be prosperous i fear or the owner fail before the vessel get in what be to be do with all this dunnage deacon it would be best to take out the contents article by article answer the other and examine each and all now that we have make a beginning with the inventory it be best to go through with it the young man obey call out the name of each article of dress as he raise it from its receptacle and pass it over to he who stand there in the character of a sort of heir-at-law the last give each garment a sharp look and prudently put he hand into every pocket in order to make sure that it be empty before he lay the article on the floor nothing be discover for some time until a small key be find in the fob of a pair of old ` go-ashore ' pantaloons as there be the till to the chest already mention and a lock on that till the heir at-law keep the key say nothing touch its existence the deceased do not appear to have be much afflict with this world 's wealth say the rev mr whittle whose expectation to own the truth have be a little disappointed this may have be all the better for he when the moment of departure draw near i dare say he would have bear the burthen cheerfully put in roswell gardiner to have be a little more comfortable i never know a person seaman or landsman who be ever the worse for have thing snug about he and for hold on to the better end of he cheer as long as he could _ you _ notion of what be best for man as he draw near to he end captain gar ` ner be not likely to be of the most approved nature the sea do not produce many very orthodox divine the young sailor color bit he lip cast a glance at mary and begin a nearly inaudible whistle in a moment he forget the rebuke he have receive and laughingly go on with the inventory well he cry this be rather a poorer outfit than jack be apt to carry _ in_fit i suppose it should be call as the poor fellow who own it be inward bind when he bring up on oyster pond you 'll hardly think it worth while captain daggett to take this dunnage across to the vineyard it be scarce worth the trouble though friend and relation may set a value on it that stranger do not i see a couple of chart there -- will you hand they this way if you please they may have a value with a sea-faring man as old mariner sometimes make note that be worth as much as the chart themselves this be say very naturally and simply but it give the deacon a good deal of concern nor be this feeling at all lessen by the earnest not to say eager manner in which daggett as we shall now call this member of the family spread the chart on the bed and begin to pry into its record the particular chart first open in this way be the one include the antarctic circle and of course be that from which the deacon have be at so much pain to erase the sealing-island that the deceased mariner have lay down with so great precision and care it be evident that the martha 's vineyard-man be look for something that he could not find and that he feel disappointment instead of look at the chart indeed he may be say to have be peer at it in all its hole and cranny of which there be not a few in consequence of the tear condition of the paper several minute elapse ere the investigation terminate the stranger seem all that time to feel no interest in the remainder of he relation 's wardrobe this be a old chart and of the date of 1802 observe daggett raise himself erect as a man who have long be bent take the creak out of he back so old a chart as to be of little use now-a-day we sealer have go over so much of the ground to the southward of the two cape as to be able to do much better than this now you uncle have the appearance of a old-fashioned sailor coldly observe the deacon and it may be that he most like old-fashioned chart if such be the case he must have pretty well forget he vineyard schooling there be not a woman there who do not know that the latest chart be commonly the best i own i be disapp ` inted somewhat for the master of the sloop give I to understand he have hear from the master of the brig that some valuable information be to be find on the old gentleman 's chart the deacon start as here be a indication that the decease have talk of he knowledge to other as well as to himself it be so natural for a man like daggett to boast of what he chart be worth that he see the extreme probability that a difficulty might arise from this source it be he cue however to remain silent and let the truth develop itself in due course he attention be not likely to be draw aside by the shirt and old clothes for the stranger begin a second time to examine the chart and what be more in the high latitudes at no great distance from the very spot where the sealing-island have be place and from which they have be so carefully erase it be unaccountable that a man should wear out a chart like this and leave so few note on it say the vineyard-man much as one complain of a delinquency here be white water note in the middle of the ocean where i dare say no other white water be see but that which be make by a fish and nothing be say of any island what do you think of this captain gar ` ner lay he finger on the precise spot where the deacon have be at work so long that very morning erase the island this look well-fingered if nothing else eh its a shoal lay down in dirt answer roswell gardiner laughing -- let 's see that be about lat -- ° -- and long -- ° -- there can be no known land thereaway as even captain cook do not succeed in get as far south that be be a favorite spot with the skipper for take hold of he chart i have know one of those old-fashioned chap put he hand on a chart in that way and never miss he hold ground for three year on a stretch mighty go-by-rule people be some of we whaling-master in particular who think they know the countenance of some of the elderly fish who be too cunning to let a harpoon get fast to 'em you have be often in they sea i some think captain gar ` ner say the other inquiringly i be bring up in the business and have a hankering for it yet return the young man frankly nor do i care so much for chart they be well enough when a vessel be on she road but as for whale or seal the man who wish to find either in these time have to look for they as i tell my owner accord to report the time have be when a craft have only to get a offing to fall in with something that be worth put a harpoon into but those day be go captain daggett and whale be to be look after out at sea much as money be to be look for ashore here be the craft i see at the wharf fitting out for a whaler then she be go after luck and will accept of it in whatever form it may turn up she be rather small for the whaling business though vessel of that size _ have _ do well by keep close in upon we own coast we shall know better what she will do after she have be try return gardiner evasively what do you think of she for the bank of newfoundland the martha 's vineyard-man give he brother tar a quick impatient glance which pretty plainly say tell that to the marine when he open the second chart which as yet have be neglect sure enough he mutter in a low tone though loud enough to be hear by the keenly attentive deacon here it be -- a chart of the west indy and of all the key by this casual spontaneous outbreaking as it might be the deacon get another clue to the stranger 's knowledge that give he increase uneasiness he be now convince that by means of the master of the brig and the sloop such information have be send to the relative of daggett as have prepare they to expect the very revelation on which he hope to establish he own fortune to what extent these revelation have be make of course he could only conjecture but there must have be a good deal of particularity to induce the individual who have come over to oyster pond to look into the two chart so closely under the circumstance therefore he felicitate himself on the precaution he have so early take to erase the important notation from the paper captain gar ` ner you eye be younger than mine say the vineyard-man hold the chart up to the light -- will you be good enough to look here -- do it not seem as if that key have be note and the word rub off the chart this cause the deacon to peer over roswell gardiner 's shoulder and glad enough be he to ascertain that the stranger have place he finger on a key that must lie several hundred mile from that which be suppose to hold the bury treasure of the pirate something like a erasure do appear at the indicated point but the chart be so old and dirty that little satisfaction could be have by examine it should the inquirer settle down on the key he evidently have in he eye all would be well since it be far enough from the spot really note it be strange that so old a seafaring man should wear out a chart and make no observation on it repeat the stranger who be both vex and at a loss what to conjecture all my chart be write over and mark off just as if i mean to get out a edition for myself man differ in they taste and habit answer roswell gardiner carelessly some navigator be for ever find rock and white water and scribble on they chart or in the newspaper when they get back but i never know any good come of it the man who make the chart be most to be trust for my part i would not give a sixpence for a note make by a man who pass a shoal or a rock in a squall or a gale what would you say to the note of a sealer who should lay down a island where the seal lie about on the beach like pig in a pen sun themselves would you not call a chart so note a treasure that would alter the case sure enough return gardiner laughing though i should not think of look into this chest for any such riches most of we master navigate too much at random to make they chart of any great value they can find the place they look for themselves but do not seem to know how to tell other people the road i have know my old man lay down a shoal that he fancy he see quite a degree out of the way now such a note as that would do more harm than good it might make a foul wind of a fair one and cause a fellow to go about or ware ship when there be not the least occasion in the world for do anything of the sort ay ay this will do for nervous man who be always think they see danger ahead but it be different with island that a craft have actually visit i do not see much use deacon pratt in you give yourself any further trouble my uncle be not a very rich man i perceive and i must go to work and make my own fortune if i wish more than i have get already if there be any demand against the deceased i be ready to discharge it this be come so much to the point that the deacon hardly know what to make of it he recollect he own ten dollar and the covetousness of he disposition so far get the better of he prudence as to induce he to mention the circumstance dr sage may have a charge -- no doubt have one that ought to be settle but you uncle mainly pay he way as he go on i think the widow who take care of he be entitle to something extra and i hand she ten dollar this morning which you may repay to I or not just as you please captain daggett draw forth he wallet and discharge the obligation on the spot he then replace the chart and without open the till of the chest he shut down the lid lock it and put the key in he pocket say that he would cause the whole to be remove much as if he feel anxious to relieve the deacon of a incumbrance this do he ask a direction to the dwelling of the widow white with whom he wish to converse ere he leave the point i shall have the question of so many cousin to answer when i get home he say smile that it will never do for I to go back without take all the talk i can get with I if you will be kind enough to show I the way captain gar ` ner i will promise to do as much for you when you come to hunt up the leavings of some old relation on the vineyard roswell gardiner very cheerfully comply not observe the look of dissatisfaction with which he owner listen to the request away the two go then and be soon at the widow 's door here the young man leave he companion have duty to attend to on board the sea lion the widow white receive she guest with lively interest it form one of the greatest pleasure of she existence to be impart and receive intelligence i dare say you find my uncle a companionable man observe the captain as soon as amicable relation be establish between the party by means of a few flattering remark on one side and on the other the vineyard folk be generally quite conversable that he be captain daggett and when the deacon have not be over to perplex he and wake up the worldly spirit in he he be as well incline to preparation as any sick person i ever wait on to be sure it _ be _ different arter the deacon have pay one of he visit be deacon pratt in the habit of come to read and pray with the sick he pray i do not believe he as much as go through a single sentence of a prayer in all he visit they whull talk be about island and seal when they be by themselves indeed exclaim the nephew manifest a new interest in the discourse and what could they find to say on such subject island and seal be a strange topic for a die man i know it -- answer the widow sharply i know would it at the time but what could a lone woman do to set 'em right and he a deacon of the meetin ' the whull time if they _ would _ talk of worldly thing at such time it be not for one like I to put 'em right then this discourse be hold openly in you presence -- before you face as it might be ma'am i can not say that it be just that nor be it altogether when my back be turn they talk and i overheard what be say as will happen when a body be about you know the stranger do not press the point have be bring up in what might almost be term a land of listener a island that be cut off from much communication with the rest of the earth and from which two-third of the male must be periodically absent would be very likely to reach perfection in the art of gossip which include that of the listener yes he answer one pick up a good deal he do not know how so they talk of island and seal thus question the widow cheerfully open she store of knowledge as she proceed in she account of the secret conference between deacon pratt and she late inmate she zeal become quicken and she omit nothing that she have ever hear besides include a great deal that she have not hear but she companion be accustom to such narrative and know reasonably well how to make allowance he listen with a determination not to believe more than half of what she say and by dint of long experience he succeed in separate the credible portion of the woman 's almost breathless account from those that ought to have be regard as incredible with a surprising degree of success the greatest difficulty in the way of comprehend the widow white 's report arise from the fact that she have altogether miss the preliminary and most explicit conference this leave so much to be understand and infer that in she own effort to supply the deficiency she make a great deal of confusion in the statement captain daggett be fully assure that the deacon know of the existence of the sealing-island at least though he be in doubt whether the rumor that have be bring to he touch the bury treasure have also be impart to this person the purchase and equipment of the sea lion take in connection with the widow 's account be enough of themselves to convince one of he experience and foresight that a expedition after seal be then fitting out on the information derive from he deceased relative of this much he have no doubt but he be not able to assure himself quite so satisfactorily that the key be to be look at by the way the interview between captain daggett and the widow white last more than a hour in that time the former have glean all the information the latter could give and they part on the best term in the world it be true that the captain give the widow nothing -- he have acquit he conscience on this score by re-pay the deacon the money the last have advance -- but he listen in the most exemplary manner to all she have to say and with a certain class of vehement talker the most favor be in the world be you good listener interest have give the stranger a air of great attention and the delighted woman have pour out she torrent of word in a way that gratify in the highest degree she intense desire to be impart information when they separate it be with a understanding that letter on the same interesting subject should pass between they that afternoon captain daggett find means to remove the chest of he late kinsman across the bay to sag harbor whither he proceed himself by the same conveyance there he pass a hour or two in make inquiry touch the state of equipment and the probable time of the departure of the sea lion the fitting out of this schooner be the cause of a good deal of discourse in all that region and the martha 's vineyard-man hear numberless conjecture but very little accurate information on the whole however he arrive at the conclusion that the sea lion would sail within the next ten day that she voyage be to be distant that she absence be expect to exceed a twelvemonth and that it be think she have some other scheme in view in addition to that of seal that night this hardy mariner -- half agriculturist as he be -- get into he whale-boat and sail for the vineyard all alone take the chest with he this be nothing however for quite often before have he be off at sea in he boat alone look out for inward-bound vessel to pilot chapter vi launch thy bark mariner christian god speed thee let loose the rudder-band good angel lead thee set thy sail warily tempest will come steer thy course steadily christian steer home mr southey the visit of captain daggett take in connection with all that he have say and do while on oyster pond and at sag harbor have the effect greatly to hasten the equipment of the sea lion deacon pratt know the character of the seaman of the island too well to trifle in a matter of so much moment how much the vineyard folk have be tell in reference to he great secret he do not know but he feel assure that they know enough and have learn enough in this visit to quicken all they desire for riches and to set they in motion towards the antarctic circle with such a people distance and difficulty be of no account a man who have be cradle oats to-day in he own retire field where one would think ambition and the love of change could never penetrate be ready to quit home at twenty-four hour ' notice assume the marlingspike as he lay aside the fork and set forth for the uttermost confines of the earth with as little hesitation as another might quit he home for a ordinary journey of a week such do the deacon well know be the character of those with whom he have now to deal and he foresee the necessity of the utmost caution perseverance diligence and activity philip hazard the mate mention by roswell gardiner be enjoin to lose no time and the man engage for the voyage soon begin to cross the sound and to make they appearance on board the schooner as for the craft herself she have all that be necessary for she want below hatch and the deacon begin to manifest some impatience for the appearance of two or three man of particular excellence of whom phil hazard be in quest and whom captain gardiner have make it a point should be obtain little do the worthy owner suspect that the vineyard people be tamper with these very hand and keep they from come to term in order that they might fit out a second sea lion which they have now be prepare for near a month have purchase she at new bedford with a view to profit by the imperfect information that have reach they through the master of the brig and sloop the identity in the name be accidental or it might be better to say have be naturally enough suggest by the common nature of the enterprise but once exist it have be the means of suggest to the vineyard company a scheme of confound the vessel out of which they hope to reap some benefit but which it would be premature now fully to state after a delay of several day hazard send across from stonington a man by the name of watson who have the reputation of be a first-class sealer this accession be highly prize and in the absence of he mate both of whom be out look for hand roswell gardiner to whom command be still novel consult freely with this experienced and skillful mariner it be fortunate for the scheme of the deacon that he have leave he young master still in the dark as respect he two great secret gardiner understand that the schooner be to go after seal sea-lion sea-elephant and all animal of the genus _ phoca _ but he have be tell nothing concern the revelation of daggett or of the real motive that have induce he to go so far out of he usual course in the pursuit of gain we say it be fortunate that the deacon have be so wary for watson have no intention whatever to sail out of oyster pond have be actually engage as the second officer of the rival sea lion which have be purchase at new bedford and be then in a active state of forwardness in its equipment with a view to compete with the craft that be still lie so quietly and unconsciously alongside of deacon pratt 's wharf in a word watson be a spy send across by the vineyard-man to ascertain all he could of the intention of the schooner 's owner to worm himself into gardiner 's confidence and to report from time to time the state of thing generally in order that the east-ender might not get the start of he real employer it be a common boast of american that there be no spy in they country this may be true in the every-day signification of the term though it be very untrue in all other this be probably the most spy country in christendom if the look into other people 's concern be mean extensive and recognize system of _ espionage _ exist among merchant and nearly every man connect with the press have enlist himself as a sort of spy in the interest of politics -- many in those of other concern also the reader therefore be not to run away with impression form under general assertion that will scarce bear investigation and deny the truth of picture that be draw with daguerreotype fidelity because they do not happen to reflect the cant of the day the man watson who have partially engage to go out in the sea lion captain roswell gardiner be not only a spy but a spy send covertly into a enemy 's camp with the meanest motive and with intention as hostile as the nature of the circumstance would permit such be the state of thing on oyster pond for quite a week after the nephew have be to look after the effect of the deceased uncle the schooner be now quite ready for sea and she master begin to talk of haul off from the wharf it be true there be no very apparent reason why this step preliminary to sailing should be take in that port where there be so few opportunity for she people 's run into excess but it sound ship-shape and captain gardiner have be hear to express a intention to that effect the man arrive but slowly from the main and something like impatience be manifest by the young commander who have long before get all he green hand or youth from the neighborhood on board and be gradually break they in to the way of a vessel indeed the best reason he could give to himself for ` haul off ' be the practice it might give to these lad with the oar i do not know what hazard and green be about -- call out roswell gardiner to he owner the first be on the quarter-deck of the sea lion and the last on the wharf while watson be busy in the main-rigging they have be long enough on the main to ship a dozen crew for a craft of this size and we be still short two hand even if this man sign the papers which he have not yet do by the way watson it be time we see you hand-writing i be a poor scholar captain gar ` ner return the cunning mariner and it take time for I to make out even so small a matter as my name ay ay you be a prudent fellow and i like you all the better for it but you have have leisure and a plenty of it too to make up you mind you must know the schooner from she keel up by this time and ought to be able to say now that you be willing to take luck 's chance in she ay ay sir that be all true enough so far as the craft be concern if this be a west indium v ` y' ge i would not stand a minute about sign the article nor should i make much question if the craft be large enough for a common whalin ' v ` y' ge but sealin ' be a different business and one onprofitable hand may make many a onprofitable lay all this be true enough but we do not intend to take any unprofitable hand or to have any unprofitable lay you know I -- oh if all be like _ you _ captain gar ` ner i would not stand even to wipe the pen _ you _ repitation be make in the southward and no man can dispute you skill well both mate be old hand at the business and we intend that all the ` able ' shall be as good man as you be yourself it _ need _ good man sir to be operatin ' among some of they sea-elephants sea-dog for sea-dog be my sayin ' they tell of seal get scurce but i say it be all in knowin ' the business -- ` there be young captain gar ` ner ' say i ` that be fittin ' out a schooner for some onknown part of the world ' say i ` maybe for the south pole for-ti-know or for some sich out-of-the-way hole now he 'll come back _ full _ or i be no judge o ' the business ' say i well if this be you way of think you have only to clap you name to the article and take you lay ay ay sir when i have seed my shipmate there be not the business under the sun that so much need that every man should be true as the sea-elephant trade smaller animal may be get along with with a narvous crew perhaps but when it come to the raal old bull or bull-dog as a body might better call 'em give I stout heart as well as stout hand ` well now to my notion watson it be less dangerous to take a sea-elephant than to fasten to a regular old bull-whale that may be have have half a dozen iron in he already yes sir _ that be _ sometimes skeary work too though i do not think so much of a whale as i do of a sea-elephant or of a sea-lion ` let I know my shipmate ' say i ` on a sealin ' expedition ' captain gar ` ner say the deacon who necessarily overhear this discourse you ought to know at once whether this man be to go in the schooner or not the mate believe he be and may come across from the main without a hand to take he place should he leave we the thing should be settle at once i be willing to come to tarm this minute return watson as boldly as if he be perfectly sincere only let I understand what i undertake if i know would to what island the schooner be bind it might make a difference in my judgment this be a well-devised question of the spy 's though it fail of its effect in consequence of the deacon 's great caution in not have yet tell he secret even to the master of he craft have gardiner known exactly where he be about to go the desire to secure a hand as valuable as watson might have draw from he some imprudent revelation but know nothing himself he be oblige to make the best answer he could go he say why we be go after seal to be sure and shall look for they where they be most to be find as experience a hand as yourself ought to know where that be ay ay sir answer the fellow laughing -- it be just neither here nor there -- that be all captain gar ` ner interrupt the deacon solemnly this be trifling and we must come to term with this man or write to mr hazard to engage another in he place come ashore sir i have business with you up at the house the serious manner in which this be utter take both the captain and the man a little by surprise as for the first he go below to conceal he good-looking throat beneath a black handkerchief before he follow the deacon where it be most probable he should meet with mary while he be thus occupy watson come down out of the main-rigging and descend into the forecastle as the young captain be walk fast towards the dwelling of deacon pratt watson come on deck again and hail bait joe who be fishing at no great distance from the wharf in a few minute watson be in joe 's boat bag and all -- he have not bring a chest on board -- and be under way for the harbor from the harbor he sail the same evening in a whale-boat that be keep in readiness for he carry the news over to holme 's hole that the sea lion of oyster pond would certainly be ready to go out as early as the succeed week although watson thus seemingly desert he post it be with a perfect understanding with he real employer he have need of a few day to make he own preparation before he leave the 41st degree of north latitude to go as far south as a vessel could proceed he do not however leave he post entirely vacant one of deacon pratt 's neighbor have undertake for a consideration to let the progress of event be know and tiding be send by every opportunity report the movement of the schooner and the prospects of she get to sea these last be not quite as flattering as roswell gardiner hope and believe the agent of the vineyard company have succeed in get away two of hazard 's best man and as reliable sealer be not to be pick up as easily as pebble on a beach the delay cause by this new stroke of management might even be serious all this time the sea lion of holme ' hole be get ahead with untiring industry and there be every prospect of she be ready to go out as soon as she competitor but to return to oyster pond deacon pratt be in he porch ere roswell gardiner overtake he there the deacon give he young friend to understand he have private business of moment and lead the way at once into he own apartment which serve the purpose of office bed-room and closet the good man be accustom to put up he petition to the throne of mercy there as well as transact all he temporal affair shut the door and turn the key not a little to roswell 's surprise the old man face he companion with a most earnest and solemn look tell he at once that he be now about to open he mind to he in a matter of the last concern the young sailor scarce know what to think of it all but he hope that mary be in some way connect with the result in the first place captain gar ` ner continue the deacon i must ask you to take a oath a oath deacon -- this be quite new for the seal business -- as ceremonious as uncle sam 's people yes sir a oath and a oath that must be most religiously keep and on this bible without the oath we whole connection must fall through captain gar ` ner rather than that should happen deacon i will cheerfully take two oath one to clench the other it be well i ask you roswell gar ` ner to swear on this holy book that the secret i shall now reveal to you shall not be tell to any other except in a manner prescribe by myself that in no other man 's employment will you profit by they and that you will in all thing connect with they be true and faithful to you engagement to I and to my interest -- so help you god roswell gardiner kiss the book while he wonder much and be die with curiosity to know what be to follow this great point secure the deacon lay aside the sacred volume open a drawer and produce the two all-important chart to which he have transfer the note of daggett captain gar ` ner resume the deacon spread the chart of the antarctic sea on the bed you must have know I and my way long enough to feel some surprise at find I at my time of life first enter into the shipping concern if i have feel any surprise deacon it be that a man of you taste and judgment should have hold aloof so long from the only employment that i think fit for a man of real energy and character ay this be well enough for you to say as a seaman yourself though you will find it hard to persuade most of those who live on shore into you own way of think that be because people ashore think and act as they have be bring up to do now just look at that chart deacon see how much of it be water and how little of it be land minister whittle tell we only the last sabbath that nothing be create without a design and that a wise dispensation of divine providence be to be see in all the work of nature now if the land be intend to take the lead of the water would there have be so much more of the last than of the first deacon that be the idea that come into my mind when i hear the minister 's word and have not mary -- what of mary demand the deacon perceive that the young man pause only i be in hope that what you have to say deacon might have some connection with she what i have to say be better worth hearing than fifty mary as to my niece gar ` ner you be welcome to she if she will have you and why she do not be to I unaccountable but you see that chart -- look at it well and tell I if you find anything new or remarkable about it it look like old time deacon and here be many place that i have visit and know what have we here island lay down in pencil with the latitude and longitude in figure who say there be land thereaway deacon pratt if i may be so free as to ask the question i do -- and capital good land it be for a seal craft to get alongside of they island gar ` ner may make you fortune as well as mine no matter how i know they be there -- it be enough that i _ do _ know it and that i wish you to carry the sea lion to that very spot as straight as you can go fill she up with elephant 's oil ivory and skin and bring she back again as fast as she can travel island in that latitude and longitude say roswell gardiner examine the chart as closely as if it be of very fine print indeed -- i never hear of any such land before ` tis there notwithstanding and like all land in distant sea that man have not often troubled plentifully garnish with what will pay the mariner well for he visit of that i have little doubt should there be actually any land there it may be a cape fly away that some fellow have see in thick weather the ocean be full of such island this be none of they it be bony fidy ` arth as i know from the man who tread it you must take good care gar ` ner and not run the schooner on it -- with a small chuckle laugh such as a man little accustomed to this species of indulgence use when in high good-humour i be not rich enough to buy and fit out sea lion for you to cast 'em away that be a high latitude deacon to carry a craft into cook himself fall short of _ that _ somewhat never mind cook -- he be a king 's navigator -- my man be a american sealer and what he have once see he know where to find again there be the island -- three in number and there you will find 'em with animal on they shore as plenty as clam-shell on the south beach i hope it may be so if land be there and you 'll risk the schooner i 'll try to get a look at it i shall want you to put it down in black and white however that i be to go as high as this you shall have any authority a man may ask on that point there can be no difficulty between I and you the risk of the schooner must be mine of course but i rely on you to take as good care of she as a man can go then direct to that point and fill up the schooner but gar ` ner my business do not end with this as soon as the schooner be full you will come to the southward and get she clear of everything like ice as fast as possible that i should be very likely to do deacon though you have say nothing on the subject yes by all account they be stormy sea and the sooner a body be shut of they the better and now gar ` ner i must swear you again i have another secret to tell you and a oath must go with each kiss this sacred volume once more and swear to I never to reveal to another that which i be about to reveal to you unless it may be in a court of law and at the command of justice so help you god what a second oath deacon -- you be as bad as the custom-house which take you on all tack and do not believe you when you have do surely i be swear in already kiss the book and swear to what i have put to you say the deacon sternly or never go to sea in a craft of mine never to reveal what i shall now tell you unless compel by justice so help you god thus corner roswell gardiner hesitate no longer but swear as require kiss the book gravely and reverently this be the young man 's first command and he be not go to lose it on account of so small a matter as swearing to keep he owner 's secret have obtain the pledge the deacon now produce the second chart which be make to take the place of the other on the bed there he exclaim in a sort of triumph -- that be the real object of you voyage that key why deacon that be in north latitude -- ° -- and you make a crooked road of it truly when you tell I to go as far south as -- ° -- in order to reach it it be well to have two string to a body 's bow when you hear what you be to bring from that key you will understand why i send you south before you be to come here to top off you cargo it must be with turtle then say roswell gardiner laugh nothing grow on these key but a few stunt shrub and nothing be ever to be find on they but turtle once in a while a fellow may pick up a few turtle if he happen to hit the right key gar ` ner rejoin the deacon still more solemnly -- that island low and insignificant as it be contain treasure pirate make they deposit here a long time ago and the knowledge of that fact be now confine to myself the young man stare at the deacon as if he have some doubt whether the old man be in he right mind he know the beset weakness of he character well and have no difficulty in appreciate the influence of such a belief as that he have just express on he feeling but it seem so utterly improbable that he live on oyster pond should learn a fact of this nature which be conceal from other that at first he fancy he owner have be dream of money until its image have make he mad then he recollect the deceased mariner the deacon 's many conference with he the interest he have always appear to take in the man and the suddenness as well as the time of the purchase of the schooner and he at once obtain a clue to the whole affair daggett have tell you this deacon pratt -- say gardiner in he off-hand way and he be the man who have tell you of those sealing-island too admit it to be so why not daggett as well as any other man certainly if he know what he be say to be true -- but the yarn of a sailor be not often to be take for gospel daggett be near he end and can not be class with those who talk idly in the pride of they health and strength -- man who be ever ready to say -- ` tush god have forget ' why be this tell to you when the man have natural friend and relative by the dozen over on the vineyard he have be away from the vineyard and they relative fifty year a length of time that weaken a body 's feeling considerably take you away from mary only a fourth part of that time and you would forget whether she eye be blue or black and altogether how she look if i should a most miserable and contemptible dog should i account myself no deacon twice fifty year would not make I forget the eye or the look of mary ay so all youngster think and feel and talk but let 'em try the world and they 'll soon find out they own foolishness but daggett make I he confidant because providence put I in he way and because he trust to be well enough to go in the schooner and to turn the expedition to some account in he own behalf have the man the impudence to confess that he have be a pirate and help to bury treasure on this key that be not by any mean he history daggett be never a pirate himself but accident place he in the same prison and same room as that in which a real pirate be confine there the man become friend and the condemn prisoner for such he be in the end give this secret to daggett as the last service he could do he i hope deacon you do not expect much in the way of profit from this part of the voyage i expect the most from it gar ` ner as you will too when you come to hear the whole story the deacon then go into all the particulars of the revelation make by the pirate to he fellow-prisoner much as they have be give by daggett to himself the young man listen to this account at first with incredulity then with interest and finally with a feeling that induce he to believe that there might be more truth in the narrative than he have originally suppose possible this change be produce by the earnest manner of the deacon as much as by the narrative itself for he have become graphic under the strong impulse of that which with he be a master passion so deep have be the impression make on the mind of the old man by daggett 's account and so intense the expectation thereby awaken that he omit nothing observe the most minute accuracy in all he detail and convey just as distinct impression to he listener as have be convey to himself when the story be first tell to he this be a most extr ` or ` nary account take it on whatever tack you will exclaim roswell gardiner as soon as a pause in the deacon 's story enable he to put in another word the most extr ` or ` nary tale i ever listen to how come so much gold and silver to be abandon for so long a time they three officer hide it there fear to trust they own crew with it in they vessel they pretence be to stop for turtle just as you must do : whilst the hand be turtle the captain and he mate walk about the key and take occasion to make they deposit in that hole on the coral rock as you have hear I say oh it be all too natural not to be true roswell gardiner see that the old man 's hope be too keenly excite to be easily cool and that he latent covetousness be thoroughly awaken of all the passion to which poor human nature be the slave the love of gold be that which endure the longest and be often literally carry with we to the verge of the grave indeed in mind so constitute originally as to submit to a undue love of money the passion appear to increase as other more dependent on youth and strength and enterprise and ambition gradually become of diminish force slowly but surely usurp the entire sway over a be that be once subject to many master thus have it be with the deacon nearly all he passion now centre in this one he no longer care for preferment in politics though once it have be the source of a strong desire to represent suffolk at albany even the meeting and its honor be loosen its hold on he mind while he fellow-men he kindred include be regard by he as little more than so many competitor or tool a lie may be make to seem very natural answer roswell gardiner if it have be put together by one who understand knotting and splicing in such matter do this daggett name the amount of the sum that he suppose the pirate may have leave on that key he do return the deacon the whole of he narrow and craving soul seem to gleam in he two sunken eye as he answer accord to the account of the pirate there could not have be much less than thirty thousand dollar and nearly all of it in good doubloon of the coin of the king -- doubloon that will weigh they full sixteen to the pound -- ay and to spare the sea lion 's cargo well choose and well stow would double that deacon if the right animal can only be find may be so -- but just think gardner -- this will be in good bright coin gold but what right can we have to that gold even admit that it be there and can be find right exclaim the deacon stare do not that which divine providence give man become he own by the same rule it might be say divine providence give it to the pirate there must be lawful owner to all this money if one could only find they ay if one could only find they harkee gar ` ner have you spend a shilling or a quarter lately a good many of both deacon answer the young man again betray the lightness of he heart with a laugh i wish i have more of you saving temper and i might get rich yes i spend a quarter only two hour since in buy fish for the cabin of old baiting joe well tell I the impression of that quarter have it a head or only pillar what be its date and in whose reign be it strike maybe it be from the mint at philadelphium -- if so have it the old eagle or the new in a word could you swear to that quarter gar ` ner or to any quarter you ever spend in you life perhaps not deacon a fellow do not sit down to take likeness when he get a little silver or gold nor be it very probable that any one could say -- ` that be my doubloon ' still there must be a lawful owner to each piece of that money if any such money be there return roswell gardiner a little positively have you ever talk with mary deacon on this subject i talk of such a matter with a woman do you think i be mad gar ` ner if i want to have the secret run through old suffolk as fire run over the salt meadow in the spring i might think of such a thing : but not without i have talk with no one but the master of the craft that i be about to send out in search of this gold as well as in search of the sealing-island i have show you have there be but _ one _ object in view i might not have venture so much but with _ two _ before my eye it would seem like fly in the face of divine providence to neglect so great a opportunity roswell gardiner see that argument would avail nothing against a cupidity so keenly arouse he abstain therefore from urge any more of the objection that suggest themselves to he mind but hear all that the deacon have to tell he take full note of what he hear it would seem that daggett have be sufficiently clear in he direction for find the hidden treasure provide always that he confidant the pirate have be as clear with he and have not be indulge in a mystification the probability of the last have early suggest itself to one of deacon pratt 's cautious temperament but daggett have succeed in remove the impression by he forcible statement of he friend 's sincerity there be as little doubt of the sincerity of the belief of the martha 's vineyard mariner as there be of that of the deacon himself the day that succeed this conference the sea lion haul off from the wharf and all communication with she be now make only by means of boat the sudden disappearance of watson may have contribute to this change man be more under control with a craft at she mooring than when fast to a wharf three day later the schooner lift she anchor and with a light air make sail she pass through the narrow but deep channel which separate shelter island from oyster pond quit the water of peconic altogether there be not a air of departure about she notwithstanding the deacon be not much concerned and some of roswell gardiner 's clothes be still at he washerwoman 's circumstance that be fully explain when the schooner be see to anchor in gardiner 's bay which be a outer roadstead to all the port and haven of that region chapter vii walk in the light so shalt thou know that fellowship of love he spirit only can bestow who reign in light above walk in the light and sin abhorr would shall ne'er defile again the blood of jesus christ the lord shall cleanse from every stain bernard barton about a hour after the sea lion of oyster pond have let go she anchor in gardiner 's bay a coast sloop approach she come from the westward there be two passage by which vessel enter or quit long island sound at its eastern termination the main channel be between plum and fisher 's island and from the rapidity of its current be know by the name of the race the other passage be much less frequent be out of the direct line of sailing for craft that keep mid-sound it lie to the southward of the race between plum island and oyster pond point and be call by the anglo-saxon appellation of plum gut the coaster just mention have come through this latter passage and it be the impression of those who see she from the schooner that she be bind up into peconic or the water of sag harbor instead of luff up into either of the channel that would have carry she into these place however she keep off cross gardiner 's bay until she get within hail of the schooner the wind be quite light there be time for the follow short dialogue to take place between the skipper of this coaster and roswell gardiner before the sloop have pass beyond the reach of the voice be that the sea lion of oyster pond demand the skipper boldly ay ay answer roswell gardiner in the sententious manner of a seaman be there one watson of martha 's vineyard ship in that craft he be aboard here for a week but leave we suddenly as he do not sign article i can not say that he run he change he mind then return the other as one express a slight degree of surprise at hear that which be new to he watson be apt to whiffle about though a prime fellow if you can once fasten to he and get he into blue water do you schooner go out to-morrow captain gar ` ner not till next day i think say roswell gardiner with the frankness of he nature utterly free from the slightest suspicion that he be communicate with one in the interest of rival my mate have not yet join I and i be short of my complement by two good hand have that fellow watson stick by I i would have give he a look at water that no lead ever sound ay ay he be a whiffler but a good man on a sea-elephant then you think you 'll sail day a ` ter to-morrow if my mate come over from the main they write I yesterday that they have get the hand and be then on the look-out for something to get across in i have come out here to be ready for they and to pick 'em up that they need not go all the way up to the harbor that be a good traverse and will save a long pull perhaps they be in _ that _ boat at this allusion to a boat roswell gardiner spring into he main rigging and see sure enough that a boat be pull directly towards the schooner come from the main and distant only a short half mile a glass be hand to he and he be soon hear announce cheerfully to he man that mr hazard and the second officer be in the boat with two seaman and that he suppose they should _ now _ have they complement all this be overhear by the skipper of the sloop who catch each syllable with the most eager attention you 'll soon be travel south i be think captain gar ` ner call out this worthy again in a sort of felicitating way -- they 's you chap and they 'll set you up i hope so with all my heart for there be nothing more tiresome than wait when one be all ready to trip my owner be get to be impatient too and want to see some skin in return for he dollar ay ay they 's you chap and you 'll be off the day a ` ter to-morrow at the latest well a good time to you captain gar ` ner and a plenty of skin it be a long road to travel especially when a craft have to go as far south as you 's be bind how do you know friend whither i be bind you have not ask I for my seal ground nor be it usual in we business to be hawk it up and down the country all that be true enough but i have a notion notwithstanding now as you 'll be off so soon and as i shall not see you again for some time at least i will give you a piece of advice if you fall _ in _ with a consort do not fall _ out _ with she and make a distant v ` y' ge a cruise for a enemy but come to tarm and work in company : lay for lay and make fair weather of what can not be help the man on board the sloop laugh at this speech while those on board the schooner wonder to roswell gardiner and he people the allusion be a enigma and the former muttered something about the stranger 's be a dunce as he descend from the rigging and give some order to prepare to receive the boat the chap belong to the hole rejoin the master of the schooner and all they vineyard fellow fancy themselves better blue-jacket than the rest of mankind : i suppose it must be because they island lie further out to sea than anything we have here inside of montauk thus end the communication with the stranger the sloop glide away before a light south wind and favor by a ebb tide soon round the spit of sand that shelter the anchorage and haul up to the eastward she go on she way towards holme ' hole the skipper be a relative of half of those who be interested in fitting out the rival sea lion and have volunteer to obtain the very information he take with he know how acceptable it would be to those at home sooth to say a deep but wary excitement prevail on the vineyard touch not only the sealing-island but also in respect to the bury treasure the information actually possess by the relation of the deceased mariner be neither very full nor very clear it consist principally of saying of daggett utter during he homeward-bound passage and transmit by the master of the brig to he of the sloop in the course of conference that wear away a long summer 's afternoon as the two vessel lay becalm within a hundred fathom of each other these saying however have be frequent and intelligible all man like to deal in that which make they of importance and the possession of he secret have just the effect on daggett 's mind that be necessary to render he boastful under such impulse he tongue have not be very guard and fact leak out which when transmit to he native island through the medium of half a dozen tongue and as many fancy amount to statement sufficient to fire the imagination of a people much duller than those of martha 's vineyard accustom to converse and think of such expedition it be not surprising that a few of the most enterprising of those who first hear the report should unite and plan the adventure they now actually have in hand when the intelligence of what be go on on oyster pond reach they everything like hesitation or doubt disappear and from the moment of the nephew 's return in quest of he uncle 's asset the equipment of the hums ' hull craft have be press in a way that would have do credit to that of a government cruiser even henry eckford so well know for have undertake to cut the tree and put upon the water of ontario two double-bank frigate if frigate they could be term each of which be to mount its hundred gun in the short space of sixty day scarce manifest greater energy in carry out he contract than do these rustic islander in prepare they craft to compete with that which they be now certain be about to sail from the place where they kinsman have breathe he last these keen and spirited islander however do not work quite as much in the dark as we account unexplained might give the reader reason to suppose it will be remember that there be a till to the chest which have not be examine by the deacon this till contain a old mutilate journal not of the last but of one or two of the earlier voyage of the deceased though it have detach entry that evidently refer to different and distant period of time by dint of study and by put together sundry entry that at first sight might not be suppose to have any connection with each other the present possessor of that chest have obtain what he deem to be very sufficient clue to he uncle 's two great secret there be also in the chest several loose piece of paper on which there be rude attempt to make chart of all the island and key in question give they relative position as it respect they immediate neighbor but in no instance give the latitudes and longitude in addition to these significant proof that the report bring through the two master be not without a foundation there be a unfinished letter write by the deceased and address as a sort of legacy to any or all of martha 's vineyard of the name of daggett this address be sufficiently wide include probably some hundred of person : a clan in fact but it be also sufficiently significant the individual into whose hand it first fall being of the name read it first as a matter of course when he carefully fold it up and place it in a pocket-book which he be much in the habit of carry in he own pocket on what principle this letter unfinished and without a signature with nothing indeed but its general and comprehensive address to point out its origin as well as its destination be thus appropriate to the purpose of a single individual we shall not stop to inquire such be the fact however and none connect with the equipment of the sea lion of holme ' hole know anything of the existence of that document its present possessor except he look it over occasionally and deem the information it convey of no trifling import under all the circumstance of the case both the enterprise of which we have give a opening account be perfectly characteristic of the state of society in which they be bring into existence deacon pratt if he have any regular calling be properly a husbandman though the love of money have induce he to invest he cash in nearly every concern around he which promise remunerate return the principal owner of the sea lion of holme ' hole be husbandman also folk who literally till the earth cradle they own oats and rye and mow they own meadow notwithstanding neither of these man those of the vineyard any more than he of oyster pond have hesitate about investing of he means in a maritime expedition just as if they be all regular ship-owner of the largest port in the union with such man it be only necessary to exhibit a account with a fair prospect of large profit and they be ever ready to enter into the adventure heart hand and pocket last season it may have be to look for whale on the coast of japan the season before that to search for island frequent by the seal this season possibly to carry a party out to hunt for camelopard set net for young lion and beat up the quarter of the rhinoceros on the plain of africa : while the next they may be transport ice from long pond to calcutta and kingston -- not to say to london itself of such material be those descendant of the puritan compose a mixture of good and evil of the religion which cling to the past in recollection rather than in feeling mingle with a worldly-mindedness that amount nearly to rapacity all cloak and render decent by a conventional respect for duty and respectable and useful by frugality enterprise and untiring activity roswell gardiner have not mistake the person of those in the boat they prove to be phil hazard he first officer tim green the second mate and the two sealer whom it have cost so much time and ingenuity to obtain although neither of the mate even suspect the truth no sooner have they engage the right sort of man than he be tamper with by the agent of the martha 's vineyard concern and spirited away by means of more tempting proposal before he have get quite so far as to sign the article one of the motive for send watson across to oyster pond have be to induce captain gardiner to believe he have engage so skilful a hand which would effectually prevent he attempt to procure another until at the last moment he might find himself unable to put to sea for the want of a complement a whaling or a seal voyage require that the vessel should take out with she the particular hand necessary to she specific object though of late year the seaman have get so much in the habit of ` run ' especially in the pacific that it be only the craft that strictly belong to what may be term the whaling community that bring back with they the people they carry out and not always they but here have roswell gardiner he complement full and nearly everything ready to sea he have only to go up to the harbor and obtain he clearance have a short interview with he owner a longer with mary and be off for the antarctic circle if indeed the ice would allow he to get as far south there be now sixteen soul on board the sea lion a very sufficient number for the voyage on which she be about to sail the disposition or rating of the crew be as follow viz 1 roswell gardiner master 2 philip hazard chief mate 3 timothy green second do 4 david week carpenter 5 nathan thompson seaman 6 sylvester haven do 7 marcus todd do 8 hiram flint do 9 joshua short seaman 10 stephen stimson do 11 bartlett davidson do 12 peter mount landsman 13 arcularius mott do 14 robert smith do 15 cato livingston cook 16 primus floyd boy this be consider a good crew on the whole every man be a native american and most of they belong to old suffolk thompson and flint and short and stimson four capital fellow in they way come from the main the last it be say from as far east as kennebunk no matter they be all reasonably young hale active fellow with a promise of excellent service about every man of they livingston and floyd be color person who bear the name of the two respectable family in which they or they progenitor have formerly be slave week be accustom to the sea and might have be rate indifferently as a carpenter or as a mariner mount and mott though ship as landsman be a good deal accustom to the water also have pass each two season in coaster though neither have ever yet be really _ outside _ or see blue water it would not have be easy to give to the sea lion a more efficient crew yet there be scarce a real seaman belong to she -- a man who could have be make a captain of the forecastle on board a frigate or a ship of the line even gardiner the best man in he little craft in nearly every respect be deficient in many attainment that mark the thorough sea-dog he would have be remarkable anywhere for personal activity for courage readiness hardihood and all those quality which render a man useful in the business to which he properly belong but he could hardly be term a skilful leadsman know little of the finesse of he call and be want in that in-and-in breeding which convert habit into a instinct and cause the thorough seaman to do the right thing blow high or blow low in the right way and at the right moment in all these respects however he be much the best man on board and he be so superior to the rest as fully to command all they respect stimson be probably the next best seaman after the master the day succeed that on which the sea lion receive the remainder of she people roswell gardiner go up to the harbor where he meet deacon pratt by appointment the object be to clear the schooner out which could be do only at that place mary accompany she uncle to transact some of she own little domestic business and it be then arrange between the party that the deacon should make he last visit to he vessel in the return-boat of she master while roswell gardiner should take mary back to oyster pond in the whale-boat that have bring she and she uncle over as baiting joe as usual have act as ferryman it be necessary to get rid of he the young sailor desire to be alone with mary this be easily enough effect by a present of a quarter of a dollar the boat have two lugg sail and the wind be light and steady at south-west there be nothing to conflict with roswell gardiner 's wish the young sailor leave the wharf at sag harbor about ten minute after the deacon have precede he on he way to the schooner as the wind be so light and so fair he soon have he sheet in and the boat glide along at a easy rate which permit he to bestow nearly all he attention on he charming companion roswell gardiner have seek this occasion that he might once more open he heart to mary and urge he suit for the last time previously to so long a absence this he do in a manly frank way that be far from be unpleasant to he gentle listener whose inclination for a few minute blind she to the resolution already make on principle so urgent be she suitor indeed that she should solemnly plight she faith to he ere he sail that a soft illusion come over the mind of one as affectionate as mary and she be half-inclined to believe she previous determination be unjustifiable and obdurate but the head of one of she high principle and clear view of duty could not long be deceive by she heart and she regain the self-command which have hitherto sustained she in all she former trial in connection with this subject perhaps it would have be better roswell she say have i take leave of you at the harbor and not incur the risk of the pain that i foresee i shall both give and bear in we present discourse i have conceal nothing from you possibly i have be more sincere than prudence would sanction you know the only obstacle there be to we union but that appear to increase in strength the more i ask you to reflect on it -- to try to remove it what would you have I do mary surely not to play the hypocrite and profess to believe that which i certainly do not and which after all my inquiry i _ can not _ believe i be sorry it be so on every account return mary in a low and saddened tone sorry that one of so frank ingenuous a mind should find it impossible to accept the creed of he father and sorry that it must leave so impassable a chasm between we for ever no mary that can never be nothing but death can separate we for so long a time while we meet we shall at least be friend and friend love to meet and to see each other often it may seem unkind at a moment like this roswell but it be in truth the very reverse if i say we ought not to meet each other here if we be bent on follow we own separate way towards a future world my god be not you god and what can there be of peace in a family when its two head worship different deity i be afraid that you do not think sufficiently of the nature of these thing i do not believe you to be so illiberal mary have the deacon say as much i might not have be surprised but for one like you to tell I that my god be not you god be narrow indeed be it not so roswell and if so why should we attempt to gloss over the truth by deceptive word i be a believer in the redeemer as the son of god as one of the holy trinity while you believe in he only as a man -- a righteous and just a sinless man if you will but as a man only now be not the difference in these creed immense be it not in truth just the difference between god and man i worship my redeemer regard he as the equal of the father -- as a part of that divine be while you look on he as merely a man without sin -- as a man such as adam probably be before the fall do we know enough of these matter mary to justify we in allow they to interfere with we happiness we be tell that they be all-essential to we happiness -- not in the sense you may mean roswell but in one of far higher import -- and we can not neglect they without pay the penalty i think you carry these notion too far dearest mary and that it be possible for man and wife most heartily to love each other and to be happy in each other without they think exactly alike on religion how many good and pious woman do you see who be contented and prosperous as wife and mother and who be member of meeting but whose husband make no profession of any sort that may be true or not i lay no claim to a right to judge of any other 's duty or manner of view what they ought to do thousand of girl marry without _ feeling _ the very obligation that they profess to reverence and when in after life deeper conviction come they can not cast aside the connection they have previously form if they would and probably would not if they could that be a different thing from a young woman who have a deep sense of what she owe to she redeemer become deliberately and with a full sense of what she be do the wife of one who regard she god as merely a man -- i care not how you qualify this opinion by say a pure and sinless man it will be man still the difference between god and man be too immense to be fritter away by any such qualification as that but if i find it _ impossible _ to believe all you believe mary surely you would not punish I for have the sincerity to tell you the truth and the whole truth no indeed roswell answer the honest girl gently not to say tenderly nothing have give I a better opinion of you principle roswell -- a higher notion of what you upright and frank character really be than the manly way in which you have admit the justice of my suspicion of you want of faith -- of faith as i consider faith can alone exist this fair dealing have make I honor you and esteem you in addition to the more girlish attachment that i do not wish to conceal from you at least i have so long feel bless mary exclaimed roswell gardiner almost ready to fall down on he knee and worship the pretty enthusiast who sit at he side with a countenance in which intense interest in he welfare be beam from two of the softest and sweetest blue eye that maiden ever bent on a youth in modest tenderness whatever disposition he might be in to accept she god as he god how can one so kind in all other respects prove so cruel in this one particular because that one particular as you term it roswell be all in all to she answer the girl with a face that be now flush with feeling i must answer you as joshua tell the israelite of old -- ` choose you this day whom you will serve whether the god which you father serve that be on the other side of the flood or the god of the amorite in whose land ye dwell : _ but as for I and my house we will serve the lord _ ' do you class I with the idolater and pagan of palestine demand gardiner reproachfully you have say it roswell it be not i but yourself who have thus class you you worship you reason instead of the one true and live god this be idolatry of the worst character since the idol be never see by the devotee and he do not know of its existence you consider it then idolatry for one to use those gift which he have receive from he maker and to treat the most important of all subject as a rational be instead of receive a creed blindly and without think if what you call think could better the matter if it be sufficient to comprehend and master this subject there might be force in what you say but what be this boast reason after all it be not sufficient to explain a single mystery of the creation though there be thousand i know there be nay there _ must _ be a variety of opinion among those who look to they reason instead of accept the doctrine of revelation for the character of christ but i believe all who be not open infidel admit that the atonement of he death be sufficient for the salvation of man : now can you explain this part of the theory of we religion any more than you can explain the divine nature of the redeemer can you _ reason _ any more wisely touch the fall than touch the redemption itself i know i be unfit to treat of matter of this profound nature continue mary modestly though with great earnestness and beauty of manner but to I it seem very plain that the instant circumstance lead we beyond the limit of we means of comprehension we be to _ believe _ in and not to reason on revelation the whole history of christianity teach this its first minister be uneducated man man who be totally ignorant until enlighten by they faith and all the lesson it teach be to raise faith and faith in the redeemer high above all other attainment as the one great acquisition that include and color every other when such be the fact the heart do not make a stumbling-block of every thing that the head can not understand i do not know how it be answer roswell gardiner influence though unconvinced but when i talk with you on this subject mary i can not do justice to my opinion or to the manner in which i reason on they with my male friend and acquaintance i confess it do appear to I illogical unreasonable -- i scarce know how to designate what i mean -- but improbable that god should suffer himself or he son to be crucify by being that he himself create or that he should feel a necessity for any such course in order to redeem being he have himself bring into existence if there be any argument in the last roswell it be a argument as much against the crucifixion of a man as against the crucifixion of one of the trinity itself i understand you to believe that such a be as jesus of nazareth do exist that he be crucify for we redemption and that the atonement be accept and acceptable before god the father now be it not just as difficult to understand how or why this should be as to understand the common creed of christian surely there be a vast difference between the crucifixion of a subordinate be and the crucifixion of one who make a part of the godhead itself mary i can imagine the first though i may not pretend to understand its reason or why it be necessary it should be so but i be certain you will not mistake my motive when i say i can not imagine the other make no apology to I roswell look rather to that dread be whose teaching through choose minister you disregard as for what you say i can fully feel its truth i do not pretend to _ understand _ why such a sacrifice should be necessary but i _ believe _ it _ feel _ it and believe and feel it i can not but adore and worship the son who quit heaven to come on earth and suffer that we might possess eternal life it be all mystery to I as be the creation itself we existence god himself and all else that my mind be too limited to comprehend but roswell if i believe a part of the teaching of the christian church i must believe all the apostle who be call by christ in person who live in he very presence who know nothing except as the holy spirit prompt worship he as the son of god as one ` who think it not robbery to be equal with god ' and shall i ignorant and uninspired pretend to set up my feeble means of reasoning in opposition to they write instruction yet must each of we stand or fall by the means he possess and the use he make of they that be quite true roswell and ask yourself the use to which you put you own faculty i do not deny that we be to exercise we reason but it be within the bound set for its exercise we may examine the evidence of christianity and determine for ourselves how far it be support by reasonable and sufficient proof beyond this we can not be expect to go else might we be require to comprehend the mystery of we own existence which just as much exceed we understanding as any other we be tell that man be create in the image of he creator which mean that there be a immortal and spiritual part of he that be entirely different from the material creature one perish temporarily at least -- a limb can be sever from the body and perish even while the body survive but it be not so with that which have be create in the image of the deity that be imperishable immortal spiritual though doom to dwell awhile in a tenement of clay now why be it more difficult to believe that pure divinity may have enter into the person of one man than to _ believe _ nay to _ feel _ that the image of god have enter into the person of so many myriad of man you not only overlook all this roswell but you commit the to I inexplicable mistake of believe a part of a mystery while you hesitate about believe all be you to deny the merit of the atonement altogether you position would be much stronger than it be in believe what you do but roswell we will not embitter the moment of separation by talk more on this subject now i have other thing to say to you and but little time to say they in the promise you have ask of I to remain single until you return i most freely make it cost I nothing to give you _ this _ pledge since there be scarce a possibility of my ever marry another mary repeat these word or rather this idea in other word to roswell gardiner 's great delight and again and again he declare that he could now penetrate the icy sea with a light heart confident he should find she on he return disengage and as he hope as much disposed to regard he with interest as she then be nevertheless gardiner do not deceive himself as to mary 's intention he know she and she principle too well to fancy that she resolution would be very likely to falter notwithstanding they long and intimate knowledge of each other at no time have she ever betray a weakness that promise to undermine she high sense of duty and as time increase she means of judge of what those duty be she submission to they seem to be stronger and stronger have there be anything stern or repulsive in mary 's manner of manifest the feeling that be uppermost in she mind one of roswell gardiner 's temperament would have be very apt to shake off she influence but so far from this be the case she ever meet he and part from he with a gentle and ingenuous interest in he welfare and occasionally with much womanly tenderness he know that she pray for he daily as fervently as she pray for herself and even this he hope would serve to keep alive she interest in he during he absence in this respect we young sailor show no bad comprehension of human nature nothing be more likely to maintain a influence of this sort than the conviction that on ourselves depend the happiness or interest of the person beloved chapter viii and i have love thee ocean and my joy of youthful sport be on thy breast to be bear like thy bubble onward from a boy i wanton would with thy breaker -- they to I be a delight and if the freshen sea make they a terror -- 'twa a please fear for i be as it be a child of thee and trust to thy billow far and near and lay my hand upon thy mane -- as i do here byron it be past the turn of the day when roswell gardiner reach he vessel after have carefully and with manly interest in all that belong to she see mary to she home and take he final leave of she of that parting we shall say but little it be touch and warm-hearted and it be render a little solemn by mary pratt 's put into she lover 's hand a pocket-bible with a earnest request that he would not forget to consult its page she add at the same time that she have carefully mark those passage which she wish he most to study and reflect on the book be accept in the spirit in which it be offer and carefully place in a little case that contain about a hundred volume of different work as the hour approach for lift the anchor the nervousness of the deacon become very apparent to the commander of he schooner at each instant the former be at the latter 's elbow make some querulous suggestion or ask a question that betray the agitate and unsettled state of he mind it really seem as if the old man at the last moment have not the heart to part with he property or to trust it out of he sight all this annoyed roswell gardiner dispose as he be at that instant to regard every person and thing that in any manner pertain to mary pratt with indulgence and favor you will be particular about they island captain gar ` ner and not get the schooner ashore say the deacon for the tenth time at least they tell I the tide run like a horse in the high latitudes and that seaman be often strand by they before they know where they be ay ay sir i 'll try and bear it in mind answer gardiner vex at be importune so often to recollect that which there be so little likelihood of he forget i be a old cruiser in those sea deacon and know all about the tide well mr hazard what be the news of the anchor we be short sir and only wait for order to go on and get clear of the ground trip at once sir and so farewell to america -- or to this end of it at least then the key they tell I be dangerous navigation gar ` ner and a body need have all he eye about he all place have they danger to you sleepy navigator deacon but the man who keep he eye open have little to fear have you give we a chronometer there would not have be one-half the risk there will be without one this have be a bone of contention between the master of the sea lion and he owner chronometer be not by any means in as general use at the period of we tale as they be to-day and the deacon abhor the expense to which such a article would have put he could he have get one at a fourth of the customary price he might have be tempt but it form no part of he principle of save to anticipate and prevent waste by liberality no sooner be the schooner release from the ground than she sail be fill and she go by the low spit of sand already mention with the light south-west breeze still blow in she favor and a ebb tide everything appear propitious and no vessel probably ever leave home under better omen the deacon remain on board until bait joe who be to act as he boatman remind he of the distance and the probability that the breeze would go down entirely with the sun as it be they have to contend with wind and tide and it would require all he own knowledge of the eddy to get the whale-boat up to oyster pond in anything like reasonable time thus admonish the owner tear himself away from he beloved craft give young gar ` ner as many ` last word ' as if he be about to be execute roswell have a last word on he part however in the shape of a message to mary tell mary deacon say the young sailor in a aside that i rely on she promise and that i shall think of she whether it be under the burning sun of the line or among the ice of the antarctic yes yes that be as it should be answer the deacon heartily i like you perseverance gar ` ner and hope the gal will come round yet and i shall have you for a nephew there be nothing that take the woman 's mind like money fill up the schooner with skin and ile and bring back that treasure and you make as sure of mary for a wife as if the parson have say the benediction over you such be deacon pratt 's notion of he niece as well as of the female sex for month he regard this speech as a _ coup de maitre _ while roswell gardiner forget it in half a hour so much better than the uncle do the lover comprehend the character of the niece the sea lion of oyster pond have now cast off the last ligament which connect she with the land she have no pilot none be necessary or usual in those water all that a vessel have to do be to give long island a sufficient berth in round its eastern extremity the boat be soon shut in by gardiner 's island and thenceforth nothing remain but the tie of feel to connect those bold adventurer with they native country it be true that connecticut and subsequently rhode island be yet visible on one hand and a small portion of new york on the other but as darkness come to close the scene even that means of communication be soon virtually cut off the light on montauk for hour be the sole beacon for these bold mariner who round it about midnight fairly meet the long rolling swell of the broad atlantic then the craft might be say to be at sea for the first time the sea lion be find to perform well she have be construct with a eye to comfort as well as to sailing and possess that just proportion in she hull which carry she over the surface of the wave like a duck this quality be of more importance to a small than to a large vessel for the want of momentum render what be term bury a very deadening process to a light craft in this very important particular roswell be soon satisfied that the ship-wright have do he duty as the wind still stand at south-west the schooner be bring upon a easy bowline as soon as she have montauk light dead to windward this new course carry she out to sea steer south-south-east a little easterly under everything that would draw the weather appear settle and there be no sign of a change gardiner now go below and turn in leave the care of the vessel to the proper officer of the watch with a order to call he at sunrise fatigue soon assert its power and the young man be shortly in as profound a sleep as if he have not just leave a mistress whom he almost worship for a absence of two year and to go on a voyage that probably would expose he to more risk and suffering than any other enterprise then attempt by sea-faring man we young sailor think not of the last at all but he fall asleep dream of mary the master of the sea lion of oyster pond be call precisely at the hour he have name five minute suffice to bring he on deck where he find everything as he have leave it with the exception of the schooner itself in the six hour he have be below he vessel have move she position out to sea nearly forty mile no land be now to be see the american coast be very tame and unpicturesque to the eye as the purest patriot if he happen to know anything of other part of the world must be constrain to admit a low monotonous coast that be scarcely visible at a distance of five league be certainly not to be name in the same breath with those glorious shore of the mediterranean for instance where nature would seem to have exhaust herself in unite the magnificent with the bewitching on this continent or on we own portion of it at least we must be content with the useful and lay no great claim to the beautiful the river and bay give we some compensation in they admirable commercial facility for the sameness not to say tameness of the view we mention these thing in pass as a people that do not understand its relative position in the scale of nation be a little apt to fall into error that do not contribute to its character or respectability more especially when they exhibit a self-love found altogether on ignorance and which have be liberally feed by flattery the first thing a seaman do on come on deck after a short absence be to look to windward in order to see how the wind stand and what be the prospects of the weather then he turn he eye aloft to ascertain what canvass be spread and how it draw occasionally the order of these observation be change the first look be sometimes bestow on the sail and the second on the cloud roswell gardiner however cast he first glance this morning towards the southward and westward and perceive that the breeze promise to be steady on look aloft he be well satisfy with the manner in which everything draw then he turn to the second mate who have the watch whom he address cheerfully and with a courtesy that be not always observe among sailor a fine morning sir say roswell gardiner and a good-bye to america we have a long road to travel mr green but we have a fast boat to do it in here be a offing ready make to we hand nothing in sight to the westward not so much as a coaster even it be too early for the outward-bound craft of the last ebb and too late for those that sail the tide before i never see this bight of the coast clearer of canvass ay ay sir it do seem empty like here be a chap however to leeward who appear inclined to try he rate of sailing with we here he be sir a very little abaft the beam and as near as i can make he out he be a fore-tawsail schooner of about we own dimension if you 'll just look at he through this glass captain gardner you 'll see he have not only we rig but we canvass set you be right enough mr green return roswell after get he look he be a schooner of about we tonnage and under precisely we canvass how long have the fellow bear as he do now he come out from under blok island a few hour since and we make he by moonlight the question with I be where do that chap come from a stunni n'ton man would have naturally pass to windward of blok island and a newport or providence fellow would not have fetch so far to windward without make a stretch or two on purpose that schooner have bother I ever since it be daylight for i can not place he where he be by any traverse my poor parnin ' can work she do seem to be out of she way possibly it be a schooner beat up for the hook and finding herself too close in she be stand to the southward to get a offing again not she sir she come out from behind blok and a craft of she size that want to go to the westward and which find itself so close in would have take the first of the flood and go through the race like a shot no no captain gar ` ner this fellow be bind south as well as ourselves and it be quite onaccountable how he should be just where he be -- so far to windward or so far to leeward as a body might say a south-south-east course from any place behind point judith would have take he off near no man 's land and here he be almost in a line with blok island perhaps he be out of new london or some of the port on the main and be bind to the west indy he have be a little careless about weather the island it be no great matter after all it be some such matter captain garner as walkin ' round a meetin ' - ` we ' when you ar 'n' d be in at the door in front but there be no such craft in at stunni n'tun or new london as i know from havin ' be at both place within the last eight-and-forty hour you begin to make I as curious about this fellow as you seem to be yourself sir and now i think the matter all over it be somewhat extr ` or ` nary he should be just where he be it be however a very easy thing to get a nearer look at he and it be no great matter to we intend as we do to make the island off the cape de verde if we do lose a little of we weatherly position -- keep the schooner away a point and get a small pull on you weather brace -- give she a little sheet too fore and aft sir so that will do -- keep she steady at that -- south-east and by south in two hour we shall just about speak this out-of-the-way joker as every command be obey the sea lion be soon run off free she bowline hang loose and all she canvass a rap full the change in she line of sailing drought the sail to leeward a little forward of she beam but the movement of the vessel that make the freest wind be consequently the most rapid in the course of half a hour the stranger be again a little abaft the beam and he be materially nearer than when first see no change be make in the route of the stranger who now seem disposed to stand out to sea with the wind as it be on a easy bowline without pay any attention to the sail in sight it be noon ere the two schooner come within hail of each other of course as they draw nearer and nearer it be possible for those on board of each to note the appearance equipment and other peculiarity of he neighbor in size there be no apparent difference between the vessel and there be a somewhat remarkable resemblance in the detail that fellow be no west indium drogger say roswell gardiner when less than a mile from the stranger he carry a boat on deck as we do and have one on each quarter too can it be possible that he be bind after seal as well as we be ourselves i believe you be right sir answer hazard the chief-mate who be now on deck there be a seal look about the gentleman if i know my own complexion it be odd enough captain gar ` ner that two of we should come together out here in the offing and both of we bind to the other end of the ` arth there be nothing so very remarkable in _ that _ mr hazard when we remember that the start must be properly time for those who wish to be off cape horn in the summer season we shall neither of we get there much before December and i suppose the master of you schooner know that as well as i do myself the position of this craft puzzle I far more than anything else about she from what port can a vessel come that she should be just here with the wind at south-west ay sir put in green who be move about the deck coil rope and clear thing away that be what i tell the chief-mate where can a craft come from to be just here with this wind if she do not come from stunni n'tun even from stunni n'tun she would be out of she way but no such vessel have be in that port any time these six week here you stimson come this way a bit do not you tell I something of have see a schooner at new bedford that be about we build and burthen and that you understand have be buy for a sealer ay ay sir answer stimson as bluff a old sea-dog as ever flatten in a jib-sheet and that be the craft as i be a thinkin ' mr green she have a animal for a figure-head and that craft have a animal as well as i can judge at this distance you be right enough there stephen cry roswell gardiner and that animal be a seal it be the twin-brother of the sea lion we carry under we own bowsprit there be some proof in that taste agree sometimes even if they do differ generally what become of the schooner you see i hear sir that she be buy up by some vineyard man and be take across to hum ` se hull they sometimes fit out a craft there as well as on the main i should have cross myself to see what they be at but i fall in with mr green and ship aboard here a adventure by which i hope you will not be a loser my hearty put in the captain and you think that be the craft which be build at new bedford and fit out on the vineyard sartain of it sir for i know the figure-head and all about she build hand I the trumpet mr green we shall soon be near enough for a hail and it will be easy to learn the truth roswell gardiner wait a few minute for the two schooner to close and be in the very act of apply the trumpet to he mouth when the usual salutation be send across the water from the stranger during the conversation that now take place the vessel gradually draw nearer to each other until both party lay aside they trumpet and carry on the discourse with the unaided voice schooner ahoy be the greet of the stranger and a simple hilloa the answer what schooner be that pray the sea lion of oyster pond long island bind to the southward after seal as i suppose you know by we outfit when do you leave oyster pond -- and how do you leave you owner the good deacon pratt we sail yesterday afternoon on the first of the ebb and the deacon leave we as we weigh anchor he be well and full of hope for we luck what schooner be that pray the sea lion of hum ` se hull bind to the southward after seal as you probably know by _ we _ outfit who command that schooner captain roswell gar ` ner -- who command aboard you pray captain jason daggett show himself more plainly by move out of the line of the main-rigging i have the pleasure of see you when i be on the p ` int look after my uncle 's dunnage you may remember captain gar ` ner ' t be but the other day and you be not likely to have forget my visit not at all not at all captain daggett though i have no idea _ then _ that you intend to make a voyage to the southward so soon when do you leave the hole sir day before yesterday afternoon we come out of the hull about five o'clock how have you the wind sir sou ' - west and sou ' - west and by south there have be but little change in that these three day roswell gardiner mutter something to himself but he do not deem it prudent to utter the thought that be just then pass through he mind aloud ay ay he answer after a moment 's pause the wind have stand there the whole week but i think we shall shortly get a change there be a easterly feeling in the air waal let it come with this offing we could clear hattera with anything that be not worse than a south-easter there be a southerly set in here down the coast for two or three hundred mile a heavy south-easter would jam we in here between the shoal in a way i should not greatly relish sir i like always to get to the eastward of the stream as soon as i can in run off the land very true captain gar ` ner -- very true sir it _ be _ best to get outside the stream if a body _ can _ once there i call a craft at sea eight-and-forty hour more of this wind would just about carry we there waal sir as we be bind on the same sort of v ` y' ge i be happy to have fall in with you and i see no reason why we should not be neighbourly and ` gam ' it a little when we have nothing better to do i like that schooner of yours so well that i have make my own to look as nearly resemble she as i could you see we paint be exactly the same i have observe that captain daggett and you might say the same of the figure-heads ay ay when i be over on the p ` int they tell I the name of the carver in boston who cut you seal and i send to he to cut I a twin if they lay in a ship-yard side by side i do not think you could tell one from the other so it seem sir pray have not you a man aboard there of the name of watson ay ay -- he be my second-mate i know what you mean captain gar ` ner -- you be right enough ` tis the same hand who be aboard you but want a second officer i offer he the berth and he think that better than take a foremast lay in you craft this explanation probably satisfy all who hear it though the truth be not more than half tell in point of fact watson be engage as daggett 's second mate _ before _ he have ever lay eye on roswell gardiner and have be send to watch the progress of the work on oyster pond as have be previously state it be so much in the natural order of event for a man to accept preferment when offer however that even gardiner himself blame the delinquent for the desertion far less than he have previously do in the mean time the conversation proceed you tell we nothing of you have that schooner fitting when you be on the point observe roswell gardiner whose thought just then happen to advert to this particular fact my mind be pretty much take up with the affair of my poor uncle i suppose captain gar ` ner death must visit each of we once nevertheless it make we all melancholy when he come among friend now roswell gardiner be not in the least sentimental nor have he the smallest turn towards indulge in moral inference from ordinary event but this answer seem so proper that it find no objection in he mind still the young man have he suspicion on the subject of the equipment of the other schooner and suspicion that be now active and keen and which lead he directly to fancy that daggett have also some clue to the very object he be after himself singular as it may seem at first deacon pratt 's interest be favourably affect by this unexpected meeting with the sea lion of holme ' hole from the first roswell gardiner have be indispose to give full credit to the statement of the deceased mariner ascribe no small part of he account to artifice stimulate by a desire to render himself important but now that he find one of this man 's family embark in a enterprise similar to he own he view of its expediency be sensibly change perfectly familiar with the wary economy with which every interest be regulate in that part of the world he do not believe a company of martha 's vineyard man would risk they money in a enterprise that they have not good reason for believe would succeed although it exceed he means to appreciate fully the information possess by the vineyard folk and covetousness do not quicken he faculty on this subject as they have quicken those of the deacon he could see enough to satisfy he mind that either the sealing-island or the booty of the pirate or both have a reality in the judgment of other which have induce they also to risk they money in turn they knowledge to account the effect of this conviction be very natural it induce roswell to regard the chart and he instruction and all connect with he voyage as much more serious matter than he have originally be incline to do until now he have think it well enough to let the deacon have he fancy rely on he own ability to obtain a cargo for the schooner by visit seal station where he have be before but now he determine to steer at once for daggett 's island as he and he owner name the land reveal to they and ascertain what could be do there he think it probable the other sea lion might wish to keep he company but the distance be so great that a hundred occasion must occur when it would be in he power to shake off such a consort should he deem it necessary for several hour the two schooner stand on in company keep just without hail distance apart and sailing so nearly alike as to render it hard to say which craft have the best of it there be nothing remarkable in the fact that two vessel build for the same trade should have a close general resemblance to each other but it be not common to find they so mould stow spar and handle that they rate of sailing should be nearly identical if there be any difference it be slightly in favor of the sea lion of the vineyard which rather draw ahead of she consort if consort the other sea lion could be term in the course of the afternoon it be scarcely necessary to say that many be the speculation that be make on board these rival vessel -- competitor now for the commonest glory of they pursuit as well as in the ultimate object of they respective voyage on the part of roswell gardiner and he two mate they do not fail in particular to comment on the singularity of the circumstance that the sea lion of the vineyard should be so far out of she direct line of sailing although we have have the wind at sow-west -lrb- _ sow _ - west always as pronounce by every seaman from the lord high admiral of england when there happen to be such a functionary down to the greenest hand on board the greenest sealer -rrb- for these last few day say hazard anybody can see we shall soon have easterly weather there be a easterly feel in the air and all last night the water have a easterly glimmer about it now why a man who come out of the vineyard sound and who have nothing to do but just to clear the west end of he own island and then lay he course off yonder to the southward and eastward should bear up cluss -lrb- anglicé close -rrb- under blok and stretch out to sea for all the world as if he be a stunni n'tun chap or a new lunnoner that have fall a little to leeward be more than i can understand captain gar ` ner depend on it sir there be a reason for ' t man do not put schooner into the water now-a-days and give they costly outfit with three whale-boat and sealin ' gear in abundance just for the fun of make fancy traverse on or off a coast like you yacht gentry who never know what they would be at and who never make a v ` y' ge worth speak on i have be turn all this over in my mind mr hazard answer the young master who be amusing himself at the moment with strap a small block while he throw many a glance at the vessel that be just as close under he lee as comport with she sailing there be a reason for it as you say but i can find no other than the fact that she have come so much out of she way in order to fall in with _ we _ know that we be to come round montauk at a particular time well sir that may have be she play man bind the same way often wish to fall into good company to make the journey seem the shorter by make it so much the pleasanter those fellow can never suppose the two schooner will keep in sight of each other from forty-one degree north all the way to seventy south or perhaps further south still if we remain near each other a week ' t will be quite out of the common way i do not know that sir i be once in a sealer that do all she could could not get shut of a curious neighbor when seal be scarce and the master do not know where to look for 'em he be usually glad to drop into some vessel 's wake if it be only to pick up she leavin 's outfit be not make on such chance as that these vineyard people know where they be go as well as we know ourselves perhaps better there be great confidence aboard here in the master captain gar ` ner i overhear the watch talk the matter over early this morning and there be but one opinion among _ they _ i can tell you sir which opinion be mr hazard -- that a lay aboard this craft would be worth a lay and a half aboard any other schooner out of all america sailor go partly on skill and partly on luck i have know hand that would not ship with the best master that ever sail a vessel if they do not think they be lucky as well as skilful ay ay it be all _ luck _ little do these fellow think of _ providence _ -- or of _ deserving _ or _ undeserving _ well i hope the schooner will not disappoint they -- or she master either but whale and seal and trust to the chance of the ocean and we most flattering hope may mislead we after all ay ay sir nevertheless captain gar ` ner _ have _ a name and man will trust to it we young master could not but be flatter at this which come at a favourable moment to sustain the resolution awaken by the competition with the rival schooner although so obviously competitor and that in a matter of trade the interest which above all other be apt to make man narrow-minded and hostile to each other though the axiom would throw this particular reproach on _ doctor _ there be no visible sign that the two vessel do not maintain the most amicable relation as the day advance the wind fall and after many passage of nautical compliment by means of signal and the trumpet roswell gardiner fairly lower a boat into the water and go a gamming as it be term on board the other schooner each of these little vessel be well provide with boat and those of the description in common use among whaler a whale-boat differ from the ordinary jolly-boat launch or yawl -- gig barge dingui & c & c be exclusively for the service of vessel of war -- in the follow particulars : viz -- it be sharp at both end in order that it may ` back off ' as well as ` pull on ' it steer with a oar instead of with a rudder in order that the bow may be throw round to avoid danger when not in motion it be buoyant and make to withstand the shock of wave at both end and it be light and shallow though strong that it may be pull with facility when it be remember that one of these little egg-shell -- little as vessel though of good size as boat -- be often drag through trouble water at the rate of ten or twelve knot and frequently at even a swifter movement one can easily understand how much depend on its form buoyancy and strength among seaman it be commonly think that a whale-boat be the safest craft of the sort in which man can trust themselves in rough water captain daggett receive he guest with marked civility though in a quiet eastern way the rum and water be produce and a friendly glass be take by one after the other the two master drink to each other 's success and many a conventional remark be make between they on the subject of sea-lion sea-elephant and the mode of capture such animal even watson semi-deserter as he be be shake cordially by the hand and he questionable conduct overlook the ocean have many of the aspect of eternity and often dispose mariner to regard they fellow-creature with a expansiveness of feeling suit to they common situation its vastness remind they of the time that have neither begin nor end its ceaseless movement of the never-tiring impulse of human passion and its accident and danger of the providence which protect all alike and which alone prevent we be abandon to the dominion of chance roswell gardiner be a kind-hearted man moreover and be incline to judge he fellow leniently thus it be that he good evening at parting to watson be just as frank and sincere as that he bestow on captain daggett himself chapter ix roll on thou deep and dark blue ocean -- roll ten thousand fleet sweep over thee in vain man mark the earth with ruin -- he control stop with the shore -- upon the watery plain the wreck be all thy deed nor doth remain a shadow of man 's ravage save he own when for a moment like a drop of rain he sink into thy depths with bubble groan without a grave unknell would uncoffin would and unknown byron that evening the sun set in cloud though the eastern horizon be comparatively clear there be however a unnatural outline to object by which they dimension be increase and in some degree render indefinite we do not know the reason why the wind at east should produce these phenomenon nor do we remember ever to have meet with any attempt at a solution but of the fact we be certain by year of observation in what be call ` easterly weather ' object be see through the medium of a refraction that be entirely unknown in a clear north-wester the crest of the sea emit a luminous light that be far more apparent than at other time and the face of the ocean at midnight often wear the aspect of a clouded day the nerve too answer to this power of the eastern wind we have a barometer within that can tell when the wind be east without look abroad and one that never err it be true that allusion be often make to these peculiarity but where be we to look for the explanation on the coast of america the sea-breeze come from the rise sun while on that of europe it blow from the land but no difference in these sign of its influence could we ever discover on account of this marked distinction roswell gardiner find the scene greatly change when he come on deck next morning the storm which have be brew so long have come at last and the wind be blow a little gale from south-east the quarter from which the air come have compel the officer of the watch to haul up on the larboard tack or with the schooner 's head to the southward and westward a course that might do for a few day provide it do not blow too heavily the other tack would not have clear the shoal which stretch away to a considerable distance to the eastward hazard have get in he flying-jib and have take the bonnet off he foresail and jib to prevent the craft bury he have also single-reefed he mainsail and foretopsail the sea lion of the vineyard imitate each movement and be bring down precisely to the same canvass as she consort and on the same tack at that moment the two vessel be not a cable 's length asunder the oyster ponder be slightly to leeward they schooner however have a trifling advantage in sailing when it blow fresh and the water be rough which advantage be now make itself apparent as the two craft struggle ahead through the troubled element i wish we be two hundred mile to the eastward observe the young master to he first officer as soon as he eye have take in the whole view i be afraid we shall get jam in on cape hattera that place be always in the way with the wind at south-east and a vessel go to the southward we be likely to have a dirty time of it mr hazard ay ay sir dirty enough be the careless answer i have know they that would go back and anchor in fort pond bay or even in gardiner 's until this south-easter have blow itself out i could not think of that we be a hundred mile south-east of montauk and if i run the craft into any place it shall be into charleston or some of the island along that coast besides we can always ware off the land and place ourselves a day 's run further to the southward and we can then give the shoal a wide berth on the other tack if we be in the bight of the coast between long island and jersey ' t would be another matter but out here where we be i should be ashamed to look the deacon in the face if i do not hold on i only make the remark captain gar ` ner by way of say something as for get to the southward close in with we own coast i do not know that it will be of much use to a craft that wish to stand so far to the eastward since the trade must be meet well to windward or they have better not be meet at all for my part i would as soon take my chance of make a passage to the cape de verds or they neighborhood by lift my anchor from gardiner 's bay three day hence as by meet the next shift of wind down south off charleston or tybee we should be only five hundred mile to windward in the latter case do the wind come from the south-west again as at this season of the year it be very likely to do but it be of no consequence man bind where we have get to go ought not to run into port every time the wind come out foul you know as well as i do mr hazard that away down south yonder a fellow think a gale of wind be a relief provide it bring clear water with it i would rather run a week among island than a single day among iceberg one know where to find land for that never move but you mountain that float about be here to-day and there to-morrow quite true sir return hazard and man that take they lay in sealer be not to expect anything but squall i be ready to hold on as long as we neighbor yonder he seem to be trim down to it as if in raal earnest to get ahead this be true enough the sea lion of the vineyard be do she best all this time and though unable to keep she station on she consort 's weather bow where she have be most of the morning she be drop so very slowly as to render the change nearly imperceptible now it be that the officer and crew of these two craft watch they behavior as it be technically term with the closest vigilance and deepest interest those in the oyster pond vessel regard the movement of they consort much as a belle in a ball-room observe the effect produce by the sister belle around she or a rival physician note the progress of a operation that be to add new laurel or to cause old one to wither now the lurch be comment on then the pitch be think to be too heavy and green be soon of opinion that they competitor be not as easy on she spar as they own schooner in short every comparison that experience jealousy or skill could suggest be freely make and somewhat as a matter of course in favor of they own vessel that which be do on board the sea lion of oyster pond be very freely emulate by those on board she namesake of the vineyard they make _ they _ comparison and form _ they _ conclusion with the same deference to self-esteem and the same submission to hope as have be apparent among they competitor it would seem to be a law of nature that man should thus flatter themselves and perceive the mote in the eye of they neighbor while the beam in they own escape have there be a impartial judge present he might have differ from both set of critic such a person would have see that one of these schooner excel in this quality while the other have a equal advantage in another in this way by run through the list of property that be desirable in a ship he would most probably have come to the conclusion that there be not much to choose between the two vessel but that each have be construct with a intelligent regard to the particular service in which she be about to be employ and both be handle by man who know perfectly well how to take care of craft of that description the wind gradually increase in strength and sail be shorten in the schooner until each be finally bring down to a close-reefed foresail this would have be heave the vessel to have they not be keep a little off in order to force they through the water to lie-to in perfection some after-sail might have be require but neither master see a necessity as yet of remain stationary it be think better to wade along some two knot than to be pitch and lurch with nothing but a drift or leeward set in this both master be probably right and find they vessel farther to windward in the end than if they have endeavor to hold they own by lying-to the great difficulty they have to contend with in keep a little off be the danger of sea come on board but as yet the ocean be not sufficiently arouse to make this very hazardous and both schooner have no real cargo be light and buoyant and float dry have they encounter the sea there be with full freight in they hold it might have be imprudent to expose they even to this remote chance of have they deck sweep water come aboard of small vessel almost without a exception in head wind and sea though the contrivance of modern naval architecture have provide defence that make merchant vessel now infinitely more comfortable in this respect than they be at the period of which we be write at the end of three day roswell gardiner suppose himself to be about the latitude of cape henry and some thirty or forty league from the land it be much easier to compute the last than the first of these material fact of course he have no observation the sun have not be visible since the storm commence and nearly half the time during the last day the two vessel be shut in from one another by mist and a small rain it blow more in squall than it have do and the relative position of the schooner be more or less affect by the circumstance sometimes one would be to windward and ahead then the other would obtain a similar advantage once or twice they seem about to separate the distance between they get to be so considerable as apparently to render it impossible to keep in company then the craft would change place by a slow process pass quite near to each other again no one could tell at the moment precisely why these variation occur though the reason generally be well understand by all on board they squall careless steer current eddy and all the accident of the ocean contribute to create these vacillate movement which will often cause two vessel of equal speed and under the same canvass to seem to be of very different quality in the night the change be greatest often place the schooner league asunder and seemingly separate they altogether but roswell gardiner become satisfied that captain daggett stick by he intentionally for on all such occasion if _ he _ schooner happen to be out of the way he manage to close again ere the danger of separate become too great to be overcome we mariner judge of they distance from the land by means of the lead if the american coast be want in the sublime and picturesque and every traveller must admit its defect in both it have the essential advantage of graduate sounding so regular be the shoaling of the water and so studiously have the fathom be lay down that a cautious navigator can always feel he way in to the coast and never need place he vessel on the beach as be so often do without at least know that he be about to do so man become adventurous by often-repeated success and the struggle of competition the go-ahead-ism of the national character and the trouble it give to sound in deep water all contribute to cast away the reckless and dashing navigator on this as well as on other coast and this to he own great surprise but whenever such a thing _ do _ happen unless in case of stress of weather the reader may rest assure it be because those who have have charge of the stranded vessel have neglect to sound the mile-stone on a highway do not more accurately note the distance than do the lead on nearly the whole of the american coast thus roswell gardiner judge himself to be about thirty-two or three marine league from the land on the evening of the third day of that gale of wind he place the schooner in the latitude of cape henry on less certain datum though that be the latitude in which he suppose she to be by dead reckoning i wish i know where daggett make himself out say the young master just as the day close on a most stormy and dirty-looking night i do not half like the appearance of the weather but i do not wish to ware off the land with that fellow ahead and nearer to the danger if there be any than we be ourselves here roswell gardiner manifest a weakness that lie at the bottom of half we blunder he do not like to be outdo by a competitor even in he mistake if the sea lion of holme ' hole could hold on on that tack why might not the sea lion of oyster pond do the same it be by this process of human vanity that man sustain each other in wrong and folly obtain the sanction of number if not that of reason in this practice we see one of the cause of the mass become mislead and this seldom happen without they become oppressive roswell gardiner however do not neglect the lead the schooner have merely to luff close to the wind and they be in a proper state to sound this they do twice during that night and with a very sensible diminution in the depth of the water it be evident that the schooner be get pretty close in on the coast the wind come out nearly at south in squall she commander hold on for he think there be indication of a change and he still do not like to ware so long as he rival of the vineyard keep on the larboard tack in this way each encourage the other in recklessness do these two craft run nearly into the lion 's jaw as it might be for when the day re-appear the wind veer round to the eastward a little northerly bring the craft directly on a lee-shore blowing at the time so heavily as to render a foresail reef down to a mere rag more canvass than the little vessel could well bear as the day return and the drizzle clear off a little land be see to leeward stretch slightly to seaward both ahead and astern on consult he chart and after get a pretty good look at the coast from aloft roswell gardiner become satisfied that he be off currituck which place he near six degree to the southward of he port of departure and about four to the westward we young man now deeply feel that a foolish rivalry have lead he into a error and he regret that he have not wear the previous evening when he might have have a offing that would have enable he to stand in either direction clear the land as thing be he be not by any means certain of the course he ought to pursue little do gardiner imagine that the reason why daggett have thus stand on be solely the wish to keep he company for that person in consequence of gardiner 's run so close in towards the coast have take up the notion that the sea lion of oyster pond mean to pass through the west indy visit the key which be think to contain treasure and of which he have some account that have arouse all he thirst for gold without give he the clue necessary to obtain it thus it be that a mistaken watchfulness on one side and a mistaken pride on the other have bring these two vessel into as dangerous a position as could have be obtain for they by a direct attempt to place they in extreme jeopardy about ten the gale be at its height the wind still hang at east a little northerly in the course of the morning the officer on board both schooner profit by lull and clear moment have get so many view of the land from aloft as to be fully aware of they respective situation all thought of competition and watchfulness have now vanish each vessel be manage with a reference solely to she safety and as might have be foresee when true seaman handle both they have recourse to the same expedient to save themselves the mainsail of both craft be set balance-reefed and the hull be press up against the wind and sea while they be drive ahead with increase momentum that main-mast spring like a whale-bone whip-handle sir say hazard when this new experiment have be try some ten minute or more she jump from one sea to another like a frog in a hurry to hop into a puddle she must stand it or go ashore answer gardiner coolly though in secret he be deeply concerned do deacon pratt forgive I should we lose the schooner i never could forgive myself should we lose the schooner captain gar ` ner few of we would escape drown to feel remorse or joy look at that coast sir -- it be clear now and a body can see a good bit of it -- never do i put eye upon a less promising land-fall for stranger to make roswell gardiner do look as desire and he fully agree with hazard in opinion ahead and astern the land trend to seaward place the schooner in a curve of the coast or what seaman term a bight render it quite impossible for the vessel to lay out past either of the head-land in sight the whole coast be low and endless line of breaker be visible along it flash up with luminous crest that leave no doubt of they character or of the danger that they so plainly denote at time column of water shoot up into the air like enormous jet and the spray be carry inland for mile then it be that gloom gather around the brow of the seaman who fully comprehend the nature of the danger that be so plainly indicate the green hand be the least concerned know nothing and fear nothing as the older seaman be apt to express they sense of this indifference on the part of the boy and landsman accord to the calculation of those on board the sea lion of oyster pond they have about two mile of drift before they should be in the breaker they be on the best tack to all appearance and that be the old one or the same leg that have carry they into the bight to ware now indeed would be a very hazardous step since every inch of room be of importance gardiner 's secret hope be that they might find the inlet that lead into currituck which be then open though we believe it have since be close in whole or in part by the sand this often happen on the american coast very tolerable passage exist this year for vessel of a easy draught that shall be absolutely shut up and be convert into visible beach a few year later the water within will then gain head and break out cut themselves a channel that remain open until a succession of gale drive in the sand upon they from the outside once more gardiner well know he be on the most dangerous part of the whole american coast in one sense at least the capacious sound that spread themselves within the long beach of sand be almost as difficult of navigation as any shoal to the northward yet would he gladly have be in one in preference to claw off breaker on they outside as between the two schooner the vineyard-man have rather the best of it be near a cable 's length to windward and so much further remove from destruction the difference however be of no great account in the event of the gale continue escape be utterly impossible for either in that case so critical be the situation of both craft become indeed that neither could now afford to yield a single fathom of the ground she hold all eye be soon look for the inlet it have be determine to keep the sea lion of oyster pond away for it should it appear to leeward under circumstance that would allow of she reach it the line of breaker be now very distinctly visible and each minute do it not only appear to be but it be in fact nearer and nearer anchor be clear away and range of cable over-hauled anchoring be a expedient that a seaman feel bind to resort to previously to go ashore though it would be with very little hope of ground-tackle hold the schooner have be describe by hazard as ` jump ' into the sea this expression be not a bad one as apply to small vessel in short sea and it be particularly apt on this occasion although construct with great care forward as to buoyancy this vessel make plunge into the wave she meet that nearly bury she and once or twice the shock be so great that those on board she could with difficulty persuade themselves they have not strike the bottom the lead nevertheless still give water sufficient though it be shoal fast and with a most ominous regularity such be the actual state of thing when the schooner make one of she mad plunge and be meet by a force that seem to check she forward movement as effectually as if she have hit a rock the main-mast be a good spar in some respects but it want wood a inch or two more in diameter might have save it but the deacon have be induce to buy it to save he money though remonstrate with at the time this spar now snap in two a few foot from the deck and fall to leeward it drag after it the head of the foremast leave the sea lion of oyster pond actually in a worse situation just at that moment than if she have no spar at all roswell gardiner now appear in a new character hitherto he have be silent but observant : issue he order in a way not to excite the man and with a air of unconcern that really have the effect to mislead most of they on the subject of he estimate of the danger they be in concealment however be no longer possible and we young master come out as active as circumstance require foremost in every exertion and issue he order amid the gale trumpet-tongue he manner so full of animation resolution and exertion probably prevent despair from get the ascendancy at that important moment he be nobly sustain by both he mate : and three or four of the older seaman now show themselves man to be rely on to the last the first step be to anchor fortunately the foresight of gardiner have everything ready for this indispensable precaution without anchor ten minute would probably have carry the schooner directly down upon the breaker leave no hope for the life of any on board she and break she up into chip both bower be let go at once and long range of cable give the schooner be snub without parting anything and be immediately bring head to sea this relieved she at once and there be a moment that she people fancy she might ride out the gale where she be could they only get clear of the wreck axis hatchet and knife be freely use and roswell gardiner see the mass of spar and rig float clear of he with a delight he do not desire to conceal as it drive to leeward he actually cheer a lead be instantly drop alongside in order to ascertain whether the anchor hold this infallible test however give the melancholy certainty that the schooner be still drift she length in rather less than two minute the only hope now be that the fluke of the anchor might catch in better holding ground than they have yet meet with the bottom be hard sand however which never give a craft the chance that it get from mud by roswell gardiner 's calculation a hour at the most would carry they into the breaker possibly less time the sea lion of holme ' hole be to windward a cable 's length when this accident happen to she consort and about half a mile to the southward just at that instant the breaker trend seaward ahead of that schooner render it indispensable for she to ware this be do bring she head to the southward and she now come struggle directly on towards she consort the operation of waring have cause she to lose ground enough to bring she to leeward of the anchor craft and nearer to the danger roswell gardiner stand on he own quarter-deck anxiously watch the drift of the other schooner as she draw near in she labored way struggle ahead through billow that be almost as white as the breaker that menace they with destruction to leeward the anchor vessel though drift have so slow a movement that it serve to mark the steady and rapid set of its consort towards its certain fate at first it seem to gardiner that daggett would pass just ahead of he and he tremble for he cable which occasionally appear above water stretch like bar of iron for the distance of thirty or forty fathom but the leeward set of the vessel under way be too fast to give she any chance of bring this new danger on she consort when a cable 's length distant the sea lion of the vineyard _ do _ seem as if she might weather she consort but ere that short space be pass over it be find that she fall off so fast by means of she drift as to carry she fairly clear of she stern the two master hold with one hand to some permanent object by which to steady themselves and each press he tarpaulin firmly down on he head with the other have a minute 's conversation when the schooner be nearest together do you anchor hold demand daggett who be the first to speak and who put he question as if he think he own fate depend on the answer i be sorry to say they do not we drift we length in about two minute that will put off the evil moment a hour or two look what a wake _ we _ be make sure enough that wake be frightful no sooner be the head of the sea lion of the vineyard fairly up with the stern of the sea lion of oyster pond than gardiner perceive that she go off diagonally move quite as fast to leeward as she go ahead this be so very obvious that a line draw from the quarter of roswell 's craft in a quarter direction would almost have keep the other schooner in its range from the moment that she bow hove heavily past god bless you -- god bless you cry roswell gardiner wave he hand in adieu firmly persuade that he and the vineyard master be never to meet again in this world the survivor must let the fate of the lose be know at the pinch i shall out boat if i can the other make no answer it would have be useless indeed to attempt it since no human voice have power to force itself up against such a gale the distance that have now to be overcome that schooner will be in the breaker in half a hour say hazard who stand by the side of young gardiner why do not he anchor no power short of divine providence can save she and divine providence will do it -- thanks to almighty god for he goodness exclaim roswell gardiner do you perceive that mr hazard the ' _ that _ ' of we young mariner be in truth a most momentous omen the wind have lull so suddenly that the rag of sail which the other schooner carry actually flap at first we seaman think she have be becalm by the swell but the change about themselves be too obvious to admit of any mistake it blow terribly again for a minute then there be another lull gardiner spring to the lead-line to see the effect on he own vessel she no longer drag she anchor god be with we exclaim the young master -- bless for ever be he holy name and that of he only and _ true _ son respond a voice from one at he elbow notwithstanding the emergency and the excitement produce by this sudden change roswell gardiner turn to see from whom this admonition have come the oldest seaman on board who be stimson a kennebunk man and who have be place there to watch the schooner 's drift have utter these unusual word the fervor with which he speak produce more impression on the young master than the word themselves the former be very unusual among sea-faring man though the language be not so much so subsequently gardiner remember that little incident which be not without its result i do believe sir cry hazard that the gale be break it often happen on we own coast that the south-easter chop round suddenly and come out nor ' - wester i hope this will not be too late to save the vineyard chap though he slip down upon they breaker at a most fearful rate there go he foresail again -- and here be another lull rejoin gardiner i tell you mr hazard we shall have a shift of wind -- nothing short of which could save either of we from these breaker which come from the marcy of god almighty through the intercession of he only son add stimson with the same fervor of manner though he speak in a very low tone of voice roswell gardiner be again surprised and for another moment he forget the gale and its danger gale it be no longer however for the lull be now decide and the two cable of the schooner be distend only when the roll of the sea come in upon she this wash of the wave still menace the other schooner drive she down towards the breaker though less rapidly than before why do not the fellow anchor exclaim gardiner in he anxiety all care for himself be now over unless he anchor he will yet go into the white water and be lose so little do he think of that that he be turn out he reef answer hazard see there be a hand aloft loosen he topsail -- and there go up a whole mainsail already sure enough daggett appear more disposed to trust to he canvass than to he ground-tackle in a very brief space of time he have he craft under whole sail and be struggle in the puff to claw off the land presently the wind cease altogether the canvass flap so as to be audible to gardiner and he companion at the distance of half a mile then the cloth be distend in the opposite direction and the wind come off the land the schooner 's head be instantly bring to meet the sea and the lead drop at she side show that she be move in the right direction these sudden change sometimes destructive and sometimes providential as act of mercy always bring strong counter-current of air in they train now we shall have it say hazard -- a true nor ` wester and butt-end foremost this opinion very accurately describe that which follow in ten minute it be blow heavily in a direction nearly opposite to that which have be the previous current of the wind as a matter of course the sea lion of the vineyard draw off the land wallow through the meeting billow that still come rolling in from the broad atlantic while the sea lion of oyster pond tend to the new current of air and ride as it might be suspend between the two oppose force with little or no strain on she cable gardiner expect to see he consort stand out to sea and gain a offing but instead of this captain daggett bring he schooner quite near to the disabled vessel and anchor this act of neighbourly kindness be too unequivocal to require explanation it be the intention of the vineyard man to lie by they consort until she be relieve from all apprehension of danger the ` butt-end ' of the ` nor ' - wester ' be too large to admit of intercourse until next morning when that which have be a small gale have dwindle to a good steady breeze and the sea have go down leave comparatively smooth water all along the coast the line of white water which mark the breaker be there and quite visible but it no longer excited apprehension the jury-mast on board the disabled craft be get up and what be very convenient just at that moment the wreck come float out on the ebb so near to she as to enable the boat to secure all the sail and most of the rig the main-boom too a excellent spar be tow alongside and save chapter x the shadow from thy brow shall melt the sorrow from thy strain but where thy earthly smile have dwelt we heart shall thirst in vain mr heman as soon as it would do to put he boat in the water or at daylight next morning captain daggett come alongside of he consort he be receive with a seaman 's welcome and he offer of service be accept just as frankly as under reversed circumstance they would have be make in all this there be a strange and characteristic admixture of neighbourly and christian kindness blended with a keen regard of the main chance if the former duty be rarely neglect by the descendant of the puritan it may be say with equal truth that the latter be never lose sight of speculation and profit be regard as so many integral portion of the duty of man and as we kinsman of old england have set up a idol to worship in the form of aristocracy so do we kinsman of new england pay homage to the golden calf in point of fact daggett have a double motive in now offer he service to gardiner the one be the discharge of he moral obligation and the other a desire to remain near the sea lion of oyster pond lest she should visit the key of which he have some very interesting memorandum without have enough to find the place unless lead there by those who be better inform on the subject of its precise locality than he be himself the boat of daggett assist in get the wreck alongside and in secure the sail and rig then he people aid in fitting jury-mast and by noon both vessel get under way and stand along the coast to the southward and westward hattera be no longer terrible for the wind still stand at north-west and they keep in view of those very breaker which only the day before they would have give the value of both vessel to be certain of never see again that night they pass the formidable cape a spit of sand project far to seaward and which be on a low beach and not on any main land at all once around this angle in the coast they have a lee haul up to the south-west with the wind abeam they stand on the rest of the day pick up a pilot the next night they double cape look out a very good landmark for those go north to keep in view as a reminder of the stormy and sunken hattera and arrive off beaufort harbor just as the sun be rise the succeed morning by this time the north-wester be do and both schooner enter beaufort with a light southerly breeze there be just water enough to receive they this be the only place on all that coast into which it would have answer they purpose to go and it be perhaps the very port of all other that be best suit to supply the present want of roswell gardiner pine timber and spar of all sort abound in that region and the banker who act as pilot tell we young master that he could get the very stick he need in one hour 's time after enter the haven this term of banker apply to a scatter population of wrecker and fisherman who dwell on the long low narrow beach which extend along the whole of this part of the coast reach from cape fear to near cape henry a distance of some hundred and fifty mile within lie the capacious sound already mention include albemarle and pimlico and which form the watery portal to the sea-shore of all north carolina well be the last headland of that region but one which the schooner do not double name cape fear it be the commencement on that side of the dangerous part of the coast and put the mariner on he guard by its very appellation admonish he to be cautious and prudent off the entrance of beaufort a very perfect and beautiful haven if it have a greater depth of water the schooner hove-to in wait for the tide to rise a little and roswell gardiner take that occasion to go on board the sister craft and express to daggett a sense of the obligation he feel for the service the other have render of course you will not think of go in captain daggett continue we hero in dwelling on the subject after have put yourself already to so much unnecessary trouble if i find the spar the banker talk of i shall be out again in eight-and-forty hour and we may meet some month hence off cape horn i 'll tell you what it be gar ` ner return the vineyard mariner push the rum towards he brother master i be a plain sort of a fellow and do not make much talk when i do a thing but i like good-fellowship we come near go both of we -- nearer than i ever be before and escape wrackin ' but escape we do -- and when man have go through such trial in company i do not like the notion of cast off till i see you all a-tanto ag ` in and with as many leg and arm as i carry myself that be just my feelin ' gar ` ner and i will not say whether it be a right feelin ' or not -- help yourself it be a right feeling as between you and I captain daggett as i can answer for my heart tell I you be right and i thank you from it for these mark of friendship but you must not forget there be such person as owner in this world i shall have trouble enough on my hand with my owner and i do not wish you to have trouble with yours here be a nice little breeze to take you out to sea again and by pass to the southward of bermuda you can make a short cut and hit the trade far enough to windward to answer all you purpose thankee thankee gar ` ner -- i know the road and can find the place i be go to though no great navigator now i never take a lunar in my life and can not do anything with a chronometer but as for find the way between martha 's vineyard and cape horn i 'll turn my back on no shipmaster living i be afraid captain daggett that we have both of we turn we back on we true course when we suffer ourselves to get jam away down here on hattera why i never see the place before and never wish to see it again it be as much out of the track of a whaler or sealer as jupiter be out of the track of mar or venus oh there go you lunar about which i know nothing and care nothing i tell you gar ` ner a man with a good judgment can just as well jog about the ` arth without any acquaintance with lunar as he can with then you sealer have not half as much need of you academy-sort of navigation as another man more than half of we call be luck and all the best seal station i ever hear of have be blunder on by some chap who have lose he way i despise lunar if the truth must be say yet i like to go straight to my port of destination take a little sugar with you rum-and-water -- we vineyard folk like sweeten for which purpose or that of go straight to you port captain daggett you have come down here on you way to the pacific or about five hundred mile out of you way i come here for company gar ` ner we have not much choice you must allow for we could not have weather the shoal on the other tack i see no great harm in we position if you have not get dismast that be a two or three hundred dollar job and may make you owner grumble a little but it be no killing matter i 'll stick by you and you can tell the deacon as much in the letter you 'll write he when we get in it seem like do injustice to _ you _ owner as well as to my own keep you here captain daggett return roswell innocently for he have not the smallest suspicion of the true motive of all this apparent good-fellowship and i really wish you would now quit I i could not think of it gar ` ner ` twould make a awful talk on the vineyard be i to do anything of the sort ` stick by you consort ' be a eleventh commandment in we island which be the reason why there be so many old maid there i suppose daggett cry roswell gardiner laugh well i thank you for you kindness and will endeavor to remember it when you may have occasion for some return but the tide must be make and we ought to lose no time unnecessarily here be a lucky voyage to we both captain daggett and a happy return to sweetheart and wife daggett toss off he glass to this toast and the two then go on deck roswell gardiner think that a kinder ship 's company never sail together than this of the sea lion of holme ' hole for notwithstanding the interest of every man on board depend on the return of they own voyage each and all appear willing to stick by he and he craft so long as there be a possibility of be of any service whaler and sealer do not ship they crew for wages in money as be do with most vessel so much depend on the exertion of the people in these voyage that it be the practice to give every man a direct interest in the result consequently all on board engage for a compensation to be derive from a division of the return cargo the term on which a party engage be call he lay and he get so many part of a hundred accord to station experience and qualification the owner be pay for he risk and expense in the same way the vessel and outfit usually take about two-third of the whole return while the officer and crew get the other these condition vary a little as the proceeds of whaling and seal rise or fall in the market and also in reference to the cost of equipment it follow that captain daggett and he crew be actually put they hand into they own pocket when they lose time in remain with the cripple craft this gardiner know and it cause he to appreciate they kindness at a rate so much higher than he might otherwise have do at first sight it might seem that all this unusual kindness be superfluous and of no avail this however be not really the case since the crew of the second schooner be of much real service in forwarding the equipment of the disabled vessel beaufort have a excellent harbor for vessel of a light draught of water like we two sealer but the town be insignificant and extra labourer especially those of a intelligence suit to such work very difficult to be have at the bottom therefore roswell gardiner find he friendly assistant of much real advantage the two crew push the work before they with as much rapidity as suit even a seaman 's impatience aid by the crew of he consort gardiner get on fast with he repair and on the afternoon of the second day after he have enter beaufort he be ready to sail once more he schooner probably in a better state for service than the day she leave oyster pond the lightning-line do not exist at the period of which we be write it be we good fortune to be a intimate acquaintance of the distinguished citizen who have bestow this great gift on he own country -- one that will transmit he name to posterity side by side with that of fulton in he case as in that of the last-named inventor attempt have be make to rob he equally of the honor and the profit of he very ingenious invention as respects the last we hold that it be every hour become less and less possible for any american to maintain he rights against number there be no question that the government of this great republic be intend to be one of well-considered and upright principle in which certain question be to be refer periodically to majority as the wisest and most natural as well as the most just mode of dispose of they such a government well administer and with a accurate observance of its govern principle would probably be the best that human infirmity will allow man to administer but when the capital mistake be make of suppose that mere number be to control all thing regardless of those great fundamental law that the state have adopt for its own restraint it may be question if so loose and capricious and selfish a system be not in great danger of become the very worst scheme of polity that cupidity ever set in motion the tendency -- not the _ spirit _ of the institution the two thing be the very antipode of each other though common mind be so apt to confound they -- the _ tendency _ of the institution of this country in flagrant opposition to they _ spirit _ or _ intention _ which be devise expressly to restrain the disposition of man to innovate be out of all question to foster this great abuse and to place number above principle even when the principle be solemnly adopt expressly to bring number under the control of a sound fundamental law this influence of number this dire mistake of the very nature of liberty by place man and they passion above those great law of right which come direct from god himself be increase in force and threaten consequence which may set at naught all the well-devised scheme of the last generation for the security of the state and the happiness of that very people who can never know either security or even peace until they learn to submit themselves without a thought of resistance to those great rule of right which in truth form the _ spirit _ of they institution and which be only too often in opposition to they own impulse and motive we pretend to no knowledge on the subject of the date of discovery in the art and science but well do we remember the earnestness and single-minded devotion to a laudable purpose with which we worthy friend first communicate to we he idea on the subject of use the electric spark by way of a telegraph it be in paris and during the winter of 1831-2 and the succeed spring a time when we be daily together and we have a satisfaction in record this date that other may prove better claim if they can have morse set he great invention on foot thirty year earlier roswell gardiner might have communicate with he owner and get a reply ere he again sail considerable as be the distance between they as thing then be he be fain to be content with write a letter which be put into the deacon 's hand about a week after it be write by he niece on he own return from a short journey to southold whither he have be to settle and discharge a tardy claim against he schooner here be a letter for you uncle say mary pratt struggle to command she feeling though she blush with the consciousness of she own interest in the missive it come from the harbor by some mistake bait joe bring it across just after you leave home a letter with a post-mark -- ` beaufort nc ' -- who in natur ' can this letter be from -- what a postage too to charge on a letter fifty cent that be a proof sir that beaufort must be a long way off besides the letter be double i think the hand-writing be roswell 's have the niece fire a six-pounder under she uncle 's ear he would scarcely have be more startled he even turn pale and instead of break the wafer as he have be about to do he actually shrink from perform the act like one afraid to proceed what can this mean say the deacon take a moment to recover he voice gar ` ner 's hand-writing so it be i declare if that imprudent young man have lose my schooner i 'll never forgive he in this world whatever a body may be _ force _ to do in the next it be not necessary to believe anything as bad as that uncle letter be often write at sea and send in by vessel that be meet i dare say roswell have do just this not he -- not he -- the careless fellow he have lose that schooner and all my property be in the hand of wracker who be worse than so many rat in a larder ` beaufort nc ' yes that must be one of the bahama and nc stand for new providence -- ah 's I ah 's I but nc do _ not _ stand for new providence -- it would be np in that case uncle nc or np they sound so dreadfully alike that i do not know what to think take the letter and open it oh how big it be -- there must be a protest or some other costly thing inclose mary do take the letter and she open it though with tremble hand the inclosure soon appear and the first glance of she eye tell she it be a letter address to herself what be it mary -- what be it my child do not be afraid to tell I say the deacon in a low falter voice i hope i know how to meet misfortune with christian fortitude have it one of they awful-looking seal that notary public use when they want money mary blush rosy-red and she appear very charming at that moment though as resolute as ever to give she hand only to a youth whose ` god should be she god ' it be a letter to I sir -- nothing else i do assure you uncle roswell often write to I as you know he have send one of he letter inclose in this to you yes yes -- i be glad it be no worse well where be he letter write do he mention the latitude and longitude it will be some comfort to learn that he be well to the southward and eastward mary 's color disappear and a paleness come over she face as she run through the few first line of the letter then she summon all she resolution and succeed in tell she uncle the fact a misfortune have befall poor roswell she say she voice tremble with emotion though it do not seem to be half as bad as it might have be the letter be write at beaufort in north carolina where the schooner have put in to get new mast have lose those with which she sail in a gale of wind off cape hattera hattera interrupt the deacon groan -- what in natur ' have my vessel to do down there i be sure i do not know sir -- but i have better read you the contents of roswell 's letter and then you will hear the whole story mary now proceed to read aloud gardiner give a frank explicit account of all that have happen since he part with he owner conceal nothing and not attempt even to extenuate he fault of the sea lion of holme ' hole he write at large give it as he opinion that captain daggett really possess some clue -- what he do not know -- to the existence of the seal island though he rather think that he be not very accurately inform of they precise position as respect the key roswell be silent for it do not at all occur to he that daggett know anything of that part of he own mission in consequence of this opinion not the least suspicion of the motive of the vineyard-man in sticking by he present itself to gardiner 's mind and nothing on the subject be communicate in the letter on the contrary we young master be quite eloquent in express he gratitude to daggett and he crew for the assistance they have volunteer and without which he could not have be ready to go to sea again in less than a week as it be the letter be partly write as the schooner re-pass the bar and be send ashore by the pilot to be mail this fact be state in full in a postscript volunteer groan the deacon aloud as if a man ever volunteer to work without he pay roswell tell we that captain daggett do uncle answer mary and that it be understand between they he be to make no charge for he go into beaufort or for anything he do while there vessel often help each other in this kind way i should hope for the sake of christian charity sir not without salvage not without salvage charity be a good thing and it be we duty to exercise it on all occasion but salvage come into charity all the same as into any other interest this schooner will ruin I i fear and leave I in my old age to be support by the town that can hardly happen uncle since you owe nothing for she and have you farm and all you other property unencumbered it be not easy to see how the schooner can ruin you yes i be undo -- return the deacon beat the floor with he foot in nervous agitation -- as much undo as ever roswell gar ` ner 's father be and he might have be the richest man between oyster pond and riverhead have he keep out of the way of speculation i remember he much better off than i be myself and he die but little more than a beggar yes yes i see how it be this schooner have undo I but roswell send a account of all that he have pay and draw a bill on you for its payment the entire amount be but one hundred and sixteen dollar and seventy-two cent that be not for salvage the next thing will be a demand for salvage in behalf of the owner and crew of the sea lion of hums ' hull i know how it will be child : i know how it will be gar ` ner have undo I and i shall go down into my grave a beggar as he father have do already if such be the fact uncle no one but i would be the sufferer and i will strive not to grieve over you loss but here be a paper that roswell have inclose in he letter to I by mistake no doubt see sir it be a acknowledgment sign by captain daggett and all he crew admit that they go into beaufort with roswell out of good feeling and allow that they have no claim to salvage here it be sir you can read it for yourself the deacon do not only read it -- he almost devour the paper which as mary suggest have be inclose in she letter by mistake the relief produce by this document so far compose the uncle that he not only read gardiner 's letter himself with a very close attention to its contents but he actually forgive the cost of the repair incur at beaufort while he be in the height of he joy at this change in the aspect of thing the niece steal into she own room in order to read the missive she have receive by herself the tear that mary pratt profusely shed over roswell 's letter be both sweet and bitter the manifestation of he affection for she which be manly and frank bring tear of tenderness from she eye while the recollection of the width of the chasm that separate they have the effect to embitter these proof of love most female would have lose the sense of duty which sustain we heroine in this severe trial and in accept the man of they heart would have trust to time and she own influence and the mercy of divine providence to bring about the change she desire but mary pratt could not thus blind herself to she own high obligation the tie of husband and wife she rightly regard as the most serious of all the obligation we can assume and she could not -- _ would _ not plight she vow to any man whose ` god be not she god ' still there be much of sweet consolation in this little-expected letter from roswell he write as he always do simply and naturally and attempt no concealment this be just as true of he act as the master of the schooner as it be in he character of a suitor to mary he tell the whole story of he weakness acknowledge that a silly spirit of pride which would not permit he to seem to abandon a trial of the quality of the two schooner have induce he to stand on to the westward longer than he should otherwise have do and the current have come to assist in increase the danger as for daggett he suppose he to have be similarly influence though he do not withhold he expression of gratitude for the generous manner in which that seaman have stick to he to the last for weary month do mary pratt derive sweet consolation from she treasure of a letter it be perhaps no more than human nature or woman 's nature at least that in time she get most to regard those passage which best answer to the longing of she own heart and that she come at last to read the missive forgetful in a degree that it be write by one who have deliberately and as a matter of faith adopt the idea that the redeemer be not in what may be call the catholic sense of the term the son of god the papers give a account of the arrival of the ` twin sea lion ' as the article style they in the port of beaufort to repair damages and of they have soon sail again in company this paragraph she cut out of the journal in which it meet she eye and enclose it in roswell 's last letter there be not a day in the succeed year in which both be not in she hand and read for the hundredth time or more these proof of tenderness however be not to be take as evidence of any lessen of principle or as sign of a disposition to let she judgment and duty submit to she affection so far from this she resolution grow with reflection and she mind become more settle in a purpose that she deem sacred the longer she reflect on the subject but she prayer in behalf of she absent lover grow more frequent and much more fervent in the mean time the twin lion sail on leave beaufort they run off the coast with a smart breeze from south-west make a lead wind of it there have be some variance of opinion between daggett and gardiner touch the course they ought to steer the last be for haul up higher and pass to the southward of bermuda while the first contend for stand nearly due east and go to the northward of those island gardiner feel impatient to repair he blunder and make the shortest cut he could whereas daggett reason more coolly and take the wind into the account keep in view the main result of the voyage perhaps the last wish to keep he consort away from all the key until he be compel to alter he course in a way that would leave no doubt of he intention of one thing the last be now certain he know by a long trial that the sea lion of oyster pond could not very easily run away from the sea lion of holme ' hole and he be fully resolve that she should not escape from he in the night or in squall as for roswell gardiner not have the smallest idea of look for he key until he come north after visit the antarctic circle he have no notion whatever of the reason why the other stick to he so closely and least of all why he wish to keep he clear of the west indy until ready to make a descent on he el dorado beaufort lie about two degree to the northward of the four hundred rock islet and small island which be know as the bermuda a advanced naval station that belong to a rival commercial power and which be occupy by that power solely as a check on this republic in the event of war have the view of real statesman prevail in america instead of those of mere politician the whole energy of this republic would have be long since direct to the object of substitute we own flag for that of england in these island as thing be there they exist a station for hostile fleet a receptacle for prize and a depot for the munitions of war as if expressly design by nature to hold the whole american coast in command while little man with great name be wrangle about southwestern acquisition and north-eastern boundary that be of no real moment to the growth and power of the republic these island that ought never to be out of the mind of the american statesman have not yet enter into the account at all a certain proof how little the mind that do or ought to influence event be really up to the work they have be delegate to perform military expedition have twice be send from this country to canada when both the canada be not of one-half the importance to the true security and independence of the country -- -lrb- no nation be independent until it hold the control of all its greater interest in its own hand -rrb- -- as the bermuda when england ask the cession of territory undoubtedly american because it overshadow quebec she should have be meet with this plain proposition -- give we the bermuda and we will exchange with you you hold those island as a check on we power and we will hold the angle of maine for a check on yours unless you will consent to make a fair and mutual transfer we will not attack you for the possession of the bermuda for we deem a just principle even more important than such a accession but when you ask we to cede we hold out we hand to take a equivalent in return the policy of this nation be not to be influence by saw-log but by these manifest important and ulterior interest if you wish maine give we bermuda in exchange or go with you wish ungratified happily among we event be stronger than man and the day be not distant when the mere force of circumstance will compel the small-fry of diplomacy to see what the real interest and dignity of the republic demand in reference to this great feature of its policy roswell gardiner and daggett have several discussion touch the manner in which they ought to pass those island there be about four degree to spare between the trade and the bermuda and the former be of opinion that they might pass through this opening and make a straighter wake than by go farther north these consultation take place from quarter-deck to quarter-deck as the two schooner run off free steering directly for the island as a sort of compromise between the two opinion the distance from the main to the bermuda be compute at about six hundred mile which give sufficient leisure for the discussion of the subject in all its bearing the conversation be amicable and the weather continue mild and the wind standing they be renew each afternoon when the vessel close as if expressly to admit of the dialogue in all this time five day altogether it be farther ascertain that the difference in sailing between the twin lion as the sailor now begin to call the two schooner be barely perceptible if anything it be slightly in favor of the vineyard craft though there yet remain many of the vicissitude of the sea in which to make the trial while this uncertainty as to the course prevail the low land appear directly ahead when daggett consent to pass it to the southward keep the cluster in sight however as they go steadily on towards the southward and eastward chapter xi with glossy skin and drip mane and reel limb and reek flank the wild steed 's sinewy nerve still strain up the repel bank mazeppa roswell gardiner feel as if he could breathe more freely when they have run the summer group fairly out of sight and the last hummock have sink into the wave of the west he be now fairly quit of america and hope to see no more of it until he make the well-known rock that point the way into that most magnificent of all the haven of the earth the bay of rio de janeiro traveller dispute whether the palm ought to be give to this port or to those of naple and constantinople each certainly have its particular claim to surpass beauty which ought to be keep in view in come to a decision see from its outside with its minaret and golden horn and bosphorus constantinople be probably the most glorious spot on earth ascend its mountain and overlook the gulf of salerno and gaeta as well as its own water the _ campugna felicus _ and the memorial of the past all see in the witchery of a italian atmosphere and the mind become perfectly satisfy that nothing equal be to be find elsewhere but enter the bay of rio and take the whole of the noble panorama in at a glance and even the experienced traveller be stagger with the stupendous as well as bewitching character of the loveliness that meet he eye witchery be a charm that peculiarly belong to italy as all must feel who have ever be bring within its influence but it be a witchery that be more or less share by all region of low latitudes we two sea lion meet with no adventure worthy of record until they get well to the southward of the equator they have be unusually successful in get through the calm latitudes and forty-six day from montauk they speak a sag harbor whaler homeward bind that have come out from rio only the precede week where she have be to dispose of she oil by this ship letter be send home and as gardiner could now tell the deacon that he should touch at rio even before the time first anticipate he believe that he should set the old man 's heart at peace a little occurrence that take place the very day they part with the whaler add to the pleasure this opportunity of communicate with the owner have afford as the schooner be move on in company about a cable 's length asunder hazard see a sudden and extraordinary movement on board the vineyard lion as the man now name that vessel to distinguish she from she consort look out for a spout shout the mate to stimson who happen to be on the foretopsail-yard at work when this unexpected interruption to the quiet of the passage occur there be a man overboard from the other schooner or they see a spout a spout a spout shout stimson in return and a spalm -lrb- sperm or spermaceti be mean -rrb- whale in the bargain here he be sir two p ` int on we weather beam this be enough if any one have have the misfortune to be in a coach draw by four horse when a sudden fright start they off at speed he can form a pretty accurate notion of the movement that now take place on board of deacon pratt 's craft every one seem to spring into activity as if a single will direct a common set of muscle those who be below literally tumble up as seaman express it and those who be aloft slide down to the deck like flash of lightning captain gardiner spring out of he cabin seemingly at a single bind at another he be in the whale-boat that hazard be in the very act of lower into the water as the schooner rounded-to perceive himself anticipate here the mate turn to the boat on the other quarter and be in she and in the water almost as soon as he command officer although neither of the schooner be thoroughly fit for a whaler each have line lance harpoon & c in readiness in they quarter-boat prepare for any turn of luck like this which now offer the process of paddle up to whale which be now so common in the american ship be then very little or not at all resort to it be say that the animal have get to be so shy in consequence of be so much pursue that the old mode of approach they will not suffice and that it now require much more care and far more art to take one of these creature than it do thirty year since on this part of the subject we merely repeat what we hear though we think we can see a advantage in the use of the paddle that be altogether independent of that of the greater quiet of that mode of force a boat ahead he that paddle look _ ahead _ and the approach be more easily regulate when the whole of the boat 's crew be apprise by means of they own sens of the actual state of thing than when they attain they idea of they through the order of a officer the last must govern in all case but the man be prepare for they when they can see what be go on and will be more likely to act with promptitude and intelligence and will be less liable to make mistake the four boat two from each schooner drop into the water nearly about the same time daggett be at the steering-oar of one as be roswell at that of another hazard and macy the chief mate of the vineyard craft be at the steering-oar of the two remain boat all pull in the direction of the spot on the ocean where the spout have be see it be the opinion of those who have be aloft that there be several _ fish _ and it be certain that they be of the most valuable species or the spermaceti one barrel of the oil of which be worth about as much as the oil of three of the ordinary sort or that of the _ right _ whale suppose they all to yield the same quantity in number of barrel the nature or species of the fish be easily enough determine by the spout the right whale throw up two high arched jet of water while the spermaceti throw but a single low bushy one it be not long ere the boat of the two captain come abreast of each other and within speak distance a stern rivalry be now apparent in every countenance the man pull might and main and without even a smile among they all every face be grave earnest and determine every arm string to its utmost power of exertion the man row beautifully be accustom to the use of they long oar in rough water and in ten minute they be all fully a mile dead to windward of the two schooner few thing give a more exalted idea of the courage and ingenuity of the human race than to see adventurer set forth in a mere shell on the troubled water of the open ocean to contend with and capture a animal of the size of the whale the simple circumstance that the last be in its own element while its assailant be compel to approach it in such light and fragile conveyance that to the unpractised eye it be sufficiently difficult to manage they amid the roll water without seek so powerful a enemy to contend with but little of all this do the crew of we four boat now think they have before they the object or _ one _ of the object rather of they adventure and so long as that be the case no other view but that of prevail could rise before they eye how be it gar ` ner call out the vineyard master shall it be share or do each schooner whale on she own hook this be ask in a friendly way and apparently with great indifference as to the nature of the reply but with profound art it be daggett 's wish to establish a sort of partnership which take in connection with the good feeling create by the affair at beaufort would be very apt to lead on to further and more important association luckily for gardiner a idea cross he mind just as he be about to reply which induce the wisest answer it be the thought that competition would be more likely to cause exertion than a partnership and that the success of all would better repay they for they toil and risk should each vessel act exclusively for itself this be the principle that render the present state of society more healthful and advantageous than that which the friend of the different system of associate that be now so much in vogue wish to substitute in its place individuality be a all-important feeling in the organization of human being into community and the political economist who do not use it as he most powerful auxiliary in advance civilization will soon see it turn round in its track and become a dead weight indulge its self-love by live with the minimum of exertion instead of push he private advantage with the maximum i think each vessel have better work for herself and she owner answer roswell gardiner as the schooner be in the trade there be a regular sea run and one that be neither very high nor much break still the boat be lift on it like egg-shell or bubble the immense power of the ocean raise the largest ship groan under they vast weight of ordnance as if they be feather in a few minute gardiner and daggett become a little more separated each look eagerly for the spout which have not be see by either since quit he vessel all this time the two mate come steadily on until the whole of the little fleet of boat be by this time not less than a marine league distant from the schooner the vessel themselves be work up to windward to keep as near to the boat as possible make short tack under reduce canvass a shipkeeper the cook steward and one or two other hand be all who be leave on board they we shall suppose that most of we reader be sufficiently acquaint with the general character of that class of animal to which the whale belong to know that all of the genus breathe the atmospheric air which be as necessary for life to they as it be to man himself the only difference in this respect be that the whale can go longer without renew he respiration than all purely land-animals though he must come up to breathe at interval or die it be the exhaling of the old stock of air when he bring the blow-hole as seaman call the outlet of he respiratory organ to the surface that force the water upward and form the spout which usually indicate to the whaler the position of they game the spout vary in appearance as have be mention owe to the number and situation of the orifice by which the exhaust air escape no sooner be the vitiated air exhale than the lung receive a new supply and the animal either remain near the surface roll about and sport amid the wave or descend again a short distance in quest of its food this food also vary materially in the different species the right-whale be suppose to live on what may be term marine insect or the molluscæ of the ocean which it be think he obtain by run in the part of the sea where they most abound arrest they by the hairy fiber which grow on the laminæ of bone that in a measure compose he jaw have no tooth the spermaceti however be furnish with regular grinder which he know very well how to use and with which he often crush the boat of those who come against he thus the whaler have but one danger to guard against in assault the common animal viz he fluke or tail while the spermaceti in addition to the last means of defense possess those of he tooth or jaw as this latter animal be quite one-third head he have no very great dissemblance to the alligator in this particular by means of this brief description of the physical formation and habit of the animal of which we adventurer be in pursuit the general reader will be the better able to understand that which it be we duty now to record after rowing the distance name the boat become a little separated in they search for the fish that spout have be see there be no doubt though since quit the schooner no one in the boat have get a further view of the fish -- if fish animal with respiratory organ can be term a good look-out for spout have be keep by each man at the steering-oar but entirely without success have not roswell and daggett previously to leave they respective vessel see the sign of whale with they own eye it be probable that they would now have both be dispose to return call in they mate but be certain that the creature they seek be not far distant they continue slowly to separate each strain he eye in quest of he game as he boat rise on the summit of the rolling and toss wave water in motion be all around they and the schooner work slowly up against the trade be all that reward they vigilant and anxious look twenty time do each fancy that he see the dark back or head of the object he seek but as often do it prove to be no more than a lipper of water roll up into a hummock ere it break or melt away again into the general mass of the unquiet ocean when it be remember that the surface of the sea be toss into a thousand fantastic outline as its wave roll along it can readily be imagine how such mistake could arise at length gardiner discern that which he practiced eye well know it be the fluke or extremity of the tail of a enormous whale distant from he less than a quarter of a mile and in such a position as to place the animal at about the same breadth of water from daggett it would seem that both of these vigilant officer perceive they enemy at the same instant for each boat start for it as if it have be instinct with life the pike or the shark could not have dart towards its prey with greater promptitude and scarcely with greater velocity than these two boat very soon the whole herd be see swim along against the wind a enormous bull-whale lead while half a dozen calf keep close to the side of they dam or sport among themselves much as the offspring of land animal delight in they youth and strength presently a mother roll lazily over on she side permit its calf to suck other follow this example and then the leader of the herd cease he passage to windward but begin to circle the spot as if in complaisance to those considerate nurse who thus wait on the want of they young at this interesting moment the boat come glance in among the herd have the competition and spirit of rivalry be at a lower point among we adventurer than it actually be greater caution might have be observe it be just as dangerous to assault a whale that have its young to defend as to assault most other animal we know that the most delicate woman become heroine in such strait and nature seem to have give to the whole sex whether endowed with reason or only with a instinct the same disposition to die in defense of the helpless creature that so much depend on they care but no one there now think of the risk he run it be the vineyard against oyster pond one sea lion against the other and in many instance pocket against pocket roswell as if disdain all meaner game pull quite through the herd and lay the bow of he boat directly on the side of the old bull -- a hundred-barrel whale at the very least no sooner do the enormous creature feel the harpoon than throw its fluke upward it descend into the depths of the ocean with a velocity that cause smoke to arise from the chuck through which the line pass ordinarily the movement of a whale be not much faster than a active man can walk and when it run on the surface its speed seldom exceed that of a swift vessel under full sail but when suddenly startle with the harpoon in its blubber the animal be capable of make a prodigious exertion when strike it usually ` sound ' as it be term or run downward sometimes to the depth of a mile and it be say that instance have be know in which the fish inflict great injury on itself by dash its head against rock in the case before we after run out three or four hundred fathom of line the ` bull ' to which gardiner have ` fasten ' come up to the surface ` blow ' and begin to move slowly towards the herd again no sooner be the harpoon throw than a change take place in the disposition of the crew of the boat which it may be well to explain the harpoon be a barb javelin fasten to a staff to give it momentum the line be attach to this weapon the proper use of which be to ` fasten ' to the fish though it sometimes happen that the animal be kill at the first blow this be when the harpoon have be hurl by a very skilful and vigorous harpooner usually this weapon penetrate some distance into the blubber in which a whale be encase and when it be draw back by the plunge of the fish the barb part get embed in the tough integument of the hide together with the blubber and hold the iron of the harpoon be very soft the shank bend under the strain of the line leave the staff close to the animal 's body owe to this arrangement the harpoon offer less resistance to the water as the whale pass swiftly through it no sooner do the boat-steerer or harpooner cast he ` iron ' as whaler term the harpoon than he change place with roswell who leave the steering-oar and proceed forward to wield the lance the weapon with which the victory be finally consummate the man now ` peak ' they oar as it be term or they place the handle in cleet make to receive they leave the blade elevate in the air so as to be quite clear of the water this be do to get rid of the oar in readiness for other duty while the instrument be leave in the thole to be resort to in emergency this give a whale-boat a peculiar appearance with its five long oar raise in the air at angle approach forty-five degree in the mean time as the bull approach the herd or school -lrb- \* -rrb- as the whaler term it the boat ' crew begin to haul in line the boat-steerer coil it away carefully in a tub place in the stern-sheet purposely to receive it any one can understand how important it be that this part of the duty should be well perform since bight of line run out of a boat drag by a whale would prove so many snare to the man 's leg unless previously dispose of in a place proper to let it escape without this risk for this reason it be that the end of a line be never permit to run out at the bow of a boat at all it might do some injury in its passage and a axe be always apply near the bow when it be find necessary to cut from a whale -lrb- \* we suppose this word to be a corruption of the dutch _ schule _ which we take it mean the same thing -rrb- it be so unusual a thing to see a fish turn towards the spot where he be strike that roswell do not know what to make of this maneuver in he bull at first he suppose the animal mean to make fight and set upon he with its tremendous jaw but it seem that caprice or alarm direct the movement for after come within a hundred yard of the boat the creature turn and commence sculling away to windward with wide and nervous sweep of its formidable fluke it be by this process that all the fish of this genus force they way through the water they tail be admirably adapt to the purpose as the man have show the utmost activity in haul in upon the line by the time the whale go off to windward again they have get the boat up within about four hundred foot of he now commence a tow dead to windward it be know that a fish when strike seldom run at first in any other direction the rate at which the whale move be not at the height of he speed though it exceed six knot occasionally this rate be lessen and in several instance he speed be reduce to less than half of that just mention whenever one of these lull occur the man would haul upon the line gradually get nearer and nearer to the fish until they be within fifty foot of he tremendous fluke here a turn be take with the line and a opportunity to use the lance be wait for whaler say that a forty-barrel bull of the spermaceti sort be much the most dangerous to deal with of all the animal of this species the larger bull be infinitely the most powerful and drive these half-grown creature away in herd by themselves that be call ` pad ' a circumstance that probably render the young bull discontented and fierce the last be not only more active than the larger animal but be much more disposed to make fight commonly give he captor the greatest trouble this may be one of the reason why roswell gardiner now find himself tow at a reasonable rate so close upon the fluke of a hundred-barrel whale still there be that in the movement of this animal that induce we hero to be exceedingly wary he be now two league from the schooner and half that distance from the other boat neither of which have as yet fasten to a fish this latter circumstance be imputed to the difficulty the different officer have in make they selection cow of the spermaceti breed when they give suck be commonly light and yielding comparatively very small quantity of head-matter and oil in select the bull roswell have show he judgment the male animal commonly return to its conqueror twice the profit that be derive from the female the whale to which roswell be fast continue sculling away to windward for quite two hour cause the man to entirely lose sight of the other boat and bring the topsail of the schooner themselves down to the water 's edge fortunately it be not yet noon and there be no immediate apprehension from the darkness nor do the bull appear to be much alarmed though the boat be tow so close in he rear at first or before the iron be throw the utmost care have be take not to make a noise but the instant the crew be ` fast ' whisper be change into loud call and order be pass in shout rather than in verbal command the wildest excitement prevail among the man strangely blended with a cool dexterity but it be very apparent that a high sport fever be rage among they gardiner himself be much the coolest man in he own boat as become he station and very responsible duty stimson the oldest and the best seaman in the schooner he who have admonish he young commander on the subject of the gratitude due to the deity act as the master 's boat-steerer have first perform the duty of harpooner it be to he that gardiner now address the remark he make after have be fasten to he whale fully two hour this fellow be likely to give we a long drag say the master as he stand balance himself on the clumsy elect in the bow of the boat use he lance as a adept in saltation poise he pole on the wire the water curl fairly above the gunwale forward with the rapid movement of the boat i would haul up alongside and give he the lance do i not distrust they fluke i believe he know we be here that he do -- that do he captain gar ` ner it be always best to be moderate and wait you time sir there be a jerk about that chap 's fluke that i do not like myself and it be best to see what he would be at before we haul up any nearer do not you see sir that every minute or two he strike down instead of scull off handsomely and with a wide sweep as become a whale that be just the motion i distrust stephen and i shall wait a bit to see what he would be at i hope those ship-keeper will be busy and work the schooner well up to windward before it get to be dark we man be asleep half he time and be apt to let the vessel fall off a point or two mr hazard give he caution to keep a bright look out sir and i think he 'll be apt to -- look out sir -- look out this warning be well-timed for just at that instant the whale cease sculling and lift its enormous tail high in the air it strike five or six blow on the surface of the water that make a noise which might have be hear half a league besides fill the atmosphere immediately around he with spray as the tail first appear in the air line be permit to run out of the boat increase the distance between its bow and the fluke to quite a hundred foot nothing could better show the hardy character of the whaler than the picture then present by roswell gardiner and he companion in the midst of the atlantic league from they vessel and no other boat in sight there they sit patiently wait the moment when the giant of the deep should abate in he speed or in he antic to enable they to approach and complete they capture most of the man sit with they arm cross and body half-turned regard the scene while the two officer the master and boat-steerer if the latter could properly be thus designate watch each evolution with a keenness of vigilance that let nothing like a sign or a symptom escape they such be the state of thing the whale still thresh the sea with he fluke when a cry among he man induce roswell for a moment to look aside there come daggett fast to a small bull which be run directly in the wind 's eye with great speed drag the boat after he which be tow astern at a distance of something like two hundred fathom at first roswell think he should be compel to cut from he whale so directly towards he own boat do the other animal direct he course but intimidate most probably by the tremendous blow with which the larger bull continue to belabor the ocean the smaller animal sheer away in time to avoid a collision though he now begin to circle the spot where he dreaded monarch lay this change of course give rise to a new source of apprehension if the smaller bull should continue to encircle the larger there be great reason to believe that the line of daggett might get entangled with the boat of gardiner and produce a collision that might prove fatal to all there in order to be ready to meet this danger roswell order he crew to be on the look-out and to have they knife in a state for immediate use it be not know what might have be the consequence of this circular movement as respects the two boat for before they could come together daggett 's line actually pass into the mouth of gardiner 's whale and draw up tight into the angle of he jaw set the monster in motion with a momentum and power that cause the iron to draw from the smaller whale which by this time have more than half encircle the animal so rapid be the rate of run now that roswell be oblige to let out line he whale sound to a prodigious depth daggett do the same unwilling to cut as long as he could hold on to he line at the expiration of five minute the large bull come up again for breath with both line still fast to he the one in the regular way or attach to the harpoon and the other jam in the jaw of the animal by means of the harpoon and staff which form a sort of toggle at the angle of he enormous mouth in consequence of feeling this unusual tenant the fish compress its jaw together thus render the fasten so much the more secure as both boat have let run line freely while the whale be sound they now find themselves near a quarter of a mile astern of he tow along side by side and not fifty foot asunder if the spirit of rivalry have be arouse among the crew of these two boat before it be now excite to a degree that menace act of hostility you know of course captain daggett that this be my whale say gardiner i be fast to he regularly and be only wait for he to become a little quiet to lance he when you whale cross he course foul you line and have get you fast in a unaccountable way but not accord to whale law i do not know that i fasten to a whale captain gar ` ner and be fast to a whale now it must be _ proved _ that i have no right to the crittur ' before i give he up gardiner understand the sort of man with whom he have to deal too well to waste word in idle remonstrance resolve to maintain he just rights at every hazard he order he man to haul in upon the line the movement of the whale become so slow as to admit of this measure daggett 's crew do the same and a warm contest exist between the two boat as to which should now first close with the fish and kill it this be not a moment for prudence and caution it be haul in -- haul in boy in both boat without any regard to the danger of approach the whale a very few minute suffice to bring the party quite in a line with the fluke gardiner 's boat come up on the larboard or left-hand side of the animal where its iron be fast and daggett 's on the opposite its line lead out of the jaw of the fish in that direction the two master stand erect on they respective clumsy cleet each poise he lance wait only to get near enough to strike the man be now at the oar and without pause for any thing both crew spring to they ashen instrument and drive the boat headlong upon the fish daggett perhaps be the coolest and most calculate at that moment but roswell be the most nervous and the boldest the boat of the last actually hit the side of the whale as its young commander drive he lance through the blubber into the vitals of the fish at the same instant daggett throw he lance with consummate skill and go to the quick it be now stern all for life each boat backing off from the danger as fast as hand could urge the sea be in a foam the fish go into he flurry almost as soon as strike and both crew be delighted to see the red of the blood mingle its deep hue with the white of the troubled water once or twice the animal spout but it be a fluid dye in he gore in ten minute it turn up and be dead chapter xii god save you sir and you sir you be welcome travel you far on or be you at the furthest sir at the furthest for a week or two shakspeare gardiner and daggett meet face to face on the carcase of the whale each strike he lance into the blubber steadying himself by its handle and each eye the other in a way that betoken feeling awaken to a keen desire to defend he rights it be a fault of american character -- a fruit of the institution beyond a doubt -- that render man unusually indispose to give up this stubbornness of temperament that so many mistake for a love of liberty and independence be productive of much good when the party happen to be right and of quite as much evil when they happen to be wrong it be ever the wisest as indeed it be the noblest course to defer to that which be just with a perfect reliance on its be the course point out by the finger of infallible wisdom and truth he who do this need feel no concern for he dignity or for he success be certain that it be intend that right shall prevail in the end as prevail it will and do but both we shipmaster be too much excite to feel the force of these truth and there they stand sternly regard each other as if it be they purpose to commence a new struggle for the possession of the leviathan of the deep captain daggett say roswell sharply you be too old a whaler not to know whaling law my iron be first in this fish i never have be loose from it since it be first strike and my lance kill it under such circumstance sir i be surprise that any man who know the usage among whaler should have stick by the creature as you have do it be in my natur ' gar ` ner be the answer i stick by you when you be dismast under hattera and i stick by everything that i undertake this be what i call vineyard natur ' and i be not about to discredit my native country this be idle talk return roswell cast a severe glance at the man in the vineyard boat among whom a common smile arise as if they highly approve of the reply of they own officer you very well know that vineyard law can not settle such a question but american law be you man enough to take this whale from I as i trust you be not on we return home you could be and would be make to pay smartly for the act uncle sam have a long arm with which he sometimes reach round the whole earth before you proceed any further in this matter it may be well to remember that daggett reflect and it be probable that as he cool off from the excitement create by he late exertion he fully recognize the justice of the other 's remark and the injustice of he own claim still it seem to he un-american un-vineyard if the reader please to give up and he cling to he error with as much pertinacity as if he have be right if you be fast i be fast too i be not so certain of you law when a man put a iron into a whale commonly it be he fish if he can get he and kill he but there be a law above all whaler ' law and that be the law of divine providence providence have fasten we to this crittur ' as if on purpose to give we a right in it and i be by no means so sure state ' law will not uphold that doctrine then i lose my own whale by means of this and be entitle to some compensation for such a loss you lose you own whale because he lead round the head of mine and not only draw he own iron but come nigh cause I to cut if any one be entitle to damage for such a act it be i who have be put to extra trouble in get my fish i do believe it be my lance that do the job for the fellow i dart and you strike in that way i get the start of you and may claim to have make the crittur ' spout the first blood but hearkee gar ` ner -- there be my hand -- we have be friend so far and i want to hold out friend i will make you a proposal therefore join stock from this moment and whale and seal and do all thing else in common when we make a final stowage for the return passage we can make a final division and each man take he share of the common adventure to do roswell justice he see through the artifice of this proposition the instant it be utter it have the effect notwithstanding a good deal to mollify he feeling since it induce he to believe that daggett be manoeuvre to get at he great secret rather than to assail he rights you be part owner of you schooner captain daggett we hero answer while i have no other interest in mine than my lay as she master you may have authority to make such a bargain but i have none it be my duty to fill the craft as fast and as full as i can and carry she back safely to deacon pratt but i dare say you vineyard people will let you cruise about the earth at you pleasure trust to providence for a profit i can not accept you offer this be answer like a man gar ` ner and i like you all the better for it forty or fifty barrel of ile sha not break friendship between we i help you into port at beaufort and give up the salvage and now i 'll help tow you whale alongside and see you fairly through this business too perhaps i shall have all the better luck for be a little generous there be prudence as well as art in this decision of daggett 's notwithstanding he ingenious pretension to a claim in the whale he know perfectly well that no law would sustain it and that in addition to the chance of be beat on the spot which be at least equal he would certainly be beat in the court at home should he really attempt to carry out he declare design then he really defer to the expectation that he future good fortune might be influence by he present forbearance superstition form a material part of a sailor 's nature if indeed it do not that of every man engage in hazardous and uncertain adventure how far he hope be justify in this last respect will appear in the contents of a communication that deacon pratt receive from the master of he schooner and to which we will now refer as the clearest and briefest mode of continue the narrative the sea lion leave oyster pond late in September it be the third day of march in the succeed year that mary be stand at a window gaze with melancholy interest at that point in the adjacent water where last she have see nearly six month before the vessel of roswell disappear behind the wood of the island that bear he family name there have be a long easterly gale but the weather have change the south wind blow softly and all the indication of a early spring be visible for the first time in three month she have raise the sash of that window and the air that enter be bland and savor of the approach season i dare say uncle -- the deacon be write near a very low wood-fire which be scarcely more than ember -- i dare say uncle say the sweet voice of mary which be a little tremulous with feeling that the ocean be calm enough to-day it be very silly in we to tremble when there be a storm for those who must now be so many many thousand mile away what be the distance between the antarctic sea and oyster pond i wonder you ought to be able to calculate that yourself gal or what be the use to pay for you schooling i should not know how to set about it uncle return the gentle mary though i should be very glad to know how many mile be there in a degree of latitude child you know that i believe more than sixty-nine sir well in what latitude be oyster pond i have hear roswell say that we be a little higher as he call it than forty-one well 41 time 69 -- figure as he speak -- make 2829 say we be 3000 mile from the equator the nearest way we can get there then the antarctic circle commence in 23 ° 30 ' south which deduct from 90 degree leave just 66 ° 30 ' between the equator and the nearest spot within the sea you have mention now 66 ° 30 ' give about 4589 statute mile more in a straight line allow only 69 to a degree the two sum add together make 7589 mile or rather more but the road be not straight by any means as shipmaster tell I and i suppose gar ` ner must have go at the very least 8000 mile to reach he latitude to say nothing of a considerable distance of longitude to travel over to the southward of cape horn it be a terrible distance to have a friend from we ejaculate mary though in a low dejected tone it be a terrible distance for a man to trust he property away from he gal and i do not sleep a-night for thinking of it when i remember where my own schooner may be all this time ah here be bait joe and with a letter in he hand uncle i do declare it might be a secret hope that impel mary for away she bound like a young fawn run to meet the old fisherman at the door no sooner do she eye fall on the superscription than the large package be press to she heart and she seem for a instant lose in thanksgive that no one might unnecessarily be a witness of what pass between she uncle and herself joe be direct to the kitchen where a good meal a glass of rum and water and the quarter of a dollar that mary give he as she show the way satisfy he with the result of he trouble here it be uncle cry the nearly breathless girl reenter the ` keeping-room ' and unconsciously hold the letter still press to she heart -- a letter -- a letter from roswell in he own precious hand a flood of tear give some relief to feeling that have so long be pent and ease a heart that have be compress nearly to break at any other time and at this unequivocal evidence of the hold the young man have on the affection of he niece deacon pratt would have remonstrate with she on the folly of refuse to become roswell gar ` ner 's wife but the sight of the letter drive all other thought from he head concentrate he whole be in the fate of the schooner look and see if it have the antarctic post-mark on it mary say the deacon in a tremulous voice this request be not make so much in ignorance as in trepidation the deacon very well know that the island the sea lion be to visit be uninhabited and be destitute of post-office but he idea be confuse and apprehension render he silly uncle exclaim the niece wipe the tear from a face that be now rosy with blush at she own weakness surely roswell can find no post-office where he be but the letter must have some post-mark child bait joe have not bring it himself into the country it be post-marked ` new york ' sir and nothing else -- yes here be ` forward by cane sprigg and button rio de janeiro ' it must have be put into a post-office there rio -- here be more salvage gal -- more salvage come to afflict I but you have no salvage to pay uncle on the other occasion perhaps there will be none to pay on this have i not better open the letter at once and see what have happen yes open it child answer the deacon in a voice so feeble as to be scarcely audible -- open it at once as you say and let I know my fate anything be better than this torment mary do not wait for a second permission but instantly break the seal it might have be the result of education or there may be such a thing as female instinct in these matter but certain it be that the girl turn towards the window as she tear the paper asunder and slip the letter that bear she own name into a fold of she dress so dexterously that one far more keen-sighted than she uncle would not have detect the act no sooner be she own letter thus secure than the niece offer the principal epistle to she uncle read it yourself mary say the last in he querulous tone my eye be so dim that i could not see to read it rio di janeiro province of brazil south america nov 14th 1819 commence the niece rio di janeiro interrupt the uncle why that be round cape horn be not it mary certainly not sir brazil be on the east side of the ande and rio di janeiro be its capital the king of portugal life there now and have live there as long as i can remember yes yes i have forget the brazil bank where we whaler go be in the atlantic but what can have take gar ` ner into rio unless it be to spend more money by read the letter sir we shall soon know i see there be something about spermaceti oil here ile and spalm ile do you say exclaim the deacon brighten up at once -- read on mary my good gal -- read the letter as fast as you can -- read it at a trot deacon israel pratt -- dear sir continue mary in obedience to this command the two schooner sail from beaufort north carolina as state already per mail in a letter write at that port and which have doubtless come to hand we have fine weather and a tolerable run of it until we reach the calm latitudes where we be detain by the usual change for about a week on the 18th oct the pleasant cry of ` there she spout ' be hear aboard here and we find ourselves in the neighborhood of whale both schooner lower they boat and i be soon fast to a fine bull who give we a long tow before the lance be put into he and he be make to spout blood captain daggett set up some claim to this fish in consequence of he line 's get foul of the creature 's jaw but he change he mind in good season and clap on to help tow the whale down to the vessel he iron draw from a young bull and a good deal of dissatisfaction exist among the other crew until fortunately the school of young bull come round quite near we when captain daggett and he people succeed in secure no less than three of the fish and mr hazard get a very fine one for we i be happy to say that we have very pleasant weather to cut in and secure every gallon of the oil of both we whale as do captain daggett all of he we largest bull make one hundred and nineteen barrel of which forty-three barrel be head-matter i never see better case and junk in a whale in my life the smallest bull turn out well too make fifty-eight barrel of which twenty-one be head daggett get one hundred and thirty-three barrel from he three fish a very fair proportion of head though not as large as we own have this oil on board we come in here after a pleasant run and i have ship as per invoice enclose one hundred and seventy-seven barrel of spermaceti oil viz sixty-four barrel of head and rest in body-oil to you order care of fish & grinnell new york by the brig jason captain william who will sail for home about the 20th proximo and to whom i trust this letter -- stop mary my dear -- this news be overpower -- it be almost too good to be true interrupted the deacon nearly as much unmanned by this intelligence of he good fortune as he have previously be by he apprehension yes it do seem too good to be true read it again child yes read every syllable of it again mary comply delighted enough to hear all she could of roswell 's success why uncle say the deeply-interested girl all this oil be spermaceti it be worth a great deal more than so much of that which come of the right whale more ay nearly as three for one hunt I up the last spectator girl -- hunt I up the last spectator and let I see at once at what they quote spalm mary soon find the journal and hand it to she uncle yes here it be and quote $ 112-1\/2 per gallon as i live that be nine shilling a gallon mary -- just calculate on that bit of paper -- thirty time one hundred and seventy-seven mary how much be that child i make it 5310 uncle -- yes that be right but what be the 30 time for sir gallon gal gallon each barrel have 30 gallon in it if not more there ought to be 32 by rights but this be a cheating age now multiply 5310 by 9 and see what that come to just 47790 sir as near as i can get it yes that be the shilling now divide 47790 by 8 my dear be actyve mary be actyve it leave 5973 with a remainder of 6 sir i believe i be right i dare say you be child yes i dare say you be this be the dollar a body may call they $ 6000 as the barrel will a little overrun the 30 gallon my share of this will be two-third and that will nett the handsome sum of say $ 4000 the deacon rub he hand with delight and have find he voice again he niece be astonish at hear he utter what he have to say with a sort of glee that sound in she ear as very unnatural come from he so it be however and she dutifully endeavor not to think of it four thousand dollar mary will quite cover the first cost of the schooner that be without include outfit and spare-rigging of which she master take about twice as much as be necessary he be a capital fellow be that young gar ` ner and will make a excellent husband as i have always tell you child a little wasteful perhaps but a excellent youth at the bottom i dare say he lose he spar off cape hattera in try to outsail that daggett but i overlook all that now he be a capital youth to work upon a whale or a sea-elephant there be not he equal as i 'll engage in all ameriky if you 'll only let he know where to find the creatur 's i know he character before i engage he for no man but a real skinner shall ever command a craft of mine roswell _ be _ a good fellow answer mary with emphasis the tear fill she eye as she listen to these eulogium of she uncle on the youth she love with all of a woman 's tenderness at the very moment she scruple to place she happiness on one whose ` god be not she god ' no one know he better than i uncle and no one respect he more but have i not better read the rest of he letter -- there be a good deal more of it go on child go on -- but read the part over again where he speak of the quantity of the ile he have ship to fish & grinnell mary do as request when she proceed to read aloud the rest of the communication i have be much at a loss how to act in regard to captain daggett say roswell in he letter he stand by I so manfully and generously off cape hattera that i do not like to part company in the night or in a squall which would have seem ungrateful as well as wear a sort of runaway look i be afraid he have some knowledge of the existence of we island though i doubt whether he have they latitude and longitude exactly something there be of this nature on board the other schooner she people often drop hint to my officer and man when they have be gam i have sometimes fancy daggett stick so close to we that he may get the advantage of we reckoning to help he to what he want to find he be no great navigator anywhere run more by sign and current in my judgment than by the use of he instrument still he could find he way to any part of the world stop there mary stop a little and let I have time to consider be not it awful child the niece change color and seem really frighten so catch be the deacon 's distress though she scarce know what be the matter what be awful uncle at length she ask anxious to know the worst this covetousness in they vineyarder i consider it both awful and wicked i must get the rev mr whittle to preach against the sin of covetousness it do gain so much ground in ameriky the whole church should lift its voice against it or it will shortly lift its voice against the church to think of they daggett ' fitting out a schooner to follow my craft about the ` arth in this unheard-of manner just as if she be a pilot-boat and young gar ` ner a pilot i do hope the fellow will make a wrack of it among the ice of the antarctic sea that would be a fit punishment for they impudence and covetousness i suppose sir they think that they have the same right to sail on the ocean that other have seal and whale be the gift of god and one person have no more right to they than another you forget mary that one man may have a secret that another do not know in that case he ought not to go prying about like a old woman in a village neighborhood read on child read on and let I know the worst at once i shall sail to-morrow have finish all my business here and hope to be off cape horn in twenty day if not sooner in what manner i be to get rid of daggett i do not yet know he outsail I a little on all tack unless it be in very heavy weather when i have a trifling advantage over he it will be in my power to quit he any dark night but if i let he go ahead and he should really have any right notion about the position of the island he might get there first and make havoc among the seal awful awful interrupted the deacon again that would be the worst of all i will not allow it i forbid it -- it shall not be alas uncle poor roswell be too far from we now to hear these word no doubt the matter be long since decide and he have act accord to the best of he judgment it be terrible to have one 's property so far away government ought to have steam-boat or packet of some sort run between new york and gape horn to carry order back and forth -- but we shall never have thing right mary so long as the democrat be uppermost by this remark which savor very strongly of a species of censure that be much in fashion in the coterie of that great emporium which it be the taste and pleasure of its people to term a _ commercial _ emporium especially among elderly lady the reader will at once perceive that the deacon be a federalist which be somewhat of a novelty in suffolk thirty year since have he live down to we own time the old man would probably have make all the gyration in politics that have distinguish the school to which he would have belong and without he own knowledge most probably would have be as near a example of perpetual motion as the world will ever see through he devotion to what be now call whig principle we be no great politician but time have give we the means of compare and we often smile when we hear the disciple of hamilton and of adam and of all that high-toned school declaim against the use of the veto and talking of the one man power and of congress ' lead the government the deacon be very apt to throw the opprobrium of even a bad season on the administration and the reader have see what he think of the subject of run packet between new york and cape horn there ought to be a large navy mary a monstrous navy so that the vessel might be keep carry letter about and serve the public but we shall never have thing right until rufus king or some man like he get in if gar ` ner let that daggett get the start of he he never need come home again the island be as much mine as if i have buy they and i be not sure a action would not lie for seal take on they without my consent yes yes we want a monstrous navy to convoy sealer and carry letter about and keep some folk at home while it let other folk go about they lawful business of what island be you speak uncle surely the seal island where roswell have go be public and uninhabited and no one have a better right there than another the deacon perceive that he have go too far in he tribulation and begin to have a faint notion that he be make a fool of himself he ask he niece in a very faint voice therefore to hand he the letter the remainder of which he would endeavor to read himself although every word that roswell gardiner write be very precious to mary the gentle girl have a still unopened epistle to herself to peruse and glad enough be she to make the exchange hand the deacon he letter therefore she withdraw at once to she private room in order to read she own dearest mary say roswell gardiner in this epistle you uncle will tell you what have bring we into this port and all thing connect with the schooner i have send home more than $ 4000 worth of oil and i hope my owner will forgive the accident off currituck on account of this run of good luck in my opinion we shall yet make a voyage and that part of my fortune will be secure would that i could feel as sure of find you more disposed to be kind to I on my return i read in you bible every day mary and i often pray to god to enlighten my mind if my view have be wrong as yet i can not flatter myself with any change for my old opinion appear rather to be more firmly root than they be before i sail here poor mary heave a heavy sigh and wipe the tear from she eye she be pained to a degree she could hardly believe possible though she do full credit to roswell 's frankness like all devout person she faith in the efficacy of sacred writ be strong : and she so much the more lament she suitor 's continued blindness because it remain after light have shine upon it still mary the letter add as i have every human inducement to endeavor to be right i shall not throw aside the book by any means in that i fully believe we difference be in what the volume teach pray for I sweetest girl -- but i know you do and will continue to do as long as i be absent yes indeed roswell murmur mary -- as long as you and i live next to this one great concern of my life come that which this man daggett give I -- the letter go on to say i hardly know what to do under all the circumstance keep in he company much longer i can not without violate my duty to the deacon yet it be not easy in any sense to get rid of he he have stand by I so manfully on all occasion and seem so much disposed to make good-fellowship of the voyage that do it depend on myself only i should at once make a bargain with he to seal in company and to divide the spoil but this be now impossible and i must quit he in some way or other he outsail I in most weather and it be a thing easier say than do what will make it more difficult be the grow shortness of the night the day lengthen fast now and as we go south they will become so much longer that by the time when it will be indispensable to separate it will be nearly all day the thing must be do however and i trust to luck to be able to do it as it ought to be effect and now dearest dearest mary -- but why should we lift the veil from the feeling of this young man who conclude he letter by pour out he whole heart in a few sincere and manly sentence mary weep over they most of that day peruse and reperus they until she eye would scarce perform they proper office a few day later the deacon be make a very happy man by the receipt of a letter from fish & grinnell notify he of the arrival of he oil accompany by a most gratifying account of the state of the market and ask for instruction the oil be dispose of and the deacon pocket he portion of the proceeds as soon as possible eagerly look for a new and profitable investment for the avail great be the reputation roswell gardiner make by this capture of the two spermaceti whale and by send the proceeds to so good a market in commerce as in war success be all in all though in both success be nearly as often the result of unforeseen circumstance as of calculation and wisdom it be true there be a sort of trade and a sort of war in which prudence and care may effect a great deal yet be both often outstrip by the random exertion and adventure of those who calculate almost as wildly as they act audacity as the french term it be a great quality in war and often achieve more than the most calculated wisdom -- nay it become wisdom in that sort of struggle and we be far from be sure that audacity be not sometimes as potent in trade at all event it be esteem a bold as well as a prosperous exploit for a little schooner like the sea lion of oyster pond to take a hundred-barrel whale and to send home its ile as the deacon always pronounce the word in common with most other in old suffolk long and anxious month with one exception succeed this bright spot of sunshine in mary pratt 's solicitude in behalf of the absent roswell she know there be but little chance of hearing from he again until he return north the exception be a short letter that the deacon receive dated two week later than that write from rio in latitude forty-one or just as far south of the equator as oyster pond be north of it and nearly fourteen hundred mile to the southward of rio this letter be write in great haste to send home by a pacific trader who be accidentally meet nearer the coast than be usual for such vessel to be it state that all be well that the schooner of daggett be still in company and that gardiner intend to get shut of she as the deacon express it on the very first occasion after the receipt of this letter the third write by roswell gardiner since he leave home a long and blank interval of silence succeed then it be that month pass away in a anxious and dark uncertainty spring follow winter summer succeed to spring and autumn come to reap the fruit of all the previous season without bring any further tiding from the adventurer then winter make its second appearance since the sea lion have sail fill the mind of the mariner ' friend with sad foreboding as they listen to the meaning of the gale that accompany that bleak and stormy quarter of the year deep and painful be the anticipation of the deacon in whom fail health and a near approach to the last of earth come to increase the gloom as for mary youth and health sustain she but she very soul be heavy as she ponder on so long and uncertain a absence chapter xiii safely in harbor be the king 's ship in the deep nook where once thou calledst I up at midnight to fetch dew from the still vex would bermoothe there she be hide _ tempest _ the letter of roswell gardiner last receive bear the date of December 10th 1819 or just a fortnight after he have sail from rio de janeiro we shall next present the schooner of deacon pratt to the reader on the 18th of that month or three week and one day after she have sail from the capital of brazil early in the morning of the day last mention the sea lion of oyster pond be visible standing to the northward with the wind light but freshen from the westward and in smooth water land be not only in sight but be quite near less than a league distant towards this land the head of the schooner have be lay and she be approach it at the rate of some four or five knot the land be break high of a most sterile aspect where it be actually to be see and nearly all cover with a light but melting snow though the season be advance to the middle of the first month in summer the weather be not very cold however and there be a feeling about it that promise it would become still milder the aspect of the neighbouring land so barren rugged and inhospitable chill the feeling and give to the scene a sombre hue which the weather itself might not have impart directly ahead of the schooner rise a sort of pyramid of broken rock which occupy a small island stand isolate in a measure and some distance in advance of other and equally ragged range of mountain which belong also to island detach from the main land thousand of year before under some violent convulsion of nature it be quite apparent that all on board the schooner regard that ragged pyramid with lively interest most of the crew be collect on the forecastle include the officer and all eye be fasten on the ragged pyramid which they be diagonally approach the principal spokesman be stimson the oldest mariner on board and one who have oftener visit those sea than any other of the crew you know the spot do you stephen demand roswell gardiner with interest yes sir there be no mistake that be the horn eleven time have i double it and this be the third time that i have be so close in as to get a fair sight of it once i go inside as i have tell you sir i have double it six time myself say gardiner but never see it before most navigator give it a wide berth ` tis say to be the stormiest spot on the known earth that be a mistake you may depend on ' t sir the sow-wester blow great gun here-abouts it be true enough and when they do sich a sea come tumble in on that rock as man never seed anywhere else perhaps but on the whull i would rather be close in here than two hundred mile further to the southward with the wind at sow-west and heavy a better slant might be make from the southern position but here i know where i be and i would go in and anchor and wait for the gale to blow itself out talking of sea captain gar ` ner observe hazard do not you think sir we begin to feel the swell of the pacific smooth as the surface of the water be here be a ground-swell rolling in that must be twelve or fifteen foot in height there be no doubt of that we have feel the swell of the pacific these two hour no man can mistake _ that _ the atlantic have no such wave this be a ocean in reality and this be its stormiest part the wind freshen and haul and i be afraid we be about to be catch close in here with a regular sow-west gale let it come sir let it come put in stimson again if it do we have only to run in and anchor i can stand pilot and i promise to carry the schooner where twenty sow-wester will do she no harm what i have see do once i know can be do again the time will come when the horn will be a reg ` lar harbor roswell leave the forecastle and walk aft ponder on what have just be say he situation be delicate and demand decision as well as prudence the manner in which daggett have stick by he ever since the two vessel take they departure from block island be know to the reader the sea lion have sail from rio in company and they have actually make staten land together the day precede that on which we now bring the oyster pond craft once more upon the scene and have close so near as to admit of a conversation between the two master it would seem that daggett be exceedingly averse to pass through the strait of le maire a uncle of he have be wreck there and have report the passage as the most dangerous one he have ever encounter it have its difficulty no doubt in certain state of the wind and tide but roswell have receive good account of the place from stimson who have be through several time the wind be rather scant to go through and the weather threaten to be thick as daggett urge he reason for keep off and pass outside of staten land a circuit of considerable extent besides bring a vessel far to leeward with the prevalent wind of that region which usually blow from northwest round to southwest roswell be reflect on the opportunity the circumstance afford of give he consort the slip after discuss the matter for some time he desire daggett to lead on and he would follow this be do though neither schooner be keep off until roswell get a good view of cape st diego on tierra del fuego thereby enable he to judge of the position of the principal land-mark without commit himself by any promise therefore he tell daggett to lead on and for some time he follow the course be one that do not take he much out of the way the weather be misty and at time the wind blow in squall the last increase as the schooner draw nearer to staten land daggett be about half a mile ahead feel the full power of one particular squall that come out of the ravine with greater force than common and he keep away to increase he distance from the land at the same time the mist shut in the vessel from each other it be also past sunset and a dark and dreary night be approach this latter fact have be one of daggett 's argument for go outside profit by all these circumstance roswell tack and stand over towards tierra del fuego he know from the smoothness of the water that a ebb-tide be run and trust to its force to carry he through the strait he see no more of the sea lion of the vineyard she continue shut in by the mist until night close around both vessel when he get about mid-channel roswell tack again by this time the current have suck he fairly into the passage and no sooner do he go about than he movement to the southward be very rapid the squall give some trouble but on the whole he do very well next morning he be off cape horn as describe by this expression it be generally understand that a vessel be somewhere near the longitude of that world-renowned cape but not necessarily in sight of it few navigator actually see the extremity of the american continent though they double the cape it be usually deem the safest to pass well to the southward such be daggett 's position who in consequence of have go outside of staten land be now necessarily a long distance to leeward and who could not hope to beat up abreast of the hermit even do the wind and sea favor he in less than twenty-four hour a great advantage be obtain by come through the strait of le maire and roswell feel very certain that he should not see he late consort again that day even do he heave-to for he but we hero have no idea of do any thing of the sort have shake off he leech he have no wish to suffer it to fasten to he again it be solely with the intention of make sure of this object that he think of make a harbor in order that the reader may better understand those incident of we narrative which we be about to relate it may be well to say a word of the geographical feature of the region to which he have be transport in fiction if not in fact at the southern extremity of the american continent be a cluster of island which be dark sterile rocky and most of the year cover with snow evergreen relieve the aspect of sterility in place that be a little sheltered and there be a meager vegetation in spot that serve to sustain animal life the first strait which separate this cluster of island from the main be that of magellan through which vessel occasionally pass in preference to go farther south then come tierra del fuego which be much the largest of all the island to the southward of tierra del fuego lie a cluster of many small island which bear different name though the group farthest south of all and which it be usual to consider as the southern termination of we noble continent but which be not on a continent at all be know by the appropriate appellation of the hermit if solitude and desolation and want and a contemplation of some of the sublimest feature of this earth can render a spot fit for a hermitage these island be very judiciously name the one that be farthest south contain the cape itself which be mark by the ragged pyramid of rock already mention place there by nature a never-tiring sentinel of the war of the element behind this cluster of the hermit it be that stimson advise he officer to take refuge against the approach gale of which the sign be now become obvious and certain roswell 's motive however for listen to such advice be less to find a shelter for he schooner than to get rid of daggett for the gale he care but little since he be a long way from the ice and could stretch off the land to the southward into a waste of water that seem interminable there be island to the southward of cape horn and a good many of they too though none very near it be now know also by means of the toil and courage of various seaman include those of the persevere and laborious wilke the most industrious and the least reward of all the navigator who have ever work for the human race in this dangerous and exhausting occupation that a continent be there also but at the period of which we be write the existence of the shetland and palmer 's land be the extent of the later discovery in that part of the ocean after pacing the quarter-deck a few minute when he quit the forecastle as mention roswell gardiner again go forward among the man you be quite sure that this high peak be the horn stimson he observe inquiringly sartain of it sir there be no mistaking sich a place which once see be never forget it agree with the chart and we reckoning and i may say it agree with we eye also here be the pacific ocean plain enough mr hazard so i think sir we be at the end of ameriky if it _ have _ a end anywhere this heavy long swell be a old acquaintance though i never be in close enough to see the land hereabouts before it be fortunate we have one trusty hand on board who can stand pilot stimson i intend to go in and anchor and i shall trust to you to carry I into a snug berth i 'll do it captain gar ` ner if the weather will permit it return the seaman with a unpretending sort of confidence that speak well for he ability preparation be now commence in earnest to come to it be time that some steady course should be adopt as the wind be get up and the schooner be rapidly approach the land in half a hour the sea lion be bend to a little gale with she canvass reduce to close-reefed mainsail and foresail and the bonnet off she jib the sea be fast get up though it come in long and mountain-like roswell dread the mist could he pass through the narrow channel that stimson have describe to he with a clear sky one half of he cause of anxiety would be remove but the wind be not a clear one and he feel that no time be to be lose it require great nerve to approach a coast like that of cape horn in such weather as the schooner get nearer to the real cape the sight of the sea tumble in and break on its ragged rock and the hollow roar sound they make actually become terrific to add to the awe inspire in the breast of even the most callous-minded man on board come a doubt whether the schooner could weather a certain point of rock the western extremity of the island after she have get so far into a bight as to render ware questionable if not impossible every one now look grave and anxious should the schooner go ashore in such a place a single minute would suffice to break she to piece and riot a soul could expect to be save roswell be exceedingly anxious though he remain cool the tide and eddy about these rock and in so high a latitude sweep a vessel like chip he say to he chief mate we have be set in here by a eddy and a terrible place it be all depend on we gear hold on sir be the answer with a little on providence just watch the point ahead captain gar ` ner though we be not actually to leeward of it see with what a drift we have draw upon it the manner in which these sea roll in from the sow-west be terrific no craft can go to windward against they this remark of hazard 's be very just the sea that come down upon the cape resemble a rolling prairie in they outline a single wave would extend a quarter of a mile from trough to trough and as it pass beneath the schooner lift she high in the air it really seem as if the glancing water would sweep she away in its force but human art have find the means to counteract even this impose display of the power of nature the little schooner ride over the billow like a duck and when she sink between two of they it be merely to rise again on a new summit and breast the gale gallantly it be the current that menace the greatest danger for that unseen except in its fruit be clearly set the little craft to leeward and bodily towards the rock by this time we adventurer be so near the land that they almost give up hope itself cape hattera and its much-talked-of danger seem a place of refuge compare to that in which we navigator now find themselves could the deepest bellowing of ten thousand bull be unite in a common roar the noise would not have equal that of the hollow sound which issue from a sea as it go into some cavern of the rock then the spray fill the air like driving rain and there be minute when the cape though so frightfully near be hide from view by the vapor at this precise moment the sea lion be less than a quarter of a mile to windward of the point she be struggle to weather and towards which she be drive under a treble impetus that of the wind act on she sail and press she ahead at the rate of fully five knot for the craft be keep a rap full that of the eddy or current and that of the roll water no man speak for each person feel that the crisis be one in which silence be a sort of homage to the deity some pray privately and all gaze on the low rocky point that it be indispensable to pass to avoid destruction there be one favourable circumstance the water be know to be deep quite close to the iron-bound coast and it be seldom that any danger exist that it be not visible to the eye this roswell know from stimson 's account as well as from those of other mariner and he see that the fact be of the last importance to he should he be able to weather the point ahead that which terminate at the mouth of the passage that lead within the hermit it be now certain it could be do only by go fearfully near the rock roswell gardiner take he station between the knight-head beckon to stimson to come near he at the same time hazard himself go to the helm do you remember this place ask the young master of the old seaman this be the spot sir and if we can round the rocky point ahead i will take you to a safe anchorage we drift be awful or we be in a eddy tide here sir it be the eddy answer roswell calmly though we drift be not trifling this be get frightfully near to that point hold on sir -- it be we only chance -- hold on and we may rub and go if we _ rub _ we be lose that be certain enough should we get by _ this _ first point there be another a short distance beyond it which must certainly fetch we up i fear see -- it open more as we draw ahead stimson see the new danger and fully appreciate it he do not speak however for to own the truth he now abandon all hope and be a piously inclined person he be privately address himself to god every man on board be fully aware of the character of this new danger and all seem to forget that of the nearest point of rock towards which they be now wade with portentous speed that point _ might _ be pass there be a little hope there but as to the point a quarter of a mile beyond with the leeward set of the schooner the most ignorant hand on board see how unlikely it be that they should get by it a impose silence prevail in the schooner as she come abreast of the first rock it be about fifty fathom under the lee bow and as to _ that _ spot all depend on the distance outward that the danger thrust themselves this it be impossible to see amid the chaos of water produce by the collision between the wave and the land roswell fasten he eye on object ahead to note the rate of he leeward set and with a seaman 's quickness he note the first change she feel the under-tow stephen he say in a voice so compress as to seem to come out of the depths of he chest and be breast up to windward what mean that sudden luff sir mr hazard must keep a good full or we shall have no chance gardiner look aft and see that the mate be bear the helm well up as if he meet with much resistance the truth then flash upon he and he shout out -- all 's well boy god be praise we have catch the ebb-tide under we lee-bow these few word explain the reason of the change instead of set to leeward the schooner be now meet a powerful tide of some four or five knot which hawse she up to windward with irresistible force as if conscious of the danger she be in the tight little craft recede from the rock as she shoot ahead and round that second point which a minute before have appear to be place there purposely to destroy she it be handsomely double at the safe distance of a hundred fathom roswell believe he might now beat he schooner off the land far enough to double the cape altogether could he but keep she in that current it doubtless expend itself however a short distance in the offing as its water diffuse themselves on the breast of the ocean and it be this diffusion of the element that produce the eddy which have prove so nearly fatal in ten minute after strike the tide the schooner open the passage fairly and be keep away to enter it notwithstanding it blow so heavily the rate of sailing by the land do not exceed five knot this be owe to the great strength of the tide which sometimes rise and fall thirty foot in high latitudes and narrow water stimson now show he be a man to be rely on con the craft intelligently he take she in behind the island on which the cape stand luff she up into a tiny cove and make a cast of the lead there be fifty fathom of water with a bottom of mud with the certainty that there be enough of the element to keep he clear of the ground at low water and that he anchor would hold roswell make a fly moor and veer out enough cable to render he vessel secure here then be the sea lion of oyster pond that craft which the reader have see lie at deacon pratt 's wharf only three short month before safely anchor in a nook of the rock behind cape horn no navigator but a sealer would have dream of carry he vessel into such a place but it be a part of they call to poke about in channel and passage where no one else have ever be it be in this way that stimson have learn to know where to find he present anchorage the berth of the schooner be perfectly snug and entirely land-locked the tremendous swell that be roll in on the outside cause the water to rise and fall a little within the passage but there be no strain upon the cable in consequence neither do the rapid tide affect the craft which lay in a eddy that merely keep she steady the gale come howl over the hermit but be so much break by the rock as to do little more than whistle through the cordage and spar aloft three day and as many night do the gale from the south-west continue the fourth day there be a change the wind come from the eastward roswell would now have go out have it not be for the apprehension of fall in with daggett again have at length get rid of that pertinacious companion it would have be a act of great weakness to throw himself blindly in he way once more it be possible that daggett might not suppose he have be leave intentionally in which case he would be very apt to look for he lose consort in the vicinity of the cape as for the gale it might or it might not have blow he to leeward a good deal would depend on the current and he distance to the southward near the land gardiner believe the current favor a vessel double it go west and if daggett be also aware of this fact it might induce he to keep as near the spot as possible time be very precious to we sealer the season be so short in the high latitudes still they be a little in advance of they calculation have get off the horn fully ten day sooner than they have hope to be there nearly the whole summer be before they and there be the possibility of they even be too soon for the loosening of the ice further south the wind be the strongest inducement to go out for the point to which we adventurer be bind lay a considerable distance to the westward and fair breeze be not to be neglect under all the circumstance however it be decide to remain within the passage one day longer and this so much the more because hazard have discover some sign of sea-elephant frequent a island at no great distance the boat be lower accordingly and the mate go in one direction while the master pull up to the rock and land on the hermit or the island which should bear that name _ par excellence _ be that in which the group terminate take stimson with he to carry a glass and arm with a old lance as a pike-pole to aid he effort roswell gardiner now commence the ascent of the pyramid already mention it be ragged and offer a thousand obstacle but none that vigor and resolution could not overcome after a few minute of violent exertion and by help each other in difficult place both roswell and stimson succeed in place themselves on the summit of the elevation which be a irregular peak the height be considerable and give a extended view of the adjacent island as well as of the gloomy and menacing ocean to the southward the earth probably do not contain a more remarkable sentinel than this pyramid on which we hero have now take he station there it stand actually the ultima thule of this vast continent or what be much the same so closely unite to it as to seem a part of we own moiety of the globe look out on the broad expanse of water the eye see to the right the pacific in front be the southern or antarctic ocean and to the left be the great atlantic for several minute both roswell and stephen sit mute gaze on this grand spectacle by turn they face north they behold the high land of terra del fuego of which many of the highest peak be cover with snow the pyramid on which they be however be no longer white with the congealed rain but stand stern and impose in its native brown the outline of all the rock and the shore of the different island have a appearance of volcanic origin though the rock themselves tell a somewhat different story the last be principally of trap formation cape pigeon gull petrel and albatross be wheeling about in the air while the roller that still come in on this noble sea-wall be really terrific distant thunder want the hollow bellow sound that these wave make when bring in contact with the shore roswell fancy that it be like a groan of the mighty pacific at find its progress suddenly check the spray continue to fly and much of the time the air below he elevated seat be fill with vapor as soon as we young master have take in the grander feature of this magnificent view he eye seek the sea lion of martha 's vineyard there she be sure enough at a distance of only a couple of league and apparently stand directly for the cape could it be possible that daggett suspect he maneuver and be come in search of he at the precise spot in which he have take shelter as respects the vessel there be no question as to she character from the elevation at which he be place roswell aid by the glass have no difficulty in make she out and in recognize she rig form and character stimson also examine she and know she to be the schooner on that vast and desolate sea she resemble a speck but the art of man have enable those she hold to guide she safely through the tempest and bring she up to she goal in a time that really seem miraculous for the circumstance if we have think of it captain gar ` ner say stephen we might have bring up a ensign and set it on these rock by way of let the vineyarder know where we be to be find but we can always go out and meet they should this wind stand which be just what i have no intention of do stephen i come in here on purpose to get rid of that schooner you surprise I sir a consort be no bad thing when a craft be a-sealin ' in a high latitude the ice make such ticklish time that for I i be always glad to know there be such a chance for take a fellow off should there happen to be a wreck all that be very true but there be reason which may tell against it i have hear of some island where seal abound and a consort be not quite so necessary to take they as when one be wreck that alter the case captain gar ` ner nobody be oblige to tell of he seal station i be aboard one of the very first craft that find out that the south shetland be a famous place for seal and no one among we think it necessary to tell it to all the world some man be weak enough to put sich discovery in the newspaper but for my part i think it quite enough to put they in the log that schooner must have the current with she she come down so fast she ` ii be abreast of the horn in half a hour longer stephen we will wait and see what she would be at gardiner 's prediction be true in half a hour the sea lion of holme ' hole glide past the rocky pyramid of the horn distant from it less than a mile have it be the object of she commander to pass into the pacific he might have do so with great apparent ease even with a south-west wind that which blow fully half the time in those sea it would have be in he power to lay past the island and soon get before it a north-east course with a little offing will clear the island and when a vessel get as far north as the main land it would take she off the coast but daggett have no intention of do anything of the sort he be look for he consort which he have hope to find somewhere near the cape disappoint in this expectation after stand far enough west to make certain nothing be in sight in that quarter he haul up on a easy bowline and stand to the southward roswell be right glad to see this inasmuch as it denote ignorance of the position of the island he seek they lay much farther to the westward and no sooner be he sure of the course steer by the other schooner than he hasten down to the boat in order to get he own vessel under way to profit by the breeze two hour later the sea lion of oyster pond glance through the passage which lead into the ocean on a ebb-tide by that time the other vessel have disappear in the southern board and gardiner come out upon the open water again boldly and certain of he course all sail be set and the little craft slip away from the land with the ease of a aquatic bird that be ply its web-feet studding-sail be set and the pyramid of the horn soon begin to lower in the distance as the schooner recede when night close over the roll water it be no longer visible the vessel have fairly enter the antarctic ocean if anything north of the circle can properly so be term chapter xiv all go ` tis ours the goodly land -- look round -- the heritage behold go forth -- upon the mountain stand then if you can be cold sprague it be a enterprising and manly thing for a little vessel like the sea lion to steer with a undeviating course into the mysterious depths of the antarctic circle -- mysterious far more in that day than at the present hour but the american sealer rarely hesitate he have very little science few chart and those oftener old than new know little of what be go on among the savan of the earth though he ear be ever open to the lore of man like himself and he have he mind store with picture of island and continent that would seem to have be form for no other purpose than to meet the want of the race of animal it be he business to pursue and to capture cape horn and its vicinity have so long be frequent by this class of man that they be at home among they island rock current and sterility but to the southward of the horn itself all seem a waste at the time of which we be write much less be know of the antarctic region than be know to-day and even now we knowledge be limit to a few dreary outline in which barrenness and ice compete for the mastery wilke and he competitor have tell we that a vast frozen continent exist in that quarter of the globe but even they daring and perseverance have not be able to determine more than the general fact we should be give a exaggerated and false idea of roswell gardiner 's character do we say that he steer into that great void of the southern ocean in a total indifference to he destination and object very much the reverse be he state of mind as he see the high land of the cape sink as it might be foot by foot into the ocean and then lose sight of it altogether although the weather be fine for the region it be dark and menacing such indeed be usually the case in that portion of this globe which appear to be the favorite region of the storm although the wind be no more than a good breeze and the ocean be but little disturbed there be those symptom in the atmosphere and in the long ground-swell that come rolling in from the southwest that teach the mariner the cold lesson of caution we believe that heavier gale of wind at sea be encounter in the warm than in the cold month but there be something so genial in the air of the ocean during summer and something so chilling and repulsive in the rival season that most of we fancy that the current of air correspond in strength with the fall of the mercury roswell know better than this it be true but he also fully understand where he be and what he be about as a sealer he have several time penetrate as far south as the ne plus ultra of cook but it have ever before be in subordinate situation this be the first time in which he have the responsibility of command throw on himself and it be no more than natural that he should feel the weight of this new burthen so long as the sea lion of the vineyard be in sight she have present a center of interest and concern to get rid of she have be he first care and almost absorb object but now that she seem to be finally throw out of he wake there remain the momentous and closely approach difficulty of the main adventure directly before he eye roswell therefore be thoughtful and grave he countenance offer no bad reflection of the sober feature of the atmosphere and the ocean although the season be that of summer and the weather be such as be deem propitious in the neighborhood of cape horn a feeling of uncertainty prevail over every other sensation to the southward a cold mistiness veil the view and every mile the schooner advance appear like penetrate deeper and deeper into region that nature have hitherto withhold from the investigation of the mariner ice and its danger be know to exist a few degree farther in that direction but island also have be discover and turn to good account by the enterprise of the sealer it be truly a great thing for the sea lion of oyster pond to have throw off she namesake of the vineyard it be true both vessel be still in the same sea with a possibility of again meeting but roswell gardiner be steer onward towards a haven designate in degree and minute while the other craft be most probably leave to wander in uncertainty in that remote and stormy ocean we hero think there be now very little likelihood of he again fall in with he late consort and this so much the more because the island he seek be not lay down in the vicinity of any other known land and be consequently out of the usual track of the sealer this last circumstance be fully appreciate by we young navigator and give he confidence of possess its treasure to himself could he only find the place where nature have hide they when the sun go down in that vast waste of water which lie to the southward of this continent the little sea lion have fairly lose sight of land and be ride over the long southwestern ground-swell like a gull that hold its way steadily towards its nest for many hour she course have not varied half a point be as near as possible to south-southwest which keep she a little off the wind no sooner however do night come to shut in the view than roswell gardiner go aft to the man at the helm and order he to steer to the southward as near as the breeze would conveniently allow this be a material change in the direction of the vessel and should the present breeze stand would probably place she by the return of light a good distance to the eastward of the point she would otherwise have reach hitherto it have be roswell 's aim to drop he consort but now it be dark and so much time have already pass and be improve since the other schooner be last see he believe he might venture to steer in the precise direction he desire to go the season be so short in those sea that every hour be precious and no more variation from a real object could be permit than circumstance imperiously require it be now generally understand that the craft be make the best of she way towards she destine sealing-ground independently of the discovery of the regular explorer a great deal of information have be obtain from the sealer themselves within the present century touch the antarctic sea it be think that many a headland and various island that have contribute they share in procure the _ accolade _ for different european navigator be know to the adventurer from stonington and other by-port of this country long before science ever lay its eye upon they or monarch they sword on the shoulder of they secondary discoverer that diver island exist in this quarter of the ocean be a fact recognize in geography long before the sea lion be think of probably before she young master be actually bear but the knowledge generally possess on the subject be meager and unsatisfactory in particular case nevertheless this remark would not apply there be at that moment on board we little schooner several mariner who have often visit the south shetland new georgium palmer 's land and other known place in those sea not one of they all however have ever hear of any island directly south of the present position of the schooner no material change occur during the night or in the course of the succeed day the little sea lion industriously hold she way toward the south pole make very regularly she six knot each hour by the time she be thirty-six hour from the horn gardiner believe himself to be fully three degree to the southward of it and consequently some distance within the parallel of sixty degree south palmer 's land with its neighbouring island would have be near have not the original course carry the schooner so far to the westward as it be no one could say what lay before they the third day out the wind haul and it blow heavily from the north-east this give the adventurer a great run the blink of ice be shortly see and soon after ice itself drift about in berg the float hill be grand object to the eye roll and wallow in the sea but they be much worn and melt by the wash of the ocean and comparatively of greatly diminish size it be now absolutely necessary to lose most of the hour of darkness it be much too dangerous to run in the night the great barrier of ice be know to be close at hand and cook 's ne plus ultra at that time the great boundary of antarctic navigation be near the parallel of latitude to which the schooner have reach the weather however continue very favourable and after the blow from the north-east the wind come from the south chill and attend with flurry of snow but sufficiently steady and not so fresh as to compel we adventurer to carry very short sail the smoothness of the water would of itself have announce the vicinity of ice : not only do gardiner 's calculation tell he as much as this but he eye confirm they result in the course of the fifth day out on several occasion when the weather clear a little glimpse be have of the ice in long mountainous wall resemble many of the ridge of the alp though move heavily under the heaving and setting of the restless water dense fog from time to time cloud the whole view and the schooner be compel more than once that day to heave-to in order to avoid run on the sunken mass of ice or field of which many of vast size now begin to make they appearance notwithstanding the danger that surround we adventurer they be none of they so insensible to the sublime power of nature as to withhold they admiration from the many glorious object which that lone and wild scene present the ice-berg be of all the hue of the rainbow as the sunlight gilded they summit or side or they be leave shaded by the interposition of dark and murky cloud there be instance when certain of the huge frozen mass even appear to be quite black in particular position and under peculiar light while other at the same instant be gorgeous in they gleam of emerald and gold the aquatic bird also have now become numerous again penguin be swim about fill the air with they discordant cry while there be literally no end of the cape-pigeon and petrel albatross too help to make up the picture of animated nature while whale be often hear blow in the adjacent water gardiner see many sign of the proximity of land and begin to hope he should yet actually discover the island lay down on he chart as they position have be give by daggett in that high latitude a degree of longitude be necessarily much shorter than when nearer to the middle of we orb on the equator a degree of longitude measure as be know to most boarding-school young lady just sixty geographical or sixty-nine and a half english statute mile but as be not know to most boarding-school young lady or be understand by very few of they indeed even when know in the sixty-second degree of latitude a degree of longitude measure but little more than thirty-two of those very mile the solution of this seeming contradiction be so very simple that it may assist a certain class of we reader if we explain it by tell they that it arise solely from the fact that these degree of longitude which be place sixty geographical mile asunder at the center or middle of the earth converge towards the pole where they all meet in a point accord to the best observation roswell gardiner could obtain he be just one of these short degree of longitude or two-and-thirty mile to the westward of the parallel where he wish to be when the wind come from the southward the change be favourable as it embolden he to run nearer than he otherwise might have feel disposed to do to the great barrier of ice which now form a sort of weather-shore fortunately the loose berg and sunken mass have drift off so far to the northward that once within they the schooner have pretty plain sailing and roswell to lose none of the precious time of the season venture to run though under very short canvass the whole of the short night that succeed it be a great assistance to the navigation of those sea that during the summer month there be scarcely any night at all give the adventurer sufficient light by which to thread he way among the difficulty of he pathless journey when the sun reappear on the morning of the sixth day after he have leave the horn roswell gardiner believe himself to be far enough west for he purpose it now remain to get a whole degree further to the south which be a vast distance in those sea and in that direction and would carry he a long way to the southward of the ` ne plus ultra ' if there be any truth in daggett however that mariner have be there and the instruction of the owner render it incumbent on we young man to attempt to follow he more than once that morning do we hero regret he have not enter into term with the vineyard man that the effort might have be make in company there be something so portentous in a lone vessel 's venture within the ice in so remote a region that to say the truth roswell hesitate but pride of profession ambition love of mary dread of the deacon native resolution and the hardihood produce by experience in danger often encounter and escape nerve he to the undertaking it must be attempt or the voyage would be lose and we young mariner now set about he task with a stern determination to achieve it by this time the schooner have luff up within a cable 's length of the ice along the margin of which she be run under easy sail gardiner believe himself to be quite as far to the westward as be necessary and he present object be to find a opening by means of which he could enter among the float chaos that be spread far and wide to windward as the breeze be drive the drift mass to the northward they become loosen and more separated every moment and glad enough be gardiner to discover at length a clear spot that seem to favor he view without a instant 's delay the sheet be flatten in a pull be take on the brace and away go the little sea lion into a passage that have a hundredfold more real cause of terror than the scyllum and charybdi of old one effect of the vicinity of ice in extensive field be to produce comparatively still water it must blow a gale and that over a considerable extent of open sea to produce much commotion among the field and berg though that heaving and setting which have be liken to the respiration of some monster and which seaman call the ground-swell be never entirely want among the water of a ocean on the present occasion we adventurer be favor in this respect they craft glide forward unimpeded by anything like oppose billow at the end of four hour the schooner tack and ware when necessary have work she way to the southward and westward accord to she master 's reckon some five-and-twenty mile it be then noon and the atmosphere be unusually clear though never without fog gardiner go aloft to take a look for himself at the condition of thing around he to the northward and along the very passage by which the vessel have sail the ice be close and it be far easier to go on than to return to the eastward and towards the south-east in particular however do roswell gardiner turn he longing eye somewhere in that quarter of the ocean and distant now less than ten league do he expect to find the island of which he be in quest if indeed they have any existence at all in that direction there be many passage open among the ice the latter be generally higher than in the particular place to which the vessel have reach once or twice roswell mistake the summit of some of these berg for real mountain when owe to the manner in which the light fall upon they or rather do not fall upon they directly they appear dark and earthy each time however the sun 's ray soon come to undeceive he and that which have so lately be black and frowning be as by the touch of magic suddenly illuminate and become bright and gorgeous throw out its emerald hue or perhaps a virgin white that fill the beholder with delight even amid the terror and danger by which in very truth he be surround the glorious alp themselves those wonder of the earth could scarcely compete in scenery with the view that nature lavish in that remote sea on a seeming void but the might and honor of god be there as well as beneath the equator for one whole hour do roswell gardiner remain in the cross-tree have hail the deck and cause the schooner 's head to be turn to the south-east press she through the opening as near the wind as she could go the atmosphere be never without fog though the vapor drift about leave large vacancy that be totally clear one spot in particular seem to be a favorite resting-place for these low cloud which just there appear to light upon the face of the ocean itself a wide field of ice or it be better to say a broad belt of berg lay between this stationary cloud and the schooner though the existence of the vapor early catch roswell 's attention and during the hour he be aloft con the craft through a very intricate and ticklish channel not a minute pass that the young man do not turn a look towards that veil spot he be in the act of place a foot on the ratlin below he to descend to the deck when he half-unconsciously turn to take a last glance at this distant and seemingly immovable object just then the vapor which have keep roll and move like a fluid in ebullition while it still cling together suddenly open and the bald head of a real mountain a thousand foot high come unexpectedly into the view there could be no mistake all be too plain to admit of a doubt there beyond all question be land and it be doubtless the most western of the island describe by the die seaman everything corroborate this conclusion the latitude and longitude be right or nearly so and the other circumstance go to confirm the conjecture or conclusion daggett have say that one island high mountainous ragged and bleak but of some size lay the most westerly in the group while several other be within a few mile of it the last be lower much smaller and little more than naked rock one of these last however he insist on it be a volcano in activity and that at interval it emit flame as well as a fierce heat by he account however the party to which he belong have never actually visit that volcanic cauldron be satisfy with admire its terror from a distance as to the existence of the land roswell get several pretty distinct and certain view leave no doubt of its character and position there be a theory which tell we that the orb of day be surround by a luminous vapor the source of heat and light and that this vapor be in constant motion occasionally leave the mass of the planet itself to be see form what it be usual to term the spot on the sun resemble this theory the fog of the antarctic sea roll about the mountain now see withdraw the curtain at time and permit a view of the striking and majestic object within well do that lone and nearly barren mass of earth and rock merit these appellation the elevation have already be give and a rock that be nearly perpendicular rise out of the ocean for a thousand foot be ever impose and grand this be render so much the more so by its loneliness its stable and stern position amid float and move mountain of ice its brown side and bald summit the latter then recently whiten with a fall of pure snow and its frowning and fix aspect amid a scene that might otherwise be say to be ever in motion roswell gardiner 's heart beat with delight when assure of success in discover this the first great goal of he destination to reach it be now he all-absorbing desire by this time the wind have get round to the southwest and be blow quite fresh bring he well to windward of the mountain but cause the ice-berg to drift in towards the land and place a impassable barrier along its western shore we young man however remember that daggett have give the anchorage as on the north-eastern side of the island where accord to he statement a little haven would be find in which a dozen craft might lie in security to this quarter of the island gardiner consequently endeavor to get there be no opening to the northward but a pretty good channel be before the schooner to the southward of the group in this direction then the sea lion be steer and by eight bell -lrb- four in the afternoon -rrb- the southern point of the largest island be double the rest of the group be make and to the infinite delight of all on board she abundance of clear water be find between the main island and its smaller neighbor the berg have ground apparently as they draw near the group leave this large bay entirely free from ice with the exception of a few small mass that be float through it these body whether field or berg be easily avoid and away the schooner go with flow sheet into the large basin form by the different member of the group to render ` assurance doubly sure ' as to the information of daggett the smoke of a volcano arise from a rock to the eastward that appear to be some three or four mile in circumference and which stand on the eastern side of the great basin or some four league from sealer 's land as daggett have at once name the principal island this be in fact about the breadth of the main basin which have two principal passage into it the one from the south and the other from the north-east once within the island and reasonably clear of all ice it be a easy thing for the schooner to run across the basin or great bay and reach the north-eastern extremity of sealer 's land as the light would continue some hour longer there be very little night in that high latitude in December the month that correspond to we June roswell cause a boat to be lower and man when he pull at once towards the spot where it strike he the haven must be find if there be any such place at all everything turn out as it have be describe by daggett and great be we young man 's satisfaction when he row into a cove that be little more than two hundred yard in diameter and which be so completely land-locked as not to feel the influence of any sea outside in general the great difficulty be to land on any of the antarctic rock the breaker and surf oppose it but in this spot the smallest boat could be lay with its bow on a beach of shingle without the slightest risk of its be injure the lead also announce good anchorage in about eight fathom of water in a word this little haven be one of those small basin that so often occur in mountainous island where fragment of rock appear to have fall from the principal mass as it be force upward out of the ocean as if purposely intend to meet the want of mariner nor be the outer bay or the large basin form by the entire group by any means devoid of advantage to the navigator from north to south this outer bay be at least six league in length while its breadth could not much have fall short of four of course it be much more expose to the wind and wave than the little harbor proper though roswell be strike with the great advantage it offer in several essential particulars it be almost clear of ice while so much be float about outside of the circle of island thus leave a free navigation in it for even the smallest boat this be mainly owe to the fact that the largest island have two long crescent-shaped cape the one at its north-eastern and the other at its south-eastern extremity give to its whole eastern side the shape of a new moon the harbor just describe be to the southward of or within the north-eastern cape which we young master at once name cape hazard in honor of he chief mate 's vigilance that officer have be the first to point out the facility probably offer by the formation of the land for a anchorage though rocky and broken it be by no means difficult to ascend the rugged bank on the northern side of the harbor and gardiner go up it attend by stimson who of late have much attach himself to the person of he commander the height of this barrier above the wave of the ocean be but a little less than a hundred foot and when the summit be reach a common exclamation of surprise not to say delight break from the lip of both hitherto not a seal of any sort have be see and gardiner have feel some misgiving touch the benefit that be to be derive from so much hardship exposure and enterprise all doubt however vanish the instant he get a sight of the northern shore of the island this shore a reach of several mile in extent be fairly alive with the monster of which he be in search they lay in thousand on the low rock that line that entire side of the island basking in the sun of the antarctic sea there they be sure enough sea lion sea elephant huge clumsy fierce-looking and revolting creature belong properly to neither sea nor land these animal be constantly go and come in crowd some waddle to the margin of the rock and tumble into the ocean in search of food while other scramble out of the water and get upon shelf and other convenient place to repose and enjoy the light of day there be very little contention or fighting among these revolting-looking creature though nearly every known species of the larger seal be among they there be famous pick for we master stephen say roswell to he companion fairly rub he hand in delight one month 's smart work will fill the schooner and we can be off before the equinox do it not seem to you that yonder be the bone of sea lion or of seal of some sort lie hereaway as if man have be at work on the creature no doubt o not at all captain gar ` ner as much out of the way as this island be -- and i never hear of the place afore old a sealer as i be -- but as much out of the way as it be we be not the first to find it somebody have be here and that within a year or two and he have pick up a cargo too depend o not as all this merely correspond with daggett 's account of the place roswell feel no surprise on the contrary he see in it a confirmation of all that daggett have state and as furnish so much the more reason to hope for a successful termination to the voyage in all its part while on the rock roswell take such a survey of the locality as might enable he to issue he order hereafter with discretion and intelligence the schooner be already make short tack to get close in with the island in obedience to a signal to that effect and the second mate have pull out to the entrance of the little haven with a view to act as pilot before the captain have descend from the summit of the northern barrier the vessel come in under she jib the wind be nearly aft and she drop two anchor in suitable spot make another fly moor of it general joy now illuminate every face it be in itself a great point gain to get the schooner into a perfectly safe haven where she people could take they natural rest at night or during they watch below without feel any apprehension of be crush in the ice but here be not only security but the source of that wealth of which they be in quest and which have induce they all to encounter so many privation and so much danger the crew land to a man each individual ascend to the summit of the barrier to feast he eye on the spectacle that lay spread in such affluent abundance along the low rock of the northern side of the island as there be yet several hour of light remain roswell still attend by stimson each arm with a seal spear or lance not only as a weapon of defense but as a leaping-staff set out to climb as high up the central acclivity of the island as circumstance would allow he to go he be deceive in the distance however and soon find that a entire day would be necessary to achieve such a enterprise could it be perform at all but he do succeed in reach a low spur of the central mountain that command a wide and noble view of all that lay to the north and east of it from this height which must have be a few hundred foot above the level of the ocean we adventurer get a still better view of the whole north coast or of what might have be call the seal quarter of the island they also get a tolerably accurate idea of the general formation of that lone fragment of rock and earth as well as of the islet and island that lay in its vicinity the outline of the first be that of a rude and of course a irregular triangle the three principal point of which be the two low cape already mention and a third that lay to the northward and westward the whole of the western or south-western shore seem to be a nearly perpendicular wall of rock that in the main rise some two or three hundred foot above the ocean against this side of the island in particular the wave of the ocean be sullenly beat while the ice drive up ` home ' as sailor express it show a vast depth of water on the two other side it be different the wind prevail most from the south-west which render the perpendicular face of the island its weather-wall while the two other side of the triangle be more favor by position the north side of course lay most expose to the sun everything of this nature be reverse in the southern hemisphere from what we have it in the northern while the eastern or north-eastern side to be precisely accurate be protect by the group of island that lay in its front such be the general character of sealer 's land so far as the hurry observation of its present master enable he to ascertain the near approach of night induce he now to hasten to get off of the somewhat dangerous acclivity to which he have climb and to rejoin he people and he schooner chapter xv ye dart upon the deep and straight be hear a wilder roar and man grow pale and pray : ye fling its water round you as a bird fling o'er he shiver plume the fountain 's spray see to the break mast the sailor cling ye scoop the ocean to its briny spring and take the mountain billow on you wing and pile the wreck of navy round the bay bryant 's wind no unnecessary delay be permit to interfere with the one great purpose of the sealer the season be so short and the difficulty and danger of enter among and of quit the ice be so very serious that every soul belong to the schooner feel the importance of activity and industry the very day that succeed the vessel 's arrival not only be great progress make in the preliminary arrangement but a goodly number of fur-seal of excellent quality be actually kill and secure two noble sea-elephant be also lanced animal that measure near thirty foot in length each of which yield a very ample return for the risk and trouble of take it in oil the skin of the fur-seal however be roswell 's principal object and glad enough be he to find the creature that pay this tribute to the want and luxury of man in number sufficient to promise he a speedy return to the northward while the slaughter and skinning and curing and try out be all in active operation we young man pay some attention to certain minor arrangement which have a direct bearing on the comfort of he people as well as the get in of cargo a old store-house of respectable size have stand on the deacon 's wharf while the schooner be fitting out but it have be take to piece in order to make room for a more eligible substitute the material of this building roswell gardiner have persuade he owner to send on board and they have all be receive and stow away a part below and a part on deck as a provision for the possible want of the people as it be necessary to clear the deck and break out the hold all these material consist principally of the timber of the frame the siding and a quantity of plank and board be now float ashore in the cove and haul upon the rock roswell take a leisure moment to select a place for the site of he building which he intend to erect at once in order to save the time that would otherwise be lose in pull between the schooner and the shore it be not difficult to find the sort of spot that be desirable for the dwelling that choose by gardiner be a shelf of rock of sufficient extent that lay perfectly expose to the north and north-east or to the sunny side of the island while it be sheltered from the south and south-west by mass of rock that form a complete protection against the colder wind of the region these wall of stone however be not sufficiently near to permit any snow they might collect to impend over the building but enough space be leave between they and the house to admit of a capacious yard in which might be place any article that be necessary to the ordinary work or to the want of the sealer have it be advisable to set all hand at the business of slaughter roswell gardiner certainly would not have lose the time he do in the erection of he house but we master be a judicious and wary commander at he call the seal be now perfectly tame and nothing be easier than to kill they in score the great difficulty be in remove the spoil across the rock as it be sometimes necessary to do so for a distance of several mile means be find in the end to use the boat on this service though even then at midsummer the northern shore of the island be frequently so closely beset by the ice as completely to block up the passage this too occur at time when the larger bay be nearly free and the cove which go by the name of the deacon 's bight among the man be entirely so in order to prevent a premature panic among the victim of this intended foray then gardiner allow no one to go out to kill but the experienced hand and no more to be slay each day than could be skin or cut up at that particular time in consequence of this prudent caution the work soon get into a regular train and it be early find that more be do in this mode than could have be effect by a less guard assault on the seal as for the material of the building they be haul up the rock without much difficulty the frame be of some size as be the case generally with most old construction in america but be of pine thoroughly seasoned the sill and plate be not so heavy but that they might be readily enough handle by the non-sealing portion of the crew robert smith the landsman be a carpenter by trade and it fall to he lot to put together again the material of the old warehouse have there not be such a mechanic among the crew however a dozen american could at any time construct a house the ` rough and ready ' habit of the people usually teach they in a rude way a good deal of a great many other art besides this of the carpenter mott have serve a part of he time with a blacksmith and he now set up he forge when the frame be ready all hand assemble to assist in raise it and by the end of the first week the building be actually enclose the labor amounting to no more than put each portion in its place and secure it there the saw be scarcely use during the whole process this building have two apartment one of which gardiner appropriate to the use of a sitting-room and the other to that of a dormitory rough bunk be construct and the mattress of the man be all bring ashore and put in the house it be intend that everybody should sleep in the building as it would save a great deal of go to and fro as well as a great deal of time the cargo be to be collect on a shelf of rock that lay about twenty foot below that on which the building stand by follow which it be possible to turn the highest point of the pass that which form the southern protection of the building and come out on the side of the cove at another shelf that be not more than fifty foot above the level of the vessel 's deck down this last declivity roswell propose to lower he cask by means of a project derrick the rock be sufficiently precipitous to admit of this arrangement while he spare spar furnish he with the necessary means thus be every preparation make with judgment and foresight in this manner do the first ten day pass every man and boy be as busy as bee to own the truth no attention be pay to the sabbath which would seem to have be leave behind they by the people among the descendant of those puritan who be so rigid in they observance of that festival at the end of the time just mention a great deal have be do the house such as it be be complete to be sure it be nothing but a old storehouse re-vamped but it be find to be of infinite service and greatly do all hand felicitate themselves at have bring its material along with they even those who have most complain of the labor of get the timber on board have the most often curse they for be in the way during the passage and have continue the loudest to deride the idea of ` sealer turn carpenter ' be shortly willing to allow that the possession of this dwelling be of the greatest value to they and that so far from the extra work 's cause they to fall behind in they main operation the comfort they find in have a home like this to go to after a long day 's toil refresh they to a degree which enable every man to return to he labor with a zeal and a energy that might otherwise have be want although it be in the warmest season of the year and the night could scarcely be call night at all yet the sun never get very low without leave a chilliness in the air that would have render sleep without a cover and a protection from the wind not only excessively uncomfortable but somewhat dangerous indeed it be often find necessary to light a fire in the old ware-house this be do by means of a capacious box-stove that be almost as old as the building itself and which have also be bring along as a article of great necessity in that climate fuel could not be want as long as the ` scrap ' from the try-works abound and there be many more of these than be need to ` try out ' the sea-elephant oil the schooner however have a very ample supply of wood to burn that be a article which abound on shelter island and which the deacon have consent to lay in in some abundance gardiner get this concession out of the miserly temperament of the old man by persuade he that a sealer could not work to any advantage unless he have the means of occasionally warm himself the miserly propensity of the deacon be not so engrossing that he do not comprehend the wisdom of make sufficient outlay to secure the execution of he main object and among other thing of this nature the schooner have sail with a very large supply of wood as have just be state wood and onion indeed be more abundant in she than any other store the arrangement describe be complete by the end of the first fortnight during which period the business of seal be also carry on with great industry and success so very tame be the victim and so totally unconscious of the danger they incur from the presence of man that the crew move round among they seemingly but very little observe and not at all molest the utmost care be take to give no unnecessary alarm and when a animal be lance it be do in such a quiet way as to produce as little commotion as possible by the end of the time name however the seal have get so advanced as to require the aid of all hand in secure the spoil to work then everybody go with a hearty good-will : and the shelf of rock just below the house be soon well garnish with cask and skin have the labor be limit to the mere killing and skinning and curing and barrel of oil it would have be comparatively quite light but the necessity of transport the fruit of all this skill and luck considerable distance in some case several mile and this over broken rock form the great obstacle to immediate success it be the opinion of roswell gardiner that he could have fill he schooner in a month be it possible to place she directly alongside of the rock frequent by the seal and prevent all this toil in transport this however be impossible the wave and the ice render it certain destruction to lay a craft anywhere along the northern shore of the island the boat might be and occasionally they be use bring load of skin and oil round the cape quite into the cove these little cargo be immediately transfer to the hold of the schooner a ground-tier of large cask have be leave in she purposely to receive the oil which be empty into they by means of a hose by the end of the third week this ground-tier be fill and the craft become stiff and be in good ballast trim although the spare water be now entirely pump out of she all this time the weather be very fair for so high a latitude and every way propitious the twenty-third day after the schooner get in roswell be stand on a spur of the hill at no great distance from the house overlook the long reach of rocky coast over which the ` sea-elephant ' and ` lion ' and ` dog ' and ` bear ' be waddle in as much seeming security as the hour when he first see they the sun be just rise and the seal be clamber up out of the water to enjoy its warm ray as they place themselves in position favourable to such a purpose that be a pleasant sight to a true sealer captain gar ` ner observe stimson who as usual have keep near he officer and one that i can say i never before saw equal i have be in this business now some five-and-twenty year and never before have i meet with so safe a harbor for a craft and so large herd that have not be stir up and get to be skeary we have certainly be very fortunate thus far stephen and i be now in hope we may fill up and be off in good season to get clear of the ice return roswell we luck have be surprising all thing consider you call it luck captain gar ` ner but in my creed there be a truer and a better word for it sir ay i know well enough what you mean stephen though i can not fancy that providence care much whether we shall take a hundred seal to-day or none at all such be not my idee sir and i be not ashamed to own it in my humble way of think captain gar ` ner the finger of divine providence be in all that come to pass if not straight ahead like as a body would receive a fall still by sartain law that bring about everything that be to happen just as it do happen i believe now sir that providence do not intend we shall take any seal at all to-day sir why not stimson it be the very finest day we have have since we have be on the island that be true enough and it be this glorious sunny day glorious and sunny for sich a high latitude that make I feel and think that this day be not intend for work you probably forget it be the sabbath captain gar ` ner sure enough i have forget that stephen but we sealer seldom lie by for such a reason so much the worse for we sealer then sir this be my seventeenth v ` y' ge into these sea sir and i will say that more of they have be make with officer and crew that do _ not _ keep the sabbath than with officer and crew that do still i have obsarve one thing sir that the man who take he rest one day in seven and freshen he mind as it might be with thinking of other matter than he every-day consarn come to he task with so much better will when he _ do _ set about it as to turn off greater profit than if he work night and day sunday and all roswell gardiner have no great reverence for the christian sabbath and this more because it be so _ call _ than for any sufficient reason in itself pride of reason render he jealous of everything like a concession to the faith of those who believe in the son of god and he be very apt to dissent from all admission that have even the most remote bearing on its truth still as a kind-hearted commander as well as a judicious reasoner on the economy of he fellow-creature he fully feel the policy of grant relaxation to labor nor be he indispose to believe in the care of a divine providence or in its justice though less believe in this respect than the illiterate but earnest-minded seaman who stand at he side he know very well that all work and no play make jack a dull boy and he understand well enough that it be good for man at stated season to raise he mind from the care and business of this world to muse on those of the world that be to come though incline to deism roswell worship in he heart the creator of all he see and understand as well as much that he could neither scan nor comprehend this be not the seaman 's usual way of think return we hero after regard he companion for a moment a little intently with we there be very little sabbath in blue-water too little sir much too little depend o not captain gar ` ner god be on the face of the water as well as on the hill-top he spirit be everywhere and it must grieve it to see human being that have be create in he image so bent on gain as to set apart no time even for rest much less for he worship and praise i be not certain you be wrong stimson and i feel much more sure that you be right as a political economist than in you religion there _ should _ be season of rest and reflection -- yet i greatly dislike lose a day as fine as this ` the better the day the better the deed ' sir no time be lose to he who stop in he work to think a little of he god we crew be use to have a sabbath and though we work on lay there be not a hand aboard we captain gar ` ner who would not be glad to hear the word pass among 'em which should say this be the lord 's day and you have to knock off from you labor as i believe you understand the people stephen and we have have a busy time of it since we get in i 'll take you at you word and give the order go and tell mr hazard there 'll be no duty carry on to-day beyond what be indispensable it be Sunday and we 'll make it a day of rest truth compel we to say that roswell be quite as much influence in give this order by recollect the pleasure it would give mary as by any higher consideration glad enough be stimson to hear this order and away he hasten to find the mate that it might be at once communicate to the man although this well-disposed seaman a little overrated the motive of a portion of the crew at least he be right enough as to the manner in which they would receive the new regulation rest and relaxation have become in a measure necessary to they and leisure be also need to enable the people to clean themselves the business in which they have be engage be one that accumulate oily substance and require occasional purification of the body in order to preserve the health the scurvy that great curse of long voyage be as much owe to neglect of cleanliness as to diet no sooner be it know that this day be to be treat as the sabbath than soap razor scissors and all the usual appliance of the sailor 's toilet be draw out of bag and chest and parade about on the rock a hour pass in scrub shave cut hair hold garment up to the light to look for hole and ascertain they condition and rummaging among property as the player would term the different wardrobe that be thus bring into view the mate come out of the _ melee _ ` shaven and shear ' as well as neatly attire and there be not a man on the island who do not look like a different be from what he have appear a hour before in consequence of this pause in the regular business of seal and the promise holiday a strict order be give that no one should go among the seal as it be fear that some indiscretion or other might have a tendency to create a alarm in all other respects the island be place at the disposal of the man if anything could be make of such a lone spot a speck on the surface of the antarctic sea and nearly encircle by mountain of float ice as for roswell himself after read a chapter or two in mary pratt 's bible he determine to make another effort to ascend to the summit of the sterile rock which cap the pile that rise vertically in the center of the island the day be nearly all before he and summon stimson as a companion for he have take a great fancy to this man away he go young active and full of buoyancy almost at the same instant hazard the chief mate pull out of the cove in one of the whale-boat man by volunteer and provide with sail with a intention to cross the great bay and get a nearer view of the volcanic hill out of which smoke be constantly pour and occasionally flame the second mate and one or two of the hand remain near the house to keep a look-out on the vessel and other property the season have now advance to the first day of January a month that in the southern hemisphere correspond with we own July as roswell pick he way among the broken rock that cover the ascent to what might be term the table-land of the island if indeed any portion of so ragged a bit of this earth could properly be so name he thought recur to this question of the season and to the probability of he get a cargo before it would be absolutely necessary to go to the northward on the whole he fancy he chance good and such he find to be stimson 's opinion when this experienced sealer be question on the subject we have begin right in all respects but one captain gar ` ner say stephen as he close he remark on the subject and even in that matter in which we make a small mistake at the outset we be improve and i hope will come out right in the end i say a _ small _ mistake but in this i be wrong as it be a _ great _ mistake and what be it stephen make no bone of tell I of any blunder i may have commit accord to you view of duty you be so much older than myself that i 'll stand it why sir it be not in seamanship or in seal if it be i would hold my tongue but it be in not keep the lord 's day from the hour when we lift we anchor in that bay that bear the name of you family captain gar ` ner and which ought to be and i make no doubt _ be _ dear to you on that account if for no other reason i rather think from what they tell I that the old lord gar ` ner of all have much preaching of the word and much pray to the lord in the old time when he live there there never be any _ lord _ gardiner among we return roswell modestly though it be a fashion among the east-ender to give that title to the owner of the island my ancestor who first get the place be lyon gardiner a engineer in the service of the colony of connecticut well whether he be a lion or a lamb i 'll answer for it the lord be not forget on that island captain gar ` ner and he should not be on this no man ever lose anything in this world or in that which be to come a ` ter it by remember once in seven day to call on he creator to help he on in he path i have hear it say sir that you be a little partic ` lar like in you idee of religion and that you do not altogether hold to the doctrine that be preach up and down the land roswell feel he cheek warm at this remark and he think of mary and of she meek reliance on that savior whom in the pride of he youth strength and as he fancy of he reason also he doubt about as be the son of god the picture thus present to he mind have its pleasant and its unpleasant feature strange as it may seem it be certain that the young man would have love would have respect mary less than he now do could he imagine that _ she _ entertain the same notion on this very subject as those he entertain himself few man relish infidelity in a woman whose proper sphere would seem to be in believe and in worship and not in cavilling or in splitting straw on matter of faith perhaps it be that we be apt to associate laxity of moral with laxity of belief and have a general distaste for release the other sex from any even the smallest of the restraint that the dogma of the church impose but we hold it to be without dispute that with very few exception every man would prefer that the woman in whom he feel a interest should err on the side of bigotry rather than on that of what be call liberalism in point of religious belief thus it be with most of we and thus be it with roswell gardiner he could not wonder at mary 's rigid notion consider she education and on the whole he rather like she the better for they at the very moment that he feel they might endanger he own happiness if woman thoroughly understand how much of they real power and influence with man arise from they seeming dependence there would be very little tolerance in they own circle for those among they who be for proclaim they independence and they right to equality in all thing while we young mariner and he companion be work they way up to the table-land which lay fully three hundred foot above the level of the sea there be little opportunity for further discourse so rough be the way and so difficult the ascent at the summit however there be a short pause ere the two undertake the mountain proper and they come to a halt to take a look at the aspect of thing around they there be the boat a mere white speck on the water fly away with a fresh northerly breeze towards the volcano while the smoke from the latter make a conspicuous and not very distant land-mark nearer at home all appear unusually plain for a region in which fog be so apt to prevail the cove lay almost beneath they and the schooner just then strike the imagination of she commander as a fearfully small craft to come so far from home and to penetrate so deep among the maze of the ice it be that ice itself however that attract most of roswell 's attention far as the eye could reach north south east and west the ocean be brilliant and chill with the vast float mass the effect on the air be always perceptible in that region ` kill the summer ' as the sealer express it but it seem to be doubly so at the elevation to which the two adventurer have attain still the panorama be magnificent the only part of the ocean that do not seem to be alive with ice-berg if one may use such a expression be the space within the group and that be as clear as a estuary in a mild climate it really appear as if nature have taboo that privileged spot in order that the communication between the different island should remain open of course the presence of so many obstacle to the billow without and indeed even to the rake of the wind produce smooth water within the slow breath-like heaving and setting of the ceaseless ground-swell be the only perceptible motion to the water in side ` tis a very remarkable view stephen say roswell gardiner but there will be one much finer if we can work we way up that cone of a mountain and stand on its naked cap i wish i have bring a old ensign and a small spar along to set up the gridiron in honor of the state we be begin to put out we feeler old stimson and shall have 'em on far better bit of territory than this before the earth have go round in its track another hundred year well to my notion captain gar ` ner answer the seaman follow he officer towards the base of the cone uncle sam have get more land now than he know what to do with if a body could discover a bit of ocean or a largish sort of a sea there might be some use in it whale be get to be skeary and be mostly drive off they old grounds and as for the seal you must bury yourself craft and all up to the truck in ice to get a smile from one of they good-lookin ' count ` nance as i always say i be afraid stephen it be all over with the discovery of more sea even the moon they now say be altogether without water have not so much as a lake or a large pond to take a duck in without water sir exclaim stimson quite aghast if ` tis so sir it _ must _ be right since the same hand that make the moon make this ` arth and all it contain but what _ can _ they do for seafaring folk in the moon if what you tell I captain gar ` ner be the truth they must do without they i fancy oil and skin be not very much in demand among the moonite stephen what be that off here to the eastward eh east-and-by north-half-east or so i see what you mean sir it do look wonderfully like a sail and a sail pretty well surround by ice too there be no mistake in the matter the white canvass of a vessel be plainly visible over a vast breadth of field-ice a little to the northward of the island that lay directly opposite the cove although the sail of this stranger be spread it be plain enough he be closely beset if not actually jam from the first instant he see the strange craft roswell have not a doubt of she character he feel convinced it be he late consort the sea lion of the vineyard which have find she way to the group by means of some hint that have fall into daggett 's hand if not by a positive nautical instinct so great have be he own success however and so certain do he now feel of fill up in due season that he care much less for this invasion on he privacy than he would have do a fortnight earlier on the contrary it might be a good thing to have a consort in the event of any accident occur to he own vessel from the moment then that gardiner feel certain of the character of the strange sail he policy be settle in he own mind it be to receive he old acquaintance with good will and to help fill he up too as soon as he have secure he own cargo in order that they might sail for home in company by he aid and advice the other schooner might save a week in time at that most important season of the year and by the experience and exertion of he people a whole month in fill up might readily be gain all thought of climb the peak be at once abandon and in fifteen minute after the sail be see roswell and stephen both come pant down to the house so much easier be it to descend in this world than to mount a swivel be instantly load and fire as a signal and in half a hour a boat be man and ready roswell take command himself leave he second mate to look after the schooner stimson go with he captain and in less than one hour after he have first see the strange sail we hero be actually pull out of the cove with a view to go to she assistance roswell gardiner be as good-hearted a fellow as ever live he have a sufficient regard for he own interest as well as for those of other entrust to he care but these main point look after he would cheerfully have work a month to relieve the vineyard-man from the peril that so plainly beset they set he sail the instant the boat be clear of the rock away he go then as fast as ash and canvass could carry he which be at a rate but little short of eight knot in the hour as he be thus fly towards he object we young mariner form a theory in he own mind touch the drift of the ice in the adjacent sea it be simply this he have sound in enter the great bay and have ascertain that comparatively shallow water exist between the south-eastern extremity of sealer 's land and the nearest island opposite it be deep enough to admit the largest vessel that ever float and a great deal more than this but it be not deep enough to permit a ice-berg to pass the tide too run in race among the island which prevent the accumulation of ice at the southern entrance while the outer current seem to set everything past the group to allow of the float mountain to collect to the eastward where they appear to be throng it be on the western verge of this wilderness of ice-berg and ice field that the strange sail have be see work she way towards the group which must be plainly in view from she deck as she distance from the nearest of the island certainly do not exceed two league it require more than two hour for the whale-boat of roswell to cross the bay and reach the margin of that vast field of ice which be prevent from drift into the open space only by encounter the stable rock of the first of the group every eye be now turn in quest of a opening by means of which it might be possible to get further to the eastward one at length be discover and into it gardiner dash order he boat 's crew to stretch themselves out at they oar though every man with he think they be plunge into possible destruction on the boat go however now sheer to starboard now to port to avoid project spur of ice until she have plough she way through a fearfully narrow and a deviate passage that sometimes barely permit they to go through until a spot be reach where the two field which form this strait actually come in close crush contact with each other roswell take a look before and behind he see that he boat be safe owe to the formation of the two outline of the respective field when he spring upon the ice itself bid the boat-steerer to wait for he a shout break out of the lip of the young captain the instant he be erect on the ice there lay the schooner the martha 's vineyard craft within half a mile of he in plain sight and in as plain jeopardy she be jam with every prospect as roswell thought of be crushed ere she could get free from the danger chapter xvi a sculler 's notch in the stern he make a oar he shape of the bottle blade then spring to he seat with a lightsome leap and launch afar on the calm blue deep _ the culprit fay _ roswell be hardly on the ice before a sound of a most portentous sort reach he ear he know at once that the field have be rent in twain by outward pressure and that some new change be to occur that might release or might destroy the schooner he be on the point of spring forward in order to join daggett when a call from the boat arrest he step these here field be come together captain gar ` ner and we boat will soon be crush unless we get it out of the water sure enough a single glance behind he suffice to assure the young master of the truth of this statement the field he be on be slowly swing bring its western margin in closer contact with the eastern edge of the floe that lay within it the movement could be see merely by the closing of the channel through which the boat have come and by the crack and crush of the ice on the edge of the two field so tremendous be the pressure however that cake as large as a small house be break off and force upward on the surface of the field or ground into small fragment as it might be under the vice of a power hitherto unknown to the spectator slow as be the movement of the floe it be too fast to allow of delay and find a suitable place the boat be haul up and put in security on the floe that lay nearest the schooner this may give we a long drag to get back into the water stimson and a night out of we bunk say roswell look about he as soon as the task be achieve i do not know that sir be the answer it seem to I that the floe have part alongside of they rock and if-so-be that should turn out to be the case the whull on we schooner boat and all hand may drift into the bay for that there be a current setting from this quarter up towards we island i be sartain of by the feel of my oar as we come along it may be so -- the current run all manner of way and field-ice may pass the shoal though a berg never can i do not remember nevertheless to have ever see even a floe within the group -- nothing beyond large cake that have get adrift by some means or other i have sir though only once a few day a ` ter we get in when i be ship-keeper and all hand be down under the rock of the north eend a field come in at the northern entrance of the bay and go out at the southern it might have be a league athwart it and it drift as a body might say as if it have some one aboard to give it the right sheer touch it do at the south cape but just wind as handy as a craft could have do it in a good tide 's way out to sea it go ag ` in bind to the south pole for-ti - ` now well this be good news and may be the means of save the vineyard craft in the end we do seem to be set bodily into the bay and if we can only get clear of that island i do not see what be to hinder it here be a famous fellow of a mountain to the northward come down before the wind as one might say and give we a cant into the passage i should think that chap must produce some sort of a change whether it be for better or worse ay ay sir put in thompson who act as a boat-steerer at need he may do just that but it be all he can do mr green and i sound out from the cove for a league or more a few day since and we find less than twenty fathom as far as we go that chap up to the nor ` ard there draw something like a hundred fathom if he draw a inch he show more above water than a first-rate 's truck that do he and a good deal to spare thompson do you and todd remain here and look after the boat while the rest of we will shape we course for the schooner she seem to be in a wicked berth and ` twill be no more than neighbourly to try to get she out of it truly enough might roswell call the berth of the sea lion of the vineyard by any expressive name that imply danger when the party reach she they find the situation of that vessel to be as follow she have be endeavor to work she way through a passage between two large field when she find the ice closing and that she be in great danger of be ` nip ' daggett be a man of fertile resource and great decision of character perceive that escape be impossible all means of get clear be render useless by the floe soon touch both before and behind he he set about adopt the means most likely to save he vessel select a spot where a curve in the margin of the field to leeward promise temporary security at least he get he vessel into it anchor fast to the floe then he commence cut away the ice by means of axis first and of saw afterwards in the hope that he might make such a cavity as by its size and shape would receive the schooner 's hull and prevent she destruction for several hour have he and he people be at this work when to they joy as well as to they great astonishment they be suddenly join by roswell and he party the fact be that so intently have every one of the vineyard man 's faculty be absorb by they own danger and so much be each individual occupy by he own duty that not a man among they have see the boat or even any of the crew until gardiner call out to daggett as he approach announce he presence by he voice this be good fortune truly captain gar ` ner say daggett shake he brother master most cordially by the hand good fortune do i call it i be satisfy that i should fall in with you somewhere about this group of island for they lie just about where my late uncle have give we reason to suppose some good seal ground might be meet with but i do not hope to see you this morning you observe we position captain gar ` ner there be every prospect of a most awful nip there be indeed though i see you have be make some provision for it what luck have you have in digging a slip to let the schooner into well we might have have worse though better would have be more agreeable it be plain sailing so long as we can work above water and you see we have clear a fine berth for the craft down to the water 's edge but below that ` tis blind work and slow the field be some thirty foot thick and saw through it be out of the question the most we can do be to get off piece diagonally i be not without hope that we have do enough of this to make a wedge on which the schooner will rise if press hard on she off-side i have hear of such thing captain gar ` ner though i can not say i ever see it it be a ticklish business to trust to such a protector still a great deal must be gain by cut away so much of this upper ice and it be possible you schooner may be lift as you seem to expect have anything be do to strengthen the craft in-board not as yet though i have think of that too but what be the stoutest ship that ever float against the pressure of such a enormous field of ice have we not better keep cut away you can continue to work the saw and the axis but i will give a eye to strengthen the craft in-board just point out the spar and plank you can spare and we 'll see what can be do at any rate my lad you can now work with the certainty that you life be safe my schooner lie about six league from you as safely moor as if she lay in a dock come captain daggett let I see you spare spar and plank great encouragement it certainly be to these mariner so far from home and in they imminently perilous condition to know that a countryman and a friend be so near they to afford shelter and protection the american sailor be not a cheer animal like he english relative but he quite as clearly understand what ought to be receive with congratulation as those who be apt to make more noise the vineyard man in particular be habitually quiet and thoughtful there be but one seaman in the craft who do not husband he lay and look forward to meet the want of a future day this be the result of education man usually become quiet as they gain idea and feel that the tongue have be give to we in order to communicate they to we fellow still the joy at receive this unlooked-for assistance be great among the vineyard man and each party go to work with activity and zeal the task of roswell gardiner be in-board while that of daggett and he man continue to be on the ice the latter resume the labor of cut and saw the field and of get up fender or skid to protect the inner side of they vessel from the effect of a ` nip ' as for gardiner he set about he self-assumed duty with great readiness and intelligence he business be to strengthen the craft by get support up in she hold this be do without much difficulty all the upper part of the hold be clear and easily come at spar be cut to the proper length plank be place in the broadest part of the vessel opposite to each other and the spar be wedge in carefully extend from side to side so as to form a great additional support to the regular construction of the schooner in little more than a hour roswell have he task accomplish while daggett do not see that he could achieve much more himself they meet on the ice to consult and to survey the condition of thing around they the outer field have be steadily encroach upon the inner break the edge of both until the point of junction be to be trace by a long line of fragment force upward and pile high in the air open space however still exist owe to irregularity in the outline of the two floe and daggett hope that the little bay into which he have get he schooner might not be entirely close ere a shift of wind or a change in the tide might carry away the cause of the tremendous pressure that menace he security it be not easy for those who be accustom to look at natural object in they more familiar aspect fully to appreciate the vast momentum of the weight that be now drift slowly down upon the schooner the only ray of hope be to be find in the deficiency in one of the two great requisite of such a force momentum be _ weight _ multiply into _ velocity _ there be some glimpse visible of a nature to produce a slight degree of expectation that the last might yet be resist the movement be slow but it be absolutely grand by its steadiness and power any one who have ever stand on a lake or river shore and behold the undeviating force with which a small cake of ice crumble and advance before a breeze or in a current may form some idea of the majesty of the movement of a field of league in diameter and which be bear upon by a gale of the ocean as well as by current and by the weight of drift ice-berg from without it be true that the impetus come principally from a great distance and could scarcely be detect or observe by those around the schooner still these last be fully aware of the whole character of the danger which each minute appear to render more and more imminent and impose the two field be obviously close still and that with a resistless power that bode destruction to the unfortunate vessel the open water near she be already narrow to a space that half a hour might suffice to close entirely have you set that nearest island by compass daggett ask roswell gardiner as soon as he have take a good look around he to I it seem that it bear more to the eastward than it do a hour since if this should be true we inner field here must have a very considerable westerly set in which case we may still hope to drift clear return daggett spring on board the schooner and run aft to the binnacle roswell keep close at he side by george it be as you say the bearing of that island be alter at least two point in which case we drift have exceed a league -- ha what noise be that can it be a eruption of the volcano daggett at first be incline to believe it be a sound produce by some of the internal convulsion of the earth which within as if in mockery of the chill scene that prevail without be a rage volcano the fierce heat of which find vent at the natural chimney produce by its own effort this opinion however do not last long and he give expression to he new thought in he answer ` tis the ice he say i do believe the pressure have cause the field to part on the rock of that island if so we leeward floe may float away as fast as the weather field approach hardly say roswell gaze intently towards the nearest island hardly for the most weatherly of the two will necessarily get the force of the wind and the impetus of those berg first and make the fastest drift it may lessen the violence of the nip but i do not think it will avert it altogether this opinion of gardiner 's fully describe all that subsequently occur the outer floe continue its inroad on the inner break up the margin of both until the channel be so nearly close as to bring the field from which the danger be most apprehend in absolute contact with the side of the schooner when the margin of the outer floe first touch the bilge of the schooner it be at the precise spot where the vessel have just be fortify within fender have also be provide without and there be just a quarter of a minute during which the two captain hope that these unite means of defense might enable the craft to withstand the pressure this delusion last but a moment however the crack of timber let it be plainly see that the force be too great to be resist for another quarter of a minute the two master hold they breath expect to see the deck rise beneath they foot as the ice rise along the point of contact between the floe such in all probability would have be the result have not the pressure bring about another change that be quite as much within the influence of the law of mechanical force though not so much expect owe to the wedge-like form of the vessel 's bottom as well as to the circumstance that the ice of the outer floe have a similar shape project beneath the schooner 's keel the craft be lift bodily with a upward jerk as if she be suddenly release from some imprison power release she be indeed and that most opportunely for another half-minute would have see she rib break in and the schooner a mangled wreck as she now rise roswell give vent to he delight in a loud cry and all hand feel that the occurrence might possibly save they the surge upward be fearful and several of the man be throw off they foot but it effectually release the schooner from the nip lay she gradually up in the sort of dock that she people have be so many hour prepare for she reception there she lay incline a little partly on she bilge or sew as seamen term it when a vessel get a list from touch the ground and be leave by the tide neither quite upright nor absolutely on she beam-end no sooner be the vessel thus dock than all apprehension of receive further injury from the outer floe cease it might force the schooner altogether on the inner field drive the vessel before it as a avalanche of mud in the alp be know to force cottage and hamlet in its front but it could no longer ` nip ' it it do not appear probable to the two master however that the vessel would be force from its present berth the rending and crack of the ice sensibly diminish as the two floe come closer and closer together nor be this all : it be soon very obvious that the inner field be drift with a increase motion into the bay while the larger or outer floe seem to hang from some cause or other of the fact there be soon no doubt the fissure begin to open as slowly and steadily as it have close but noiselessly and without any rending of the ice we shall get you clear daggett we shall get you clear cry roswell with hearty good-will forget in that moment of generous effort all feeling of competition and rivalry i know what you be after my good fellow -- have understand it from the first yonder high land be the spot you seek and along the north shore of that island be elephant lion dog bear and other animal to fill up all the craft that ever come out of the vineyard this be hearty gar ` ner return the other give he brother master a most cordial shake of the hand and it be just what i like seal be a sociable business and a craft should never come alone into these high latitudes accident will happen to the most prudent man living as you see by what have just befall I for to own the truth we have have a narrow chance of it the reader will remember that all which daggett now say be utter by a man who see he vessel lie on the ice with a list that render it somewhat difficult to move about on she deck and still in circumstance that would have cause half the navigator of this world to despair such be not the fact with daggett however seven thousand mile from home alone in a unknown sea and uncertain of ever find the place he seek this man have pick he way among mountain and field of ice with perhaps less hesitation and reluctance than a dandy would encounter the peril of a cross when the street be a little moistened by rain even then with he vessel literally shelf on the ice certain that she have be violently nip he be congratulating himself on reach a seal ground from which he could never return without encounter all the same danger over again as for roswell he laugh a little at the other 's opinion of the seal business for he be morally certain the vineyard-man would have keep the secret have it be in he possession alone well well we 'll forget the past he say all but what we have do to help one another you stand by I off hattera and i have be of some service to you here you know how it be in we call daggett first come first serve i get here first and have have the cream of the business for this season though i do not by any means wish to be understand as say that you be too late i hope not gar ` ner ` twould be vexatious to have all this risk and trouble for nothing how much ile have you stow all my ground-tier and a few rider it be with the skin that we be do the best business daggett 's eye fairly snap at this announcement which arouse all he professional ambition to say nothing of that propensity to the root of all evil which have become pretty thoroughly incorporate with he moral be by dint of example theory and association we have frequently have occasion to remark how much more ` enjoyable ' for the intellectual and independent be a country on the decline than a country on the advance the one be accumulate that wealth which the other have already possess and improve and man cease to dwell so much on riches in they inmost soul when the means of obtain they would seem to have get beyond they reach this be one of the secret of the universal popularity of italy with the idle and educate though the climate and the monument and the recollection out of doubt contribute largely to its charm nevertheless man as a rule be far more remove from the money-getting mania in italy than in almost any other portion of the christian world and this merely because the time of she wealth and power have go by leave in its train a thousand fruit that would seem to be the most savoury as the stem on which they grow would appear to be approach its decay on martha 's vineyard however and in no part of the great republic indeed have this wane season yet commence and the heart of man be still engross with those desire that be to produce the means which be to lay the foundation for the enjoyment of generation to come that be luck indeed for a craft so early in the season return daggett when he eye have do snap be the crittur get to be wild and skeary not more so than the day we begin upon they i have take the greatest care to send none but my most experienced hand out to kill and skin and they order have be rigid to give as little alarm as possible if you wish to fill up i would advise you to take the same precaution for the heel of the season be begin to show itself i will winter here but i get a full craft say daggett with a resolute manner if not absolutely serious in what he say trouble enough have i have to find the group and we vineyard-men do not relish the idee of be outdo you would be do up my fine fellow answer roswell laughing do you attempt to pass a winter here the sea lion of humse 's hull would not herself keep you in fuel and you would have to raft it off next summer on you cask or remain here for ever i suppose a body might expect to see you back again another season observe daggett glance meaningly towards he companion as if he have seriously revolve so desperate a plan in he mind ` tis not often that a sealer let a station like that you have describe drop out of he recollection in a single v ` y' ge i may be back or i may not -- say roswell just then remember mary and wonder if she would continue to keep he any longer in suspense should he return successful from he present adventure -- that will depend on other more than on myself i wish however now we be both here and there can no longer be any ` hide and go seek ' between we that you would tell I how you come to know anything about this cluster of island or of the seal then and there to be find you forget my uncle who die on oyster pond and whose effect i cross over to claim i remember he very well -- see he often while live and help to bury he when dead well we information come from he he throw out several hint consarn sealing-grounds aboard the brig in which he come home and you need not be tell gar ` ner that a hint of that kind be sartain to find its way through all the port down east but hear that there be new sealing-ground be not know where to find it i should have be at a loss be not it for the spot on my uncle 's chart that have be rub over lately as i conclude to get rid of some of he note you know as well as i do that the spot be in this very latitude and longitude and so i come here to look for the much-desired land and you have undertake such a outfit and come this long distance into a icy sea on information as slight as this exclaimed roswell astonish at this proof of sagacity and enterprise even in man who be renown for scent dollar from pole to pole on this with a few hint pick up here and there among some of the old gentleman 's papers he be fond of scribble and i have get a sort of a chart that he scratch on a leaf of he bible that be make to represent this very group as i can now see then you could have have no occasion for the print chart with the mark of obliteration on it and do not come here on that authority after all there you be wrong captain gar ` ner the chart of the group have no latitude or longitude but just place each island with its bearing and distance from the other island it be no help in find the place which might be in one hemisphere as well as in the other it be then the mark of the obliteration -- _ mark _ if you please captain gar ` ner interrupt the other significantly my uncle talk a good deal aboard of that brig about other matter besides seal we think several matter have be obliterate from the old chart and we intend to look 'em all up it be we right you know see that the old man be vineyard-born and we be he nearest of kin certainly -- rejoin roswell laughing again but somewhat more faintly than before every man for he self in this world be a good maxim it be pretty certain if we do not take care of ourselves no one will take care of we yes sir say stimson who be stand near there be one to care for every hair of we head however forgetful and careless we may be ourselves be not it for this captain gar ` ner there be many a craft that come into these sea that would never find its way out of 'em and many a bold sailor with a heart boil over with fun and frolic that would be freeze to a ice-cicle every year gardiner feel the justice of this remark and easily pardon its familiarity for its truth in these sealer the discipline be by no means of that distant and military or naval character that be find in even a ordinary merchantman as every seaman have a interest in the result of the voyage some excuse be make for this departure from the more general usage and this familiarity itself never exceed the bound that be necessary to the observance of duty ay ay return roswell smile -- in one sense you be right enough but captain daggett and myself be speak of human affair as human affair be carry on -- be not this inner field drift fast away from the outer daggett if so we shall go directly into the bay it be as gardiner think by some means that be not apparent the floe be now actually separate and at a rate of movement which much exceed that of they junction all idea of further danger from the outer field disappear as a matter of course it be so captain gar ` ner say stimson respectfully but with point and who and what bring it about for we safety and the preservation of this craft -- i just ventur ' to ask that question sir it may be the hand of providence my good fellow for i very frankly own i can see no direct physical cause nevertheless i fancy it would be find that the tide or current have something to do with it if the truth could be come at well sir and who cause the tide and current to run this-a-way and that-a-way there you have I stephen for i never could get hold of the clew to they movement at all answer roswell laugh there be a reason for it all i dare say if one could only find it out captain daggett it be high time to look after the safety of you schooner she ought to be in the cove before night set in since the ice have find its way into the bay this appeal produce a general movement by this time the two field be a hundred fathom asunder the smaller or that on which the vessel lay drift quite fast into the bay under the joint influence of wind and current while the larger floe have clearly be arrest by the island this smaller field be much lessen in surface in consequence of have be break at the rock though the fragment that be thus cut off be of more than a league in diameter and of a thickness that exceed many yard as for the sea lion of the vineyard she be literally shelf as have be say so irresistible have be the momentum of the great floe that it lift she out of the water as two or three hand would run up a bark canoe on a gravelly beach this lifting process have very fortunately for the craft be effect by a application of force from below in a wedge-like manner and by bring the strongest defence of the vessel to meet the power consequently no essential injury have be do the vessel in thus lay she on she screw-dock if a body could get the craft _ off _ as easily as she be get _ on _ observe daggett as he and roswell gardiner stand look at the schooner 's situation it would be but a light job but as it be she lie on ice at least twenty foot thick and ice that seem as solid as flint we know it be not quite as hard as that daggett be roswell 's reply for we saw and axis make great havoc in it when we can fairly get at it if one _ could _ get fairly at it but here you see gar ` ner everything be under water and a axe be next to useless nor can the saw be use with much advantage on ice so thick there be no help for it but hard work and great perseverance i would advise that a saw be set at work at each end of the schooner allow a little room in case of accident and that we weaken the foundation by two deep cut the weight of the vessel will help we and in time she will settle back into she ` native element ' as the newspaper have it there be indeed no other process that promise success and the advice of gardiner be follow in the course of the next two hour deep cut be make with the saw which be push so low as to reach quite to the bottom of the cake this could be do only by what the sailor call jury-handle or spar secure to the plate the water offer the principal obstacle for that lay on the shelf at least five foot deep perseverance and ingenuity however finally achieve they aim a crack be hear the schooner slowly right and settle off into the sea again as easily and harmlessly as if scientifically launch the fender protect she side and copper though the movement be little more than slowly sink on the fragment of the cake which by means of the cut have be gradually so much reduce as to be unable to uphold so great a weight it be merely reverse the process of break the camel 's back by lay the last feather on he load this happy conclusion to several hour of severe toil occur just as the field have drift abreast of the cove and be about the center of the bay hazard come up also at that point on he return from the volcano alter he course a little to speak the stranger the report of the mate concern he discovery be simple and brief there be a volcano and one in activity but it have nothing remarkable about it no seal be see and there be little to reward one for cross the bay sterility and a chill grandeur be the characteristic of all that region and these be not want to any part of the group just as the sun be set gardiner pilot he companion into the cove and the two sea lion be moor amicably side by side and that too at a spot where thousand of the real animal be to be find within a league chapter xvii the morning air blow fresh on he the wave dance gladly in he sight the sea-birds call and wheel and skim -- o bless morning light dana the very day succeed the arrival of the sea lion of the vineyard even while he mate be clear the vessel daggett have a gang on the north shore killing and skinning as roswell 's rule be rigidly observe no other change be produce by this accession to the force of the sealer than additional slaughter many more seal be kill certainly but all be do so quietly that no great alarm be awaken among the doomed animal themselves one great advantage be obtain by the arrival of the new party that occasion a good deal of mirth at first but which in the end be find to be of great importance to the progress of the work daggett have take to piece and bring with he the run part of a common country wagon which be soon find of vast service in transport the skin and blubber across the rock the wheel be separate leave they in pair and each axle be load with a freight that a dozen man would hardly have carry when two or three hand would drag in the load with a occasional lift from other gang to get they up a height or over a cleft this portion of the operation be find to work admirably owe in a great measure to the smooth surface of the rock and unquestionably these wheel advance the business of the season at least a fortnight -- gardiner think a month it render the crew better natured too much diminish they toil and send they to they bunk at night in a far better condition for rest than they otherwise could have be just one month or four week to a day after the second schooner get in it be Sunday of course gardiner and daggett meet on the platform of a perfectly even rock that lay stretch for two hundred yard directly beneath the house it be in the early morning notwithstanding there be a strong disposition to work night and day on the part of the new-comer roswell 's rule of keep the sabbath as a day of rest have prevail and the business of wash scrubbing and shaving have just commence as for the two master they require fewer ablutions than they man have rise earlier and be already dress for the day to-morrow will be the first day of February say daggett when the salutation of the morning be pass and i be calculate my chance of get full this season you will be full this week i conclude gar ` ner we hope to be so by the middle of it be the answer i think the seal be get to be much shyer than they be and be afraid we shall demonstrate that ` the more haste be the worse speed ' what be that to you return daggett quickly of course you will sail for home as soon as you can get off gardiner do not like the of course which be indirectly say what the other would do himself under similar circumstance still it cause no difference in he own decision which have be make up under the influence of much reflection and of a great deal of good feeling i shall do no such thing captain daggett be the answer i do not fancy the idea of leave a fellow-creature a countryman -- nay i might say a neighbor on this lone spot with the uncertainty of he ever get out of it if you can come to some understanding with my officer and crew i will keep the schooner here until we be both full and ready to sail in company in which case you would nat ` rally ask a lay for yourself naturally perhaps i might return roswell smile though positively i shall not not one of we in the cabin will look for any other advantage than you good company i have talk this matter over with my mate and they say that the advantage of have a consort in get through the ice be sufficient to justify we in hold on two or three week longer with the man it will be a little different perhaps and they will require some pay the poor fellow live by they hand and what they hand do they will expect to be compensate for they shall have good lay depend on it as for yourself captain gar ` ner i trust my owner will not forget to do what be right if we ever get home and meet with luck in the market never fear for I daggett i look for my reward in the bright eye and pleasant smile of as excellent a girl as long island can produce mary never fail to reward I in that way whenever i do right it _ be _ right to stand by you just now -- to do as i would be do by : and i 'll do it set the thing down as decide but make you bargain with my man and now daggett what say you to climb yonder mountain to-day by way of get a good survey of we territory as well as to take a look at the state of the ice daggett assent very cheerfully he mind be greatly relieve by this assurance of standing by he on the part of roswell for he have be undecided whether to remain after the departure of the other schooner or not all be now clear to he however and the two master make they preparation to ascend the mountain as soon as they have breakfast stimson be summon to be of the party he officer have get to be accustom to and desirous of he company for the first two hour after quit the house gardiner daggett and the boat-steerer be busily employ in work they way across the broken surface of the island to the base of the cone-like pinnacle that form the apex of all there they rest and take a little refreshment converse the while on the state of the ice in the offing so far as the last could be see from they present elevation we shall have a sharp hill to climb should we succeed in get up here observe roswell though the rock appear to be quite clear of snow just now just now or never this be the antarctic dog-days gar ` ner answer daggett laughing and we must make the most of they a man can move about without he pee-jacket at noon-day and that be something gain for i have hear of ice making in the bay even at mid-summer we be not in a high enough latitude for that thank heaven though pretty well south too this be we harvest-time here sure enough and we have better look to it as gardiner say this the eye of all three be turn on the sterile scene around they the island be not absolutely destitute of vegetation as be the case a few degree further south but it might be say to be nearly so a few stunt plant be to be see in the fissure of the rock and a little soil have be make seemingly by the crumble of the stone in which a wiry grass occasionally show itself as for the mountain however it be mostly bare and when we party begin to climb the ascent be not only difficult but in place dangerous roswell have foresee this and he have make a provision accordingly in addition to he lance use as a leaping-staff and walking-pike each man have a small coil of ratlin-stuff throw over he shoulder in order to help he in difficult place or enable he to help he companion it be in the descent chiefly that these rope be expect to be of service though they utility be make apparent ere the three reach the summit the ascent of a mountain a thousand foot in height be no great exploit under ordinary circumstance even when there be precipitous cliff gorge ravine and broken mass youth activity and courage will commonly overcome all the difficulty place the foot of man on eminence that nature would appear to have intend solely for the dominion of the goat thus do it turn out with the three sealer all of whom stand on the bald cap of that mountain after a vigorous and somewhat hazardous ascent that occupy rather more than a hour they have greatly aid each other in achieve they purpose to be sure and the ratlin-stuff be find of use on more than one occasion a extraordinary and consider the accessory a most brilliant view reward the adventurer but after a few minute pass in pure admiration of what they behold the mind of all three advert to the part which give such unusual splendor to the panorama iceberg be visible on all side of they the great bay except and the group be surround by they in a way that would seem to proclaim a blockade at that season the south wind prevail though change be frequent and sudden and the vast frozen fleet be drift north gardiner see that the passage by which he have bring in he schooner be now completely close and that the only means of exit from the bay be by its northern outlet the great depth of the berg still prevent they come within the cluster of island while they number and size completely stop the floe from pass to the northward the sea be much more open gardiner and daggett both think as they gaze in that direction that it would be easy enough to take a vessel through the difficulty of the navigation and that a good run of eight-and-forty hour would carry she quite beyond the crowded ice this sight awaken some regret in the two master that they be not then in a condition to depart i be almost sorry that we have make a holiday of the Sunday say daggett seat himself on a point of rock to get a little rest after so fatigue a ascent every minute of time be precious to man in we situation every minute of time be precious to all man captain daggett in another and a still more important sense if they do but know it put in stimson with a zealous freedom and a christian 's earnestness i understand you stephen and will not gainsay it but a sealin ' v ` y' ge be no place after all for a man to give himself up to sabbath and religion all place be good sir and all hour sabbath when the heart be in the true state god be on this naked rock as he be on the vineyard and a thought or a syllable in he praise on this mountain be as pleasant to he as they that arise from church and priest i believe it be at least a mistake in policy to give the man no day of rest say roswell quietly though not prepare to carry matter as far as my friend stephen here i agree with he entirely in _ that _ and not in believe sir that the spirit of god be on this island in that too certainly neither captain daggett nor myself will be dispose to dispute either of these two proposition i think when we come to reflect on they a day of rest would seem to be appoint by nature and i make no doubt we have fill up all the sooner for have observe one seaman have so many call on they time which can not be neglect that it be unwise in they to increase the number unnecessarily this be not the spirit captain gar ` ner i be sorry to say in which we should keep we day of rest though it be well that we keep it at all i be no stickler for house and congregation though they be good enough in they time and season for every man have a tabernacle in he own heart if he be dispose to worship and if any place on earth can particularly incline one to worship god surely it must be some such spot as this exclaimed roswell with a degree of fervor it be not usual for he to exhibit never in my life have my eye see a sight as remarkable and as glorious as this well might we young mariner thus exclaim the day be fine for the region but mark by the caprice and changeful light of high latitudes there be mist in place and flurry of snow be to be see to the southward while the ocean to the northward of the group be glitter under the brightness of a unclouded sun it be the mixed character of this scene that render it so peculiar while its grandeur sublimity and even beauty be find in its vastness its noble though wild accessory its frozen and floating mountain glowing in prismatic light and the play of summer on the feature of a antarctic view ` tis a remarkable spot as no one can deny answer daggett but i like its abundance of seal the most of all t can not say i have much taste for sight unless they bring the promise of good profit with they we vineyarder live in a small way and be not rich enough to take delight in landscape serve god and reverence he holy name say stimson earnestly and all place will be good to look upon i have be on the vineyard in my time and have never find any difference as to the spot so long as the heart be right a poor man must work answer daggett drop he eye from the more distant and gorgeous view of the drift ice-mountain to the rocky shore that be still frequent by thousand of seal some of the largest of which might be see even from that elevation waddle about ay a poor man must work sunday or no sunday and he who would make he hay must do it while the sun shine i like meetin ' - goin ' at the right place and sealin ' when sealin ' ought to be do this day be lose i fear and i hope we shall not have reason to regret it stimson do not abandon what he conceive to be he duty but answer this cold worldly spirit in the best manner he uncultivated speech enable he to do but he word be throw away on daggett the lust of gold be strong within he and while that have full dominion over the heart it be vain to expect that any purely spiritual fruit will ripen there daggett be a instance of what we fear many thousand resemble he might be find up and down the land of a man energetic by temperament industrious by habit and even moderate in he view but whose whole existence be concentrate in the accumulation of property bear poor and in a state of society in which no one other generally recognize mode of distinction be so universally acknowledge as that of the possession of money it be not surprising that a man of he native disposition should early bend all he faculty to this one great object he be not a miser irke deacon pratt for he could spend freely on occasion and perfectly understand the necessity of make liberal outfit to insure ample return but he live for little else than for gain what such a man might have become under more favourable auspices and with different desire instil into he youthful mind it be not easy to say it be only certain that as he be the steel-trap be not quicker to spring at the touch than he be to arouse all he manifold energy at the hope or promise of profit as he whole life have be pass in one call it be but natural that he thought should most easily revert to the return that call have so often give he never dream of speculation know nothing of stock have no concern with manufacture in cotton or wool nor have any other notion of wealth than the possession of a good farm on the vineyard a reasonable amount of money at use certain interest in coaster whaler and sealer and a sufficiency of household effect and this in a very modest way to make himself and family comfortable notwithstanding this seeming moderation daggett be a intensely covetous man but he wish be limit by he habit while one of the master of the seal craft be draw these picture in he imagination of wealth after he manner very different be the thought of the other roswell 's fancy carry he far across that blue and sparkling ocean northward to oyster pond and deacon pratt 's homestead and to mary he see the last in she single hearted simplicity she maiden modesty she youthful beauty -- nay even in she unyielding piety for singular as it may seem gardiner value he mistress so much the more for that very faith to which in he own person he lay no claim irreligious he be not himself though skeptical on the one great tenet of christianity but in mary it strike he it be right that she should believe that which she have be so sedulously teach for he do not at all fancy those inquire mind in the other sex that lead they possessor in quest of novelty and paradox in this humor then the reader will not be surprise to hear that he imagine the deacon 's niece in she most please attribute and bedeck she with all those charm that render maiden pleasant to youthful lover have mary be less devout less fix in she belief that jesus be the son of god strange as it may seem the skeptical young man would have love she less and what be that rugged uncultivated seaman who stand near the two officer think of all this time do he too bend he thought on love and profit and the pleasure of this world of love most truly be he heart full to overflow but it be the love of god with that affection for all he creature that benevolence and faith which glow as warmly in the heart of the humblest and least educate as in those of the great and learn he mind be turn towards he creator and it convert the extraordinary view that lay before he sight into a vast magnificent gorgeous though wild temple for he worship and honor it might be well for all of we occasionally to pause in we eager pursuit of worldly object and look around on the world itself consider it as but a particle in the illimitable field of creation -- one among the many thousand of other known world that have be set in they place in honor of the hand that make they these brief but vivid glance at the immensity of the moral space which separate man from he deity have very healthful effect in inculcate that humility which be the stepping-stone of faith and love after pass a hour on the bald cap of the mountain sometimes converse at other ruminate on the scene a change in the weather induce we party to move there have be flurry of snow visible all the morning but it be in the distance and among the glitter berg once the volcano have thus be shut in from view but now a drive cloud pass over the mountain itself which be quickly as white as the pure element could make it so heavy be the fall of snow that it be soon impossible to see a dozen yard and of course the whole of the plain of the island be conceal at this most inauspicious moment we adventurer undertake they descent it be always much less dangerous to mount a acclivity than to go down it the upward progress be easily enough arrest while that in the other direction be frequently too rapid to be under perfect command roswell feel the truth of this and would have propose a delay until the atmosphere become clear again but it strike he that this be not likely to occur very soon he follow daggett therefore though reluctantly and with due caution stimson bring up the rear for the first ten minute we adventurer get along without any great difficulty they find the precise point at which they have reach the summit of the mountain and begin to descend it be soon apparent that great caution must be use the snow render the footing slippery daggett however be a bold and hot-blooded man when in motion and he precede the party some little distance call out to those behind he to come on without fear this the last do though it be with a good deal more caution than be observe by they leader at length all three reach a spot where it seem they could not overcome the difficulty beneath they be the smooth face of a rock already cover with snow while they could not see far enough in advance to ascertain in what this inclined plane terminate daggett however insist that he know the spot that they have pass up it there be a broad shelf a short distance below they and once on that shelf it would be necessary to make a considerable circuit in order to reach a certain ravine down which the path would be reasonably easy all remember the shelf and the ravine the question be merely whether the first lay beneath they and as near as daggett suppose a mistaken confidence beset the last and he carry this feeling so far as to decline take a end of a line which roswell throw to he but seat himself on the snow and slide downward pass almost immediately out of sight what have become of he demand roswell endeavor to pierce the air by strain he eye-ball he be not to be see hold on to the line sir and give I the other end of it i will go and see answer stimson it be obviously the most hazardous to remain to the last and descend without the support of one above he roswell acquiesce in this proposal lower the boat-steerer down the rock until he too be hide from he sight but though out of sight in that dense snow-storm stimson be not so distant as to be beyond the reach of the voice go more to the right sir call out the seaman and steady I with the line along with you this be do the walk be sufficiently secure at the elevation where roswell be presently stimson shake the line and call out again that will do captain gar ` ner he say i be on the shelf _ now _ and have pretty good footing lay the line down on the snow sir and slide as slowly as you can mind and keep close at its side i 'll stand by to fetch you up gardiner understand all this perfectly and do as he be desire to do by keep near the line he reach the shelf precisely at the spot where stimson be ready to meet he the latter arrest he downward movement by throw the weight of he own body forward to meet he officer by such a precaution roswell be stop in time else would he have go over the shelf and down a declivity that be so nearly perpendicular as to offer no means of arrest the movement and what have become of captain daggett demand gardiner as soon as on he foot again i fear he have shoot off the rock sir be the answer at the place where i reach this shelf it be so narrow i could with great difficulty walk -- could not indeed have not the line be there to steady I and judge from the mark in the snow the poor man have go down helpless this be appalling intelligence to receive at such a time and in such a place but roswell be not unmanned by it on the contrary he act coolly and with great judgment make a coil of the ratlin-stuff he throw the line down until certain it reach bottom at the distance of about six fathom then he cause stimson to brace himself firmly hold on to the line aid by a turn round a rise in the rock and he boldly lower himself down the precipice reach its base at about the distance he have calculate so to do it still snow violently the flake be large and eddy round the angle of the rock in flurry so violent as at moment to confound all the sens of the young man he be resolute however and bent on a object of humanity as well as of good fellowship living or dead daggett must be somewhere on he present level and he begin to grope he way among the fragment of rock eager and solicitous the roaring of the wind almost prevent he hearing other sound though once or twice he hear or fancy that he hear the shout of stimson from above suddenly the wind cease the snow lessen in quantity soon clear away altogether and the ray of the sun -- and this in the dog-day of that region be it remember -- fall bright and genial on the glittering scene at the next instant the eye of roswell fall on the object of he search daggett have be carry over the narrow shelf on which stimson land in consequence of he have no support or any means of arrest he momentum he do thrust forward he lance or leaping-staff but its point meet nothing but air the fall however be by no means perpendicular several projection of the rock help to lessen it though it be probable that the life of the unfortunate sealer be save altogether by means of the lance this be beneath he as he make he final descent and he slide along it the whole length cant he into a spot where be the only piece of stinted vegetation that be to be see for a considerable distance in consequence of come down on a tolerably thick bunch of furze the fall be essentially break when roswell reach he unfortunate companion the latter be perfectly sensible and quite cool god be thank that you have find I gar ` ner he say at one time i have give it up thank god also that you be live my friend answer the other i expect only to find you body but you do not seem to be much hurt more than appear gar ` ner more than appear my left leg be break certainly and one of my shoulder pain I a good deal though it be neither out of joint or break this be a sad business for a seal v ` y' ge give yourself no concern about you craft daggett -- i will look to she and to you voyage will you stand by the schooner gar ` ner -- promise I that and my mind will be at peace i do promise the two vessel shall stick together at all event until we be clear of the ice ay but that will not do _ my _ sea lion must be fill up as well as you own promise I _ that _ it shall be do god willing but here come stimson the first thing will be to get you out of this spot daggett be obviously relieve by roswell 's pledge for amid the anguish and apprehension of he unexpected state he thought have most keenly advert to he vessel and she fortune now that he mind be somewhat relieve on this score the pain of he body become more sensibly feel the situation of we party be sufficiently embarrassing the leg of daggett be certainly break a little distance above he ancle and various bruise in other place give notice of the existence of other injury to do anything with the poor man lie where he be be out of the question however and the first thing be to remove the sufferer to a more eligible position fortunately it be no great distance to the foot of the mountain and a low level piece of rock be accessible by means of care and steady foot daggett be raise between roswell and stimson in a sit attitude and support himself by put a arm around the neck of each the leg hang down the break as well as the sound limb to this accidental circumstance the sufferer be indebted to a piece of incidental surgery that prove of infinite service to he while dangle in this manner the bone get into its place and daggett instantly become aware of that important fact which be immediately communicate to roswell of course the future mode of proceeding be regulate by this agreeable piece of information sailor be often require to act as physician surgeon and priest it be not often that they excel in either capacity but in consequence of the many thing they be call to turn they hand to it do generally happen that they get to possess a certain amount of address that render they far more dexterous in nearly everything they undertake than the generality of those who be equally stranger to the particular act that be thus to be exercise roswell have set one or two limb already and have a tolerable notion of the manner of treat the case daggett be now seat on a rock at the base of the mountain with he leg still hang down and he back support by another rock no sooner be he thus place than stimson be despatch post-haste for assistance he instruction be full and the honest fellow set off at a rate that promise as early relief as the circumstance would at all allow as for we hero he set about he most important office the instant stimson leave he daggett aid with he counsel and a little by he personal exertion for a seaman do not lie down passively when anything can be do even in he own case bare the limb roswell soon satisfied himself that the bone have work itself into place bandage be instantly apply to keep it there while splint be make it be perhaps a little characteristic that daggett take out he knife and aid in shave down these splint to the necessary form and thickness they be make out of the staff of the broken lance and be soon complete roswell manifest a good deal of dexterity and judgment in apply the splint the handkerchief be use to relieve the pressure in place and rope-yarn from the ratlin stuff furnish the means of secure everything in its place in half a hour roswell have he job complete and that before there be much swell to interfere with he as soon as the broken limb be thus attend to it be carefully raise and lay upon the rock along with its fellow a horizontal position be deem better than one that be perpendicular not less than four painful hour now pass ere the gang of hand from the vessel reach the base of the mountain it come prepared however to transport the sufferer on a hand-barrow that have be use in convey the skin of seal across the rock on this barrow daggett be now carefully place when four man lift he up and walk away with he for a few hundred yard these be then relieve by four more and in this manner be the whole distance to the house pass over the patient be put in he bunk and some attention be bestow on he bruise and other injury glad enough be the sufferer to find himself beneath a roof and in a room that have its comfort or what be deem comfort on a seal voyage as the man be in the dormitory very little of the time except at night he be enable to sleep and roswell have hope as he now tell stimson that a month or six week would set the patient on he foot again he have be a fortunate fellow stephen that it be no worse add roswell on that occasion but for the luck which turn the lance-pole beneath he every bone he have would have be break what you call _ luck _ captain gar ` ner i call _ providence _ be stephen 's answer the good book tell we that not a sparrow shall fall without the eye of divine providence be on it chapter xviii now far he sweep where scarce a summer smile on bhering 's rock or greenland 's naked isle cold on he midnight watch the breeze blow from waste that slumber in eternal snow and waft across the wave ' tumultuous roar the wolf 's long howl from oonalaska 's shore campbell roswell gardiner set about he duty the succeed day with a shade of deep reflection on he brow a crisis have indeed come in he affair and it behoove he to look well to he proceedings daggett 's presence on the island be no longer of any moment to himself or he owner but there remain the secret of the key and of the bury treasure should the two schooner keep together how be he to acquit himself in that part of he duty without admit of a partnership against which he know that every fiber in the deacon 's system whether physical or moral would revolt still he word be pledge and he have no choice but to remain and help fill up the rival sea lion and trust to he own address in get rid of she again as the two vessel proceed north the chief mate of daggett 's craft though a good sealer be a impetuous and reckless man and have more than once find fault with the great precaution use by the order of roswell macy as this officer be call be for make a regular onslaught upon the animal slaying as many as they could at once and then take up the business of cure and trying-out as a regular job he have see such thing do with success and he believe it be the most secure mode of get along ` some of these fine morning ' as he express it ` captain gar ` ner would turn out and find that he herd be off -- go to pasture in some other field ' this be a view of the matter with which roswell do not at all agree he forbearing and cautious policy have produce excellent result so far and he hope it would continue so to do until both schooner be full on the morning when the man next go forth he as leader of both crew therefore we young master renew he admonition point out to the new-comer in particular the great necessity there be of use forbearance and not to alarm the seal more than the work indispensably require the usual number of ay ay 's sir be give in reply and the gang go along the rock seemingly in a good humor to obey these injunction circumstance however be by no means favourable to give roswell the same influence over the vineyard-man as he possess over he own crew he be a young commander and this be he first voyage in that capacity as all well know then there have be rivalry and competition between the two craft which be a feeling not so easily remove next macy feel and even intimate that he be the lawful commander of he own schooner in case in which daggett be disabled and that the latter have no power to transfer he and he people to the authority of any other individual all these point be discuss that day with some freedom particularly among the vineyard-man and especially the last wisely have it be say that the king 's name be a tower of strength they who have the law on they side carry with they a weight of authority that it be not easy to shake by means of pure reasoning on right or wrong man be much inclined to defer to those who be thus armed legal control be ordinarily quite as effective in achieve a victory as have one 's quarrel just in a certain sense authority indeed become justice and we look to its proper exercise as one of the surest means of assert what be right between man and man the _ commodore _ say that the crittur be to be treat delicately say macy laughing as he lance he first seal that morning a young one of the fur species so take up the pet lad and lay it in its cradle while i go look for its mamma a shout of merriment succeed this sally and the man be only so much the more disposed to be rebellious and turbulent in consequence of hearing so much freedom of remark in they officer the child 's in its cradle mr macy return jenkin who be a wag as well as the mate in my judgment the best mode of rock it to sleep will be by knock over all these grim chap that be so plenty in we neighborhood let 'em have it cry macy make a onset on a elephant as he issue the order in a instant the rock at that point of the island be a scene of excitement and confusion hazard who be near at hand succeed in restrain he own people but it really seem as if the vineyard-man be mad a great many seal be kill it be true but twenty be frighten to take refuge in the ocean where one be slay all animal have they alarm cry or if not absolutely cry signal that be understand by themselves occasionally one see a herd or a flock take to its heel or to its wing without any apparent cause but in obedience to some warning that be familiar to they instinct thus must it have be with the seal for the rock be soon desert even at the distance of a league from the scene of slaughter leave hazard and he gang literally with nothing to do unless indeed they return to complete some stowage that remain to be do on board they own craft i suppose you know mr macy all this be contrary to order say hazard as he be lead he own gang back towards the cove you see i be oblige to go in and report report and welcome be the answer i have no commander but captain daggett -- and by the way if you see he hazard just tell he we have make a glorious morning 's work of it ay ay you will have you hand full enough to-day macy but how will it be to-morrow why just as it have be to-day the devil must come up to blow and we be sartain of 'em somewhere along the shore this day 's work be worth any two that i have see since i come upon the island very true but what will to-morrow 's work be worth i will tell captain daggett what you wish I to say however and we will hear he opinion on the subject in my judgment he mean to command he craft till she get back to the hole leg or no leg hazard go he way shake he head ominously as he proceed nor be he much mistaken in what he expect from daggett 's anger that experienced sealer send for he mate and soon give he to understand that he be yet he commander loose and neighbourly as be usually the discipline of one of these partnership vessel there be commonly a man on board who be every way competent to assert the authority give he by the law as well as by he contract macy be send for rebuke and menace with degradation from he station should he again presume to violate he order as commonly happen in case of this nature regret be express by the offender and future obedience promise but the mischief be do seal be no longer the regular systematic pursuit it have be on that island but have become precarious and changeful at time the man meet with good success then day would occur in which not a single creature of any of the different species would be take the vineyard schooner be not more than half-full and the season be fast draw to a close roswell be quite ready to sail and he begin to chafe a little under the extra hazard that be thus impose on himself and he people in the mean time or fully three week after the occurrence of the accident to daggett the injury receive by the wounded man be fast healing the bone have knit and the leg promise in another month to become tolerably sound if not as strong as it have be before the hurt all the bruise be well and the captain of the vineyard craft be just begin to move about a little on crutch a prodigious relief to one of he habit after the confinement to the house by dint of great care he could work he way down on the shelf that stretch like a terrace for two hundred yard beneath the dwelling here he meet roswell on the morning of the sabbath just three week after they unfortunate visit to the mountain each take he seat on a low point of rock and they begin to converse on they respective prospects and on the condition of they vessel and crew stephen be near he officer as usual i believe stimson be right in urge I to give the man they sabbath observe gardiner glance round at the different group in which the man be wash shaving and otherwise get rid of the impurity create by another week of toil they begin anew after a little rest with a better will and steadier hand yes the sabbath _ be _ a great privilege especially to such as be on shore return daggett at sea i make no great account of it : a craft must jog along high day or holiday depend on it the same account be keep of the day captain daggett in the great log-book above whether a man be on or off sounding put in stephen who be privileged ever to deliver he sentiment on such subject the lord be god on the sea as on the land there be a pause for the solemn manner and undoubted sincerity of the speaker produce a impression on he companion little give as they be to think deeply on thing of that nature then roswell renew the discourse turn it on a matter that have be seriously uppermost in he mind for several day i wish to converse with you captain daggett about we prospects and chance he say my schooner be full as you know we could do no more if we stay here another season you be about half-full with a greatly diminish chance of fill up this summer mr macy 's attack on the seal have put you back a month at least and every day we shall find the animal less easy to take the equinox be not very far off and then you know we shall get less and less sun -- so little as to be of no great use to we we want day-light to get through the ice and we shall have a long hundred league of it between we and clear water even be we to get under way to-morrow remember what a serious thing it would be to get catch up here in so high a latitude after the sun have leave we i understand you gardner answer the other quietly though he manner denote a sort of compel resignation rather than any cordial acquiescence in that which he believe he brother master intend to propose you be master of you own vessel and i dare say deacon pratt would be much rejoice to see you come in between shelter island and oyster pond i be but a cripple or i think the vineyard craft would not be many day ' run astarn roswell be provoke but he pride be touch also bite he lip he be silent for a moment when he speak very much to the point but generously and like a man i 'll tell you what it be daggett say we hero good-fellowship be good-fellowship and the flag be the flag it be the duty of all we yankee seaman to stand by the stripe and i hope i be as ready as another to do what i ought to do in such a matter but my owner be a close calculator and i be much inclined to think that he will care less for this sort of feeling than you and i the deacon be never in blue water so i suppose -- he have a charming daughter i believe gar ` ner you mean he niece i suppose answer roswell color the deacon never have any child himself i believe -- at least he have none living mary pratt be he niece it be all the same -- niece or daughter she be comely and will be rich i hear _ well _ i be _ poor _ and what be more a _ cripple _ roswell could have knock he companion down for he perfectly understand the character of the allusion but he have sufficient self-command to forbear say anything that might betray how much he feel it be always easier to work upon the sensitiveness of a spirited and generous-minded man than to influence he by force or apprehension roswell have never like the idea of leave daggett behind he at that season and in that latitude and he relish it still less now that he see a false reason might be attribute to he conduct you certainly do not dream of winter here captain daggett he say after a pause not if i can help it but the schooner can never go back to the vineyard without a full hold the very woman would make the island too hot for we in such a case do you duty by deacon pratt gar ` ner and leave I here to get along as well as i can i shall be able to walk a little in a fortnight and in a month i hope to be well enough to get out among the people and regulate they seal a little myself mr macy will be more moderate with my eye on he a month he who stay here another month may almost make up he mind to stay eight more of they if indeed he ever get away from the group at all a late start be better than a half-empty vessel when you get in to oyster pond gar ` ner i hope you will send a line across to the vineyard and tell 'em all about we another long and brooding pause succeed during which roswell 's mind be make up i will do this with you daggett he say speak like one who have fully decide on he course twenty day longer will i remain here and help to make out you cargo after which i sail whether you get another skin or a thousand this will be remain as long as any prudent man ought to stay in so high a latitude give I you hand gar ` ner i know you have the clear stuff in you and that it would make itself see at the proper moment i trust that providence will favor we -- it be really a pity to lose as fine a day as this especially as the crittur 's be come up on the rock to bask something like old time you 'll gain no great help from that providence you just speak of captain daggett by forget to keep ` holy the sabbath ' say stimson earnestly try forbearance a little and find the good that will come of it he be right say roswell as i know from have do as he advise well we bargain be make for twenty day longer i stay here help you to fill up that will bring we close upon the equinox when i shall get to the northward as fast as i can in that time too i think you will be able to return to duty this then be the settle arrangement roswell feel that he concede more than he ought to do but the feeling of good-fellowship be active within he and he be strongly averse to do anything that might wear the appearance of abandon a companion in he difficulty all this time we hero be fully aware that he be befriend a competitor and he be not without he suspicion that daggett wish to keep he within he view until the visit have be pay to the key nevertheless roswell 's mind be make up he would remain the twenty day and do all he could in that time to help along the voyage of the vineyarder the seal be now continue with more order and method than have be observe under macy 's control the old caution be respect and the work prosper in proportion each night on he return to the house gardiner have a good report to make and that peculiar snap of the eye that denote daggett 's interest in he call be to be again trace in the expression of the vineyarder 's feature a certain proof that he be fast fall into he old train of thought and feeling daggett be never happier than when listen to some account of the manner in which a old elephant or lion have be take or a number of fur-seal have be make to pay they tribute to the enterprise and address of he people as for roswell though he comply with he promise and carry on the duty with industry and success he eye be constantly turn on those sign that denote the advance of the season now he scan the ocean to the northward and note the diminish number as well as lessened size of the float berg proof that the summer and the wave have be at work on they side next he look be on the sun which be make he daily course lower and lower each time that he appear settle rapidly away towards the north as if in haste to quit a hemisphere that be so little congenial to he character the night always cool in that region begin to menace frost and the sign of the decline of the year that come so much later in more temperate climate begin to make themselves apparent here it be true that of vegetation there be so little and that little so meager and of so hardy a nature that in this respect the progress of the season be not to be particularly note but in all other roswell see with grow uneasiness that the latest hour of he departure be fast drawing near the seal go on the while and with reasonable return though the golden day of the business have be seriously interrupted by macy 's indiscretion and disobedience the man work hard for they too foresee the approach of the long night of the antarctic circle and all the risk of remain too long as we have have frequent occasion to use the term ` antarctic ' it may be well here to say a few word in explanation it be not we wish to be understand that these sealer have penetrate literally within that belt of eternal snow and ice but approximatively few navigator so far as we knowledge extend have absolutely go as far south as this wilke do it it be true and other among the late explorer have be equally enterprising and successful the group visit by gardiner on this occasion be quite near to this imaginary line but we do not feel at liberty precisely to give its latitude and longitude to this hour it remain a species of private property and in this age of anti-rentism and other audacious innovation on long-received and venerable rule of conduct we do not choose to be party to any inroad on the rights of individual when invade by the cupidity and ruthless power of number those who wish to imitate roswell must find the island by bold adventure as he reach they for we be tongue-tied on the subject it be enough therefore that we say the group be _ near _ the antarctic circle whether a little north or a little south of it be a matter of no moment as those sea have a general character we shall continue to call-them the antarctic sea with the understanding that include in the term be the nearest water without as well as within the circle glad enough be roswell gardiner when he twenty day be up march be now far advance and the approach of the long night be near the vineyard craft be not full nor be daggett yet able to walk without a crutch but order be issue by gardiner on the evening of the last day for he own crew to knock off seal and to prepare to get under way for home you mind be make up gar ` ner say daggett in a deprecate sort of way as if he still have latent hope of persuade he brother-master to remain a little longer another week would almost fill we up not another day be the answer i have stay too long already and shall be off in the morning if you will take my advice captain daggett you will do the same thing winter come in this latitude very much as spring appear in we own or with a hop skip and a jump i have no fancy to be grope about among the ice after the night get to be longer than the day all true enough gar ` ner all quite true -- but it have such a look to take a craft home and she not full you have a great abundance of provision stop and whale awhile on the false bank as you go north i would much rather stick by you there a whole month than remain here another day you make I narvous talking of the group in this way i be sartain that this bay must remain clear of ice several week longer perhaps it may it be more likely to be so than to freeze up but this will not lengthen the day and carry we safe through the field and berg that we know be drift about out here to the northward there be a hundred league of ocean thereaway daggett that i care for more just now than for all the seal that be leave on these island but talk be useless i go to-morrow if you be wise you will sail in company this settle the matter daggett well know it would be useless to remain without the aid of roswell 's counsel and that of he crew 's hand for macy be not to be trust any more as the leader of a gang of sealer the man have get to be provoke and reckless and have call down upon himself latterly more than one rebuke it be necessary therefore that one of the sea lion should accompany the other the necessary order be issue accordingly and hey for home be the word that now cheerfully pass from mouth to mouth that pleasant idea of home in which be concentrate all that be bless in this life the pale of the christian duty and charity except bring to each mind its particular form of happiness and good the weather-beaten seaman the foot-worn soldier the weary traveller the adventurer in whatever land interest or pleasure may lead equally feel a throb at he heart as he hear the welcome sound of hey for home never be craft prepare for sea with greater rapidity than be the case now with we two sea lion it be true that the oyster-ponder be nearly ready and have be quite so for a fortnight but a good deal remain to be do among the vineyarder the last set themselves to they task with a hearty good-will however and with corresponding result we will leave the house standing for they that come after we say roswell when the last article belong to he schooner be take out of it the deacon have cram we so full of wood that i shall be tempt to throw half of it overboard now we have so much cargo let all stand hazard bunk plank and all for really we have no room for the material even this wood point to a pile of several cord that have be land already to make room for skin and cask that have be bring out in shock must go to the next comer perhaps it may be one of ourselves for we sailor never know what port will next fetch we up i hope it will be old sag sir answer hazard cheerfully for though no great matter of a seaport it be near every man 's home and may be call a sort of door-way to go in and out of the country through a side-door at the best answer roswell with you i trust it will be the next haven that we enter though i shall take the schooner at once in behind shelter island and tie she up to the deacon 's wharf what image of the past and future do these few jocular word awaken in the mind of we young sealer he fancy that he see mary standing in the porch of she uncle 's habitation a witness of the approach of the schooner look wistfully at the still indistinct image of those who be to be see on she deck mary have often do this in she dream again and again have she behold the white sail of the sea lion drive across gardiner 's bay and enter peconic and often have she thus gaze in the weather-worn countenance of he who occupy so much of she thought -- so many of she prayer -- picture through the mysterious image of sleep the object she so well love when wake and where be mary pratt at that day and hour when roswell be thus issue he last order at sealer 's land and what be she occupation and what she thought the difference in longitude between the group and montauk be so trifling that the hour might be almost call identical literally so it be not but mainly so it be there be not the five degree in difference that make the twenty minute in time more than this we be not permit to say on this subject and this be quite enough to give the navigator a pretty near notion of the position of the group as a degree of longitude measure less than twenty-eight statute mile at the polar circle this be come within a day 's run of the spot so far as longitude be concerned and nearer than that we do not intend to carry the over-anxious reader let he curiosity be as lively as it may and where then be mary pratt safe well and reasonably happy in the house of she uncle where she have pass most of she time since infancy the female friend of mariner have always fruitful source of uneasiness in the pursuit itself but mary have no other cause for concern of this nature than what be inseparable from so long a voyage and the sea into which roswell have go she well know that the time be arrive when he be expect to be on he way home and as hope be a active and beguiling feeling she already fancy he to be much advance on he return but a dialogue which take place that very day -- nay that very hour -- between she and the deacon will best explain she view and opinion and expectation it be very extr ` or ` nary mary commence the uncle that gar ` ner do not write if he only know would how a man feel when he property be ten thousand mile off i be sartain he would write and not leave I with so many misgiving in the matter by whom be he to write uncle answer the more considerate and reasonable niece there be no post-office in the antarctic sea nor any traveller to bring letter by private hand but he _ do _ write once and plaguy good news be it that he send we in that letter he do write from rio for there he have the means by my calculation roswell have leave he seal ground some three or four week and must now be as many thou sand mile on he way home d'ye think so gal -- d'ye think so exclaim the deacon he eye fairly twinkle with pleasure that would be good news and if he do not stop too long by the way we might look for he home in less than ninety day from this moment mary smile pensively and a richer color steal into she cheek slowly but distinctly i do not think uncle that roswell gardiner will be very likely to stop on he way to we here on oyster pond be the answer she make i should be sorry to think that the best part of he v ` y' ge may be make in the west ingee and i hope he be not a man to overlook he instruction will roswell be oblige to stop in the west indy uncle sartain -- if he obey he order and i think the young man will do _ that _ but the business there will not detain he long -- mary 's countenance brighten again at this remark -- and should you be right we may still look for he in the next ninety day mary remain silent for a short time but she charming face be illuminate by a expression of heartfelt happiness which however the next remark of she uncle 's have a obvious tendency to disturb should gar ` ner come home successful mary inquire the deacon successful in all thing -- successful in seal and successful in that other matter -- the west ingee business i mean -- but successful in all as i daily pray he may be -- i want to know if you would then have he always suppose that he get back himself unchanged unchanged i shall never be he wife answer mary tremulously but firmly the deacon look at she in surprise for he have never comprehend but one reason why the orphan and penniless mary should refuse so pertinaciously to become the wife of roswell gardiner and that be he own want of means now the deacon love mary more than he be aware of himself but he have never actually make up he mind to leave she the heiress of he estate the idea of parting with property at all be too painful for he to think of make a will and without such a instrument there be other who would have come in for a part of the asset share and share alike as the legal man express it of all this be the deacon fully aware and it occasionally trouble he : more of late than formerly since he feel in he system the unerring sign of decay once have he get so far as to write on a page of foolscap in the name of god aman but the effort prove too great for he and he abandon the undertaking still deacon pratt love he niece and be well incline to see she become the wife of young gar ` ner more especially should the last return successful unchanged repeat the uncle slowly you sartainly would not wish to marry he mary if he be _ change _ i do not mean change in the sense you be think of uncle but we will not talk of this now why should roswell stop in the west indy at all it be not usual for we vessel to stop there no it be not if gar ` ner stop at all it will be on a very _ unusual _ business and one that may make all we fortune -- you 'n as well as he 'n and mine mary i hope that sealer never meddle with the transportation of slave uncle the girl exclaim with a face fill with apprehension i would rather live and die poor than have anything to do with they i see no such great harm in the trade gal but such be not roswell 's ar ` nd in the west ingee it be a great secret the reason of he call there and i will venture to foretell that should he make it and should it turn out successful you will marry he gal mary make no reply well be she assure that roswell have a advocate in she own heart that be plead for he night and day but firm be she determination not to unite herself with one however dear to she who set up he feeble understanding of the nature of the mediation between god and man in opposition to the plainest language of revelation as well as to the prevalent belief of the church since the age that immediately succeed the christian era chapter xix poor child of danger nursling of the storm sad be the woe that wreck thy manly form rock wave and wind the shatter would bark delay thy heart be sad thy home be far away campbell it be about midday when the two sea lion open they canvass at the same moment and prepare to quit sealer 's land all hand be on board every article be ship for which there be room and nothing remain that denote the former presence of man on that dreary island but the desert house and three or four pile of cord-wood that have grow on shelter island and martha 's vineyard and which be now abandon on the rock of the antarctic circle as the topsail be sheet home and the heavy fore-and-aft mainsail be hoist the song of the man sound cheerful and animating ` home ' be in every tone each movement all the order daggett be on deck in full command though still careful of he limb while roswell appear to be everywhere mary pratt be before he mind 's eye all that morning nor do he even once think how pleasant it would be to meet she uncle with a there deacon be you schooner with a good cargo of elephant-oil well chuck off with fur-seal skin the oyster pond craft be the first clear of the ground the breeze be little feel in that cove where usually it do not seem to blow at all but there be wind enough to serve to cast the schooner and she go slowly out of the rocky basin under she mainsail foretopsail and jib the wind be at south-west -- the nor-wester of that hemisphere -- and it be fresh and howling enough on the other side of the island after roswell have make a stretch out into the bay of about a mile he lay he foretopsail flat aback haul over he jib-sheet and put he helm hard down in wait for the other schooner to come out and join he in a quarter of a hour daggett get within hail well call out the last you see i be right garner wind enough out here and more still further from the land we have only to push in among they berg while it be light pick out a clear spot and heave-to during the night it will hardly do for we to travel among so much ice in the dark i wish we have get out earlier that we might have make a run of it by day-light answer roswell ten hour of such a wind in my judgment would carry we well towards clear water the delay could not be help i have so many trap ashore it take time to gather they together come fill away and let we be move now we be under way i be in as great haste as you be yourself roswell comply and away the two schooner go keep quite near to each other have smooth water and still something of a moderate gale in consequence of the proximity and weatherly position of the island the course be towards a spot to leeward where the largest opening appear in the ice and where it be hope a passage to the northward would be find the further the two vessel get from the land the more they feel the power of the wind and the greater be they rate of run daggett soon find that he could spare he consort a good deal of canvass a consequence of he not be full and he take in he topsail though run nearly before the wind he spar would have stand even a more severe strain as the oldest mariner it have be agree between the two master that daggett should lead the way this he do for a hour when both vessel be fairly out of the great bay clear of the group altogether and run off north-easterly at a rate of nearly ten knot in the hour the sea get up as they recede from the land and everything indicate a gale though one of no great violence night be approach and a alpine-like range of iceberg be glowing to the northward under the oblique ray of the setting sun for a considerable space around the vessel the water be clear not even a cake of any sort be to be see and the question arise in daggett 's mind whether he ought to stand on or to heave-to and pass the night well to windward of the berg time be precious the wind be fair the heaven clear and the moon would make its appearance about nine and might be expect to remain above the horizon until the return of day this be one side of the picture the other present less agreeable point the climate be so fickle that the clearness of the sky be not to be depend on especially with a strong south-west wind -- a little gale in fact and a change in this particular might be produce at any moment then it be certain that floe and fragment of berg would be find near if not absolutely among the sublime mountain-like pile that be float about in a species of grand fleet some twenty mile to leeward both of we master indeed all on board of each schooner very well understand that the magnificent array of icy island which lay before they be owe to the current for which it be not always easy to account the clear space be to be attribute to the same cause though there be little doubt that the wind which have now be to the southward fully eight-and-forty hour have contribute to drive the icy fleet to the northward as a consequence of these fact the field-ice must be in the vicinity of the berg and the embarrassment from that source be know always to be very great it require a good deal of nerve for a mariner to run in among danger of the character just describe as the sun be set nevertheless daggett do it and roswell gardiner follow the movement at the distance of about a cable 's length to prevent separation each schooner show a light at the lower yard-arm just as the day be give out its last glimmering as yet however no difficulty be encounter the alpine-looking range be yet quite two hour ' run still to leeward those two hour must be pass in darkness and daggett shorten sail in order not to reach the ice before the moon rise he have endeavor to profit by the light as long as it remain to find a place at which he might venture to enter among the berg but have meet with no great success the opening first see now appear to be close either by means of the drift or by means of the change in the position of the vessel and he no longer think of _ that _ fortune must be trust to in some measure and on he go roswell always closely follow the early hour of that eventful night be intensely dark nevertheless daggett stand down towards the icy range use no other precaution than shorten sail and keep a sharp look-out every five minute the call from the quarter-deck of each schooner to keep a bright look-out be hear unless indeed daggett or roswell be on he own forecastle thus occupy in person no one on board of either vessel thought of sleep the watch have be call as be usual at sea and one half of the crew be at liberty to go below and turn in what be more those small fore-and-aft rig craft be readily enough handle by a single watch and this so much the more easily now that they top-sail be in still not a man leave the deck anxiety be too prevalent for this the least experienced hand in either crew be well aware that the next four-and-twenty hour would in all human probability be decisive of the fate of the voyage both daggett and gardiner grow more and more uneasy as the time for the moon to rise draw near without the orb of night make its appearance a few cloud be drive athwart the heaven though the star twinkle as usual in they diminutive but sublime splendor it be not so dark that object could not be see at a considerable distance and the people of the schooner have no difficulty in very distinctly trace and that not very far ahead the broken outline of the chain of float mountain no alpine pile in very fact could present a more regular or better define range and in some respects more fantastic outline when the berg first break away from they native mooring they form be ordinarily somewhat regular the summit commonly resemble table-land this regularity of shape however be soon lose under the ray of the summer sun the wash of the ocean and most of all by the wear of the torrent that gush out of they own frozen bosom a distinguished navigator of we own time have compare the appearance of these berg after they regularity of shape be lose and they begin to assume the fantastic outline that uniformly succeed to that of a desert town build of the purest alabaster with its edifice crumble under the season and its countless unpeopled street avenue and alley all who have see the sight unite in describe it as one of the most remarkable that come from the lavish hand of nature about nine o'clock on the memorable night in question there be a good deal of fog drive over the ocean to increase the obscurity this render daggett doubly cautious and he actually haul up close to the wind head off well to the westward in order to avoid run in among the berg in greater uncertainty than the circumstance would seem to require of course roswell follow the movement and when the moon first diffuse its mild ray on the extraordinary scene the two schooner be pitch into a heavy sea within less than a mile of the weather-line of the range of berg it be soon apparent that floe or field ice accompany the float mountain and extend so far to the southward of they as to be already within a inconvenient if not hazardous proximity to the two vessel these floe however unlike those previously encounter be much break by the undulation of the wave and seldom exceed a quarter of a mile in diameter while thousand of they be no larger than the ordinary drift ice of we own principal river in the time of a freshet they vicinity to the track of the schooner indeed be first ascertain by the noise they produce in grind against each other which soon make itself audible even above the roaring of the gale both of we master now begin to be exceedingly uncomfortable it be soon quite apparent that daggett have be too bold and have lead down towards the ice without sufficient caution and foresight as the moon rise higher and higher the difficulty and danger to leeward become at each minute more and more apparent nothing could have be more magnificent than the scene which lay before the eye of the mariner or would have produce a deeper feeling of delight have it not be for the lively consciousness of the risk the two schooner and all who be in they unavoidably run by be so near and to windward of such a icy coast if one may use the expression as relate to float body by that light it be very easy to imagine wilke ' picture of a ruin town of alabaster there be arch of all size and order pinnacle without number tower and even statue and column to these be to be add long line of perpendicular wall that it be easy enough to liken to fortress dungeon and temple in a word even the alp with all they peculiar grandeur and certainly on a scale so vastly more enlarged possess no one aspect that be so remarkable for its resemblance to the labor of man compose of a material of the most beautiful transparency and consider as the result of human ingenuity on a scale so gigantic the glacier have often be liken and not unjustly to a frozen sea but here be congeal mountain seemingly hew into all the form of art not by the chisel it be true but by the action of the unerring law which produce they perhaps roswell gardiner be the only individual in those two vessel that night who be fully alive to all the extraordinary magnificence of its unusual picture stephen may in some degree have be a exception to the rule though he see the hand of god in nearly all thing it be wonderful to look at captain gar ` ner be not it say this worthy seaman about the time the light of the moon begin to tell on the view wonderful truly do we not know who make it all these few and simple word have a cheer influence on roswell and serve to increase he confidence in eventual success god do produce all thing either directly or indirectly this even he sceptical notion could allow and that which come from divine wisdom must be intend for good he would take courage and for once in he life trust to providence the most resolute man by nature feel he courage augment by such a resolution the gale of the antarctic sea be say to be short though violent they seldom last six-and-thirty hour and for about a third of that time they blow with they greatest violence as a matter of course the danger amid the ice be much increase by a tempest though a good working breeze or small gale of wind perhaps add to a vessel 's security by render it easier to handle she and to avoid floe and berg if the ice be sufficient to make a lee smooth water be sometimes a consequence though it oftener happen that the turbulence produce in clear water be partially communicate over a vast surface cause the field and mountain to grind against each other under the resistless power of the wave on the present occasion however the schooner be still in open water where the wind have a long and unobstructed rake and a sea have get up that cause both of the little craft to bury nearly to they gunwale what render they situation still more unpleasant be the fact that all the water which come aboard of they now soon freeze to this however the man be accustom it frequently happen that the moisture deposit on they rigging and spar by the fog freeze during the night of the autumn indeed it have be think by some speculator on the subject that the berg themselves be form in part by a similar process though snow undoubtedly be the principal element in they composition this it be which give the berg its stratified appearance no geological formation be more apparent or regular in this particular than most of these float mountain about ten the moon be well above the horizon the fog have be precipitate in dew upon the ice where it congeal and help to arrest the progress of dissolution while the ocean become luminous for the hour and object comparatively distinct then it be that the seaman first get a clear insight into the awkwardness of they situation the bold be apt to be reckless in the dark but when danger be visible they movement become more wary and better calculate than those of the timid when daggett get this first good look at the enormous mass of the field-ice that stir by the unquiet ocean be grind each other and raise a unceasing rush sound like that the surf produce on a beach though far louder and with a harshness in it that denote the collision of substance harder than water he almost instinctively order every sheet to be flatten down and the schooner 's head bring as near the wind as she construction permit roswell observe the change in he consort 's line of sailing slight as it be and imitate the maneuver the sea be too heavy to dream of tack and there be not room to ware so close indeed be some of the cake those that might be call the straggler of the grand array that repeatedly each vessel brush along so near they as actually to receive slight shock from collision with project portion it be obvious that the vessel be set down upon the ice and that daggett do not haul he wind a moment too soon the half-hour that succeed be one of engrossing interest it settle the point whether the schooner could or could not eat they way into the wind sufficiently to weather the danger fragment after fragment be pass blow after blow be receive until suddenly the field-ice appear directly in front it be in vast quantity extend to the southward far as the eye could reach there remain no alternative but to attempt to ware without wait longer than to assure himself of the fact daggett order he helm put up and the main gaff lower at that moment both the schooner be under they jib and foresail each without its bonnet and double-reefed mainsail this be not canvass very favourable for ware there be too much after-sail but the sheet be attend to and both vessel be soon drive dead to leeward amid the foam of a large wave the next instant ice be hear grind along they side it be not possible to haul up on the other tack ere the schooner would be surround by the floe and see a comparatively open passage a short distance ahead daggett stand in boldly follow closely by roswell in ten minute they be fully a mile within the field render all attempt to get out of it to windward so hopeless as to be almost desperate the maneuver of daggett be begin under circumstance that scarcely admit of any alternative though it might be question if it be not the best expedient that offer now that the schooner be so far within the field-ice the water be much less broken though the undulation of the restless ocean be still considerable and the grind of ice occasion by they be really terrific so loud be the noise produce by these constant and violent collision indeed that the roaring of the wind be barely audible and that only at interval the sound be rush like that of a incessant avalanche attend by crack noise that resemble the rending of a glacier the schooner now take in they foresail for the double purpose of diminish they velocity and of be in a better condition to change they course in order to avoid danger ahead these change of course be necessarily frequent but by dint of boldness perseverance and skill daggett work he way into the comparatively open passage already mention it be a sort of river amid the floe cause doubtless by some of the inexplicable current and be fully a quarter of a mile in width straight as a air-line and of considerable length though how long could not be see by moonlight it lead moreover directly down towards the berg then distant less than a mile without stop to ascertain more daggett stand on roswell keep close on he quarter in ten minute they draw quite near to that wild and magnificent ruin city of alabaster that be float about in the antarctic sea notwithstanding the imminent peril that now most seriously menace the two schooner it be not possible to approach that scene of natural grandeur without feeling of awe that be ally quite as much to admiration as to dread apprehension certainly weigh on every heart but curiosity wonder even delight be all mingle in the breast of the crew as the vessel come drive down into the midst of the berg everything contribute to render the movement impose in all sens appalling in one there lay the vast maze of float mountain generally of a spectral white at that hour though many of the mass emit hue more please while some be black as night the passage between the berg or what might be term the street and lane of this mysterious-looking fantastical yet sublime city of the ocean be numerous and of every variety some be broad straight avenue a league in length other wind and narrow while a good many be little more than fissure that might be fancy lane the schooner have not run a league within the berg before they feel much less of the power of the gale and the heaving and setting of the sea be sensibly diminish what be perhaps not to be expect the field-ice have disappear entirely within the passage of the berg and the only difficulty in navigate be to keep in such channel as have outlet and which do not appear to be close the rate of sailing of the two schooner be now greatly lessen the mountain usually intercept the wind though it be occasionally hear howl and scuffle in the ravine as if in a hurry to escape and pass on to the more open sea the grind of the ice too come down in the current of air furnish fearful evidence of danger that be not yet distant as the water be now sufficiently smooth and the wind except at the mouth of particular ravine be light there be nothing to prevent the schooner from approach each other this be do and the two master hold a discourse together on the subject of they present situation you be a bold fellow daggett and one i should not like to follow in a voyage round the world commence roswell here we be in the midst of some hundred of ice-berg a glorious sight to behold i must confess -- but be we ever to get out again it be much better to be here gar ` ner return the other than to be among the floe i be always afraid of my starn and my rudder when among the field-ice whereas there be no danger hereabouts that can not be see before a vessel be on it give I my eye and i feel that i have a chance there be some truth in that but i wish these channel be a good deal wider than they be a man may _ feel _ a berg as well as see it be two of these fellow to take it into they head to close upon we we little craft would be crush like nut in the cracker we must keep a good look-out for that here seem to be a long bit of open passage ahead of we and it lead as near north as we can wish to run if we can only get to the other end of it i shall feel as if half we passage back to ameriky be make the citizen of the united state call he country america _ par excellence _ never use the addition of ` north as be practice by most european people daggett mean ` home ' therefore by he ` ameriky ' in which he see no other than the east end of long island gardiner 's island and martha 's vineyard roswell understand he of course so no breath be lose in my judgment return gardiner we shall not get clear of this ice for a thousand mile not that i expect to be in a wilderness of it as we be to-night but after such a summer you may rely on it daggett that the ice will get as far north as 45 ° if not a few degree further it be possible : i have see it in 42 ° myself and in 40 ° to the nor ` ard of the equator if it get as far as 50 ° however in this part of the world it will do pretty well that will be play to what we have just here -- in the name of divine providence what be that gar ` ner not a voice be hear in either vessel scarcely a breath be draw a heavy groan sound have be instantly succeed by such a plunge into the water as might be imagine to succeed the fall of a fragment from another planet then all the berg near by begin to rock as if agitate by a earthquake this part of the picture be both grand and frightful many of those mass rise above the sea more than two hundred foot perpendicularly and show wall-like surface of half a league in length at the point where the schooner happen to be just at that moment the ice-island be not so large but quite as high and consequently be more easily agitate while the whole panorama be bow and rock pinnacle arch wall and all seem about to totter from they basis there come a wave sweep down the passage that lift they high in the air some fifty foot at least and bear they along like piece of cork fully a hundred yard other wave succeed though of less height and force when gradually the water regain its former and more natural movement and subside this have be a earthquake exclaim daggett that volcano have be pen up and the gas be stir up the rock beneath the sea no sir answer stimson from the forecastle of he own schooner it be not that captain daggett one of they berg have turn over like a whale wallow and it have set all the other a-rocking this be the true explanation one that do not occur to the less experienced sealer it be a danger however of no rare occurrence in the ice and one that ever need to be look to the berg when they first break loose from they native mooring which be do by the agency of frost as well as by the action of the season in the warm month be usually tabular and of regular outline but this shape be soon lose by the action of the wave on ice of very different degree of consistency some be compose of frozen snow some of the moisture precipitate from the atmosphere in the shape of fog and some of pure frozen water the first melt soonest and a berg that drift for any length of time with one particular face expose to the sun 's ray soon lose its equilibrium and be cant with a inclination to the horizon finally the center of gravity get outside of the base when the still monstrous mass roll over in the ocean come literally bottom upward there be all degree and variety of these ice-slip if one may so term they and they bring in they train the many different commotion that such accident would naturally produce that which have just alarm and astonish we navigator be of the follow character a mass of ice that be about a quarter of a mile in length and of fully half that breadth which float quite two hundred foot above the surface of the water and twice that thickness beneath it be the cause of the disturbance it have preserve its outline unusually well and stand upright to the last moment though owe to numerous stratum of snow-ice its base have melt much more on one of its side than on the other when the precise moment arrive that would have carry a perpendicular line from the center of gravity without this base the monster turn leisurely in its lair produce some such effect as would have be work by the fall of a portion of a swiss mountain into a lake a sort of accident of which there have be many and remarkable instance stimson 's explanation while it raise the curtain from all that be mysterious do not serve very much to quiet apprehension if one berg have perform such a evolution it be reasonable to suppose that other might do the same thing and the commotion make by this which be at a distance give some insight into what might be expect from a similar change in another nearer by both daggett and gardiner be of opinion that the fall of a berg of equal size within a cable 's length of the schooner might seriously endanger the vessel by dash they against some wall of ice if in no other manner it be too late however to retreat and the vessel stand on gallantly the passage between the berg now become quite straight reasonably broad and be so situate as regard the gale as to receive a full current of its force it be compute that the schooner run quite three marine league in the hour that succeed the overturn of the berg there be moment when the wind blow furiously and take all the accessory of that remarkable view into the account the scene resemble one that the imagination might present to the mind in its highest flight but which few could ever hope to see with they proper eye the moon-light the crowd of ice-berg of all shape and dimension seem to flit past by the rapid movement of the vessel the variety of hue from spectral white to tint of orange and emerald pale at that hour yet distinct street and lane that be scarce open ere they be pass together with all the fantastic image that such object conjure to the thought contribute to make that hour much the most wonderful that roswell gardiner have ever pass to add to the excitement a couple of whale come blow up the passage come within a hundred yard of the schooner they be fin-back which be rarely if ever take and be suffer to pass unharmed to capture a whale however amid so many berg would be next to impossible unless the animal be kill by the blow of the harpoon without require the keener thrust of the lance at the end of the hour mention the sea lion of the vineyard rapidly change she course haul up by a sudden movement to the westward the passage before she be close and there remain but one visible outlet towards which the schooner slowly make she way have get rather too much to leeward of it in consequence of not earlier see the necessity for the change of course in that dim and deceptive light roswell be to windward have less difficulty but notwithstanding he keep he station on he consort 's quarter decline to lead the passage into which daggett barely succeed in carry he schooner be fearfully narrow and appear to be fast closing though it be much wider further ahead could the schooner but get through the first dangerous strait roswell remonstrate ere the lead vessel enter and point out to daggett the fact that the berg be evidently close each instant increase they movement most probably through the force of attraction it be know that ship be thus bring in contact in calm and it be think a similar influence be exercise on the ice-berg at all event the wind the current or attraction be fast close the passage through which the schooner have now to go scarcely be daggett within the channel when a enormous mass fall from the summit of one of the berg literally close the passage in he wake while it compel gardiner to put he helm down and to tack ship standing off from the totter berg the scene that follow be frightful the cry on board the lead craft denote she peril but it be not possible for roswell to penetrate to she with he vessel all he could do be to heave-to he own schooner lower a boat and pull back towards the point of danger this he do at once manfully but with a anxious mind and throbbing heart he actually urge he boat into the chasm beneath a arch in the fall fragment and make he way to the very side of daggett 's vessel the last be nip again and that badly but be not absolutely lose the fall fragment from the berg alone prevent she and all in she from be ground into powder this block of enormous size keep the two berg asunder and now that they could not absolutely come together they begin slowly to turn in the current gradually open and separate at the very point where they have so lately seem attract to a closer union in a hour the way be clear and the boat tow the schooner stern foremost into the broader passage chapter xx a voice upon the prairie a cry of woman 's woe that mingleth with the autumn blast all fitfully and low mr sigourney the accident to the sea lion of the vineyard occur very near the close of the month of march which in the southern hemisphere correspond to we month of September this be somewhat late for a vessel to remain in so high a latitude though it be not absolutely dangerous to be find there several week longer we have give a glance at mary pratt and she uncle about this time but it have now become expedient to carry the reader forward for a considerable period and take another look at we heroine and she miserly uncle some seven month later in that interval a great change have come over the deacon and he niece and hope have nearly desert all those who have friend on board the sea lion of oyster pond as the follow explanation will show be reasonable and to be expect when captain gardiner sail it be understand that he absence would not extend beyond a single season all who have friend and connection on board he schooner have be assure of this and great be the anxiety and deep the disappointment when the first of we own summer month fail to bring back the adventurer as week succeed week and the vessel do not return the concern increase until hope begin to be lose in apprehension deacon pratt groan in spirit over he loss find little consolation in the gain secure by means of the oil send home as be apt to be the case with the avaricious when they heart be once set on gain as for mary the load on _ she _ heart increase in weight as it might be day by day until those smile which have cause she sweet countenance to be radiant with innocent joy entirely disappear and she be see to smile no more still complaint never pass she lip she pray much and find all she relief in such pursuit as comport with she feeling but she seldom speak of she grief never except at weak moment when she querulous kinsman introduce the subject in he frequent lamentation over he loss the month of November be apt to be stormy on the atlantic coast of the republic it be true that the heaviest gale do not then occur but the weather be generally stern and wintry and the wind be apt to be high and boisterous at a place like oyster pond the gale from the ocean be feel with almost as much power as on board a vessel at sea and mary become keenly sensible of the change from the bland breeze of summer to the sterner blast of autumn as for the deacon he health be actually give way before anxiety until the result be get to be a matter of doubt premature old age appear to have settle on he and he niece have privately consult dr sage on he case the excellent girl be grieve to find that the mind of she uncle grow more worldly he desire for wealth more grasp as he be lose he hold on life and be approach nearer to that hour when time be succeed by eternity all this while however deacon pratt keep about as he express it himself and struggle to look after he interest as have be he practice through life he collect he debt foreclose he mortgage when necessary drive tight bargain for he wood and other saleable article and neglect nothing that he think would tend to increase he gain still he heart be with he schooner for he have expect much from that adventure and the disappointment be in proportion to the former hope one day near the close of November the deacon and he niece be alone together in the keeping-room -- as it be if it be not still the custom among person of new england origin to call the ordinary sitting-apartment -- he bolster up in a easy-chair on account of increase infirmity and she ply the needle in she customary way the chair of both be so place that it be easy for either to look out upon that bay now of a wintry aspect where roswell have last anchor previously to sail what a pleasant sight it would be uncle mary almost unconsciously to herself remark as with tearful eye she sit gaze intently on the water could we only awake and find the sea lion at anchor under the point of gardiner 's island i often fancy that such _ may _ be -- nay _ must _ be the case yet but it never come to pass i would not tell you yesterday for you do not seem to be as well as common but i have get a answer by bait joe to my letter send across to the vineyard the deacon start and half-turn he body towards he niece on whose face he own sunken eye be now fasten with almost ferocious interest it be the love of mammon stir within he the linger remains of covetousness he think of he property while mary thought of those whose life have be endanger if not lose by the unhappy adventure the latter understand the look however so far as to answer its inquiry in she usual gentle feminine voice i be sorry to say sir that no news have be hear from captain daggett or any of he people be the sad reply to this silent interrogatory no one on the island have hear a word from the vineyard vessel since the day before she sail from rio there be the same uneasiness feel among captain daggett 's friend as we feel for poor roswell they think however that the two vessel have keep together and believe that the same fate have befall both heaven forbid exclaim the deacon as sharply as waste lung would allow -- heaven forbid if gar ` ner he let that daggett keep in he company a hour longer than be necessary he have deserve to meet with shipwreck though the loss always fall heaviest on the owner surely uncle it be more cheer to think that the two schooner be together in those dangerous sea than to imagine one alone leave to meet the risk without a companion you talk idly gal -- as woman always talk if you know would all you would not think of such a thing so you have say often uncle and i fear there be some mystery prey all this time on you spirit why not relieve you mind by tell you trouble to I i be you child in affection if not by birth you be a good gal mary answer the deacon a good deal soften by the plaintive tone of one of the gentlest voice that ever fall on human ear a excellent creatur ' at the bottom -- but of course you know nothing of the seal business and next to nothing about take care of property i hope you do not think I wasteful sir that be a character i should not like to possess no not wasteful on the contrary curful -lrb- so the deacon pronounce the word -rrb- and considerate enough as to _ keep _ but awfully indifferent as to _ get _ have i be as indifferent as you be yourself you futur ' day would not be so comfortable and happy as they be now likely to be a ` ter my departure -- if depart i _ must _ my future life happy and comfortable _ think _ mary then she struggle to be satisfy with she lot and contented with the decree of providence it be but a few hour that we live in this state of trial compare to the endless existence that be to succeed it i wish i know all about this voyage of roswell 's she add aloud for she be perfectly certain that there be something to be tell that as yet the deacon have conceal from she it might relieve you mind and lighten you spirit of a burthen to make I a confidant the deacon muse in silence for more than five minute seldom have he thought go over so wide a reach of interest and event in so short a space of time but the conclusion be clear and decide you ought to know all mary and you shall know all he answer in the manner of a man who have make up he mind beyond appeal gar ` ner have go a ` ter seal to some island that the daggett who die here about a year and a half ago tell I of island of which nobody know would anything accord to he account but himself he shipmate that see the place when he see it be all dead afore he let I into the secret i have long suspect something of the sort sir and have also suppose that the people on martha 's vineyard have get some news of this place by the manner in which captain daggett have act be not it wonderful gal island they tell I where a schooner can fill up with ile and skin in the shortest season in which the sun ever shine upon a antarctic summer wonderful wonderful very extraordinary perhaps but we should remember uncle at how much risk the young man of the country go on these distant voyage and how dearly they profit be sometimes buy buy if the schooner would only come back i should think nothing of all that it be the cost of the vessel and outfit mary that weigh so much on _ my _ spirit well gar ` ner 's first business be with they island which be at a awful distance for one to trust he property but ` nothing venture nothing get ' they say by my calculation the schooner have have to go a good five hundred mile among the ice to get to the spot not such ice as a body fall in with in go and come between england and ameriky as we read of in the papers but ice that cover the sea as we sometimes see it pile up in gar ` ner 's bay only a hundred time higher and deeper and broader and colder it be desperate _ cold _ ice the sealer all tell I that of the antarctic sea some on 'em think it be colder down south than it be the other way up towards greenland and iceland itself it be extr ` or ` nary mary that the weather should grow cold as a body journey south but so it be by all account i never could understand it and it be not so in ameriky i be sartain i suppose it must come of they turn the month round and have they winter in the midst of the dog-days i never could understand it though gar ` ner have try more than once to reason I into it i believe but i do not understand it be all tell in my geography here answer mary mechanically take down the book for she thought be far away in those icy sea that she uncle have be so graphically describe i dare say we can find it all explain in the elementary part of this book they _ do _ make they geography useful now-a-day say the deacon with rather more animation than he have show before that morning they have get 'em to be now almost as useful as almanac read what it say about the season child it say sir that the change in the season be owe to ` the inclination of the earth 's axis to the plane of its orbit ' i do not exactly understand what that mean uncle ' no -- it be not as clear as it might be -- the declination -- inclination sir be what be print here ay inclination i do not see why any one should have much inclination for winter but so it must be i suppose the earth 's orbit have a inclination towards change ' you say the change in the season sir be owe to ` the inclination of the earth 's axis to the plane of its orbit ' it do not say that the orbit have a inclination in any particular way thus be it with mary pratt and thus be it with she uncle the deacon one of the plainest problem in natural philosophy be hebrew to both simply because the capacity that providence have so freely bestow on each have never be turn to the consideration of such useful study but while the mind of mary pratt be thus obscure on this simple and to such as choose to give it a hour of reflection perfectly intelligible proposition it be radiant as the day on another mystery and one that have confound thousand of the learn as well as of the unlearned to she intellect nothing be clearer no moral truth more vivid no physical fact more certain than the incarnation of the son of god she have the evidence of thing not see in the fulness of divine grace and be profound on this the greatest concern of human life while unable even to comprehend how the inclination of the earth 's axis to the plane of its orbit could be the cause of the change of the season and be it thus with she uncle -- he who be a pillar of the meeting whose name be often in man 's mouth as a shine light and who have get to be identify with religion in he own neighborhood to a degree that cause most person to think of deacon pratt when they should be think of the savior we be afraid he know as little of one of these proposition as of the other it be very extr ` or ` nary resume the deacon after ruminate on the matter for a few moment but i suppose it _ be _ so be not it for this ` inclination ' to cold weather we vessel might go and seal under as pleasant sky as we have here in June but mary i suppose that be not to be or it would be there would have be no seal most likely uncle if there be no ice they tell I that such creature love the cold and the ice and the frozen ocean too much warm weather would not suit they but mary it might suit other folk gar ` ner 's whole ar ` nd be not among the ice or a ` ter they seal i do not know that i understand you sir surely roswell have go on a seal voyage sartain there be no mistake about _ that _ but there may be many stopping-place in so long a road do you mean sir that he be to use any of these stopping-place as you call they ask mary eagerly half-breathless with she anxiety to hear all you say something about the west indy once harkee mary -- just look out into the entry and see if the kitchen door be shut and now come nearer to I child so that there may be no need of bawl what i have get to say all over oyster pond there sit down my dear and do not look so eager as if you want to eat I or my mind may misgive I and then i could not tell you a ` ter all perhaps it would be best if i be to keep my own secret not if it have anything to do with roswell dear uncle not if it have anything to do with he you have often advise I to marry he and i ought to know all about the man you wish I to marry yes gar ` ner will make a right good husband for any young woman and i _ do _ advise you to have he you be my brother 's da ` ghter mary and i give you this advice which i should give you all the same have you be my own child instead of he 'n yes sir i know that -- but what about roswell and he have to stop on he way home why you must know mary that this v ` y' ge come altogether out of that seaman who die among we last year i be kind to he as you may remember and help he to many little odd comfort -- odd enough be they of a verity -- and he be grateful of all virtue give I gratitude say i it be the noblest as it be the most oncommon of all we good quality how little have i meet with in my day of all the present i have make and gift bestow and good act do not one in ten have ever meet with any gratitude mary sigh for well do she know how little he have give of he abundance to relieve the want of he fellow-creature she sigh too with a sort of mild impatience that the information she seek with so much eagerness be so long and needlessly delay but the deacon have make up he mind to tell she all yes gar ` ner have get something to do beside seal he resume of himself when he regret at the prevalence of ingratitude among man have exhaust itself suthin ' -- for this be the way he pronounce that word -- that be of more importance than the schooner 's hold full of ile ile be ile i know child but gold be gold what do you think of _ that _ be roswell then to stop at rio again in order to sell he oil and send the receipt home in gold better than that -- much better than that if he get back at all mary feel a chill at she heart yes that be the p ` int -- if he get back at all if gar ` ner ever do come home child i shall expect to see he return with a considerable size keg -- almost a barrel by all account -- fill with gold the deacon stare about he as he make this announcement like a man who be afraid that he be tell too much nevertheless it be to he own niece he brother 's daughter that he have confide thus much of he great secret -- and reflection re-assure he how be roswell to get all this gold uncle unless he sell he cargo mary ask with obvious solicitude that be another p ` int i 'll tell you all about it gal and you 'll see the importance of keep the secret this daggett -- not the one who be out in another schooner another sea lion as it might be but he uncle who die down here at the widow white 's -- well _ that _ daggett tell more than the latitude and longitude of the seal island -- he tell I of a bury treasure bury treasure -- bury by whom and consist of what uncle bury by seaman who make free with the goods of other on the high sea ag ` in the time when they might come back and dig it up and carry it away to be use consist of what indeed consist principally accordin ' to daggett 's account of heavy doubloon though there be a lot of old english guinea among 'em yes i remember that he speak of they guinea -- three thousand and odd and nearly as many doubloon be daggett then a pirate sir -- for they who make free with the goods of other on the high sea be neither more nor less than pirate no not he himself he get this secret from one who _ be _ a pirate however and who be a prisoner in a gaol where he be himself confine for smuggling yes that man tell he all about the bury treasure in return for some act of kindness show he by daggett it be well to be kind sometimes mary it be well to be kind always sir even when it be misunderstand and the kindness be abused what be the redemption but kindness and love and god-like compassion on those who neither understand it nor feel it but money collect and bury by pirate can never become _ yours _ uncle nor can it ever become the property of roswell gardiner whose be it then gal demand the deacon sharply gar ` ner have some such silly notion in he head when i first tell he of this treasure but i soon bring _ he _ to hear reason i think roswell must always have see that a treasure obtain by robbery can never justly belong to any but its rightful owner and who be this rightful owner pray or _ owner _ i might say for the gold be pick up here and there out of all question from many hand now suppose gar ` ner get this treasure as i still hope he may though he be a awful time about it -- but suppose he get it how be he to find the rightful owner there it be a bag of doubloon say -- all look just alike with the head of a king a don somebody and the date and the latin and greek -- now who can say that ` this be my doubloon i lose it at such a time -- it be take from I by such a pirate in such sea and i be whip till i tell the thief where i have hide the gold ' no no mary depend on ' t no action of ` plevy would lie ag ` in a single one of all they piece they be lose one and all to they former owner and will belong to the man that succeed in get hold on 'em ag ` in who will become a rightful owner in he turn all property come from law and if the law will not ` plevy money get in this way nobody can maintain a claim to it i should be very very sorry my dear uncle to have roswell enrich himself in this way you talk like a silly young woman and one that do not know she own rights we have no hand in rob the folk of they gold they lose it year ago and may be dead -- probably be or they would make some stir about it -- or have forget it and could not for they life tell a single one of the coin they once have in they possession and do not know whether what they lose be throw into the sea or bury in the sand on a key -- mary child you must never mention anything i tell you on this subject you need fear nothing sir from I but i do most earnestly hope roswell will have nothing to do with any such ill-gotten wealth he be too noble-hearted and generous to get rich in this way well well say no more about it child you be romantic and notional just pour out my drop for all this talk make I breathe thick i be not what i be mary and can not last long but be it the last breath i draw i would stand to it that treasure desart and find in this way belong to the last holder i go by the law however let gar ` ner only find it -- well well i 'll say no more about it now for it distress you and that i do not like to see go and hunt up the spectator child and look for the whaling news -- perhaps there may be suthin ' about the sealer too mary do not require to be tell twice to do as she uncle request the paper be soon find and the column that contain the marine intelligence consult the niece read a long account of whaler speak with so many hundred or so many thousand barrel of oil on board but could discover no allusion to any sealer at length she turn she eye into the body of the journal which be semi-weekly or tri-weekly be crowd with matter and start at see a paragraph to the following effect : -- by the arrival of the twin sister at stonington we learn that the ice have be find farther north in the southern hemisphere this season than it have be know to be for many year the sealer have have a great deal of difficulty in make they way through it and even vessel bind round the cape of good hope have be much embarrass by its presence that be it -- yes mary that be just it exclaim the deacon it be that awful ice if 'twa not for the ice sealin ' would be as pleasant a call as preachin ' the gospel it be possible that this ice have turn gar ` ner back when he have be on he way home and that he have be wait for a better time to come north there be one good p ` int in this news -- they tell I that when the ice be see drift about in low latitudes it be a sign there be less of it in the higher the cape of good hope be certainly in one sense in a low latitude uncle if i remember right it be not as far south as we be north and as you say it _ be _ a good sign if the ice have come anywhere near it i do not say it have child i do not say it have but it may have come to the northward of cape horn and that will be a great matter for all the ice that be drift about there come from the polar sea and be so much take out of gardner 's track still he must come _ through _ it to get home return mary in she sweet melancholy tone ah why can not man be content with the blessing that providence place within we immediate reach that they must make distant voyage to accumulate other you like you tea i fancy mary pratt -- and the sugar in it and you silk and ribbon that i have see you wear how be you to get such matter if there be to be no go on v ` y' ge tea and sugar and silk and satin do not grow along with the clam on ` yster pond ' -- for so the deacon uniformly pronounce the word ` oyster ' mary acknowledge the truth of what be say but change the subject the journal contain no more that related to seal or sealer and it be soon lay aside it may be that gar ` ner be digging for the bury treasure all this time the deacon at length resume that may be the reason he be so late if so he have nothing to dread from ice i understand you sir that this money be suppose to be bury on a key -- in the west indy of course do not speak so loud mary -- there be no need of let all ` yster pond know where the treasure be it may be in the west ingee or it may not there be key all over the ` arth i take it do you not think uncle that roswell would write if detain long among those key you would not hear to post-office in the antarctic ocean and now you want to put they on the sand-key of the west ingee woman 's always a sailin ' ag ` in wind and tide i do not think so sir in this case at least there must be many vessel pass among the key of the west indy and nothing seem to I to be easier than to send letter by they i be quite sure roswell would write if in a part of the world where he think what he write would reach we not he -- not he -- gar ` ner be not the man i take he for if he let any one know what he be about in they key until he have do up all he business there no no mary we shall never hear from he in that quarter of the world it may be that gar ` ner be a digging about and have difficulty in find the place for daggett 's account have some weak spot in it mary make no reply though she think it very little likely that roswell would pass month in the west indy employ in such a pursuit without find the means of let she know where he be and what he be about the intercourse between these young people be somewhat peculiar and ever have be in listen to the suit of roswell mary have yield to she heart in hesitate about accept he she defer to she principle usually a mother -- not a managing match-making interested parent but a prudent feminine well-principled mother -- be of the last importance to the character and well-being of a young woman it sometimes happen however that a female who have no parent of she own sex and who be early make to be dependent on herself if the bias of she mind be good become as careful and prudent of herself and she conduct as the advice and solicitude of the most tender mother could make she such have be the case with mary pratt perfectly conscious of she own desert situation high principled and early awake to the defect in she uncle 's character she have lay down severe rule for the government of she own conduct and from these rule she never depart thus it be that she permit roswell to write though she never answer he letter she permit he to write because she have promise not to shut she ear to he suit so long as he practice towards she he native and manly candor conceal none of he opinion and confess he deficiency on the one great point that form the only obstacle to they union a young woman who have no mother if she escape the ill attendant on the privation while she character be form be very apt to acquire quality that be of great use in she future life she learn to rely on herself get accustomed to think and act like a accountable being and be far more likely to become a reasoning and useful head of a family than if bring up in dependence and under the control of even the best maternal government in a word the bias of the mind be sooner obtain in such circumstance than when other do so much of the think whether that bias be in a right or in a wrong direction but mary pratt have early take the true direction in all that relate to opinion and character and have never be want to herself in any of the distinctive and discreet deportment of she sex we heroine hardly know whether or not to seek for consolation in she uncle 's suggestion of roswell 's be detain among the key in order to look for the hidden treasure the more she reflect on this subject the more do it embarrass she few person who know of the existence of such a deposit would hesitate about take possession of it and once reclaim in what way be the best intention to be satisfy with the disposition of the gold to find the owner would probably be impossible and a question in casuistry remain mary ponder much on this subject and come to the conclusion that be she the person to whom such a treasure be commit she would set aside a certain period for advertising and fail to discover those who have the best claim to the money that she would appropriate every dollar to a charity alas little do mary understand the world the fact that money be thus advertise would probably have bring forward a multitude of dishonest pretender to have be rob by pirate and scarce a doubloon would have find its way into the pocket of its right owner even have she yield all to the statement of such claimant all this however do not bring back the miss roswell another winter be fast approach with its chill storm and gale to awaken apprehension by keep the turbulence of the ocean as it might be constantly before the sens not a week now pass that the deacon do not get a letter from some wife or parent or sister or perhaps from one who hesitate to avow she relation to the absent mariner all inquire after the fate of those who have sail in the sea lion of oyster pond under the order of captain roswell gardiner even those of the vineyard send across question and betray anxiety and dread in the very manner of put they interrogatory each day do the deacon 's apprehension increase until it be obvious to all around he that this cause unite to other that be more purely physical perhaps be seriously undermine he health and menace he existence it be a sad commentary on the greediness for gain manifest by this person that ere the adventure he have undertake on the strength of daggett 's reluctant communication be bring to any apparent result he himself be nearly in the condition of that diseased seaman with as little prospect of be benefit by he secret as be the man himself who first communicate they existence mary see all this clearly and mourn almost as much over the blindness and worldliness of she uncle as she do over the now nearly assure fate of he whom she have so profoundly love in she heart 's core day by day do time roll on without bring any tiding of either of the sea lion the deacon grow weak fast until he seldom leave he room and still more rarely the house it be now that he be induce to make he will and this by a agency so singular as to deserve be mention the rev mr whittle broach the subject one day not with any interested motive of course but simply because the meeting-house want some material repair and there be a debt on the congregation that it might be a pleasure to one who have long stand in the relation to it that deacon pratt fill to pay off when he no longer have any occasion for the money for himself it be probable the deacon at length feel the justice of this remark for he send to riverhead for a lawyer and make a will that would have stand even the petulant and envious justice of the present day a justice that incline to divide a man 's estate infinitesimally lest some heir become a little richer than he neighbor after all no small portion of that which strut about under the aspect of right and liberty and benevolence be in truth derive from some of the most sneak propensity of human nature chapter xxi i too have see thee on thy surge path when the night-tempest meet thee thou didst dash thy white arm high in heaven as if in wrath threaten the angry sky thy wave do lash the labor vessel and with deadening crash rush madly forth to scourge its groan side onward thy billow come to meet and clash in a wild warfare till the lift tide mingle they yesty top where the dark storm-cloud ride percival the first movement of the mariner when he vessel have be bring in collision with any hard substance be to sound the pump this very necessary duty be in the act of performance by daggett in person even while the boat of roswell gardiner be tow he strained and roughly treat craft into the open water the result of this examination be wait for by all on board include roswell with the deepest anxiety the last hold the lantern by which the height of the water in the well be to be ascertain the light of the moon scarce sufficing for such a purpose daggett stand on the top of the pump himself while gardiner and macy be at its side at length the sounding-rod come up and its lower end be hold out in order to ascertain how high up it be wet well what do you make of it gar ` ner daggett demand a little impatiently water there must be for no craft that float could have stand such a squeeze and not have she side open there must be near three foot of water in you hold answer roswell shake he head if this go on captain daggett it will be hard work to keep you schooner afloat afloat she shall be while a pump-break can work here rig this larboard pump at once and get it in motion it be possible that you seam open under the nip and have close again as soon as the schooner get free in such a case ten minute at the pump will let we know it although there be no duty to which seaman be so averse as pump -- none perhaps that be actually so exhausting and laborious -- it often happen that they have recourse to it with eagerness as the only available means of save they life such be now the case the harsh but familiar stroke of the pump-break be audible amid the more solemn and grand sound of the grate of ice-berg the rush of floe and the occasional scuffling and howling of the wind the last appear to have change in they direction however a circumstance that be soon note there be much less of bite cold in the blast than have be feel in the earlier hour of the night i do believe that the wind have get round here to the north-east say roswell as he pace the quarter-deck with daggett still hold in he hand the well wipe and dry sounding-rod in readiness for another trial that last puff be right in we tooth not in we tooth gar ` ner no not in _ my _ tooth answer daggett whatever it maybe in _ you ` n _ i shall try to get back to the island where i shall endeavor to beach the schooner and get a look at she leak this be the _ most _ i can hope for it would never do to think of carry a craft after such a nip as far as rio pump every foot of the way that will cause a great delay captain daggett say roswell doubtingly we be now well in among the first great body of the ice it may be as easy to work we way to the northward of it as to get back into clear water to the southward i dare say it would but back i go i do not ask you to accompany we gar ` ner by no mean a ` ter the handsome manner in which you have wait for we so long i could not think of such a thing if the wind have r ` ally get round to nothe-east and i begin to think it have i shall get the schooner into the cove in four-and-twenty hour and there be as pretty a spot to beach she just under the shelf where we keep we spare cask as a body can wish in a fortnight we 'll have she leak all stop and be jogging along in you wake you 'll tell the folk on oyster pond that we be a-coming and they 'll be sure to send the news across to the vineyard this be touch roswell on a point of honor and daggett know it very well generous and determine the young man be much more easily influence by a silent and indirect appeal to he liberal quality than he could possibly have be by any other consideration the idea of desert a companion in distress in a sea like that in which he be cause he to shrink from what under other circumstance he would regard as a imperative duty the deacon and still more mary call he north but the necessity of the vineyarder would seem to chain he to they fate let we see what the pump tell we now cry roswell impatiently perhaps the report may make matter better than we have dare to hope for if the pump gain on the leak all may yet be well it be encouraging and hearty to hear you say this but no one who be _ in _ that nip as a body might say can ever expect the schooner to make a run of two thousand mile without repair to my eye gar ` ner these berg be separate leave we a clearer passage back to the open water i do believe you be right but it seem a sad loss of time and a great risk to go through these mountain again return roswell the wind have shift and the nearest berg from some cause or other be slowly open but recollect what a mass of floe-ice there be outside let we sound again the process be renew this time much easier than before the box be already remove the result be soon know well what news gar ` ner demand daggett lean down in a vain endeavor to perceive the almost imperceptible mark that distinguish the wet part of the rod from that which be dry do we gain on the leak or do the leak gain on we god send it may be the first god have so send it sir answer stimson reverently for he be hold the lantern have remain on board the damage vessel by the order of he officer it be he alone captain daggett who could do this much to seamen in distress then to god be thanks as be due if we can but keep the leak under the schooner may yet be save i think it may be do daggett add roswell that one pump have bring the water down more than two inch and in my judgment the two together would clear she entirely we 'll pump she till she suck cry daggett rig the other pump man and go to the work heartily this be do though not until roswell order fully half of he own crew to come to the assistance of he consort by this time the two vessel have fill away make more sail and be run off before the new wind retrace they step so far as one might judge of the position of the great passage daggett 's vessel lead and hazard follow roswell still remain on board the injured craft thus pass the next few hour the pump soon suck and it be satisfactorily ascertain that the schooner could be free from the water by work at they about one-fourth of the time this be a bad leak and one that would have cause any crew to become exhaust in the course of a few day as roswell ascertain the fact more clearly he become better satisfy with a decision that in a degree have be force on he he be passively content to return with daggett convince that take the injured vessel to rio be out of the question until some attention have be pay to she damages fortune -- or as stimson would say providence -- favor we mariner greatly in the remainder of they run among the berg there be several avalanche of snow quite near to they and one more berg perform a revolution at no great distance but no injury be sustain by either vessel as the schooner get once more near to the field-ice roswell go on board he own craft and all the boat which have be tow in the open passage be run up and secure gardiner now lead leave he consort to follow as closely in he wake as she could keep much greater difficulty and danger indeed be encounter among the broken and grating floe than have be expect or previously meet with notwithstanding fender be get out on all side many a rude shock be sustained and the copper suffer in several place once or twice roswell apprehend that the schooner would be crush by the pressure on they side the hazard be in some measure increase by the bold manner in which we navigator feel themselves call on to push ahead for time be very precious in every sense not only on account of the wane season but actually on account of the fatigue undergo by man who be compel to toil at the pump one minute in every four at the return of day now get to be later than it have be during the early month of they visit to these sea we adventurer find themselves in the center of vast field of float ice drive away from the berg which influence by under-current be still float north while the floe drive to the southward it be very desirable to get clear of all this cake-ice though the grind among it be by no means as formidable as when the sea be run high and the whole of the frozen expanse be in violent commotion motion however soon become nearly impossible except as the schooner drift in the midst of the mass which be float south at the rate of about two knot thus pass a entire day and night so compact be the ice around they that the mariner pass from one vessel to the other on it with the utmost confidence no apprehension be feel so long as the wind stand in its present quarter the fleet of berg actually form as good a lee as if they have be so much land on the morning of the second day all this suddenly change the ice begin to open why be matter of conjecture though it be attribute to a variance between the wind and the current this in some measure liberate the schooner and they begin to move independently of the floe about noon the smoke of the volcano become once more visible and before the sun go down the cap of the highest elevation in the group be see amid flurry of snow every one be glad to see these familiar land-mark dreary and remote from the haunt of man as they be know to be for there be a promise in they of a temporary termination of they labor incessant pump -- one minute in four be thus employ on board the vineyard craft -- be produce its customary effect and the man look jade and exhaust no one who have not stand at a pump-break on board a vessel can form any notion of the nature of the toil or of the extreme dislike with which seaman regard it the tread-mill as we conceive -- for we experience extend to the first though not to the last of these occupation -- be the nearest approach to the pain of such toil though the convict do not work for he life on the morning of the fourth day we mariner find themselves in the great bay in clear water about a league from the cove and nearly dead to windward of they port the helm be put up and the schooner be soon within the well-known shelter as they run in roswell gaze around he in regret awe and admiration he could not but regret be compel to lose so much precious time at that particular season short as have be he absence from the group sensible change in the aspect of thing have already occur every sign of summer -- and they have ever be few and meager -- be now lose a chill and dreary autumn have succeed as a matter of course nothing be alter about the dwelling the pile of wood and other object place there by the hand of man remain just as they have be leave but even these look less cheer more unavailable than when last see to the surprise of all not a seal be visible from some cause unknown to the man all of these animal have disappear thereby defeat one of daggett 's secret calculation this provident master have determine in he own mind to profit by he accident and seize the occasion to fill up some say that the creature have go north to winter other assert that they have be alarm and have take refuge on one of the other island but all agree in say that they be go it be know that a seal will occasionally wander a great distance from what may be consider he native water but we be not at all aware that they be to be consider as migratory animal the larger species usually take a wide range of climate to dwell in and even the little fur-seal sometimes get astray and be find on coast that do not usually come within he haunt as respects the animal that so lately abound on sealer 's land we shall hazard no theory we business be principally with fact but a conversation that take place between the two chief mate on this occasion may possibly assist some inquire mind in its speculation well macy say hazard point along the desert rock what do you think of _ that _ not a animal to be see where there be lately thousand what do i think of it -- why i think they be off and i have know would such thing to happen afore -- the sealer of 1819 be not very particular about they english even among they officer -- any man who watch for sign and symptom may know how to take this i should like to hear it explain to I it be quite new the seal be off and that be a sign _ we _ should be off too there be my explanation and you may make what you please of it natur ' give such hint and no prudent seaman ought to overlook 'em i say that when the seale go the sealer should go likewise and you set this down as a hint from natur ' as you call it i do and a useful hint it be if we be in sailing trim i would ha ` nt the old man but i would get he off this bless night now mark my word hazard -- no good will come of that nip and of this return into port ag ` in and of all this veer and haul upon cargo the other mate laugh but a call from he command officer put a stop to the dialogue hazard be want to help secure the schooner of daggett in the berth in which she be now place the tide do not appear to rise and fall in very high latitudes by any means as much as it do in about 50 ° in the antarctic sea they be report to be but of medium elevation and force this fact we navigator have note and daggett have at once carry he schooner on the only thing like a beach that be to be find on any part of that wild coast he craft be snug within the cove and quite handy for discharge and take in beach in a proper sense it be not be with a very trifling exception nothing but a shelf of rock that be a little inclined and which admit of a vessel 's be place upon it as on the floor of a dock into this berth daggett take he schooner while the other vessel anchor there be nearly a whole day before they and all the man be at once set to work to discharge the cargo of the injured vessel to get rid of the pump they would cheerfully have work the twenty-four hour without intermission as fast as the vessel be lighten she be heave further and further on the rock until she be get so high as to be perfectly safe from sink or from injure anything on board she when the pump be abandon before night come however the schooner be so secure by means of shore and purchase aloft that be carry out to the rock as to stand perfectly upright on she keel she be thus protect when the tide leave she at low water it be find that she want eight foot of be high and dry have already be lighten four foot a good deal of cargo be still in on this the first night after she return the crew of daggett 's vessel carry they mattress ashore take possession of the bunk light a fire in the stove and make they preparation to get the camboose ashore next day and do they cooking in the house as have be practice previously to quit the island roswell and all he people remain on board they own vessel the succeed day the injured schooner be clear of everything even to she spar the lower mast and bowsprit except two large seal crew make quick work with so small a craft empty cask be get under she and at the top of the tide she be float quite up to the small beach that be compose of the _ débris _ of rock already mention as the water leave she she fall over a little of course and at half-tide she keel lay high and dry the prying eye of all hand be now busy look out for the leak as might have be expect none be find near the garboard streak a fact that be clearly enough prove by a quantity of the water remain in the vessel after she lay entirely bare nearly on she bilge she seam have open a few streak below the bend say roswell as he and daggett go under the vessel 's bottom look out for injury and you have better set about get off the copper at once have there be a examination make inside none have yet be make and we two master clamber up to the main hatch and get as good a look at the state of thing in the hold as could be thus obtain so tremendous have be the pressure that three of the deck beam be break they would have be drive quite clear of they fastening have not the wall of ice at each end prevent the possibility of such a thing as it be the top-timber have slightly give way and the seam must have open just below the water-line when the tide come in again the schooner right of course and the opportunity be take to pump she dry there be then no leak another proof that the defective place must be seek above the present water-line with the knowledge thus obtain the copper be remove and several of the seam examine the condition of the pitch and oakum point out the precise spot that need attention and the caulking-iron be immediately set at work in about a week the job be complete as be fancy the copper re-placed and the schooner be get afloat again great be the anxiety to learn the effect of what have be do and quite as great the disappointment when it be find that there be still a serious leak that admit too much water to think of go to sea until it be stop a little head-work however and that on the part of roswell speedily give a direction to the search that be immediately set on foot this leak be not as low down as the vessel 's bilge he say for the water do not run out of she nor into she until we get she afloat it be somewhere then between she light-water load-line and she bilge now we have have all the copper off and the seam examine in the wake of this section of the vessel 's bottom from the fore-chain to the main and in my judgment it will be find that something be wrong about she stem or she stern-post perhaps one of she wood-end have start such a thing might very well have happen under so close a squeeze in which case we shall have to lay the craft ashore again and go to work anew answer daggett i see how it be you do not like the delay and be think of deacon pratt and oyster pond i do not blame you gar ` ner and shall never whisper a syllable ag ` in you or you people if you sail for home this very afternoon leave I and mine to look out for ourselves you have stand by we nobly thus far and i be too thankful for what you have do already to ask for more be daggett sincere in these profession to a certain point he be while he be only artful on other he wish to appear just and magnanimous while in secret it be he aim to work on the better feeling as well as on the pride of gardiner and thus secure he service in get he own schooner ready as well as keep he in sight until a certain key have be examine in the proceeds of which he conceive he have a share as well as in those of sealer 's land strange as it may seem even in the strait in which he be now place with so desperate a prospect of ever get he vessel home again this man cling like a leech to the remotest chance of obtain property there be a bull-dog tenacity on this subject among a certain portion of the great american family -- the god-like anglo-saxon -- that certainly lead to great result in one respect but which it be often painful to regard and never agreeable to any but themselves to be subject to of this school be daggett whom no danger no toil no thought of a future could divert from a purpose that be color by gold we do not mean to say that other nation be not just as mercenary many be more so those in particular that have long be corrupt by vicious government you may buy half a dozen frenchman for instance more easily than one yankee but let the last actually get he tooth into a dollar and the muzzle of the ox fare worse in the jaw of the bull-dog roswell be deeply reluctant to protract he stay in the group but professional pride would have prevent he from desert a consort under such circumstance have not a better feeling inclined he to remain and assist daggett it be true the last have in a manner thrust himself on he and the connection have be strangely continue down to that moment but this he view as a dispensation of providence to which he be bind to submit the result be a declaration of a design to stand by he companion as long as there be any hope of get the injured craft home this decision point at once to the delay of another week no time be lose in vain regret however but all hand go to work to get the schooner into shallow water again and to look further for the principal leak accurate trim and pump show that a good deal of the water be already stop out but too much still enter to render it prudent to think of sailing until the injury be repair this time the schooner be not suffer to lie on she bilge at all she be take into water just deep enough to permit she to stand upright sustain by shore while the tide leave two or three streak dry forward it be the intention to wind she should the examination forward not be successful on strip off the copper it be find that a wood-end have indeed start the inner edge of the plank have get as far from its bed as where the outer have be originally place this open a crack through which a small stream of water must constantly pour each hour render the leak more dangerous by loosen the oakum and raise the plank from its curvature once discover however nothing be easier than to repair the damage it remain merely to butt-bolt anew the wood-end drive a few spike cork and replace the copper roswell who be get each moment more and more impatient to sail be much vex at a delay that really seem unavoidable as it arise from the particular position of the leak place as it be in a manner between wind and water it be not possible to work at it more than a hour each tide and the staging permit but two hand to be busy at the same time as a consequence of these embarrassment no less than six tide come in and go out before the stem be pronounced tight again the schooner be then pump out and the vessel be once more take into deep water this time it be find that the patience and industry of we sealer be reward with success no leak of any account exist she be as tight as a bottle with a seal cork gar ` ner cry daggett a few hour after he craft be at she anchor meet he brother-master at he own gangway and shake hand with he cordially i owe much of this to you as all on the vineyard shall know if we ever get home ag ` in i be rejoice that it turn out so captain daggett be roswell 's reply for to own the truth to you the fortnight we have lose or shall lose before we get you stow and ready to sail again have make a great change in we weather the day be shorten with frightful rapidity and the great bay be actually cover with a skim of ice this very morning the wind have send in a sea that have break it up but look about you in the cove here -- a boy might walk on that ice near the rock there 'll be none of it leave by night and the two crew will fill I up in twenty-four hour keep a good heart gar ` ner i 'll take you clear of the berg in the course of the week i have less fear of the berg now than of the new ice and the floe the island must have get pretty well to the northward by this time but each night get colder and the field seem to be set back towards the group instead of away from it daggett cheer he companion by a good deal of confident talk but roswell be heartily rejoice when at the end of four-and-twenty hour more the vineyard craft be pronounced entirely ready it be near the close of the day and gardiner be for sailing or move at once but daggett offer several very reasonable objection in the first place there be no wind and roswell 's proposition to tow the schooner out into the middle of the bay be meet by the objection that the people have be hard at work for several day and that they need some rest all that could be gain by move the schooner then be to get they outside of the skim of ice that now regularly form every still night near the land but which be as regularly break and disperse by the wave as soon as the wind return roswell however do not like the appearance of thing and he determine to take he own craft outside let daggett do as he might after discuss the matter in vain therefore and find that the people of the other schooner have eat they supper and turn in he call all hand and make a short address to he own crew leave it to they discretion whether to man the boat or not as roswell have point out the perfect absence of wind the smoothness of the water and the appearance of a severe frost or cold for frost there be now almost at mid-day the man come reluctantly over to he view of the matter and consent to work instead of sleep the toil however could be much lessen by divide the crew into the customary watch all that roswell aim at be to get he schooner about a league from the cove which would be take she without a line draw from cape to cape the greatest danger of new ice be within the curvature of the crescent this he think might easily be do in the course of a few hour and should there come any wind much sooner on explain this to the crew the man be satisfied roswell gardiner feel as if a load be take off he spirit when he schooner be clear of the ground and he mainsail be hoist a boat be get ahead and the craft be slowly tow out of the cove the canvass do neither good nor harm as the vessel pass that of daggett the last be on deck the only person visible in the vineyard craft he wish he brother-master a good night promise to be out as soon as there be any light next morning it would not be easy to imagine a more dreary scene than that in which deacon pratt 's schooner move out into the water that separate the different island of this remote and sterile group roswell could just discern the frown mass of the rock that crown the center of sealer 's land and that be soon lose in the increase obscurity the cold be get to be severe and the man soon complain that ice be form on the blade of they oar then it be that a thought occur to we young mariner which have hitherto escape he of what use would it be for he vessel to be beyond the ice if that of daggett should be shut in the succeed day so sensible do he become to the importance of this idea that he call in he boat and pull back into the cove in order to make one more effort to persuade daggett to follow he out gardiner find all of the vineyarder turn in even to they officer the fatigue they have lately undergo unite to the cold render the berth very agreeable and even daggett beg he visiter would excuse he for not rise to receive he guest argument with a man thus circumstance and so disposed be absolutely useless after remain a short time with daggett roswell return to he own schooner as he pull back he ascertain that ice be fast making and the boat actually cut its way through a thin skim ere it reach the vessel we hero be now greatly concerned lest he should be freeze in himself ere he could get into the more open water of the bay fortunately a light air spring up from the northward and trim he sail gardiner succeed in carry he craft to a point where the undulation of the ground-swell give the assurance of she be outside the segment of the crescent then he brail he foresail haul the jib-sheet over lower he gaff and put he helm hard down after this all the man be permit to seek they berth the officer look out for the craft in turn it want about a hour of day when the second mate give roswell a call accord to order the young master find no wind but a intensely cold morning on go on deck ice have form on every part of the rigging and side of the schooner where water have touch they though the stillness of the night by prevent the spray from fly be much in favor of the navigator in this respect on thrust a boat-hook down roswell ascertain that the bay around he have a skim of ice nearly a inch in thickness this cause he great uneasiness and he wait with the greatest anxiety for the return of light in order to observe the condition of daggett sure enough when the day come out distinctly it be see that ice of sufficient thickness to bear man on it cover the entire surface within the crescent daggett and he people be already at work on it use the saw they must have take the alarm before the return of day for the schooner be not only free from the ground but have be bring fully a cable 's length without the cove gardiner watch the movement of daggett and he crew with a glass for a short time when he order all hand call the cook be already in the galley and a warm breakfast be soon prepare after eat this the two whale-boat be lower and roswell and hazard both row as far as the ice would permit they when they walk the rest of the way to the imprison craft take with they most of they hand together with the saw it be perhaps fortunate for daggett that it soon begin to blow fresh from the northward send into the bay a considerable sea which soon break up the ice and enable the vineyard craft to force she way through the fragment and join she consort about noon glad enough be roswell to regain he own vessel and he make sail on a wind determine to beat out of the narrow water at every hazard the experience of that night have tell he that they have remain in the cove too long daggett follow willingly but not like a man who have escape by the skin of he tooth from winter near the antarctic circle chapter xxii beside the moldau 's rush stream with the wan moon overhead there stand as in a awful dream the army of the dead longfellow most of we reader will understand what be mean by mary pratt 's inclination of the earth 's axis to the plane of its orbit but as there may be a few who do not and as the consequence of this great physical fact be materially connect with the succeed event of the narrative we propose to give such a homely explanation of the phenomenon as we humbly trust will render it clear to the most clouded mind the orbit of the earth be the path which it follow in space in its annual revolution around the sun to a planet there be no up or down except as ascent and descent be estimate from and towards itself in all other respects it float in vacuum or what be so nearly so as to be thus term now let the uninstructed reader imagine a large circular table with a light on its surface and near to its center the light shall represent the sun the outer edge of the circle of the table the earth 's orbit and its surface the plane of that orbit in nature there be no such thing as a plane at all the space within the orbit be vacant but the surface of the table give a distinct notion of the general position of the earth as it travel round the sun it be scarcely necessary to say that the axis of the earth be a imaginary line draw through the planet from one pole to the other the name be derive from the supposition that we daily revolution be make on this axis now the first thing that the student be to fix in he mind in order to comprehend the phenomenon of the season be the lead fact that the earth do not change its attitude in space if we may so express it when it change its position if the axis be _ perpendicular _ to the plane of the orbit this circumstance would not affect the temperature as the simplest experiment will show put the equator of a globe on the outer edge of the table and hold it perfectly _ upright _ cause it to turn on its axis as it pass round the circle it would be find that the light from the center of the table would illumine just one half of the globe at all time and in all position cut the two pole do this movement correspond with that of nature the day and night would be always of the same length and there would be no change of the season the warmest weather be nearest to the equator and the cold increase as the pole be approach no where however would the cold be so intense as it now be nor would the heat be as great as at present except at or quite near to the equator the first fact would be owe to the regular return of the sun once in twenty-four hour the last to the oblique manner in which its ray strike this orb in all place but near its center but the globe ought not to be make to move around the table with its axis perpendicular to its surface or to the plane of the earth 's orbit in point of fact the earth be incline to this plane and the globe should be place at a corresponding inclination let the globe be bring to the edge of the table at its south side and with its upper or north pole incline to the sun and then commence the circuit take care always to keep this north pole of the globe point in the same direction or to keep the globe itself in what we have term a fix attitude as one half of the globe must always be in light and the other half in darkness this inclination from the perpendicular will bring the circle of light some distance beyond the north pole when the globe be due-south from the light and will leave a equal space around the opposite pole without any light at all or any light directly receive now it be that what we have term the _ fix attitude _ of the globe begin to tell if the north pole inclined towards the orbit face the rim of the table the light would still cut the pole the day and night would still be equal and there would be no change in the season though there would be a rival revolution of the globe by cause it to turn once a year shift the pole end for end the inclination be to the surface of the table or to _ the plane _ of the orbit the phenomenon that be know to exist be a consequence thus it be that the change in the season be as much owe to the fix attitude of the earth in space as we have choose to term its polar direction as to the inclination of its axis neither would produce the phenomenon without the assistance of the other as we experiment with the table will show place then the globe at the south side of the rim of the table with its axis incline towards its surface and its pole always point in the same general direction not follow the circuit of the orbit and set it in motion towards the east revolving rapidly on its axis as it move while directly south of the light it would be find that the north pole would be illuminate while no revolution on the axis would bring the south pole within the circle of the light this be when a line draw from the axis of the globe would cut the lamp be the inclination bring as low as the surface of the table next set the globe in motion follow the rim of the table and proceed to the east or right hand keep its axis always look in the same general direction or in a attitude that would be parallel to a north and south line draw through the sun be the inclination as low as the surface of the table this movement would be in one sense sideways the circle of light gradually lessen around the north pole and extend towards the south as the globe proceed east and north diminish the length of the day in the northern hemisphere and increase they in the southern when at east the most direct ray of the light would fall on the equator and the light would cut the two pole render the day and night equal as the globe move north the circle of light would be find to increase around the _ south _ pole while none at all touch the _ north _ when on the north side of the table the _ northern _ pole of the globe would incline so far from the sun as to leave a space around it in shadow that would be of precisely the same size as have be the space of light when it be place on the opposite side of the table go round the circle west the same phenomenon would be see until come directly south of the lamp the north pole would again come into light altogether and the south equally into shadow owing to this very simple but very wonderful provision of divine power and wisdom this earth enjoy the relief of the change in the season as well as the variation in the length of the day for one half of the year or from equinox to equinox from the time when the globe be at a due-west point of the table until it reach the east the north pole would always receive the light in a circle around it that would gradually increase and diminish and for the other half the same would be true of the other hemisphere of course there be a precise point on the earth where this polar illumination cease the shape of the illuminate part be circular and place the point of a pencil on the globe at the extremest spot on the circle hold it there while the globe be turn on its axis the line make would just include the portion of the earth around the globe that thus receive the ray of the sun at midsummer these line compose what be term the arctic and antarctic circle with the last of which we legend have now a most serious connection after all we be by no means certain that we have make we meaning as obvious as we could wish it be very difficult to explain phenomenon of this nature clearly without actually experiment it be usual to say that there be six month day and six month night in the polar basin this be true literally at the pole only but approximatively it be true as a whole we apprehend that few person -- none perhaps but those who be in habit of study -- form correct notion of the extent of what may be term the icy sea as the polar circle be in 23 ° 28 a line draw through the south pole for instance commence on one side of the earth at the antarctic circle and extend to the other would traverse a distance materially exceed that between new york and lisbon this would make those frozen region cover a portion of this globe that be almost as large as the whole of the atlantic ocean as far south as the equator any one can imagine what must be the influence of frost over so vast a surface in reproduce itself since the presence of ice-berg be think to affect we climate when many of they drift far south in summer as power produce power riches wealth so do cold produce cold fill then in a certain degree a space as large as the north atlantic ocean with ice in all its variety fix mountain and field berg and floe and one may get a tolerably accurate notion of the severity of its winter when the sun be scarce see above the horizon at all and then only to shed its ray so obliquely as to be little better than a chill-looking orb of light place in the heaven simply to divide the day from the night this then be the region that roswell gardiner be so very anxious to leave the winter he so much dreaded mary pratt be before he to say nothing of he duty to the deacon while behind he be the vast polar ocean just describe about to be veil in the freezing obscurity of its long and gloomy twilight if not of absolute night no wonder therefore that when he trim he sail that evening to beat out of the great bay that it be do with the earnestness with which we all perform duty of the highest import when they be know to affect we well-being visibly and directly keep she a good full mr hazard say roswell as he be leave the deck to take the first sleep in which he have indulge for four-and-twenty hour and let she go through the water we be behind we time and must keep in motion give I a call if anything like ice appear in a serious way hazard ay-ay would this order as usual button he pee-jacket tighter than ever and see he young superior -- the transcendental delicacy of the day be cause the difference in rank to be term _ senior _ and _ junior _ -- but hazard see _ he _ superior go below with a feeling ally to envy so heavy be he eye-lid with the want of rest stimson be in the first-mate 's watch and the latter approach that old sea-dog with a wish to keep himself awake by converse you seem as wide awake king stephen the mate remark as if you never feel drowsy this be not a part of the world for hammock and berth mr hazard be the reply i can get along and must get along with a quarter part of the sleep in these sea as would sarve I in a low latitude and i feel as if i want all i can get they fellow look up well into we wake stephen they do indeed sir and they ought to do it for we have be longer than be for we good in they 'n well now we have get a fresh start i hope we may make a clear run of it i see no ice worth speaking of to the nor ` ard here before we make sail because you see would none mr hazard be no proof there be none floe-ice can not be see at any great distance though its blink may but it seem to I it be all blink in these here sea there you be quite right stephen for turn which way you will the horizon have a show of that sort -- starboard -- call out the look-out forward -- keep she away -- keep she away -- there be ice ahead ice in here exclaim hazard spring forward -- that be more than we bargain for where away be you ice smith off here sir on we weather bow -- and a mortal big field of it -- jist sich a chap as nipp have the vineyard lion when she first come in to join we sich a fellow as that would take the sap out of we bend as a squeezer take the juice from a lemon smith be a carpenter by trade which be probably the reason why he introduce this figure hazard see the ice with regret for he have hope to work the schooner fairly out to sea in he watch but the field be get down through the passage in a way that threaten to cut off the exit of the two schooner from the bay daggett keep close in he wake a proof that this experienced navigator in such water see no means to turn farther to windward as the wind be now abeam both vessel drive rapidly ahead and in half a hour the northern point of the land they have so lately leave come into view close aboard of they just then the moon rise and object become more clearly visible hazard hail the vineyard lion and demand what be to be do it be possible by haul close on a wind to pass the cape a short distance to windward of it and seemingly thus clear the floe unless this be do both vessel would be compel to ware and run for the southern passage which would carry they many mile to leeward and might place they a long distance on the wrong side of the group be captain gar ` ner on deck ask daggett who have now draw close up on the lee-quarter of he consort hazard have brail he foresail and lay he topsail sharp aback to enable he to do so -- if he be not i would advise you to give he a call at once this be do immediately and while it be do the vineyard lion sweep past the oyster pond schooner roswell announce he presence on deck just as the other vessel clear he bow there be no time to consult gar ` ner answer daggett there be we road before we go through it we must or stay where we be until that field-ice give we a jam down yonder in the crescent i will lead and you can follow as soon as you eye be open one glance let roswell into the secret of he situation he like it little but he do not hesitate fill the topsail and haul aft the foresheet be the quiet order that proclaim what he intend to do both vessel stand on by some secret process every man on board the two craft become aware of what be go on and appear on deck all hand be not call nor be there any particular noise to attract attention but the word have be whisper below that there be a great risk to run a risk it be of a verity it be necessary to stand close along that iron-bound coast where the seal have so lately resort for a distance of several mile the wind would not admit of the schooner steer much more than a cable 's length from the rock for quite a league after which the shore trend to the southward and a little sea-room would be gain but on those rock the wave be then beat heavily and they bellowing as they roll into the cavity be at almost all time terrific there be some relief however in the knowledge obtain of the shore by have frequently pass up and down it in the boat it be know that the water be deep close to the visible rock and that there be no danger as long as a vessel could keep off they no one speak every eye be strain to discern object ahead or be look astern to trace the expect collision between the floe-ice and the low promontory of the cape the ear soon give notice that this meeting have already take place for the frightful sound that attend the crack and rend of the field might have be hear fully a league now it be that each schooner do she best yard be brace up sheet flatten and the helm tend the close proximity of the rock on the one side and the secret presentiment of there be more field-ice on the other keep every one wide awake the two master in particular be all eye and ear it be get to be very cold and the sort of shelter aloft that go by the quaint name of crow 's - nest have be fit up in each vessel a mate be now send into each to ascertain what might be discover to windward almost at the same instant these young seaman hail they respective deck and give notice that a wide field be come in upon they and must eventually crush they unless avoid this startling intelligence reach the two commander in the very same moment the emergency demand decision and each man act for himself roswell order he helm put _ down _ and he schooner _ tack _ the water be not rough enough to prevent the success of the maneuvre on the other hand daggett keep a rap full and _ stand on _ roswell manifest the most judgment and seamanship he be now far enough from the cape to beat to windward and by go nearer to the enemy he might always run along its southern boundary profit by any opening and would be by as much as he could thus gain to windward of the coast daggett have one advantage by stand on in the event of a return become necessary he would gain in time in ten minute the two schooner be a mile asunder we shall first follow that of roswell gardiner 's in he attempt to escape the first floe which be rip and tear one of its angle into fragment as it come grind down on the cape soon compel the vessel to tack make short reach roswell ere long find himself fully a mile to windward of the rock and sufficiently near to the new floe to discern its shape drift and general character its eastern end have lodge upon the field that first come in and be add to the vast momentum with which that enormous floe be press down upon the cape large as be that first visiter to the bay this be of at least twice if not of thrice its dimension what give roswell the most concern be the great distance that this field extend to the westward he go up into the crow 's - nest himself and aid by the light of a most brilliant moon and a sky without a cloud he could perceive the blink of ice in that direction as he fancy for fully two league what be unusual perhaps at that early season of the year these floe do not consist of a vast collection of numberless cake of ice but the whole field so far as could then be ascertain be firm and unite the night be now so cold that ice make fast wherever there be water and it occur to we young master that possibly fragment that have once be separate and break by the wave might have become re-united by the agency of the frost roswell descend from the crow 's - nest half chill by a cut wind though it blow from a warm quarter summon he mate he ask they advice it seem to I captain gar ` ner hazard reply there be very little choice here we be so far as i can make it out embayed and we have only to box about until day-light come when some chance may turn up to help we if so we must turn it to account if not we must make up we mind to winter here this be coolly and calmly say though it be clear enough that hazard be quite in earnest you forget there may be a open passage to the westward mr hazard roswell rejoin and that we may yet pass out to sea by it captain daggett be already out of sight in the western board and we may do well to stand on after he ay ay sir -- i know all that captain gar ` ner and it may be as you say but when i be aloft half a hour since if there be not the blink of ice in that direction quite round to the back of the island there be not the blink of ice nowhere hereabouts i be use to the sight of it and can not well be mistake there be always ice on that side of the land hazard and you may have see the blink of the berg which have hug the cliff in that quarter all summer still that be not prove we shall find no outlet this craft can go through a very small passage and we must take care and find one in proper time wintering here be out of the question a _ hundred _ reason tell we not to think of such a thing besides the interest of we owner we be walk along this floe pretty fast though i think the vessel be too much by the head do not it strike you so hazard lord sir it be nothing but the ice that have make and be make for ` ard before we get so near the field as to find a better lee the little lipper that come athwart we bow freeze almost as soon as it wet we i do suppose sir there be now several ton of ice on we bow count from channel to channel forward on a examination this prove to be true and the knowledge of the circumstance do not at all contribute to gardiner 's feeling of security he see there be no time to be lose and he crowd sail with a view of force the vessel past the danger if possible and of get she into a milder climate but even a fast-sailing schooner will scarcely equal we wish under such circumstance there be no doubt that the sea lion 's speed be get to be affect by the manner in which she bow be weigh down by ice in addition to the discomfort produce by cold damp and the presence of a slippery substance on the deck and rig fortunately there be not much spray fly or matter would have be much worse as it be they be bad enough and very ominous of future evil while the sea lion of oyster pond be run along the margin of the ice in the manner just describe and after the blink to the westward have change to a visible field make it very uncertain whether any egress be to be find in that quarter or not a opening suddenly appear trend to the northward and sufficiently wide as roswell think to enable he to beat through it put he helm down he schooner come heavily round and be fill on a course that soon carry she half a mile into this passage at first everything seem propitious the channel rather open than otherwise while the course be such -- north-north-west -- as enable the vessel to very long leg on one tack and that the best after go about four or five time however all these flattering symptom suddenly change by the passage 's terminate in a _ cul de sac _ almost at the same instant the ice close rapidly in the schooner 's wake a effort be make to run back but it fail in consequence of a enormous floe 's turn on its center have meet resistance from a field closer in that be in its turn stop by the rock roswell see at once that nothing could be do at the moment he take in all he canvass as well as the frozen cloth could be handle get out ice-anchor and haul he vessel into a species of cove where there would be the least danger of a nip should the field continue to close all this time daggett be as busy as a bee he round the headland and flattered himself that he be about to slip past all the rock and get out into open water when the vast field of which the blink have be see even by those in the other vessel suddenly stretch themselves across he course in a way that set at defiance all attempt to go any further in that direction daggett wear round and endeavor to return this be by no means as easy as it be to go down before the wind and he bow be also much encumber with ice more so indeed than those of the other schooner once or twice he craft miss stay in consequence of get so much by the head and it be deem necessary to heave-to and take to the axis a great deal of extra and cumbrous weight be get rid of but a hour of most precious time be lose by the time daggett be ready to make sail again he find he return round the headland be entirely cut off by the field 's have come in absolute contact with the rock it be now midnight and the man on board both vessel require rest a watch be set in each and most of the people be permit to turn in of course proper look-out be have but the light of the moon be not sufficiently distinct to render it safe to make any final effort under its favor no great alarm be feel there be nothing unusual in a vessel 's be embay in the ice and so long as she be not nipped or press upon by actual contact the position be think safe rather than the reverse it be desirable moreover for the schooner to communicate with each other for some advantage might be know to one of the master that be conceal by distance from he companion without concert therefore roswell and daggett come to the same general conclusion and wait patiently the day come at last cold and dreary though not altogether without the relief of a air that blow from region far warmer than the ocean over which it be now travel then the two schooner become visible from each other and roswell see the jeopardy of daggett and daggett see the jeopardy of roswell the vessel be little more than a mile apart but the situation of the vineyard lion be much the most critical she have make fast to the floe but she support itself be in a steady and most impose motion as soon as roswell see the manner in which he consort be surround and the very threatening aspect of the danger that press upon he he first impulse be to hasten to he with a party of he own people to offer any assistance he could give after look at the ice immediately around he own craft where all seem to be right he call over the name of six of he man order they to eat a warm breakfast and to prepare to accompany he in twenty minute roswell be lead he little party across the ice each man carry a axe or some other implement that it be suppose might be of use it be by no means difficult to proceed for the surface of the floe one seemingly more than a league in extent be quite smooth and the snow on it be crust to a strength that would have bear a team the water between the ice and the rock be a much narrower strip than i have think say roswell to he constant attendant stimson here it do not appear to be a hundred yard in width nor be it sir -- whew -- this trot in so cold a climate make a man puff like a whale blowing -- but captain gar ` ner that schooner will be cut in two before we can get to she look sir the floe have reach the rock already quite near she and it do not stop the drift at all seemingly roswell make no reply the state of the vineyard lion do appear to be much more critical than he have previously imagine until he come nearer to the land he have form no notion of the steady power with which the field be set down on the rock on which the broken fragment be now creep like creature endowed with life occasionally there would be loud disruption and the movement of the floe would become more rapid then again a sort of pause would succeed and for a moment the approach party feel a gleam of hope but all expectation of this sort be doom to be disappointed look sir exclaim stimson -- she go down afore it twenty fathom at that one set she must be awful near the rock sir all the man now stop they know they be powerless : and intense anxiety render they averse to move attention appear to interfere with they walk on the ice and each hold he breath in expectation they see that the schooner then less than a cable 's length from they be close to the rock and the next shock if anything like the last must overwhelm she to they astonishment instead of be nip the schooner rise by a stately movement that be not without grandeur uphold by broken cake that have get beneath she bottom and fairly reach the shelf of rock almost unharmed not a man have leave she but there she be place on the shore some twenty foot above the surface of the sea on rock wear smooth by the action of the wave have the season be propitious and do the injury stop here it might have be possible to get the craft into the water again and still carry she to america but the floe be not yet arrest cake succeed cake one ride over another until a wall of ice rise along the shore that roswell and he companion with all they activity and courage have great difficulty in cross they succeed in get over it however but when they reach the unfortunate schooner she be literally bury the mast be break the sail tear rig scatter and side stove the sea lion of martha 's vineyard be a worthless wreck -- worthless as to all purpose but that of be convert into material for a smaller craft or to be use as fuel all this have be do in ten minute then it be that the vast superiority of nature over the resource of man make itself apparent the people of the two vessel stand aghast with this sad picture of they own insignificance before they eye the crew of the wreck it be true have escape without difficulty the movement have be as slow and steady as it be irresistible but there they be in the clothes they have on with all they effect bury under pile of ice that be already thirty or forty foot in height she look as if she be build there gar ` ner daggett coolly observe as he stand regard the scene with eye as intently rivet on the wreck as human organ be ever fix on any object have a man tell I this _ could _ happen i would not have believe he have she be a three-decker this ice would have treat she in the same way there be a force in such a field that wall of stone could not withstand captain gar ` ner -- captain gar ` ner call out stimson hastily we would better go back sir we own craft be in danger she be drift fast in towards the cape and may reach it afore we can get to she sure enough it be so in one of the change that be so unaccountable among the ice the floe have take a sudden and powerful direction towards the entrance of the great bay it be probably owe to the circumstance that the inner field have force its way past the cape and make room for its neighbor to follow a few of daggett 's people with daggett himself remain to see what might yet be save from the wreck but all the rest of the man start for the cape towards which the oyster pond craft be now directly set the distance be less than a league and as yet there be not much show on the rock by take a upper shelf it be possible to make pretty good progress and such be the manner of roswell 's present march it be a extraordinary sight to see the coast along which we party be hasten just at that moment as the cake of ice be break from the field they be drive upward by the vast pressure from without and the whole line of the shore seem as if alive with creature that be issue from the ocean to clamber on the rock roswell have often see that very coast people with seal as it now appear to be in activity with fragment of ice that be writhe and turn and rise one upon another as if possess of the vital principle in half a hour roswell and he party reach the house the schooner be then less than half a mile from the spot still set in along with the outer field but not nip so far from be in danger of such a calamity the little basin in which she lay have expand instead of closing and it would have be possible to handle a quick-working craft in it under she canvass a exit however be quite out of the question there be no sign of any passage to or from that icy dock there the craft still lay anchor to the weather-floe while the portion of she crew which remain on board be as anxiously watch the coast as those who be on the coast watch she at first roswell give he schooner up but on closer examination find reason to hope that she might pass the rock and enter the inner rather than the great bay chapter xxiii to prayer -- for the glorious sun be go and the gathering darkness of night come on like a curtain from god 's kind hand it flow to shade the couch where he child repose then kneel while the watch star be bright and give you last thought to the guardian of night ware desolate indeed and nearly devoid of hope have the situation of we sealer now become it be mid-day and it be freezing everywhere in the shade a bright genial sun be shed its glorious ray on the icy panorama but it be so obliquely as to be of hardly any use in dispel the frost far as the eye could see even from the elevation of the cape there be nothing but ice with the exception of that part of the great bay into which the floe have not yet penetrate to the southward there stand clustering around the passage a line of gigantic berg place like sentinel as if purposely to stop all egress in that direction the water have lose its motion in the shift of wind and new ice have form over the whole bay as be evident by a white sparkling line that precede the irresistible march of the floe as roswell gaze on this scene serious doubt darken he mind as to he escape from this frozen chain until the return of another summer it be true that a south wind might possibly produce a change and carry away the blockade mass but every moment render this so much the less probable winter or what would be deem winter in most region be already set in and should the ice really become stationary in and around the group all hope of its move must vanish for the next eight month daggett reach the house about a hour before sunset he have succeed in cut a passage through the ice as far as the cabin-door of he unfortunate schooner when there be no difficulty in descend into the interior part of the vessel the whole party come in stagger under heavy load pretty much as a matter of course each man bring he own effect clothes tobacco rum small-store bedding quadrant and similar property be that first attend to at that moment little be think of the skin and oil the cargo be neglect while the minor article have be eagerly seek roswell be on board he own schooner now again in dangerous proximity to the cape she be steadily set in when daggett rejoin he the crew of the lose vessel remain in the house where they light a fire and deposit they goods return to the wreck for another load take the double set of wheel along with they when the two master meet they confer together earnestly receive into they council such of the officer as be on board the security of the remain vessel be now all-important and it be not to be conceal that she be in imminent jeopardy the course take by the floe be directly towards the most rugged part of cape hazard and the rate of the movement such as to threaten a very speedy termination of the matter there be one circumstance however and only that one which offer a single chance of escape the open around the schooner still exist in part about half of it have be lose in the collision with the outermost point of the rock it be this species of vacuum that by remove all resistance at that particular spot indeed which have give the field its most dangerous cant turn the movement of the vessel towards the rock the chance therefore exist in the possibility -- and it be little more than a bare possibility -- of move the schooner in that small area of open water and of take she far enough south to clear the most southern extremity of the wall of stone that protect the cove as yet this open water do not extend far enough to admit of the schooner 's be take to the point in question but it be slowly tend in that direction and do not the basin close altogether ere that desirable object be achieve the vessel might yet be save in order however to do this it would be necessary to cut a sort of dock or slip in the ice of the cove into which the craft might shoot as a place of refuge once within the cove fairly behind the point of the rock there would be perfect safety if suffer to drift to the southward of that shelter this schooner would probably be lose like she consort and very much in the same manner gardiner now send a gang of hand to the desire point arm with saw and the slip be commence the ice in the cove be still only two or three inch thick and the work go bravely on instead of satisfy himself with cut a passage merely behind the point of rock hazard open one quite up into the cove to the precise place where the schooner have be so long at anchor just as the sun be set the crisis arrive so heavy have be the movement towards the rock that roswell saw he could delay no longer be he to continue where he be a projection on the cape would prevent he passage to the entrance of the cove he would be shut in and he might be certain that the sea lion would be crush if the floe press home upon the shore the ice-anchor be cut out accordingly the jib be hoist and the schooner wear short round on she heel the space between the floe and the projection in the rock just name do not now exceed a hundred foot and it be lessen fast much more room exist on each side of this particular excrescence in the rugged coast the space north be still considerable while that to the southward might be a hundred yard in width the former of these area be owe to the form of the basin and the latter to the shape of the shore in the first of the basin name the schooner wear short round on she heel she foresail be set to help she a breathless moment pass as she run down towards the narrow strait it be quickly reach and that none too soon the open now not exceed sixty foot the yard of the vessel almost brush the rock in pass but she go clear as soon as in the lower basin as one might call it the jib and foresail be take in and the head of the mainsail be get on the craft this help she to luff up towards the slip which she reach under sufficient head-way fairly to enter it line be throw to the people on the ice who soon haul the schooner up to the head of she frozen dock three cheer break spontaneously out of the throat of the man as they thus achieve the step which assure they of the safety of the vessel so far as the ice be concern in this way do we estimate we advantage and disadvantage by comparison in the abstract the situation of the sealer be still sufficiently painful though compare with what it would have be with the other schooner wreck it be security itself by this time it be quite dark and a day of excitement and fatigue require a night of rest after sup the man turn in the vineyarder mostly in the house where they occupy they old bunk when the moon rise the party from the wreck arrive with they cart well load and themselves half frozen notwithstanding they toil in a short time all be bury in sleep when roswell gardiner come on deck next morning he first glance tell he how little be the chance of he party 's return north that season the strange floe have drive into the great bay completely cover its surface line the shore far and near with broken and glittering cake of ice and as it be hermetically seal the place against all egress new ice a inch or two thick or even six or eight inch thick might have be saw through and a passage cut even for a league should it be necessary such thing be sometimes do and great as would have be the toil we sealer would have attempt it in preference to run the risk of pass a winter in that region but almost desperate as would have be even that source of refuge the party be completely cut off from its possession to think of saw through ice as thick as that of the floe for any material distance would be like a project to tunnel the alp melancholy be the meeting between roswell and daggett that morning the former be too manly and generous to indulge in reproach else might he well have tell the last that all this be owe to he there be a singular propensity in we all to throw the burthen of we own blunder on the shoulder of other folk roswell have a little of this weakness overlook the fact that he be he own master and as he have come to the group by himself he ought to have leave it in the same manner as soon as he own particular task be accomplish but roswell do not see this quite as distinctly as he see the fact that daggett 's detention and indirect appeal to he better feeling have involve he in all these difficulty still while thus he feel he make no complaint all hope of get north that season now depend on the field-ice 's drift away from the great bay before it get fairly freeze in so jam and cram with it do every part of the bay appear to be however that little could be expect from that source of relief this daggett admit in the conversation he hold with roswell as soon as the latter join he on the rocky terrace beneath the house the wisest thing we can do then reply we hero will be to make as early preparation as possible to meet the winter if we be to remain here a day gain now will be worth a week a month hence if we should happily escape the labor thus expend will not kill we quite true -- very much as you say certainly answer daggett musing i be think as you come ashore gar ` ner if a lucky turn might not be make in this wise : -- have a good many skin in the wreck you see and you have a good deal of ile in you hold -- now by start some of that ile and pump it out and shook the cask room might be make aboard of you for all my skin i think we could run all of the last over on they wheel in the course of a week captain daggett it be by yield so much to you skin that we have get into all this trouble skin measure for measure in the way of tonnage will bring a great deal more than ile roswell smile and mutter something to himself a little bitterly he be think of the grievous disappointment and prolonged anxiety that it pained he to believe mary would feel at he failure to return home at the appoint time though it would probably have pained he more to believe she would not thus be disappointed and anxious here he displeasure or its manifestation cease and the young man turn he thought on the present necessity of he situation daggett appear very earnest on the subject of remove he skin before the snow come to impede the path roswell could urge no objection that would be likely to prevail but he acquiescence be obtain by means of a hint from stimson who by this time have gain he officer 's ear let he do it captain gar ` ner say the boat-steerer in a aside speak respectfully but earnestly he 'll never stow 'em in we hold this season at least but they 'll make excellent filling-in for the side of this hut you think then stephen that we be likely to pass the winter here we be in the hand of divine providence sir which will do with we as seem the best in the eye of never-failing wisdom at all event captain gar ` ner i think ` twill be safest to act at once as if we have the winter afore we in my judgment this house might be make a good deal more comfortable for we all in such a case than we craft for we should not only have more room but might have as many fire as we want and more than we can find fuel for ay there be the difficulty stephen where be we to find wood throughout a polar winter for even one fire we must be save sir and thoughtful and keep ourselves warm as much as we can by exercise i have have a taste of this once in a small way already and know what ought to be do in many partic ` lar in the first place the man must keep themselves as clean as water will make they -- dirt be a great helper of cold -- and the water must be just as frosty as human natur ' can bear it this will set everything into actyve movement inside and bring out warmth from the heart as it might be that be my principle of keep warm captain gar ` ner i dare say it may be a pretty good one stephen answer roswell and we 'll bear it in mind as for stove we be well enough off for there be one in the house and a good large one it be then there be a stove in each cabin and there be the two camboose if we have fuel for they all i should feel no concern on the score of warmth there be the wrack sir by cut she up at once we should get wood enough in my judgment to see it out roswell make no reply but he look intently at the boat-steerer for half a minute the idea be new to he and the more he think on the subject the greater be the confidence it give he in the result daggett he well know would not consent to the mutilation of he schooner wreck as it be so long as the most remote hope exist of get she again into the water the tenacity with which this man cling to property be like that which be imputed to the life of the cat and it be idle to expect any concession from he on a subject like that nevertheless necessity be a hard master and if the question be narrow down to one of burn the material of a vessel that be in the water and in good condition and of burn those of one that be out of the water with hole cut through she bottom in several place and otherwise so situate as to render repair extremely difficult if not impossible even duggett would be compel to submit to circumstance it be accordingly suggest to the people of the vineyard lion that they could do no better than to begin at once to remove everything they could come at and which could be transport from the wreck to the house as there be little to do on board the vessel afloat she crew cheerfully offer to assist in this labor the day be shorten sensibly and fast and no time be to be lose the distance be so great as to make two trip a day a matter of great labor no sooner be the plan adopt therefore than step be take to set about its execution it be unnecessary for we to dwell minutely on everything that occur during the succeed week or ten day the wind shift to south-west the very day that the sea lion get back into she little harbor and this seem to put a sudden check on the pressure of the vast floe nevertheless there be no counter-movement the ice remain in the great bay seemingly as firmly fasten as if it have originally be make there notwithstanding this shift of the wind to a cold point of the compass the thermometer rise and it thaw freely about the middle of the day in all place to which the ray of the sun have access this enable the man to work with more comfort than they could have do in the excessively severe weather as it be find that respiration become difficult when it be so very cold access be now obtain to the wreck by cut a regular passage to the main hatch through the ice the schooner stand nearly upright sustain by fragment of the floe and there be extensive cavern all around she produce by the random manner in which the cake have come up out of they proper element like so many live thing among these cavern one might have wander for mile without once come out into the open air though they be cold and cheerless and have little to attract the adventurer after the novelty be abate in rise from the water the schooner have be roughly treat but once sustain by the ice she transit have be easy and tolerably safe several large cake lay on or over she sustained more by other cake that rest on the rock than by the timber of the vessel herself these cake form a sort of roof and as they do not drip they serve to make a shelter against the wind for at the point where the wreck lay the south-west gale come howling round the base of the mountain pierce the marrow itself in the bone at the hut it be very different there the height make a lee that extend all over the cape and for some distance to the westward while the whole power the sun possess in that high latitude be cast very obliquely it be true but clearly and without any other drawback than its position in the ecliptic fairly on the terrace the hut above and the rock around it on the natural terrace indeed it be still pleasant to walk and work and even to sit for a few hour in the middle of the day for winter be not yet come in earnest in that frozen world one of roswell 's first object be to transport most of the eatables from the wreck for he foresee the need there would be for everything of the sort neither vessel have lay in a stock of provision for a longer period than about twelve month of which nearly half be now go this allowance apply to salted meat and bread which be usually regard as the base of a ship 's store there be several barrel of flour a few potato a large quantity of onion a few barrel of corn-meal or ` injin ' as it be usually term in american parlance a entire barrel of pickled cucumber another about half full of cabbage preserve in the same way and a entire barrel of molasses in addition there be a cask of whiskey a little wine and brandy to be use medicinally sugar brown whitey-brown and browny-white and a pretty fair allowance of tea and coffee the former be a hyson-skin and the latter san domingo of no very high quality most of these article be transport from the wreck to the house in the course of the few day that succeed though daggett insist on a certain portion of the supplies be leave in he stranded craft not until this be do would roswell listen to any proposal of daggett 's to transfer the skin twice during these few day indeed do the vineyard master come to a pause in he proceedings as the weather grow milder and gleam of a hope of be able yet to get away that season cross he mind on the last of these occasion of misgive roswell be compel to lead he brother master up on the plain of the island to a elevation of some three hundred foot above the level of the ocean and more than half that distance higher than the house and point out to he a panorama of field-ice that the eye could not command until that vast plain open or become riven by the joint action of the agitate ocean and the warmth of a sun from which the ray do not glance away from the frozen surface like light obliquely receive and as obliquely reflect from a mirror it be useless to think of release even the uninjured vessel much less that which lay riven and crush on the rock be every cake of this ice melt into water daggett roswell continue it would not float off you schooner the best supply ship-yard in america could hardly furnish the material for way to launch she and i never know of a vessel 's be drop into the water some twenty foot nearly perpendicular i do not know that answer daggett stoutly see what they be do now-a-day and think nothing of it i have see a whole row of brick house turn round by the use of jack-screw and one building actually take down a hill much higher than the distance you name commodore rodger have just haul a heavy frigate out of the water and mean to put she back again when he have do with she what have be do once can be do twice i do not like give up 'till i be force to it that be plain enough captain daggett return roswell smile that you be game no one can deny but it will all come to nothing neither commodore rodger nor commodore anybody else could put you craft into the water again without something to do it with you think it would be ask too much to take you schooner and go across to the main next season a ` ter timber to make way put in daggett inquiringly she stand up like a church and nothing would be easier than to lay down way under she bottom or more difficult than to make they of any use after you have put they there no no my good sir you must think no more of this though it may be possible to make a cover for the cargo and return and recover it all by freight a craft from rio on we way north daggett give a quick inquisitive glance at he companion and roswell 's color mount to he cheek for while he really think the plan just mention quite feasible he be conscious of foresee that it might be make the means of throw off he troublesome companion as he himself draw near to the west indy and they key this terminate the discussion for the time both of the master busy themselves in carry on the duty which have now fall into a regular train as much of the interest of what be to be relate will depend on what be do in these few day it may be well to be a little more explicit in state the particulars the reader will understand that the house of which so much have already be make by we mariner be nothing but a shell it have a close roof one that effectually turn water and its siding though rough be tight and rather thicker than be usual be make of common inch board roughly plane and originally paint red there be four very tolerable window and a decent substantial floor of planed plank all this have be well put together rather more attention than be often bestow on such structure have be pay by the carpenter to the crack and joint on account of the known sharpness of the climate even in the warm month still all this make a mere shell the marrow-freezing wind which would soon come -- have indeed come -- might be arrest by such a cover it be true but the little needle-like particle of the frost would penetrate such a shelter as they counterpart of steel pierce cloth it be a matter of life and death therefore to devise means to exclude the cold in order that the vital heat might be keep in circulation during the tremendous season that be know to be approach stimson have much to say on the subject of the arrangement take he be the oldest man in the two crew and the most experienced sealer it happen that he have once pass a winter at orange harbor in the immediate vicinity of cape horn it be true that be a inhabit country if the poor degraded creature who dwell there can be term inhabitant and have its tree and vegetation such as they be the difference between orange harbor and sealer 's land in this respect must be something like that which all the travel world know to exist between a winter 's residence at the hospital of the great st bernard and a winter 's residence at one of the village a few league lower down the mountain at sealer 's land if there be literally no vegetation there be so little as scarcely to deserve the name of fuel there be none with the exception of that which have be bring there nevertheless the experience of a winter pass at such a place as orange harbor must count for a great deal cape horn be in nearly 56 ° and sealer 's land -- we may as well admit this much -- be by no means 10 ° to the southward of that there must be a certain general resemblance in the climate of the two place and he who have go through a winter at one of they must have have a very tolerable foretaste of what be to be suffer at the other this particular experience therefore add to he general knowledge as well as to he character contribute largely to stephen 's influence in the consultation that take place between the two master at which he be usually present it be useless to be play off in a affair like this captain gar ` ner say stephen on one occasion away from this spot all the navy of the ` arth could not now carry we until god 's sun come back in he course to drive the winter away afore it i have my misgivin 's gentleman touch this great floe that have get jam in among these island whether it will ever move ag ` in for i do not think its come in here be a common matter in which case what would become of we stephen why sir we should be at god 's marcy then jist as we be now or would be be we on the east eend itself i will not say that two resolute and strong arm might not cut a way through for one little craft like ourn if they have summer fully afore 'em and know would they be a-workin ' towards a frus ` nd instead of towards a inimy there be a great deal in the last every man be encourage when he think he be nearer to the eend of he journey a ` ter a hard day 's work than he be when he set out in the mornin ' but to undertake sich a expedition at this season would be sartain destruction no sir all we can do now be to lay up for the winter and that with great care and prudence we must turn ourselves into so many ant and show they forethought and care what would you recommend as we first step stimson ask daggett who have be a attentive listener i would advise sir to begin harden the man as soon as i could we have too much fire in the stove both for we stock of wood and for the good of the people make the man sleep under fewer clothes and do not let any on ` ern hang about the galley fire as some on 'em love to do even now most desperately they ` ere man will be good for nothin ' ten week hence unless they be take off the fire as a body would take off a pot or a kettle and be set out to harden this be a process that may be easier advise than perform perhaps roswell quietly observe do not you believe that captain gar ` ner i have know the most shiverin ' smoke-dried hand in a large crew harden and bring to a edge a ` ter a little trouble as a body would temper a axe with steel the first thing to be do be to make 'em scrub one another every mornin ' in cold water this give a life to the skin that act much the same as a suit of clothes yes gentleman put a fellow in a tub for a minute or two of a mornin ' and you may do almost anything you please with he all day a ` terward one pail of water be as good as a pee-jacket and above all thing keep the stove clear the cook should be tell not to drive they fire so hard and we can do without the stove in the sleeping-room a great deal better now than most on we think it will help to save much wood if we begin at once to caulk and thicken we siding and make the house warmer be the hut in a good state we might do without any other fire than that in the camboose for two month yet such be the general character of stephen 's counsel and very good advice it be not only do roswell adopt the scrub process which enable he to throw aside a great many clothes in the course of a week but he keep aloof from the fire to harden as stimson have call it that which be thus enforce by example be additionally enjoin by precept several large hulk idle fellow who greatly love the fire be drive away from it by shame and the heat be allow to diffuse itself more equally through the build any one who have ever have occasion to be a witness of the effect of the water-cure process in enable even delicate woman to resist cold and damp may form some notion of the great improvement that be make among we sealer by adopt and rigidly adhering to stimson 's cold water and no-fire system those who have shiver at the very thought of ice-water soon dabble in it like young duck and there be scarcely a hour in the day when the half-hogshead that be use as a bath have not its tenant this tub be place on the ice of the cove with a tent over it and a well be make through which the water be draw of course the axe be in great request a new hole be require each morning and sometimes two or three time in the course of the day the effect of these ablutions be very soon apparent the man begin to throw aside they pee-jacket and work in they ordinary clothing which be warm and suit to a high latitude with a spirit and vigor at which they be themselves surprise the fire in the camboose suffice as yet and at evening the pee-jacket with the shelter of the build the crowded room and the warm meal for a long time enable they to get on without consume anything in the largest stove stimson 's plan for the protection of the hut moreover soon begin to tell the skin sail and much of the rigging be bring over from the wreck by means of the cart so long as there be no snow and by means of sledge when the snow fall and render wheeling difficult luckily the position of the road along the rock cause the upper snow to melt a little at noon-day while it freeze again firmer and firmer each night the crust soon bear and it be find that the sledge furnish even better means of transportation than the wheel there be a little controversy about the use of the skin daggett continue to regard they as cargo necessity and number prevail in the end and the whole building be line with they four or five deep by place they inside of becket make of the smaller rigging by stuff these skin compactly within rope so place as to keep all snug a very material defense against the entrance of cold be interpose but this be not all inside of the skin stimson get up hanging of canvass use the sail of the wreck for that purpose it be not necessary to cut these sail -- daggett would not have suffer it -- but they be suspend and cram into opening and otherwise so arrange as completely to conceal and shelter every side as well as the ceiling of both room portion be fit with such address as to fall before the window to which they form very warm if not very ornamental curtain stephen however induce roswell to order outside shutter to be make and hang maintain that one such shutter would soon count as a dozen cord of wood much of the wood too be bring over from the wreck and that which have be carelessly abandon on the rock be all collect and pile carefully and conveniently near the outer door of the hut which door by the way look inward or towards the rock in the rear of the building where it open on a sort of yard that roswell hope to be able to keep clear of ice and snow throughout the winter he might as well have expect to melt the glacier of grindewald by light a fire on the meadow at they base stephen have another project to protect the house and to give facility for move outside when the winter should be at the hardest in he experience at orange harbor he have find that great inconvenience be sustain in consequence of the snow 's melting around the building he inhabit which come from the warmth of the fire within to avoid this a very serious evil he have spare sail of heavy canvass lay across the roof of the warehouse a building of no great height and secure they to the rock below by means of anchor kedge and various other device in some instance by lashing to projection in the cliff spare spar lean from the roof support this tent-like cover and prop beneath sustained the spar this arrangement be make on only two side of the building one end and the side which look to the north material fail before the whole place be surround the necessity for admit light too admonish the sealer of the inexpediency of thus shroud all they window the bottom of this tent be only ten foot from the side of the house which give it greater security than if it have be more horizontal while it make a species of verandah in which exercise could be take with greater freedom than in the room everything be do to strengthen the building in all its part that the ingenuity of seaman could suggest and particularly to prevent the tent-verandah from cave in stephen intimate that they situation possess one great advantage as well as disadvantage in consequence of standing on a shelf with a lower terrace so close as to be within the cast of a shovel the snow might be throw below and the hut relieve the melted snow too would be apt to take the same direction under the law that govern the course of all fluid the disadvantage be in the barrier of rock behind the hut which while it serve admirably to break the pierce south wind would very naturally tend to make high snow-bank in drift storm chapter xxiv my foot on the ice-berg have light when hoarse the wild wind veer about my eye when the bark be benighted see the lamp of the light-house go out i be the sea-bird sea-bird sea-bird lone looker on despair the sea-bird sea-bird sea-bird the only witness there brainard two month pass rapidly away in the excitement and novelty of the situation and pursuit of the man in that time all be do that the season would allow the house be consider as complete and far from uncomfortable the day have rapidly lessen in length and the night increase proportionably until the sun be visible only for a few hour at a time and then merely pass low along the northern horizon the cold increase in proportion though the weather vary almost as much in that high latitude as it do in we own it have cease to thaw much however and the mean of the thermometer be not many degree above zero notwithstanding this low range of the mercury the man find that they be fast get acclimate and that they could endure a much greater intensity of cold than they have previously suppose possible as yet there have be nothing to surprise native of new york and new england there rarely occur a winter in which weather quite as cold as any they have yet experience in the antarctic sea do not set in and last for some little time even while write this very chapter of we legend here in the mountain of otsego one of these siberian visit have be pay to we valley for the last three day the thermometer have range at sunrise between 17 ° and 22 ° below zero though there be every appearance of a thaw and we may have the mercury up to 40 ° above in the course of the next twenty-four hour man accustom to such transition and such extreme cold be not easily lay up or intimidate a great deal of snow fall about this particular portion of the year more indeed than at a later period this snow produce the greatest inconvenience for it soon become so deep as to form high bank around the house and to fill all the customary haunt of the man still there be place that be in a great measure exempt from this white mantle the terrace immediately below the hut which have so often be mention be one of these bare spot it be so place as to be sweep by both the east and the west wind which generally clear it of everything like snow as fast as it fall and this more effectually than could be do by a thousand broom the level of rock usually travel in go to or from the wreck be another of these clear place it be a sort of shelf too narrow to admit of the snow 's banking and too much rake by the wind that commonly accompany snow to suffer the last to lodge to any great depth snow there be with a hard crust as have already be mention but it be not snow ten or fifteen foot deep as occur in many other place there be several point however where bank have form even on this ledge through which the man be compel to cut they way by the use of shovel : a occupation that give they exercise and contribute to keep they in health if it be of no other service it be find that the human frame could not endure one-half the toil in that low state of the mercury that it could bear in one a few degree higher daggett have not by any means abandon he craft as much as he have permit she to be dismantle every day or two he have some new expedient for get the schooner off in the spring though all who hear they be perfectly convince of they impracticableness this feeling induce he to cause he own man to keep open the communication and scarce a day pass in which he do not visit the poor unfortunate craft nor be the place without a interest of a very peculiar sort it have be say that the fragment of ice some of which be more than a hundred foot in diameter and all of which be eight or ten foot in thickness have be leave on they edge incline in a way to form cavern that extend a great distance now it so happen that just around the wreck the cake be so distribute as to intercept the first snow which fill the outer passage get to be harden and cover anew by fresh storm thus interpose a effectual barrier to the admission of any more of the frozen element within the ice the effect be to form a vast range of natural gallery amid the cake that be quite clear of any snow but that which have adhere to they surface and which offer little or no impediment to motion -- nay which rather aid it by render the walk less slippery as the deck of the schooner have be clear leave a easy access to all its entrance cabin hold and forecastle this put the vineyard lion under cover while it admit of all she accommodation be use a portion of she wood have be leave in she it will be remember as well as she camboose the last be get into the cabin and daggett attend by two or three of he hand would pass a good deal of he time there one reason give for this distribution of the force be the greater room it allow those who remain at the hut for motion the deck of this vessel be quite clear it offer a very favourable spot for exercise better in fact than the terrace beneath the hut be quite sheltered from the wind and much warmer than it have be originally or ever since the heavy fall of snow commence daggett pace he quarter-deck hour after hour almost delude himself with the expectation of sailing for home as soon as the return of summer would permit he to depart around the hut the snow early make vast embankment every one accustom to the action of this particular condition of one of the great element will understand that a bend in the rock outward or a curve inward must necessarily affect the manner in which these bank be form the wind do not by any means blow from any one point of the compass though the south-western cliff might be almost term the weather-side of the island so much more frequently do the gale come from that quarter than from any other the cape where the cove lay and where the house have be set up be at the north-eastern point and much protect by the high table-land in its rear it occupy the warmest situation in the whole region the wind that sweep most of the north shore but which owe to a curvature in its formation do not often blow home to the hut even when they whistle along the terrace only a hundred foot beneath and more salient be ordinarily from the south-west outside though they get a more westerly inclination by follow the land under the cliff a bank of snow may be either a cause of destruction or a source of comfort of course a certain degree of cold must exist wherever snow be to be find but unless in absolute contact with the human body it do not usually affect the system beyond a certain point on the other hand it often break the wind and it have be know to form a cover to flock house & c that have contribute essentially to they warmth we incline to the opinion that if one sleep in a cavern form in the snow provide he could keep himself dry and do not come in absolute contact with the element he would not find he quarter very uncomfortable so long as he have sufficient clothing to confine the animal warmth near he person now we sealer enjoy some such advantage as this though not literally in the same degree they house be not cover with snow though a vast bank be already form quite near it and a good deal have begin to pile against the tent singular as it may seem on the east end of the building and on the south front which look in towards the cliff next the cove there be scarcely any snow at all this be in part owe to the constant use of the shovel and broom but more so to the current of air which usually carry everything of so light a nature as a flake to more quiet spot before it be suffer to settle on the ground roswell early find what he experience as a american might have teach he that the _ melting _ of the snow in consequence of the warmth of the fire cause much more inconvenience than the snow itself the latter when dry be easily get along with but when melt in the day and convert into icicle at night it become a most unpleasant and not altogether a safe neighbor inasmuch as there be really danger from the sort of damp atmosphere it produce the greatest ground of roswell gardiner 's apprehension however be for the supply of fuel much of that bring from home have be fairly use in the camboose and in the stove originally set up in the hut large as that stock have be a very sensible inroad have be make upon it and accord to a calculation he have make the wood regularly lay in would not hold out much more than half the time that it would be indispensable to remain on the island this be a grave circumstance and one that demand very serious consideration without fuel it would be impossible to survive no hardening process be sufficient to fortify the human frame to a degree that would resist the influence of a antarctic winter from the moment it be probable the party would be oblige to pass the winter at sealer 's land therefore roswell have keep a vigilant eye on the wood stimson have more than once speak to he on the subject and with great prudence warmth must be keep among we say the old boat-steerer or there will be no hope for the stoutest man in either crew we have a pretty good stock of coffee and that be better any day than all the rum and whiskey that be ever distil good hot coffee of a morning will put life into we the coldest day that ever come out of either pole and they do say the south be colder than the north though i never could understand why it should be so you surely understand the reason why it grow warmer as we approach the equator and colder as we go from it whether we go north or south stimson assent though have the truth be say he would have be oblige to confess that he know no more than the fact all sailor know sich thing captain gar ` ner though they know it with very different degree of exper ` ence but few get as far south as i have be to pass a winter a good pot of hot coffee of a morning will go as far as a second pee-jacket if a man have to go out into the open air when the weather be at the hardest luckily we small store be quite abundant and we be better off for coffee and sugar than for anything else i lay in of both liberally when we be at rio yes rio be a good place for the article but coffee must be _ hot _ to do a fellow much good in one of these high-latitude winter and to be hot there must be fuel to heat it i be afraid the wood will not hold out much more than half the time we shall be here fortunately we have a large supply but the other schooner be by no means as well furnished with fuel as she ought to have be for such a voyage well sir i suppose you know what must be do next in such a case without _ warm _ food man can no more live through one of these winter than they can live without food at all if the vineyard craft have no proper fuel aboard she we must make fuel of she roswell regard stephen with fixed attention for some time the idea be present to he mind for the second time and he greatly like it that might do he say though it will not be a easy matter to make captain daggett consent to such a thing let he go two or three morning without he warm meal and hot coffee answer stimson shake he head and he will be glad enough to come into the scheme a man soon get willing to set fire to anything that will burn in such a climate a notion have be float about in my mind captain gar ` ner that i have several time think i would mention to you d'ye think sir any benefit could be make of that volcano over the bay should the worst get to the worst with we i have think of the same thing stephen though i fear in vain i suppose no useful heat can be give out there until one get too near the bad air to breathe it what you say about break up the other schooner however be worthy of consideration and i will speak to captain daggett about it roswell be as good as he word and the vineyard mariner meet the proposal as one repel a injury never be we two master so near a serious misunderstanding as when roswell suggest to daggett the expediency of break up the wreck now that the weather be endurable and the man could work with reasonable comfort and tolerable advantage the man who put a axe or a saw into that unfortunate craft say daggett firmly i shall regard as a enemy it be a hard enough bed that she lie on without have she rib and side tear to piece by hand this be the strange spirit in which daggett continue to look at the condition of the wreck it be true that the ice prevent he actually see the impossibility of he ever get he schooner into the water again but no man at all acquaint with mechanic and who know the paucity of means that exist on the island could for a moment entertain the idle expectation that seem to have get into the vineyard-master 's mind unless subject to a species of one-idea infatuation this infatuation however exist not only in daggett 's mind but in some degree in those of he man it be say that in a multitude of counsellor there be wisdom and the axiom come from a authority too venerable to be dispute but it might almost with equal justice be say that in-a multitude of counsellor there be folly for man be quite as apt to sustain each other in the wrong as in the right the individual who would hesitate about advance he fallacy and mistake with a single voice do not scruple to proclaim they on the hill-top when he find other tongue to repeat he error divine wisdom foresee this consequence of human weakness have provide a church-catholic and proceed directly from its great head on earth as the repository of those principle fact and law that it have deem essential to the furtherance of its own scheme of moral government on earth and yet we see audacious imitator start up on every side presume in they ignorance longing in they ambition and envious in these longing who do not scruple to shout out upon the house-tops crudity over which knowledge wonder as it smile and humility weep as it wonder such be man when sustain by he fellow in every interest of life from religion the highest of all down to the most insignificant of he temporal concern in this spirit do daggett and he crew now feel and act roswell have early see with regret that something like a feeling of party be get up among the vineyarder who have all along regard the better fortune of they neighbor with a ill-concealed jealousy ever since the shipwreck however this rivalry have take a new and even less pleasant aspect it be slightly hostile and remark have be occasionally make that sound equivocally as if the vineyarder have a intention of separate from the other crew and of living by themselves it be probable however that all this be the fruit of disappointment and that at the bottom nothing very serious be in contemplation daggett have permit he people to aid in transport most of the store to the house though a considerable supply have be leave in the wreck this last arrangement be make seemingly without any hostile design but rather in furtherance of a plan to pass as much time as circumstance would allow on board the stranded vessel there be in truth a certain convenience in this scheme that commend it to the good sense of all so long as any portion of the vineyarder could be make comfortable in the wreck it be best they should remain there for it save the labor of transport all the provision and make more room to circulate in and about the house the necessity of put so many cask barrel and box within door have materially circumscribe the limit and space be a great desideratum for several reason health in particular roswell be glad therefore when any of the vineyarder express a wish to go to the wreck and to pass a few day there with a view to encourage this disposition as well as to ascertain how those fare who choose that abode he pay daggett a visit and pass a night or two himself in the cabin of the craft this experiment tell he that it be very possible to exist there when the thermometer stand at zero but how it would do when range a great deal lower he have he doubt the cabin be small and a very moderate fire in the camboose serve to keep it reasonably warm though daggett at all time a reasonable and reasoning man when the root of all evil do not sorely beset he come fully into he own view as to the necessity of husband the fuel and of harden the man none of that close stewing over stove which be so common in america and which cause one-half of the winter disease of the climate be tolerate in either gang daggett see the prudence of roswell 's or rather of stimson 's system and fall into it freely and with hearty good-will it be during gardiner 's visit to the wreck that we two master talk over they plan for the winter while take they exercise on the schooner 's deck each well muffle up to prevent the frost from take hold of the more exposed part every one have a seal-skin cap make in a way to protect the ear and most of the face and we two master be thus provide in common with they man i suppose that we be to consider this as pleasant winter weather roswell remark the thermometer be down only at zero stimson tell I that even at orange harbor the season he be there they pay out mercury until it all get into the ball a month or two hence we may look out for the season of frost as the injin call it you will hardly think of stay out here when the really hard weather set in i do not believe we shall feel the cold much more than we do now this daily wash be a capital stove for i find all hand say that when it be once over they feel like new man as for I i shall stick by my craft while there be a timber leave in she to float roswell think how absurd it be to cling thus to a useless mass of wood and iron and copper but he say nothing on that subject i be now sorry that we take over to the house so many of we supplies daggett continue after a short pause i be afraid that many of they will have to be bring back again that would hardly quit cost daggett it would be better to come over and pass the heel of the winter with we when the supplies get to be short here as we eat we make room in the hut you know and you will be so much the more comfortable a empty pork-barrel be break up for the camboose yesterday morning we shall see -- we shall see gardner my man have get a notion that you people intend to break up this schooner for fuel should they not keep a anchor-watch aboard she anchor-watch repeat roswell smile it be well name -- if there ever be a anchor-watch you keep it here : for no ground-tackle will ever hold like this we still think the schooner may be get off daggett say regard he companion inquiringly while the vineyard-man have a certain distrust of he brother-master he have also a high respect for he fair-dealing propensity and a strong disposition to put confidence in he good faith the look that he now give be if possible to read the real opinion of the other in a countenance that seldom deceive i shall be grateful to god captain daggett return roswell after a short pause if we get through the long winter of this latitude without burn too much of _ both _ craft than will be for we good surely it be better to begin on that which be in the least serviceable condition i have think this matter over gar ` ner with all my mind -- have dream of it -- sleep on it -- have it before I at all hour and in all weather and look at it as i will it be full of difficulty will you agree to take in a half-cargo of my skin and ile next season and make in all respect a joint v ` y' ge of it from home home ag ` in if we 'll consent to let this craft be burn it exceed my power to make any such bargain i have a owner who look sharply after he property and my crew be upon lay like the people of all sealer you ask too much and you forget that should i assume the same power over my own craft as you still claim in this wreck you might never find the means of get away from the group at all we be not oblige to receive you on board we schooner i know you think gar ` ner that it will be impossible for we ever to get we craft off but you overlook one thing that we may do -- what be there to prevent we break she up and of use the material to make a smaller vessel one of sixty ton say -- in which we might get home besides take most of we skin i will not say _ that _ will be impossible but i do say it will be very difficult it would be wiser for you in my judgment to leave you cargo in the house under the keep of a few hand if you see fit and go off with I i will land you at rio where you can almost always find some small american craft to come south in and pick up you leavings if you choose that the man leave behind should amuse themselves in you absence by build a small craft i be certain they will meet with no opposition from I there be but one place where a vessel can be launch and that be the spot in the cove where we beach you schooner there it might possibly be do though i think not without a great deal of trouble and possibly not without more means than be to be pick up along shore in this group but there be a very important fact that you overlook daggett which it may be as well to mention here as to delay it _ you _ craft or _ mine _ must be use as fuel this winter or we shall freeze to death to a man i have make the calculation closely and certain as we existence there be no alternative between such a death and the use of the fuel i have mention not a timber of mine shall be touch i do not believe one-half of these story about the antarctic winter which can not be much worse than what a body meet with up in the bay of fundy a winter in the bay of fundy without fuel must be bad enough but it be a mere circumstance to one here i should think that a man who have taste a antarctic _ summer _ and _ autumn _ must get a pretty lively notion of what be to come after they the man can keep in they berth much of the time and save wood there be many other way of get through a winter than burn a vessel i shall never consent to a stick of this good craft 's go into the galley-fire as long as i can see my way clear to prevent it i would burn _ cargo _ before i would burn my _ craft _ roswell wonder at this pertinacity but he trust to the pressure of the come season and change the subject certainly the thought of break up he own craft do not cross he mind : though he could see no sufficient objection to the other side of the proposition as discussion be useless however he continue to converse with daggett on various practical subject on which he companion be rational and disposed to learn it have be ascertain by experiment that the water at a considerable depth be essentially warmer beneath the ice than at its surface a plan have be devise by which the lower current of the water could be pump up for the purpose of the bath thus render the process far more tolerable than it have previously be bathing in extremely cold weather however be not as formidable a thing as be generally suppose the air be at a lower temperature than the water as the greatest importance be attach to these daily ablutions the subject be go over between the two master in all its bearing there be no convenience for the operation at the wreck and this be one reason why roswell suggest that a residence there ought to be abandon daggett dissent and invite he companion to take a walk in he cavern a promenade in a succession of cave form of ice with the thermometer at zero would naturally strike one as a somewhat chilling amusement gardiner do not find it so he be quite protect from the wind which give so much pungency to bitter cold render it insupportable completely protect from this and warm by the exertion of clamber among the cake roswell 's blood be soon in a healthful glow and to own the truth when he leave the wreck it be with a much better opinion of it as a place of residence than when he have arrive to pay he visit as there be now nothing for the man to do in the way of preparation mode of amusement be devise that might unite activity of body with that of the mind the snow cease to fall as the season advance and there be but few place on which heavy burthen might not have be transport over they crust it be indeed easier move about on the surface of the frozen snow than it have be on the naked rock : the latter offering obstacle that no longer show themselves slide down the declivity and even skating be practice few northern american be ignorant of the latter art various other source of amusement be resort to but it be find generally that very little exercise in the open air exhaust the frame and that a great difficulty of breathing occur still it be think necessary to health that the man should remain as much as possible out of the crowded house and various project be adopt to keep up the vital warmth while expose ere the month of July have pass which correspond to we January it have be find expedient to make dress of skin for which fortunately the material abound as the season advance the idea of preserve more than the life of he man be gradually abandon by gardiner though daggett still cling to he wreck and actually have wood transport back to it that he might stay as much as possible near he property there be no longer any thawing though there be very material gradation in the intensity of the frost occasionally it be quite possible to remain in the open air a hour or two at a time then again there be day in which it exceed the power of human endurance to remain more than a few minute remove to any distance from heat artificially procure on the whole however it be find that the comparatively moderate weather predominate and it be rare indeed that all the people do not pursue they avocation and amusement outside at what be call the middle of the day and what a meridian it be the shortest day have pass some time when roswell and stimson be walk together on the terrace then as usual as clear from snow as if sweep by a broom but otherwise wear the aspect of interminable winter in common with all around it they be converse as have be much they wont of late and be watch the passage of the sun as he steal along the northern horizon even at high noon rise but a very few degree above it it have a cold look sir but it do give out some heat say stephen as he face the luminary in one of he turn i can feel a little warmth from it just now sheltered we we be here under the cliff and with a back-ground of naked rock to throw back what reach we to I all these change in the movement of the sun seem very strange captain gar ` ner but i know i be ignorant and that other may well know all about what i do not understand here gardiner undertake to explain the phenomenon that have be slightly treat on in we own page there be few american so ignorant as not to be fully aware that the sun have no sensible motion or any motion that have a apparent influence on we own planet but fewer still clearly comprehend the reason of those very change that be occur constantly before they eye we can not say that captain gardiner succeed very well in he undertaking though he imprint on the old boat-steerer 's mind the fact that the sun would not be see at all be they only a few degree farther south than they actually be and now sir i suppose he 'll get higher and higher every day put in stephen until he come quite up above we head not exactly that at noon though abeam as it might be morning and evening still the coldest of we weather be yet to come or i have no exper ` ence in such thing why do not the heat come back with the sun -- or what seem to be the sun come back though as you tell I captain gar ` ner it be only the ` arth sheer this-a-way and that-a-way in she course one may well ask such a question -- but cold produce cold and it take time to wear it out February be commonly the coldest month in the year even in america though day any one in February march and even April be month i dread here and that so much the more stephen because we fuel go a good deal faster than i could wish what you say be very true sir still the people must have fire i turn out this morning while all hand be still in they berth and look to the stove and it be as much as human natur ' could bear to be about without my cap and skin-covering though in-door the whole time if the weather go on as it have begin we shall have to keep a watch at the stove nor do i think one stove will answer we much longer we shall want another in the sleeping-room heaven know where the wood be to come from unless captain daggett give up the wreck we shall certainly be out long before the mild season return we must keep ourselves warm sir by read the bible answer stimson smile though the glance he cast at he officer be earnest and anxious you must not forget captain gar ` ner that you have promise one who be pray for you daily to go through the chapter she have mark and give the matter a patient and attentive thought no sealin ' sir can be half as important as this reading of the good book in the right spirit so you believe that jesus be the son of god exclaim roswell half inquiringly and half in a modify sort of levity as much as i believe that we be here sir i wish i be half as certain of we ever get away what have cause you to believe this stimson -- reason or the talk of you mother and of the parson my mother die afore i could listen to she talk sir : and very little have i have to do with parson for the want of be where they be to be find _ faith _ tell I to believe this and faith come from god and i could believe it too be faith impart to I from the same source as it be i fear i shall never believe in what appear to I to be a impossibility then follow a long discussion in which ingenuity considerable command of language human pride and worldly sentiment contend with that clear intuitive deep conviction which it be the pleasure of the deity often to bestow on those who would otherwise seem to be unfitted to become the repository of so great a gift as we shall have to deal with this part of we subject more particularly hereafter we shall not enlarge on it here but pursue the narrative as it be connect with the advance of the season and the influence the latter exert over the whole party of the lose sealer chapter xxv beyond the jewish ruler band close a company full glorious i see the twelve apostle stand o with what look of ravishment and joy what rapturous tear what heart of ecstacy they gaze again on they beloved master -- _ hillhouse 's judgment _ it have become necessary to advance the season to the beginning of the month of October which correspond to we own April in a temperate climate this would mark the opening of spring and the revive hope of a new and genial season would find a place in every bosom not so at sealer 's land so long as the winter be at its height and the clear steady cold continue by fall into a system so prepared as to meet the want of such a region matter have go on regularly if not with comfort and as yet the personal disaster be confine to a few frozen cheek and nose the result of carelessness and wanton exposure rather than of absolute necessity but one who have see the place in July and who examine it now would find many mark of change not to say of deterioration in the first place a vast deal of snow have fall fall indeed to such a degree as even to cover the terrace block up the path that communicate with the wreck and nearly to smother the house and all around it the wind be high and piercing render the cold doubly penetrate the thermometer now vary essentially sometimes rise considerably above zero though oftener fall far below it there have be many storm in September and October be open with a most blustering and wintry aspect in one sense however the character of the season have change the dry equal cold that be generally supportable have be succeed by tempest that be sometimes a little moist but oftener of intense frigidity of course the equinox be past and there be more than twelve hour of sun the great luminary show himself well above the northern horizon and though he circuit describe a arch that do not promise soon to bring he near the zenith at meridian it be a circuit that seem about to enclose sealer 's land by carry the orb of day so far south morning and evening as to give it a air of travel round the spot these change have not occur without suffer and danger enormous icicle be suspend from the roof of the house reach to the ground the third and fourth succession of these sign of heat and cold unite the earlier formation have be knock down and throw away mountain of drift snow be to be see in place all along the shore and wreath that threaten fearful avalanche be suspend from the cliff wait only for the increase of the warmth to come down upon the rock beneath once already have one of these mass fall on the wreck and the oyster pond man have be busy for a week digging into the pile in order to go to the rescue of the vineyarder there be much generosity and charitable feeling display in this act for owe to the obstinate adherence of daggett and he people to what they deem they rights roswell have finally be compel to cut to piece the upper work of he own schooner to obtain fuel that might prevent he own party from freezing to death the position of the sea lion of oyster pond be to be trace only by a high mound of snow which have be arrest by the obstacle she present to its drift but she bulwark plank deck top-timbers stern-frame -- in short nearly all of the vessel above water have actually be take to piece and carry within the covering of the verandah mention in readiness for the stove to render the obstinacy of the other crew more apparent daggett have be oblige to do the same much of he beloved craft have already disappear in the camboose and more be likely to follow this compel destruction however rather increase than lessen he pertinacity he cling to the last chip and no term of compromise would he now listen to at all the stranded wreck be he and he people 's while the other wreck belong to the man from oyster pond let each party act for itself and take care of its own such be he express opinion and on they he act this state of thing have not be bring about in a day month have pass roswell have see he last billet of wood put in the camboose have try various experiment for produce heat by means of oil which so far succeed as to enable the ordinary boil to be do thereby save wood but when a cold turn set in it be quickly find that the schooner must go or all hand perish when this decree go forth every one understand that the final preservation of the party depend on that of the boat for one entire day the question have be up in general council whether or not the two whale-boat should be burn with they oar and appurtenance before the attack be make on the schooner itself stimson settle this point as he do so many other roswell listen to all he say with a constantly increase attention if we burn the boat first say the boat-steerer and then have to come to the schooner a ` ter all how be we ever to get away from this group they boat would not last we a week even in we best weather but they may answer to take we to some christian land when every rib and splinter of the sea lion be turn into ash i would begin on the upper work of the schooner first captain gar ` ner resarvin ' the spar though they would burn the freest then i would see away the top-timbers beam deck transom and everything down within a foot of the water but i would not touch anything below the copper for this here reason : unless captain daggett set to work on he craft and burn she up altogether we may find mater ` al enough in the spring to deck over ag ` in the poor thing down there in the cove and fit she out a ` ter a fashion and make much better weather of it in she than in we boat that be my opinion sir it be decide that this line of conduct should be pursue the upper work of the schooner be all take out of she as soon as the weather permit and the wood be carry up and store in the house even with this supply it be soon see that great economy be to be use and that there might be the necessity of get at the vessel 's bottom as for the schooner as the people still affectionately call the hull or what be leave of the hull everything have be take out of she the frozen oil be carry up to the house in chunk and use for fuel and light a good deal of heat be obtain by make large wick of canvass and place they in vessel that contain oil though it be very far from suffice to keep life in the man during the hardest of the weather the utmost economy in the use of the fuel that have be so dearly obtain be still deem all-essential to eventual preservation happily the season advance all this time and the month of October be reach the intercourse between the crew have by no means be great during the two solemn and critical month that be just past a few visit have be exchange at noon-day and when the thermometer be a little above zero but the snow be fill the path and as yet there be no thaw to produce a crust on which the man might walk about a month previously to the precise time to which it be we intention now to advance the more regular action of the legend macy have come over to the house attend by one man with a proposal on the part of daggett for the two crew to occupy he craft as he still persist in call the wreck and of use the house as fuel this be previously to begin to break up either vessel gardiner have think of this plan in connection with he own schooner a scheme that would have be much more feasible than that now propose on account of the difference in distance but it have soon be abandon all the material of the building be of pine and that well seasoned a wood that burn like tinder no doubt there would have be a tolerably comfortable fortnight or three week by make these sacrifice then would have come certain destruction as to the proposal of daggett there be many objection to it a want of room would be one want of provision another and there would be the necessity of transport store bedding and a hundred thing that be almost as necessary to the people as warmth and which indeed contribute largely to they warmth in addition be the objection just mention of the insufficiency of the material of the build a objection which be just as applicable to a residence in one vessel as a residence in the other of course the proposition be decline macy remain a night with the oyster ponder and leave the house after breakfast next morning know that daggett only wait for he return with a negative to commence break up the wreck the mate be attend by the seaman return as he have arrive two day later there have be a slight yielding of the snow under the warmth of the noon-day sun and a consequent hardening of its crust in the succeed night roswell and stimson undertake to return this visit with a view to make a last effort to persuade daggett to quit the wreck and come over to the house altogether when they have get about half-way between the two place they find the body of the seaman stiff frozen hard and dead a quarter of a mile further on the reckless macy who it be suppose greatly sustained daggett in he obstinacy be find in precisely the same state both have fall in the path and stiffen under the terrible power of the climate it be not without difficulty that roswell reach the wreck and report what he have see even this terrible admonition do not change daggett 's purpose he have begin to burn he vessel for there be now no alternative but he be do it on a system which as he explain it to roswell be not only to leave he material with which to construct a smaller craft in the spring but which would allow of he inhabit the steerage and cabin as long as he please in some respects the wreck certainly have its advantage over the house there be more room for exercise the cavern of the ice be extensive while they completely exclude the wind which be now the great danger of the season it be doubtless owe to the wind that macy and he companion have perish as the spring approach these wind increase in violence though there have be slight symptom of they come more blandly even at the time when they colder current be really frightful a whole month succeed this visit of roswell 's during which there be no intercourse it be September the march of the antarctic circle and the weather have be terrific during most of the period it be during these terrible four week that roswell complete he examination of the all-important subject mary have mark out for he and which stimson have so earnestly and so often place before he mind the sudden fate of macy and he companion the condition of he crew and all the serious circumstance with which he be surround conspire to predispose he to inquiry and what be equally important in such a investigation to humility man be a very different be in high prosperity from what he become when the blow of a evil fortune or the visitation of divine providence alight upon he the skepticism of roswell be more the result of human pride of confidence in himself than in any precept derive from other or of any deep reasoning process whatever he conceive that the theory of the incarnation of the son of god be oppose to philosophy and experience it be true and thus far he may be say to have reason in the matter though it be in he own way and with a very contract view of the subject but pride have much more to do with even this conclusion than a knowledge of physics or philosophy it do not comport with the respect he entertain for he own power to lend he faith to a account that conflict with so many of the opinion he have form on evidence and practice credulous woman might have they conviction on the truth of this history but it be not necessary for man to be as easily dupe there be something even amiable and attractive in this weakness of the other sex that would ill comport however with the greater sternness of masculine judgment roswell as he once tell stimson hesitate to believe in anything that he could not comprehend he god must be worship for the obvious truth of he attribute and existence he wish to speak with respect of thing that so many worthy people reverenced but he could not forget that providence have make he a reasoning creature and he reason must be convinced stephen be no great logician as the reader will easily understand but newton possess no clearer demonstration of any of he problem than this simple nay ignorant man enjoy in he religious faith through the divine illumination it have receive in the visit of the holy spirit that gloomy month however have not be throw away all the man be dispose to be serious and the reading of the bible openly and aloud soon become a favorite occupation with every one of they although roswell 's reading be direct by the mark of mary all of which have reference to those passage that touch on the divinity of the savior he make no comment that betray he incredulity there be a simple earnestness in the narrative portion of the gospel that commend its truth to every mind and it have its effect on that of roswell gardiner though it fail to remove doubt that have so long be cherish and which have they existence in pride of reason or what pass for such with those who merely skim the surface of thing as they seem to exist around they on the evening of that particular day in October to which we desire now to advance the time and after the most pleasant and cheerful afternoon and sunset that any on the island have see for many month roswell and stimson venture to continue they exercise on the terrace then again clear of impediment even after the day have close the night promise to be cold but the weather be not yet so keen as to drive they to a shelter both fancy there be a feeling of spring in the wind which be from the north-east a quarter that bring the blandest current of air into those sea if any air of that region deserve such a term at all it be high time we have some communication with the vineyarder say roswell as they turn at that end of the terrace which be nearest to the wreck a full month have pass since we have see any of they or have hear a syllable of they doings or welfare it be a bad business this separation captain gar ` ner return the boat-steerer and every hour make it worse think how much good might have be do they young man have they only be with we while we have be read the book of book night and morning sir that good book seem to fill most of you thought stephen -- i wish i could have you faith it will come in time sir if you will only strive for it i be sure no heart could have be harder than mine be until within the last five year i be far worse as a christian captain gar ` ner than i consider you to be for while you have doubt consarn the divinity of we bless lord i have no thought of any one of the trinity my only god be the world and sich a world too as a poor sailor know it be be but little better than the brute of all the man with I you seem to be the most contented and happy i can not say i have see even a sign of fear about you when thing have be at the worst it would be very ungrateful sir to mistrust a providence that have do so much for I i devoutly wish i could believe with you that jesus be the son of god excuse I captain gar ` ner it be jist because you do not _ devoutly _ wish this that you do not believe i think i understand the natur ' of you feelin 's sir i have some sich once myself though it be only in a small way i be too ignorant to feel much pride in my own judgment and soon give up every notion that go ag ` in scriptur ' i own it be not accordin ' to natur ' as we know natur ' to believe in this doctrine but we know too little of a thousand thing to set up we weak judgment in the very face of revelation i be quite willing to believe all i can understand stephen but i find it difficult to credit account that be irreconcilable with all that my experience have teach I to be true they who be of you way of thinkin ' sir do not deny that christ be a good man and a prophet and that the apostle be good man and prophet and that they all work miracle this much i be willing enough to believe but the other doctrine seem contrary to what be possible yet you have see sir that these apostle believe what you refuse one thing have cross my mind captain gar ` ner which i wish to say to you i know i be but a ignorant man and my idee may be hardly worth you notice but sich as they be i want to lay 'em afore you we be tell that these apostle be all man from a humble class in life with little l'arnin ' choose as it might be to show man that faith stand in need of no riches or edication or worldly greatness of any sort to I sir there be a wholesome idee in that one thing it give we all a useful lesson stephen and have often be mention i believe in connection with the doctrine of christianity yes sir -- so i should think though i do not remember ever to have hear it name from any pulpit well captain gar ` ner it do not agree with we notion to suppose that god himself a part of the ruler and master of the universe should be bear of a woman and come among sinner in order to save 'em from he own just judgment that be just the difficulty that i have in believe what be call the dogma of christianity on that one point to I it have ever seem the most improbable thing in the world just so sir -- i have some sort of feelin of that natur ' myself once when god in he goodness put it into my heart to believe however as he be please to do in a fit of sickness from which i never expect to rise and in which i be lead to pray to he for assistance i begin to think over all these matter in my own foolish manner among other thing i say to myself ` be it likely that any mortal man would dream of call christ the son of god unless it be put into _ he _ mind to say so ' then come the character of they man who all admit be upright and religious how can we suppose that they would agree in give the same account of sich a thing unless what they say have be tell to they by some tongue that they believe roswell smile at stephen 's reasoning which be not without a certain point but which a ingenious man might find the means of answering in various way there be another thing sir that i have read in a book resume the boat-steerer which go a great way with I jesus allow other to call he the son of god without rebuke they for do so it do really seem that they who believe he be a good man as i understand be the case with you captain gar ` ner must consider this as a strong fact we be to remember what a sin idolatry be how much all ra'al worshipper abhor it and then set that feelin ' side by side with the fact that the son do riot think it robbery to be call the equal of the father to I that look like a proof that we belief have a solid foundation roswell do not reply he be aware that it would not be just to hold any creed responsible for the manner in which a person like stimson defend it still he be strike with both of this man 's fact the last he have often meet in book but the first be new to he of the two this novel idea of the improbability of the apostle ' invent that which would seem to be oppose to all man 's notion and prejudice strike he more forcibly than the argument adduce from the acquiescence of the redeemer in he own divinity the last might be subject to verbal criticism and could possibly be explain away as he imagine but the first appear to be intimately incorporate with the entire history of christ 's ministration on earth these be the declaration of john the baptist the simple and unpretending history of the gospel the commentary of st paul and the venerable teaching of the church through so many century of vary degree of faith and contention each and all go to corroborate a doctrine that in he eye have appear to be so repugnant to philosophy and reason wish to be alone roswell give a order to stimson to execute some duty that fall to he share and continue walk up and down the terrace alone for quite a hour longer the night be come in cold and still it be one of those last effort of winter in which all the terrible force of the season be concentrate : and it really appear as if nature wearied with its struggle to return to a more genial temperature yield in despair and be literally return backwards through the coldest of she month the moon be young but the star give forth a brightness that be rarely see except in the clear cold night of a high latitude each and all of these sublime emblem of the power of god be twinkle like bright torch glowing in space and the mind have only to endow each with its probable or known dimension its conjectural and reasonable use to form a picture of the truest sublimity in which man be make to occupy he real position in this world where in a certain sense he be master where all thing be apparently under he influence if not absolutely subject to he control where little that be distinctly visible be to be meet with that do seem to be create to meet he want or to be wholly at he disposal one get a mistaken and frequently a fatal notion of he true place in the scale of the being who be intend to throng around the footstool of the almighty as the animalcula of the atmospheric air bear a proportion to thing visible so would this throng seem to bear a proportion to we vague estimate of the spiritual host all this roswell be very capable of feeling and in some measure of appreciate and never before have he be make so conscious of he own insignificance as he become while look on the firmament that night glowing with its bright world and sun doubtless the centre of other system in which distance swallow up the lesser orb almost every one have hear or read of that collection of star which go by the name of the southern cross the resemblance to the tree on which christ suffer be not particularly striking though all who navigate the southern hemisphere know it and recognize it by its imputed appellation it now attract roswell 's gaze and come as it do after so much reading so many conversation with stephen and address itself to one whose heart be soften by the fearful circumstance that have so long environ the sealer it be not surprising that it bring we young master to meditate seriously on he true condition in connection with the atonement that he be willing to admit have be make for he in common with all of earth at the very moment he hesitate to believe that the sufferer be in any other than a metaphorical sense the son of god it be not we intention to describe more of the religious for I where there be the same knowledge there be too much companionship like for worship and reverence but we be tell that man be create after the image of god in he likeness captain gar ` ner -- with _ some _ of the divine spirit but not with all that make he different from the brute and immortal i have convarse with a clergyman who think that the angel and archangel and other heavenly being be far before even the saint in heaven such as have be only man on ` arth the idea of not have a deity that he could not comprehend have long be one of roswell gardiner 's favorite rule of faith he do not understand by this pretend dogma that he be in any respect of capacity equal to comprehend with that of the divine be but simply that he be not to be expect or require to believe in any theory which manifestly conflict with he knowledge and experience as both be control by the power of induction he have derive directly from he creator in a word he exception be one of the most obvious of the suggestion of the pride of reason and just so much in direct opposition to the great law of regeneration which have its very gist in the converse of this feeling -- faith as we young master pace the terrace alone that idea of the necessity of the creator 's be incomprehensible to the create recur to he the hour that succeed be probably the most important in roswell gardiner life so intense be he feeling so active the workings of he mind that he be quite insensible to the intensity of the cold and he body keep equal motion with he thought if one may so express it he frame actually set at defiance a temperature that might otherwise have chill it warmly and carefully as it be clad truly there be many cause exist at that time and place to bring any man to a just sense of he real position in the scale of create being the vault above roswell be sparkling with orb float in space most of they far more vast than this earth and each of they doubtless have its present or destine use what be that light so brilliant and pervade throughout space that convert each of those mass of dark matter into globe clothe with a glorious brightness roswell have see chemical experiment that produce wonderful illuminations but faint indeed be the most glowing of those artificial torch to the flood of light that come streaming out of the void on mission of million and million of mile who and what be the dread be -- dread in he majesty and justice but inexhaustible in love and mercy -- who use these exceed means as mere instrument of he pleasure and what be he himself that he should presume to set up he miserable pride of reason in opposition to a revelation support by miracle that must be admit to come through man inspire by the deity or reject altogether in this frame of mind roswell be make to see that christianity admit of no half-way belief it be all true or it be wholly false and why should not christ be the son of god as the father of the church have perseveringly but so simply proclaimed and as that church have continue to teach for eighteen century roswell believe himself to have be create in the image of god and he much-prized reason tell he that he could perpetuate himself in successor : and that which the creator have give _ he _ the power to achieve could he not in he own person perform for the first time a inference to the contrary seem to be illogical then the necessity for the great expiation occur to he mind this have always be a stumbling-block to roswell 's faith he could not see it and that which he could not see he be indispose to believe here be the beset weakness of he character a weakness which do not suffer he to perceive that could he comprehend so profound a mystery he would be raise far above that very nature in which he take so much pride as he reflect on this branch of the subject a thousand mystery physical and moral float before he mind and he become aware of the little probability that he should have be endow with the faculty to comprehend this the greatest of they all have not science gradually discover the chemical process by which gas could be concentrated and disengage the formation of one of those glitter orb above he head would have be quite as unintelligible a mystery to he as the incarnation of the savior the fact be that phenomenon that be just as mysterious to the human mind as any that the dogma of christianity require to be believe exist hourly before we eye without awaken skepticism or exciting discussion find they impunity in they familiarity many of these phenomenon be strictly incomprehensible to human understanding which could reason up to a fountain-head in each case and there it be oblige to abandon the inductive process purely for the want of power to grapple with the premise which control the whole demonstration could mary pratt have know what be go on in roswell gardiner 's soul that night she happiness would have be as boundless as she gratitude to god she would have see the barrier that have so long interpose itself to she wish break down not by any rude hand but by the influence of those whispering of the divine spirit which open the way to man to fit themselves for the presence of god chapter xxvi let winter come let polar spirit sweep the darkening world and tempest-troubled deep campbell while the bosom of roswell be thus warm with the new-born faith of which the germ be just open in he heart stimson come out upon the terrace to see what have become of he officer it be much past the hour when the man get beneath the covering of they mattress and the honest boat-steerer who have perform the duty on which he have be send be anxious about roswell 's remain so long in the open air on this positively the severest night of the whole season you stand the cold well captain gar ` ner say stephen as he join he officer but it might be prudent now to get under cover i do not feel it cold stephen -- return roswell -- on the contrary i be in a pleasant glow my mind have be busy while my frame have keep in motion when such be the fact the body seldom suffer but hearken -- do it not seem that some one be call to we from the direction of the wreck the great distance to which sound be convey in intensely cold and clear weather be a fact know to most person conversation in the ordinary tone have be hear by the sealer when the speaker be nearly a mile off and on several occasion attempt have be make to hold communication by means of the voice between the wreck and the hut certain word _ have _ be understand but it be find impossible to hold anything that could be term conversation still the voice have be often hear and a fancy have come over the mind of roswell that he hear a cry like a call for assistance just as stimson join he it be so late sir that i should hardly think any of the vineyarder would be up observe the boat-steerer after listen some little time in the desire to catch the sound mention then it be so cold that most man would like to get beneath they blanket as soon as they could i do not find it so very cold stephen have you look at the thermometer lately i give it a look in come out sir and it tell a terrible story to-night the marcury be all down in the ball which be like givin ' the matter up i do suppose captain gar ` ner ` tis strange i do not _ feel _ it so very cold the wind seem to be get round to north-east too give we enough of that and we shall have a thaw hark there be the cry again this time there could be no mistake a human voice have certainly be raise amid the stillness of that almost polar night clearly appeal to human ear for succor the only word hear or comprehend be that of help one well enough adapt to carry the sound far and distinctly there be a strain of agony in the cry as if he who make it utter it in despair roswell 's blood seem to flow back to he heart never have he before feel so appalling a sense of the dependence of man on a divine providence as at that moment you hear it he say inquiringly to stephen after a instant of silent attention to make sure that no more be to reach he ear just then sartain sir -- no man could mistake _ that _ it be the voice of the nigger joe he that captain daggett have for a cook think you so stephen the fellow have good lung and they may have set he to call upon we in they distress what can be the nature of the assistance they ask i have be think of that captain gardner and a difficult p ` int it be to answer food they must have still and be they in want of they ration hand would have be send across to get 'em they may have let they fire go out and be without the means to re-light it i can think of nothing else that be likely to happen to man so sarcumstanced the last suggestion strike roswell as possible from the instant he feel certain that he be call on for aid he have determine to proceed to the wreck notwithstanding the lateness of the hour and the intense severity of the weather as he have intimate to stephen he be not at all conscious how very cold it be exercise and the active workings of he mind have bring he to a excellent condition to resist the sternness of the season the appeal have be so sudden and unexpected however that he be at first somewhat at a loss how to proceed this matter be now discuss between he and stimson when the follow plan be adopt : -- the mate be to be call and make acquaint with what have occur and put on they guard as to what might possibly be require of they it be not think necessary to call any of the rest of the man there be always one hand on the watch in the house whose duty it be to look to the fire for the double purpose of security against a conflagration and to prevent the warmth within from sink too near to the cold without it have often occur to roswell 's mind that a conflagration would prove quick destruction to he party in the first place most of the provision would be lose and it be certain that without a cover and the means of keep warm within it the man could not resist the climate eight-and-forty hour the burning of the hut would be certain death roswell take no one with he but stimson two be as good as a hundred if all that be ask be merely the means to re-light the fire these means be provide and a loaded pistol be take also to enable a signal-shot to be fire should circumstance seem to require further aid one or two mode of communicate leading fact be concerted when we hero and he companion set forth on they momentous journey take the hour the weather and the object before he into the account roswell gardiner feel that he be now enlist in the most important undertaking of he whole life as he and stephen shake hand with the two mate and leave the point the drift render a somewhat circuitous path necessary at first but the moon and star shed so much of they radiance on the frozen covering of the earth that the night be quite as light as many a london day excitement and motion keep the blood of we two adventurer in a brisk circulation and prevent they become immediately conscious of the chill intensity of the cold to which they be expose it be good to think of almighty god and of he many marcy say stephen when a short distance from the house as a body go forth on a expedition as serious as this we may not live to reach the wrack for it seem to I to grow colder and colder i wonder we hear no more of the cry remark roswell who be think of the distress he be bent on relieve one would think that a man who could call so stoutly would give we another cry a body can never calcilate on a nigger answer stephen who have the popular american prejudice against the caste that have so long be hold in servitude in the land they call out easily and shut up oncommon quick if there be nothin ' gain by yell black blood will not stand cold like white blood captain gar ` ner any more than white blood will stand heat like black blood i have hear this before stephen and it have surprise I that captain daggett 's cook should be the only one of that party who seem to have have any voice to-night stimson have a good deal to say now as the two pick they way across the field of snow always walk on the crust which in most place would have uphold a loaded vehicle the subject of he remark be the difference between the two race as respects they ability to endure hardship the worthy boat-steerer have several tale to relate of case in which he have know negro freeze when whites have escape as the fact be one pretty well establish roswell listen complacently enough be much too earnest in press forward toward he object to debate any of he companion 's theory just then it be while thus employ that roswell fancy he hear one more cry resemble those which have bring he on this dangerous undertaking on a night so fearful this time however the cry be quite faint and what be not so easily explain it do not appear to come from the precise direction in which the wreck be know to lie but from one that diverge considerably from that particular quarter of course the officer mention this circumstance to the boat-steerer and the extraordinary part of the information cause some particular discussion between they to I that last call seem to come from up yonder nearer to the cliff than the place where we be and not at all from down there near to the sea where the wrack be say stimson in the course of he remark so sartain be i of this that i feel anxious to change we course a little to see if it be not possible that one of the vineyarder have get into some difficulty in try to come across to we roswell have the same desire for he have make the same conjecture though he do not believe the black would be the person choose to be the messenger on such a occasion i think captain daggett would have come himself or have send one of he best man he observe in preference to trust a negro with a duty so important we do not know sir that it be the nigger we hear misery make much the same cry whether it come from the throat of white or black let we work upward nearer to the cliff sir i see something dark on the snow hereaway as it might be on we larboard bow roswell catch a glimpse of the same object and thither we adventurer now bent they step walk on the crust without any difficulty so long as they keep out of the drift one do not find it as easy to make any physical effort in a intensely cold atmosphere as he do when the weather be more moderate this prevent roswell and he companion from move as fast as they otherwise might have do but they get along with sufficient rapidity to reach the dark spot on the snow in less than five minute after they have change they course you be right stephen say gardiner as he come up to this speck amid the immensity of the white mantle that cover both sea and land far as the eye could reach it be the cook the poor fellow have give out here about half-way between the two station there must be life in he yet sir -- nigger as he be it be not yet twenty minute since he give that last cry help I to turn he over captain gar ` ner and we will rub he and give he a swallow of brandy a little hot coffee now might bring the life back to he heart roswell comply first firing he pistol as a signal to those leave behind the negro be not dead but so near it that a very few more minute would have seal he fate the application and friction use by gardiner and the boat-steerer have a effect a swallow of the brandy probably save the poor fellow 's life while work on he patient captain gardiner find a piece of frozen pork which on examination he ascertain have never be cook it at once explain the nature of the calamity that have befall the crew of the wreck so intent be the two on they benevolent duty that a party arrive from the house in obedience to the signal in much less time than they could have hope for it be lead by the mate and come provide with a lamp burning beneath a tin vessel fill with sweeten coffee this hot drink answer a excellent purpose with both well and sick after a swallow or two aid by a vigorous friction and closely surround by so many human body the black begin to revive and the sort of drowsy stupor which be know to precede death in those who die by freezing have be in a degree shake off he be enable to stand alone and by means of assistance to walk the hot coffee be of the greatest service every swallow that he get down appear to set the engine of life into new motion the compel exercise contribute its part and by the time the mate to use he own expression have run the nigger into dock which mean when he have get he safe within the hut he sens and faculty have so far revive as to enable he to think and to speak as gardiner and stimson return with he everybody be up and listen when the black tell he story it would seem that during the terrible month which have just pass daggett have compel he crew to use more exercise than have be they practice of late some new apprehension have come over he on the subject of fuel and he order to be save in that article be most stringent and very rigidly enforce the consequence be that the camboose be not as well attend to as it have be previously and as circumstance require indeed that it should be at night the man be tell to keep themselves warm with bed-clothes and by huddle together and the cabin be small so many person crowd together in it do not fail to produce a impression on its atmosphere such be the state of thing when on go to he camboose in order to cook the breakfast this very black find the fire totally extinguish not a spark could he discover even among the ash and what be even worse the tinder-box have disappear as respects the last it may be well to state here that it be afterwards discover carefully bestow between two of the timber of the wreck with a view to a particular safe-keeping the person who have make this disposition of it forget what he have do the loss of the tinder-box under the circumstance be almost as great a calamity as could have befall man in the situation of the vineyarder as against the cold by means of bed-clothes exercise and other precaution it might have be possible to exist for some time provide warm food could be obtain but the frost penetrate the cabin and every one soon become sensitively alive to the awkwardness not to say danger of they condition a whole day be pass in fruitless attempt to obtain fire by various process friction do not succeed it probably never do with the thermometer at zero spark could be obtain but by this time everything be stiff with the frost the food already cook be soon as hard as bullet and it be find that on the second night brandy that be expose be convert into a lump of ice not only do the intensity of the cold increase but everything even to the human system seem to be gradually congeal and prepare to become convert into receptacle for frost several of the man begin to suffer in they ear nose foot and other extremity and the bunk be soon the only place in which it be find possible to exist in anything like comfort no less than three man have be send at interval of a few hour across to the house with a view to obtain fire or the means of light one along with other article that be consider necessary to the safety of the people the cook have be the third and last of these messenger he have pass he two shipmate each lie dead on the snow -- or as he suppose lifeless for neither give the smallest sign of vitality on a examination it be in the agony of alarm produce by these appalling spectacles that the negro have cry aloud for help send the sound far enough to reach the ear of roswell still he have persevere until chill as much with terror as with the cold and the want of warm nourishment the cook have sink into what would have soon prove to be he last long sleep when the timely succor arrive it be some two hour after the black have be get into the hut and be strengthen with a good hot supper ere he have communicate all the fact just related roswell succeed however in get a little at a time from he and when no more remain to be relate the plan be already arrange for future proceedings it be quite clear no unnecessary delay should be permit to take place the cold continue to increase in intensity notwithstanding it be the opinion of the most experienced among the man that a thaw and a great spring thaw be approach it often happen in climate of a exaggerated character that these extreme almost touch each other as they be say to meet in man roswell leave the house for the second time that eventful night just at the hour of twelve he now go accompany by the second mate and a foremast-hand as well as by he old companion the boat-steerer each individual drink a bowl of hot coffee before he set out and a good warm supper have also be take in the interval between the return and this new sortie experience show that there be no such protector against the effect of cold as a full stomach more especially if the food be warm and nourishing this be understand by roswell and not only do he cause the whole party that set forth with he at that late and menacing hour to receive this sustenance but he order the kettle of boil coffee to be carry with they and keep two lamp burn for the double purpose of maintain the heat and of have a fire ready on reach the wreck the oil of the sea-elephant together with piece of canvass prepare for the purpose supply the necessary material so intensely severe be the weather that roswell have serious thought of return when he reach the spot where the black have be find but the picture of daggett 's situation that occur to he mind urge he on and he proceed every precaution have be take to exclude the cold as it be usually term which as it respect the body mean little else than keep the vital heat in and very useful be these provision find to be skin form the principal defense though the man have long adopt the very simple but excellent expedient of wear two shirt owe to this and to the other measure take neither of the four be strike with a chill and they all continue on at the place mention by the black the body of one of daggett 's best man a boat-steerer be find the man be dead of course and the corpse be as rigid as a billet of wood every particle of moisture in it have congeal until the whole of what have be a very fine and manly frame lay little more than a senseless lump of ice a few degree to the southward of the spot where it be now see it be probable that this relic of humanity would have retain its form and impression until the trump sound to summon it to meet its former tenant the spirit in judgment no time be lose in useless lamentation over the body of this man who be much of a favorite among the oyster ponder twenty minute later the second corpse be find both the body lie in what be the customary track between the house and the wreck it be the last that have die but like that of the unfortunate man just describe it be in a state to be preserve ten thousand year without the occurrence of a thaw merely glance at the rigid feature of the face in order to identify the person roswell pass on the chill feeling of every individual of he party now admonish they all of the necessity of get as soon as possible to some place where they could feel the influence of a fire in ten minute more the whole be in the cavern of the ice and presently the cabin of the wreck be enter without turn to the right hand or to the leave without look for one of the inmate of the place every man among the new-comer turn he attention instantly to get the fire light the camboose have be fill with wood and it be evident that many effort have be make to produce a blaze by those who have put it there splinter of pine have be insert among the oak of the vessel and nothing be want but the means of kindle these most fortunately for themselves the party of roswell have and eagerly do they now have recourse to they use there be not a man among the oyster ponder who do not just at that moment feel he whole be concentrate in that one desire to obtain warmth the cold have slowly but surely insinuate itself among they garment and slight chill be now feel even by roswell whose frame have be most wonderfully sustain that night through the force of moral feeling stimson be the individual who be put forward at the camboose other hold the lamp canvass saturate with oil and some prepared paper it be find to be perceptibly warmer within the cabin with its door close and the external covering of sail & c that have be make to exclude the air than without nevertheless when roswell glance at a thermometer that be hang against the bulk-head he see that all the mercury be still in the ball the interest with which we party now watch the proceedings of stephen have much of that intensity that be know to attend any exhibition of vital importance life and death be however to be dependent on the issue and the manner in which every eye be turn on the wood and stephen 's mode of deal with it denote how completely the dread of freezing have get possession of the mind of even these robust and generous man roswell alone venture for a single moment to look around the cabin three of the vineyarder only be visible in it though it strike he that other lay in the berth under pile of clothes of the three who be up one be so near the lamp he hold in he hand that its light illumined he face and all that could be see of a form envelop in skin this man sit lean against a transom he eye be open and glare on the party around the camboose the lip be slightly part and at first roswell expect to hear he speak the immovable feature rigid muscle and wild expression of the eyeball however soon tell he the melancholy truth the man be dead the current of life have actually freeze at he heart shudder as much with horror as with a sharp chill that just then pass through he own stout frame we young master turn anxiously to note the success of stimson in get the wood of the camboose in a blaze every one in the least accustomed to a very severe climate must have have frequent occasion to observe the reluctance with which all sort of fuel burn in exceedingly cold weather the billet of wood that shall blaze merrily on a mild day moulder and simmer and seem indispose to give out any heat at all with the thermometer at zero in a word all inanimate substance that contain the element of caloric appear to sympathize with the prevailing state of the atmosphere and to contribute to render that which be already too cold for comfort even colder so it be now notwithstanding the preparation that have be make baffled twice in he expectation of procure a blaze stephen stop and take a drink of the hot coffee as he swallow the beverage it strike he that it be fast lose its warmth a considerable collection of canvass saturate with oil be now put beneath the pile in the midst of splinter of pine and one of the lamp be force into the center of the combustible this expedient succeed the frost be slowly chase out of the kindling material a sickly but gradually increase flame strive through the kindling stuff and soon begin to play among the billet of the oak the only fuel that could be rely on for available heat still there be great danger that the lighter wood would all be consume ere this main dependence could be arouse from its dull inactivity frost appear to be in possession of the whole pile and it be expel so slowly cling to its dominion with so much power as really to render the result doubtful for a moment or two fortunately there be find a pair of bellows and by means of a judicious use of this very useful implement the oak wood be get into a bright blaze and warmth begin to be give out from the fire then come the shivering and chill with which intense cold consent even to abandon the human frame and by they number and force roswell be make to understand how near he and he companion have be to death as the young man see the fire slowly kindle to a cheerful blaze a glow of gratitude flow towards he heart and mentally he return thanks to god the cabin be so small have be make so tight by artificial means and the camboose be so large that a sensible influence be produce on the temperature as soon as the wood begin to burn a little freely as none of the heat be lose the effect be not only apparent but most grateful roswell have look into the vessel of the camboose while the fire be gather head one the largest be fill or nearly so with coffee freeze to a solid mass in the other beef and pork have be set over to boil and there the piece now be embed in ice and freeze to block it be when these two distinct mass of ice begin to melt that it be know the fire be begin to prevail and hope revive in the bosom of the oyster ponder on take another look at the thermometer it be find that the mercury have so far expand as to be leave the ball it soon after ascend so high as to denote only forty degree below zero every thing even to life depend on maintain and increase the power of the fire the man now look about they for more fuel there be a ample stock in the cabin however the fire have become extinguish not for want of wood but in the usual way it be needless to describe the manner in which those who stand around the stove watch the flame or how profound be they satisfaction when they see that stimson have finally succeed god be praise for this and for all he mercy exclaim stephen lay aside the bellows at last i can feel warmth from the fire and that will save such of we as have not yet be take away he then lift the lid and look into the different vessel that be on the ice be melting fast and the steam of coffee become apparent to the sens it be at this instant that a feeble voice be hear issue from beneath the covering of a berth gar ` ner it say imploringly if you have any feelin ' for a fellow-creatur ' in distress warm I up with one swallow of that coffee oh how pleasantly it smell and how good it must be for the stomach for three day have i taste nothing -- not even water this be daggett the long-tried sealer the man of iron nerve and golden longing he who have so lately concentrate within himself all that be necessary to form a pertinacious resolute and grasp seeker after gain how change now in all this he ask for the means of preserve life and think no more of skin and oils and treasure on desert key roswell be no sooner apprise of the situation of he brother-master than he bestow the necessary care on he want fortunately the coffee bring by the oyster ponder and which retain some of its original warmth have be set before the fire and be now as hot as the human stomach could bear it two or three swallow of this grateful fluid be give to daggett and he voice almost instantaneously show the effect they produce i be in a bad way garner resume the vineyard-master i fear we be all in a bad way that be here i hold out ag ` in the cold as long as human natur ' could bear it but be force to give in at last how many of you people still remain daggett tell we that we may look for they and attend to they want i be afraid gar ` ner they 'll never want anything more in this life the second mate and two of the hand be sit in the cabin when i get into this berth and i fear ' t will be find that they be dead i urge they to turn in too as the berth be the only place where anything like warmth be to be find but drowsiness have come on 'em and when that be the case freezin ' soon follow the three man in the cabin be past we assistance be actually freeze into log but there must be several more of you i see the sign of two other in the berth -- ah what do you say to that poor fellow stephen the spirit be still in the body sir but about to depart if we can get he to swallow a little of the coffee the angel of death may yet loosen he hold on he the coffee be get down this man 's throat and he instantly revive he be a young man name lee and be one of the finest physical specimen of strength and youth in the whole crew on examine he limb none be find absolutely freeze though the circulation of the blood be so near be check that another hour of the great cold which have reign in the cabin and which be slowly increase in intensity must have destroy he on apply a similar process to daggett roswell be startle at the discovery he make the foot leg and forearm of the unfortunate vineyarder be all as stiff and rigid as icicle in these particulars there could be no mistake and man be immediately send for snow in order to extract the frost by the only safe process know to the sealer the dead body be carry from the cabin and lay decently on the ice outside the increase warmth within render the removal advisable on glance again at the thermometer now suspend in a remote part of the cabin the mercury be find rise to two above zero this be a very tolerable degree of cold and the man begin to lay aside some of they extra defence against the weather which would otherwise be of no service to they when expose outside the crew of the vineyard lion have consist of fifteen soul one less than that of she consort of these man four have lose they life between the wreck and the house two on a former and two on the present occasion three body be find sit in the cabin and two more be take out of the berth dead the captain the cook and lee add to these make a dozen leave but three of the crew to be account for when question on the subject lee say that one of those three have freeze to death in the cavern several day before and the other two have set out for the hut in the last snow-storm unable to endure the cold at the wreck any longer as these two man have not arrive at the house when gardiner and he companion leave it they have perish out of all doubt thus of the fifteen human being who have sail together from martha 's vineyard ready to encounter every hazard in order to secure wealth or what in they estimation be wealth but three remain and of these two might be consider in a critical condition lee be the only man of the entire crew who be sound and fit for service chapter xxvii bid _ he _ bow down to that which be above he -- the overrule infinite -- the maker -- who make he not for worship -- let he kneel and we will kneel together byron when the body have be remove from the cabin and the limb of daggett be cover with snow roswell gardiner take another look at the thermometer it have rise already to twenty degree above zero this be absolutely warmth compare with the temperature from which the man have just escape and it be feel to be so in they person the fire however be not the only cause of this most acceptable change one of the man who have be outside soon come back and report a decide improvement in the weather the wind which have be coquet with the north-east point of the compass for several hour now blow steadily from that quarter a hour later it be find on examination that a second thermometer which be outside actually indicate ten above zero this sudden and great change come altogether from the wind which be now in the warm quarter the man strip themselves of most of they skin and the fire be suffer to go down though care be take that it should not again be totally extinguish we have little pleasure in exhibit picture of human suffering and shall say but little of the groan and pain that daggett utter and endure while undergo that most agonizing process of have the frost take out of he system by cold application it be the only safe way of treat he case however and as he know it he bear he suffering as well as man could bear they long ere the return of day he be release from he agony and be put back into he berth which have be comfortably arrange for he have the almost unheard-of luxury of sheet with a additional mattress as stephen remark when the man be tell to try and get a little sleep there be plenty of berth empty and each on we can have as many clothes and as warm a bed as he can ask for now that so many have hasten away to they great account as it might be in the pride of they youth and strength activity the responsibility of command and the great necessity there have be for exertion prevent roswell from reflect much on what have happen until he lay down to catch a little sleep then indeed the whole of the past come over he in one sombre terrible picture and he have the most lively perception of the danger from which he have escape as well as of the mercy of god 's providence surround by the dead as it might be and still uncertain of the fate of the live he view of the past and future become much lessen in confidence and hope the majesty and judgment of god assume a higher place than common in he thought while he estimate of he self be fast get to be humble and search in the midst of all these change of view and feeling however there be one image unaltered in the young man 's imagination mary occupy the back-ground of every picture with she meek gentle but bloom countenance if he think of god _ she _ eye be elevated in prayer if the voyage home be in he mind and the chance of success be calculate _ she _ smile and anxious watchfulness stimulate he to adventure if arrive and safe she downcast but joyful look betray the modest happiness of she inmost heart it be in the midst of some such picture that roswell now fell asleep when the party turn out in the morning a still more decide change have occur in the weather the wind have increase to a gale bring with it torrent of rain come from the warm quarter a thaw have set in with a character quite as decide as the previous frost in that region the weather be usually exaggerate in its feature and the change from winter to spring be quite as sudden as that from autumn to winter we use the term spring and autumn out of complaisance to the usage of man but in fact these two season have scarcely any existence at all in the antarctic sea the change commonly be from winter to summer such as summer be and from summer back to winter notwithstanding the favourable appearance of thing when roswell walk out into the open air next morning he well know that summer have not yet come many week must go by ere the ice could quit the bay and even a boat could put to sea there be consideration of prudence therefore that should not be neglect connect with the continuance of the supplies and the means of subsistence in one respect the party now on the island have be gainer by the terrible loss it have sustain in daggett 's crew the provision of the two vessel might now virtually be appropriate to the crew of one and roswell when he come to reflect on the circumstance see that a providential interference have probably save the survivor from great privation if not from absolute want still there be a thaw and one of that decide character which mark a climate of great extreme the snow on the mountain soon begin to descend upon the plain in foam torrent and increase by the tribute receive from the last the whole come tumble over the cliff in various place in rich water-fall there be about a mile of rock that be one continuous cataract the sheet be nearly unbroken for the whole distance the effect of this deluge from the plain above be as startling as it be grand all the snow along the rocky shore soon disappear and the fragment of ice begin rapidly to diminish in size and to crumble at first roswell feel much concern on account of the security of the wreck he original apprehension be that it would be wash away this ground of fear be soon succeed by another of scarcely less serious import -- that of its be crush by the enormous cake of ice that make the cavern in which it lay and which now begin to settle and change they position as the water wash away they basis at one time roswell thought of set the storm at defiance and of carry daggett across to the house by means of the hand-barrow but when he come to look at the torrent of water that be cross the rock so many rage rivulet the idea be abandon as impracticable another night be therefore pass in the midst of the tempest the north-east wind the rain and the thaw be all at work in concert when we adventurer come abroad to look upon the second day of they sojourn in the wreck by this time the cavern be drip with a thousand little stream and every sign denote a most rapid melting of the ice on carry the thermometer into the open air it stand at sixty-two and the man find it necessary to lay aside they second shirt and all the extraordinary defence of they attire nor be this all the wind that cross the salt water be know to have more than the usual influence on the snow and ice and such be the effect now produce by it on sealer 's land the snow indeed have mostly disappear from all place but the drift while the ice be much diminish in its size and outline so grateful be the change from the extreme cold that they have so lately endure that the man think nothing of the rain at all they go about in it just as if it do not stream down upon they in little torrent some of they clamber up the cliff and reach a point whence it be know that they could command a view of the house the return of this party which roswell do not accompany be wait for with a good deal of interest when it get back it bring a report that be deem important in several particulars the snow have go from the plain and from the mountain with the exception of a few spot where there have be unusual accumulation of it as respect the house it be stand and the snow have entirely disappear from its vicinity the man could be see walk about on the bare rock and every symptom be that of settle spring this be cheer news and the torrent have much diminish in size some have disappear altogether roswell set out for the cape leave the second mate in charge of the wreck lee the young vineyarder who have be rescue from freezing by the timely arrival of we hero accompany the tatter have join he fortune to those of the oyster ponder the two reach the house before dark where they find hazard and he companion in a good deal of concern touch the fate of the party that be out a deep impression be make by the report of what have befall the other crew and that night roswell read prayer to as attentive a congregation as be ever assemble around a domestic hearth as for fire none be now need except for culinary purpose though all the preparation to meet cold weather be maintain it be well know that a shift of wind might bring back the fury of the winter the follow morning it be clear though the wind continue warm and balmy from the north no such weather indeed have be feel by the sealer since they reach the group and the effect on they be highly cheer and enliven before he have breakfast roswell be down in the cove examine into the condition of he vessel or what remain of she a good deal of frozen snow still lay heap on the mass and he set the hand at work to shovel it off before noon the craft be clear and most of the snow be melt it require little more than exposure to the air in order to get rid of it as soon as the hulk be clear roswell direct he man to take everything out of it the remains of cargo water-cask and some frozen provision in order that it might float as light as possible the ice be freeze close to every part of the vessel 's bottom to a depth of several foot follow she mould a circumstance that would necessarily prevent she settling in the water below she timber but as there be no tell when this ice might begin to recede by melt it be deem prudent to use this precaution it be find that the experiment succeed the hulk actually rise when relieve from the weight in it no less than four inch a consultation be hold that night between gardiner he officer and the oldest of the seaman the question present be whether the party should attempt to quit the group in the boat or whether they should build a little on the hulk deck she over and make use of this altered craft to return to the northward there be a good deal to be say on both side if the boat be use the party might leave as soon as the weather become settle and the season a little more advance by drag the boat on sledge across the ice to the open water which be suppose to be some ten or twenty mile to the northward and a large amount of provision might thus be save on the other hand however as it regard the provision the boat would hold so little that no great gain would be make by go early in they and leave a sufficient supply behind to keep all hand two or three month this be a consideration that present itself and it have its weight in the decision then there be the chance of the winter 's return bring with it the absolute necessity of use a great deal more fuel this be a matter of life and death comparatively pleasant as the weather have become there be no security for its so continue one entire spring month be before the sealer and a shift of wind might convert the weather into a wintry temperature should such be the case it might become indispensable to burn the very material that would be require to build up and deck over the hulk there be therefore many thing to be take into the account nor be the question settle without a great deal of debate and reflection after discuss all these point the decision be as follow it be at least a month too soon to think of trust themselves in that stormy ocean on the high sea and in the open boat and this so much the more because nature as if expressly to send back a reasonable amount of warm air into the polar region with a view to preserve the distinction of the season cause the wind to blow most of the time from the northward as this month in all prudence must be pass on the island it might as well be occupy with building upon the hulk as in any other occupation should the cold weather return the material would still be there and might be burn in the last extremity just as well or even with greater facility after be bring over to the cove as if leave where they then be or at the wreck should the winter not return the work do on the vessel would be so much gain and they would be ready for a earlier start when the ice should move on this last plan the duty be commence very little interrupted by the weather for quite three week the wind hold from point favourable to the progress of spring veer from east to west but not once get any southing in it occasionally it blow in gale send down upon the group a swell that make great havoc with the outer edge of the field-ice every day or two a couple of hand be send up the mountain to take a look-out and to report the state of matter in the adjacent sea the fleet of berg have not yet come out of port though it be in motion to the southward like three-deckers drop down to outer anchorage in roadstead and bay as roswell intend to be off before these formidable cruiser put to sea they smallest movement or change be watch and note as for the field-ice it be break up mile at at a time until there remain very little of it with the exception of the portion that be wedge in and jam among the island of the group from some cause that could not be ascertain the wave of the ocean which come tumble in before the northern gale fail to roll home upon this ice which lose its margin now it be reduce to the limit of the group slowly and with great resistance some of the sealer ascribe this obstinacy in the bay-ice to its greater thickness believe that the shallowness of the water have favor a frozen formation below that do not so much prevail off sounding this theory may have be true though there be quite as much against it as in its favor for polar ice usually increase above and not from below the sea be much warmer than the atmosphere in the cold month and the ice be make by deposite of snow moisture and sleet on the surface of the field and berg in those three week which carry forward the season to within ten day of summer a great deal of useful work be do daggett be bring over to the house on a handbarrow for the second time and make as comfortable as circumstance would allow from the first roswell see that he state be very precarious the frozen leg in particular be threaten with mortification all the expedient know to a sealer 's _ materia medico _ be resort to in order to avert consequence so serious but without success the circulation could not be restore as nature require it to be do and fail of the support derive from a healthful condition of the vital current the fatal symptom slowly supervene this change however be so gradual that it scarce affect the regular course of the duty it be a work of great labor to transport the remain timber and plank of the wreck to the cove without the wheel indeed it may be question whether it could have be do at all in a reasonable time the break up of the schooner be in itself no trifling job for fully one half of the frame remain to be pull to piece in prepare the material for use again a good deal of embarrassment be experience in consequence of the portion of the two vessel that be leave be respectively they lower body all the upper work of each have be burn with the exception of the after part of daggett 's craft which have be preserve on account of the cabin this occasion a good deal of trouble in moulding and fitting the new upper work on the hulk in the cove roswell have no idea of rebuild he schooner strictly in she old form and proportion he do not indeed possess the material for such a reconstruction he plan be simply to raise on the hulk as much as be necessary to render she safe and convenient and then to get as good and secure a deck over all as circumstance would allow fortunately for the progress of the work lee the vineyard man be a ship-carpenter and he skill essentially surpass that of smith who fill the same station on board the oyster pond craft these two man be now of the greatest service for though neither understand draft each be skilful in the use of tool and have a certain readiness that enable he to do a hundred thing that he have never find it necessary to attempt on any former occasion if the upper frame that be now get on the sea lion be not of faultless mould it be securely fasten and render the craft even stronger than it have be originally some regard be have to resist the pressure of ice and experience have teach all the sealer where the principal defence against the effect of a nip ought to be place the line be not perfect it be true but this be of less moment as the bottom of the craft which alone have any material influence on she sailing be just as it have come from the hand of the artizan who have originally mould she by the end of a fortnight the new top-timber be all in they place and secure while a complete set of bend be bring to they and be well bolt the caulking-iron be put in requisition as soon as a streak be on the whole work advance as it might be _ parus passu _ plank for the deck be much want for in the terrible strait for fuel which have cause the original assault on the schooner this portion of the vessel have be the first burn as of the most combustible material the quarter-deck of the vineyard craft luckily be entire and its plank so far answer a excellent purpose they serve to make a new quarter-deck for the repair but the whole of the main-deck and forecastle remain to be provide for material be glean from different part of the two vessel until a reasonably convenient and a perfectly safe deck be lay over the whole craft the coaming for the hatch be take from daggett 's schooner which have not be break up in those part it be scarcely necessary to say that the ice have early melt from the rock of the coast the cavern all disappear within the first week of the thaw the attitude into which the cake have be throw greatly favor the melting process by expose so much surface to the joint action of wind rain and sun what be view as a favourable augury the seal begin to reappear there be a remote portion of the coast from which the ice have be drive by the wind around the north-west cape that be already alive with they alas these animal no longer awaken cupidity in the breast of the sealer the last no longer thought of gain but simply of save they life and of restore themselves to the humble place they have hold in the world previously to have come on this ill-fated voyage this re-appearance of the seal produce a deep impression on roswell gardiner he mind have be much inclined of late to dwell more and more on religious subject and he conversation with stephen be still more frequent than formerly not that the boat-steerer could enlighten he on the great subject by any learn lore for in this stimson be quite deficient but he officer find encouragement in the depth and heartiness of he companion 's faith which seem to be raise above all doubt and misgiving whatever during the gloomiest moment of that fearful winter stephen have be uniformly confide and cheerful not once have he be see to waver though all around he be despond and anticipate the worst he heart be light exactly in proportion as he faith be strong we shall neither freeze nor starve he use to say unless it be god 's will and when it be he pleasure depend on it friend it will be for we good as for daggett he have finally give up he hold on the wreck and it seem no longer to fill he thought when he be tell that the seal have come back he eye brighten and he nature betray some of its ardent longing but it be no more than a gleaming of the former spirit of the man now become dim under the darkness that be fast encircle all he view of this world it be a pity gar ` ner that we have no craft ready for the work he say under the first impulse of the intelligence at this early time in the season a large ship might be fill we have other matter on we hand captain daggett be the answer they must be look to first if we can get off the island at all and return safe to those who i much fear be now mourn we as dead we shall have great reason to thank god a few skin would do no great harm gar ` ner even to a craft cut down and reduce we have more cargo now than we shall be able to take with we quite one half of all we skin must be leave behind we and all of the oil the hold of the schooner be too shallow to carry enough of anything to make out a voyage i shall ballast with water and provision and fill up all the spare room with the best of we skin the rest of the property must be abandon why abandon leave a hand or two to take care of it and send a craft out to look for it as soon as you get home leave I gar ` ner i be willing to stay roswell think that the poor man would be leave whether he wish to remain or not for the symptom that be know to be so fatal in case like that of daggett 's be make themselves so apparent as to leave little doubt of the result what render this display of the master-passion somewhat remarkable be the fact that we hero have on several occasion converse with the invalid conceal no material feature of he case and the latter have express he expectation of a fatal termination if not a absolute willingness to die stimson have frequently pray with daggett and roswell have often read particular chapter of the bible to he at he own request create a impression that the vineyarder be think more of he end than of any interest connect with this life such might have be probably _ be _ the case until the seeming return of what have once be deem good luck awaken old desire and bring out trait of character that be about to be lose in the near view of a future world all this roswell saw and note and the reflection produce by he own perilous condition the certain loss of so many companion the probable death of daggett and the humble but impressive example and sympathy of stimson be such as would have delight the tender spirit of mary pratt could she have know of they existence but the great consideration of the moment the center of all the hope and fear of we sealer be the rebuilding of the mutilate sea lion although the long thaw do so much for they the reader be not to regard it as such a spell of warm weather as one enjoy in may within the temperate zone there be no flower no sign of vegetation and whenever the wind cease to blow smartly from the northward there be frost at two or three interval cold snap set in that look seriously like a return to winter and at the end of the third week of pleasant weather mention it begin to blow a gale from the southward to snow and to freeze the storm commence about ten in the forenoon ere the sun go down the day then be of great length every passage around the dwelling be already block up with bank of snow several time have the man ask permission to remove the sail from the house to admit air and light but it be now find that the tent-like verandah they form be of as much use as it have be at any time during the season without it indeed it would not have be possible for the people to quit they dwelling during three entire day everything like work be of course suspend during this tempest which seriously menace the unfortunate sealer with the necessity of again break up they schooner now nearly complete with a view again to keep themselves from freezing the weather be not so intensely cold as it have be continuously for month during the past winter but come as it do after so long a spell of what might be consider as a balmy atmosphere in that region it find the people unbraced and little prepared for it at no time be the thermometer lower than twenty degree below zero this be near morning after a sharp and stinging night nor be it for any succession of hour much below zero but zero be now hard to bear and fire and good fire too be absolutely necessary to keep the man from suffer as well as from despondency perhaps the spectacle of daggett die from the effect of frost before they eye serve to increase the uneasiness of the people and to cause they to be less sparing of the fuel than person in they situation ought to have be it be certain that a report be bring to roswell in the height of the tempest and when the thermometer be at the lowest that there be not wood enough leave from the plunder of the two vessel exclusively of that which have be work up in the repair to keep the fire go eight-and-forty hour longer it be true a little wood intend to be use in the homeward passage enough to last as far as rio possibly have be use in stow the hold and that might be get at first if it ever cease to snow without that addition to the stock in the house it would not be within the limit of probability to suppose the people could hold out against the severity of such weather a great while longer every expedient that could be devise to save wood and to obtain warmth from other source be resort to of course by roswell 's order lamp be burn with great freedom not little vessel invent to give light but such torch as one see at the lighting up of a princely court-yard on the occasion of a _ fête _ in which wick be make by the pound and unctuous matter be use by the gallon old canvass and elephant ' oil supply the material and the spare camboose which have be bring over to the house to be set up there while the other galley be be place on board very well answer the purpose of a lamp some warmth be obtain by these means but much more of a glaring and unpleasant light it be during the height of this tempest that the soul of daggett take its flight towards the place of depart spirit in preparation for the hour when it be to be summon before the judgment-seat of god previously to he death the unfortunate vineyarder hold a frank and confidential discourse with roswell as he last hour approach he error and mistake become more distinctly apparent as be usual with man while he sin of omission seem to crowd the vista of by-gone day then it be that the whole earth do not contain that which in he die eye would prove a equivalent for one hour pass in a sincere devout and humble service of the deity i be afraid that i have love money most too well he say to roswell not a hour before he draw he last breath but i hope it be not so much for myself as for other a wife and child gar ` ner tie a man to ` arth in a most unaccountable manner sealer ' companion be use to hearing of misfortune and the vineyard woman know that few on 'em live to see a husband at they side in old age still it be hard on a mother and wife to l'arn that she choose friend have be cut off in the pride of he day and in a distant land poor betsey it would have be better for we both have we be satisfy with the little we have for now the good woman will have to look to all matter for herself daggett now remain silent for some time though he lip move most probably in prayer it be a melancholy sight to see a man in the vigor of he manhood whose voice be strong and whose heart be still beat with vigor and vitality standing as it be on the brink of a precipice down which all know he be to be so speedily hurl but the decree have go forth and no human skill could arrest it shortly after the confession and lamentation we have record the decay reach the vitals and the machine of clay stop to avoid the unpleasant consequence of keep the body in so warm a place it be bury in the snow at a short distance from the house within a hour after it have cease to breathe when roswell gardiner see this man who have so long adhere to he like a leech in the pursuit of gold lay a senseless corpse among the frozen flake of the antarctic sea he feel that a lively admonition of the vanity of the world be administer to himself how little have he be able to foresee all that have happen and how mistaken have be he own calculation and hope what then be that intellect of which he have be so proud and what reason have he to rely on himself in those matter that lay equally beyond the cradle and the grave -- that incomprehensible past and the unforeseen future towards which all those in existence be hasten roswell have receive many lesson in humility the most useful of all the lesson that man can receive in connection with the relation that really exist between the deity and himself often have he wonder while read the bible mary pratt have put into he hand at the stubborn manner in which the choose people of god have return to they idol and they grove and they high place but he be now make to understand that other still err in this great particular and that of all the idol man worship that of self be perhaps the most objectionable chapter xxviii long swoln in drenching rain seed germ and bud start at the touch of vivify beam move by they secret force the vital lymph diffusive run and spread o'er wood and field a flood of verdure wilcox at length it come to be rumor among the sealer that the fire must be permit to go out or that the material use for make the berth and various other fixture of the house must be take to supply the stove it be when it get to be know that the party be reduce to this sad dilemma that roswell break through the bank of snow that almost cover the house and get so far into the open air as to be able to form some estimate of the probable continuance of the present cold weather the thermometer within the bank of snow but outside of the building then stand at twenty below zero but it be much colder in the unobstructed current of as keen and bite a south wind as ever come howl across the vast field of ice that cover the polar basin the snow have long cease but not until a immense quantity have fall nearly twice as much roswell and hazard think as they have see on the rock at any time that winter i see no sign of a change mr hazard roswell remark shiver with the intensity of the cold we have better go back into the house before we get chill for we have no fire now to go to to warm ourselves it be much warmer within door than it be in the open air fire or no fire there be many reason for that captain gar ` ner answer the mate so many body in so small a space the shelter from the wind and outer air and the snow bank all help we i think we shall find the thermometer indoors at a pretty comfortable figure this morning on examine it it be find to stand at only fifteen below zero make a difference of five degree in favor of the house as compare with the sort of covered gallery under the tent and probably of five more as compare with the open air on a consultation it be decide that all hand should eat a hearty meal remove most of they clothes and get within the covering of they berth to see if it would not be possible to wear out the cold spell in some tolerable comfort beneath rug and blanket on the whole it be think that the berth might be make more serviceable by this expedient than by put they material into the stove accordingly within a hour after roswell and he mate have return from they brief out-door excursion the whole party be snugly bestow under pile of rug clothes sail and whatever else might be use to retain the animal heat near the body and exclude cold in this manner six-and-thirty hour be pass not a man of they all have the courage to rise from he lair and encounter the severity of the climate now unrelieved by anything like a fire roswell have sleep most of the time during the last ten hour and in this he be much like all around he a general feeling of drowsiness have come over the man and the leg and foot of many among they notwithstanding the quantity of bed-clothes that be in particular pile on that part of they person be sensitively alive to the cold no one ever know how low the thermometer go that fearful night but a sort of common consciousness prevail that nothing the man have yet see or feel equal its chill horror the cold have get into the house convert every article it contain into a mass of frost the berth cease to be warm and the smallest exposure of a shoulder hand or ear soon produce pain the head of very many of the party be affect and breathing become difficult and trouble a numbness begin to steal over the lower limb and this be the last unpleasant sensation remember by roswell when he fall into another short and disturbed slumber the propensity to sleep be very general now though many struggle against it know it be the usual precursor of death by freezing we hero never know how long he sleep in the last nap he take on that memorable occasion when he awake he find a bright light blaze in the hut and hear some one move about the camboose then he thought revert to himself and to the condition of he limb on try to rub he foot together he find they so nearly without sensation as to make the consciousness of they touching each other almost out of the question take the alarm at once he commence a violent friction until by slow degree he could feel that the nearly stagnant blood be get again into motion so great have be roswell 's alarm and so intent he occupation that he take no heed of the person who be busy at the camboose until the man appear at the side of he berth hold a tin pot in he hand it be stimson up and dress without he skin and seemingly in perfect preservation here be some hot coffee captain gar ` ner say the provident boat-steerer and then turn out the wind have shift by the marcy of god and it have begin to rain _ now _ i think we may have summer in ` arnest as summer come among these sealin ' island roswell take six or eight swallow of the coffee which be smoking hot and instantly feel the genial influence diffuse over he whole frame send stephen to the other berth with this timely beverage he now sit up in he berth and rub he foot and leg with he hand the exercise friction and hot coffee soon bring he round and he spring out of he berth and be quickly dress stimson have light a fire in the camboose use the very last of the wood and the warmth be begin to diffuse itself through the building but the change in the wind and the consequent melioration of the temperature probably alone save the whole of the oyster pond crew from experience the dire fate of that of the vineyard craft stephen get man after man out of he berth by dose of the steam coffee and the blood be thus stimulate by the aid of friction everybody be soon up and stir it be find on inquiry that all three of the black have toe or ear freeze and with they the usual application of snow become necessary but the temperature of the house soon get to be so high as to render the place quite comfortable warm food be deem very essential stephen have put a supply of bean and pork into he copper and the frost have be extract from a quantity of the bread by soak it in cold water a hearty meal of good hot and most nourishing food be make by all hand this set we sealer up no more complaint of the frost be hear it be indeed no longer very cold the thermometer be up to twenty-six above zero in the house when roswell turn out and the cooking process together with stephen 's fire and the shift of wind soon bring the mercury up to forty this be a cheer temperature for those who have be breathe the polar air and the influence of the north-east gale continue to increase the rain and thaw produce another deluge and the cliff present for several hour a sight that might have cause niagara to hide she head in mortification these sublime scene be of frequent occurrence amid the solitude of the earth the occasional phenomenon of nature often surpass in sublimity and beauty she rarest continue effort the succeed day the rain cease and summer appear to have come in reality it be true that at mid-day the thermometer in the shade stand at only forty-eight but in the sun it actually rise to seventy let those who have ever experience the extreme of heat and cold imagine the delight with which we sealer move about under such a sun all excess of clothing be throw aside and many of the man actually pursue they work in they shirt-sleeve as the snow have vanish quite as suddenly as it come everything and everybody be now in active motion not a man of the crew be dispose to run the risk of encounter any more cold on sealer 's land roswell himself be of opinion that the late severe weather be the die effort of the winter and that no more cold be to be expect and stimson agree with he in this notion the sail be take down from around the house and those article it be intend to carry away be transfer to the schooner as fast as the difficulty of the road would allow while he mate be carry on this duty we young master take a early occasion to examine the state of matter generally on the island with this view he ascend to the plain and go half-way up the mountain desire to get a good look into the offing it be soon ascertain that the recent deluge have sweep all the ice and every trace of the dead into the sea the body of daggett have disappear with the snow-bank in which it have be bury and all the carcase of the seal have be wash away in a word the rock be as naked and as clean as if man 's foot have never pass over they from the fact that skeleton of seal have be find strew along the north shore and the present void roswell be lead to infer that the late storm have be one of unusual intensity and most probably of a character to occur only at long interval but the state of the ice be the point of greatest interest the schooner could now be get ready for sea in a week and that easily but there she lay imbed in a field of ice that still cover nearly the whole of the water within the group as roswell stand on the cliff which overlook the cove he calculate the distance it would be necessary to take the schooner through the ice by saw and cut and that through a field know to be some four foot thick at five good mile at least so herculean do this task appear to be that he even think of abandon he vessel altogether and of set out in the boat as soon as the summer be fairly commence on reflection however this last plan be reserve as a _ dernier ressort _ the danger of encounter the tempest of those sea in a whale-boat without cover or fire be much too great to be think of so long as any reasonable alternative offer the berg to the southward be in motion and a large fleet of they be put to sea as it might be come in from those remote and then unknown region in which they be form from the mountain we hero count at least a hundred all regularly shape with top like that of table-land and with even regular side and upright attitude it be very desirable to get ahead of these new maritime alp for the ocean to the northward be unusually clear of ice of all kind that lodge between the island except so long as it be safe to calculate on the regular change of the season roswell know that patience and vigilance would serve he turn by bring everything round in its proper time and place but it be by no means certain that it be a usual occurrence for the great bay to be cram with field-ice as have happen the past winter if the actual state of the surround water be a exception instead of the rule on examine the shore however it be find that the rain and melted snow have create a sort of margin and that the strong wind which have be blow and which in fact be still blow have produce a gradually increase attrition until a space exist between the weather-side of the field and the rock that be some thirty fathom wide this be a important discovery and bring up a most grave question for decision owe to the shape of the surrounding land it would not be possible for the ice to float out in a body for two or three month to come or until so much have melt as to leave room for the field to pass the cape and head-land it never could have enter the bay for the same reason but for the resistless power of a field that extend league out into the ocean where act on jointly by wind and tide it come down with a momentum that be resistless rip and tear the edge of the field as if they have be so much freshly turn up mould it be then a question how to get the schooner out of she present bed and into clear water the reader will probably remember that on she first arrival at the group the sea lion have enter the great bay from the southward while in she subsequent effort to get north she have go out by the opposite passage now it occur to roswell that he might escape by the former of these route more readily than by the latter and for the follow reason : -- no field-ice have ever block up the southern passage which be now quite clear though the approach to it just then be choke by the manner in which the north-east gale that be still blow press home against the rock the field that so nearly fill the bay a shift of wind however must soon come and when that change occur it be certain that this field would move in a opposite direction leave the margin of open water that have already be mention all along the rock the distance be considerable it be true -- not less than fifteen mile -- and the whole of it be to be make quite close to sharp angular rock that would penetrate the schooner 's side almost as readily as a axe in the event of a nip but this danger might be avoid by foresight and a timely attention to the necessity of the case see no more available plan to get the vessel out of she present duresse the mate come readily into this scheme and preparation be make to carry it out as the cove be so near the north-east end of sealer 's land it may be well to explain that the reason this same mode of proceeding could not be carry out in a northern direction be the breadth of the field seaward and the danger of follow the north shore when the solid ice do leave it on account of the quantity of broken fragment that be toss and churn in its front far as the eye could reach from the cliff themselves the third day after the commencement of the thaw the wind come round again from the south-west blow heavily as be expect this soon begin to set the field in motion drive it over towards the volcano and at the same time northerly about six in the morning hazard bring a report to roswell that a margin of open water be begin to form all along under the cliff while there be great danger that the channel which have be cut from the schooner to the nearest point beneath the rock in readiness for this very contingency might be close by the pressure of the ice without on that within the cove no time be to be lose therefore if it be intend to move the craft on this shift of wind the distance that have be saw through to make the channel just name do not exceed a hundred yard the passage be not much wider than the schooner 's breadth : and it will be easily understand that it be to the last degree important to carry she through this strait as soon as possible although many useful article be scatter about on the ice and several remain to be bring over the rock from the house the order be give to get out line and to move the vessel at once the man set to work with hearty goodwill another glimpse of home rise before they imagination and in five minute after hazard have make he communication the sea lion have go six or eight time she length towards the cliff then come the pinch have not the ice be solid between the cape and the berth just before occupy by the schooner she would have be hopelessly nip by the closing of the artificial channel as it be she be catch and she progress be arrest but the field take a cant in consequence of the resistance of the solid ice that fill the whole cove to the eastward of the channel and before any damage be do the latter begin to open even faster than it have come together the instant the craft be release the sealer man they haul line again and run she up lo the rock with a hurrah the margin of water be just open but so prompt have be the movement of the man that it be not yet wide enough to permit the vessel to go any further and it be find necessary to wait until the passage be sufficiently wide to enable she to move ahead the intervene time be occupy in bring to the craft the article leave behind by nine o'clock everything be on board the wind channel that follow the sinuosity of the coast could be trace far as the eye could see the line be man and the word be again give to move roswell now feel that he be engage in much the most delicate of all he duty the desperate run through the fleet of berg and the second attempt to get to sea be not in certain particulars as hazardous as this the field have be set back and forth now for several week the margin of cleat water increase by the attrition at each return to the rock and it be know by observation that these change often occur at very short notice should the wind haul round with the sun or one of the unaccountable current of those sea intervene before the south-east cape be reach the schooner would probably be break into splinter or ground into powder in the course of some two or three hour it be all-important therefore to lose not a moment several time in the course of the first hour the movement of the schooner be arrest by the want of sufficient room to pass between project point in the cliff and the edge of the ice on two of these occasion passage be cut with the saw the movement of the field not answer to the impatience of the sealer at the end of that most momentous hour however the craft have be haul ahead a mile and a half and have reach a curvature in the coast where the margin of open water be more than fifty fathom wide and the tracking of the vessel become easy and rapid by two o'clock the sea lion be at what might be call the bottom of the great bay some three or four league from the cove and at the place where the long low cape begin to run out in a south-easterly direction as the wind could now be feel over the rock the foretopsail be set as well as the lower sail the latter be mainly becalmed however by the land when the people be all take on board the craft move faster under she canvass than by means of the haul line the wind be very fresh and in half a hour more the south-east cape come in sight close as be the navigator to the rock ten minute later the sea lion be under reef sail stretch off to the southward and eastward in perfectly clear water at first roswell gardiner be dispose to rejoice under the impression that he greatest labor have be achieve a better look at the state of thing around he however teach the disheartening lesson of humility by demonstrate that they have in truth but just commence although there be scarcely any field-ice to the southward of the group and in its immediate neighborhood there be a countless number of berg it be true these float mountain do not come very near the passage for the depth of water just there usually bring they up ere they could get into it nevertheless a large fleet of they be blockade the entire group far as the eye could reach look east west and south or along the whole line of the southern coast it be at first questionable whether and soon after it become certain that the schooner could never beat through such danger have the wind be fair the difficulty would have be insurmountable but ahead and blow a little gale the matter be out of the question some other course must be adopt there be a choice of alternative one be to go entirely round the whole group pass to the eastward of the volcano where no one of the party have ever be and the other be to follow the eastern margin of the bay keep inside of it and trust to find some opening by which the schooner could force she way into clear water to the northward after a very brief consultation with he mate roswell decide on attempt the last as the course now to be steer be almost dead before the wind the little craft lighten of so much of she upper work almost fly through the water the great source of apprehension feel by we young man in attempt this new expedient be in the probability that the field would drift home to the rock in the north-east quarter of the bay which with a south-west wind be necessarily a quarter to leeward should this prove to be the case it might be find impossible to pass ahead and the schooner would be catch in a _ cul de sac _ since it would not be in the power of she people to track she back again in the tooth of so strong a wind notwithstanding these probability on roswell go for he see plain enough that at such a moment almost anything be better than indecision the rate at which the little craft be fly before a fresh gale in perfectly smooth water soon put we sealer in a better condition to form closer estimate of they chance the look-out aloft one of whom be hazard the first officer send down on deck constant report of what they could see how do it look ahead now mr hazard demand roswell about five in the afternoon just as he schooner be come close under the smoking side of the volcano which have always be a object of interest to he though he have never find time to visit it before be there no danger of we touch the ground close in as we be to this island i think not sir when i land here we keep the lead go the whole time and we get two fathom quite up to the shore in my judgment captain gar ` ner we may run down along this land as bold as lion and how do it look ahead i have no wish to get jam here close aboard of a volcano which may be choke we all with its smoke before we know where we be not much danger of that sir with this wind these volcano be nothin ' but plaything a ` ter all the vapor be drive off towards the north-east -- that be a crack with a vengeance just as hazard be boast of the innocuous character of a volcano that near they fire a gun as the man afterwards call it cast into the air a large flight of cinder and stone accompany by a sharp flash of flame all the lighter material drive away to leeward but the heavier follow the law of projectile and scatter in all direction several stone of some size fall quite close to the schooner and a few smaller actually come down on she deck it will never do to stop here to boil we pot cry roswell to the mate we must get away from this mr hazard as fast as the good craft can travel get away it be sir there be nothing very near ahead to stop we though it do look more toward the east cape as if the field be jam in that quarter keep all you eye about you sir and look out especially for any opening among the smaller island ahead i be not without hope that the current which run among they may give we a clear passage in that quarter these word explain precisely that which do actually occur on go the schooner almost brushing the base of the volcano cause roswell many a bind of the heart when he fancy she must strike but she go clear all this time it be crack crack crack from the crater rumble sound and heavy explosion the last attend by flame and smoke of a pitchy darkness a dozen time the sea lion have very narrow escape when nearest to the danger stone of a weight to pass through she deck and bottom fall even on the ice outside of she but that hand which have so benevolently stay various other evil be stretch forth to save and nothing touch the schooner of a size to do any injury these escape make a deep impression on roswell until the past winter he have be accustom to look upon thing and event as matter of course this vacant indifference so common to man in prosperity be extend even to the sublimest exhibition of the almighty power we hero see nothing in the firmament of heaven of a clear night but the twinkling rights that seem to he to be place there merely to garnish and illumine the darkness of this globe now how differently do he look upon natural object and they origin if it be only a insect he mind present its wonderful mechanism its beauty its use no star seem less than what science have teach we that it be and the power of the dread be who have create all who govern all and who be judge of all become a inseparable subject of contemplation as he look upon the least of he work feeling thus soften and temper by humility easily lead they subject to the reception of those lead article of the christian faith which have be consecrate by the belief of the church catholic since the age of miraculous guidance and which be now venerable by time bold and presuming be he who fancy that he intellect can rectify error of this magnitude and antiquity and that the church of god have be permit to wallow on in a most fatal idolatry for century to be extricate by the pretend syllogism of he one-sided and narrow philosophy the people of the sea lion be less affect by what they see than they young commander they heart be light with the prospect of a speedy release from the hardship and danger they have undergo and at each explosion of the volcano as soon as out of reach of the fall stone they laugh and assert that the mountain be firing a salute in honor of they departure such be the difference between man whose heart and spirit have submit to the law of faith and those who live on in the recklessness of the pass event of life the schooner be race past a rocky islet begin to haul more on a wind as she make the circuit of the bay just as hazard come to the conclusion that the field have drift home on the outer island of the group and that it would be impossible to pass into clear water by go on turn he head in quest of some bay or other secure place in which the craft might wait for a favourable change he see a narrow opening to leeward of the islet he have pass but a minute before and so far as he could perceive one that lead directly out to sea it be too late to keep away for the entrance of the passage the ice be too close at hand to leeward but most fortunately there be room to tack a call to roswell soon cause the schooner to be close on a wind down go she helm and round she come like a top sail be shorten in stay and by the time the little craft be ready to fall off for the passage she have nothing on she but a foretopsail jib and a close-reefed mainsail under this canvass she glide along almost brushing the rock of the islet but without touch in twenty minute more she be clear of the group altogether and in open water that night some embarrassment be encounter from broken field-ice of which the ocean be pretty full but by exercise great vigilance no serious thump occur fortunately the period of darkness be quite short the twilight being of great length both morning and evening and the re-appearance of the sun cast a cheerful glow on the face of the troubled water the wind hold at south-west for three day blow heavily the whole time by the second night-fall the sea be clear of ice and everything be carry on the schooner that she could bear about nine o'clock on the morning of the fourth day out a speck be see rise above the ragged outline of the roll wave and each minute it become higher and more distinct a hour or two later the sea lion be stagger along before a westerly gale with the hermit of cape horn on she larboard beam distant three league how many try scene and bitter moment crowd on the mind of young roswell gardiner as he recall all that have pass in the ten month which intervene since he have come out from behind the shelter of those wild rock stormy as be that sea and terrible as be its name among mariner come as he do from one still more stormy and terrible he now regard it as a sort of place of refuge a winter there he well know would be no trifling undertaking but he have just pass a winter in a region where even fuel be not to be find unless carry there twenty day later the sea lion sail again from rio have sell all the sea-elephant oil that remain and buy store of which by this time the vessel be much in want most of the portion of the provision that be leave have be damage by the thawing process and food be get to be absolutely necessary to she people when the schooner go again into the noble harbor of the capital of brazil then succeed the lassitude and calm that reign about the imaginary line that mark the circuit of the earth at that point which be ever central as regard the sun and where the day and night be always equal no inclination of the earth 's axis to the plane of its orbit affect the climate there which know not the distinction of summer and winter or which if they do exist at all be so faintly mark as to be nearly imperceptible twenty day later the schooner be stand among some low sandy key under short canvass and in the south-east trade by she movement a anchorage be seek and one be find at last where the craft be bring up boat be hoist out and roswell gardiner land chapter xxix if every ducat in six thousand ducat be in six part and every part a ducat i would not draw they i would have my bond shakspeare the earth have not stop in its swift

belief that it be sacrilege to entertain we pretend not to any distinct impression on this subject ourselves beyond a sturdy protestant disinclination to put any faith in the abuse of purgatory at least but most devoutly do we wish that such petition _ could _ have the efficacy that so large a portion of the christian world impute to they but mary pratt so much better than we can lay any claim to be in all essential be less liberal than ourselves on this great point of doctrine roswell gardiner 's name now never pass she lip in prayer therefore though scarce a minute go by without he manly

whittle have assume this solemn duty it be deem proper that one who have so long till the office of deacon should depart with a proper attention to the usage of he meet some of the relative who have lately appear and who be not so conversant with the state of thing between the deacon and he divine complain among themselves that the latter make too many ill-timed allusion to the pecuniary want of the congregation and that he have in particular almost as much as ask the deacon to make a legacy that would enable those who be to stay behind to paint the meeting-house erect a new horse-shed purchase some improve stove and reseat the body of the building these modest request it be whisper -- for all pass in whisper then -- would consume not less than a thousand dollar of the deacon 's hard earnings and the thing be mention as a wrong do he who be about to descend into the grave where nought of earth could avail he in any way close be the siege that be lay to deacon pratt during the last week of he life many be the hint give of the necessity of he make a will though the brother and sister estimate they rights as the law establish they say but little on the subject and that little be rather against the propriety of annoy a man in they brother 's condition with business of so perplexing a nature the fact that these important personage set they face against the scheme have due weight and most of the relative begin to calculate the probable amount of they respective share under the law of distribution as it stand in that day this excellent and surpassingly wise community of new york have not then reach the pass of exceed liberality towards which it be now so rapidly tend in that day the debtor be not yet think of as the creditor 's next heir and that plausible and impracticable desire of a false philanthropy which be term the homestead exemption law -- impracticable as to anything like a just and equitable exemption of equal amount in all case of indebtedness -- be not yet dream of new york be then a sound and healthful community make its mistake doubtless as man ever will err but the control of thing have not yet pass into the hand of sheer political empiric whose ignorance and quackery be stimulate by the lowest passion for majority among other thing that be then respect be will but it be not know to a single individual among all those who throng the dwelling of deacon pratt that the die man have ever muster the self-command necessary to make such a instrument he be free to act but do not choose to avail himself of he freedom have he survive a few year he would have find himself in the enjoyment of a liberty so sublimate that he could not lease or rent a farm or collect a common debt without come under the harrow of the tiller of the political soil the season have advance to the early part of April and that be usually a soft and balmy month on the sea-shore though liable to considerable and sudden change of temperature on the day to which we now desire to transfer the scene the window of the deacon 's bed-room be open and the soft south wind fan he hollow and pallid cheek death be near though the principle of life struggle hard with the king of terror it be now that that bewildered and pharasaical faith which have so long hold this professor of religion in a bondage even more oppressive than open and announce sin most feel the insufficiency of the creed in which he have rather be speculate than trust all he life to render the pass hour compose and secure there have always be too much of self in deacon pratt 's moral temperament to render he belief as humble and devout as it should be it avail he not a hair now that he be a deacon or that he have make long prayer in the market-place where man could see he or that he have do so much as he be wont to proclaim for example 's sake all have not suffice to cleanse he heart of worldly-mindedness and he now grope about he in the darkness of a faith obscure for the true light that be to illumine he path to another world the doctor have order the room clear of all but two or three of the die man 's nearest relative among these last however be the gentle and tender-hearted mary who love to be near she uncle in this he greatest need she no longer think of he covetousness of he gripe usury of he live so much for self and so little for god while hover about the bed a message reach she that bait joe wish to see she in the passage that lead to the bed-room she go to this old fisherman and find he stand near a window that look towards the east and which consequently face the water of gardiner 's bay there she be miss mary say joe point out of the window he whole face in a glow between joy and whiskey it should be tell to the deacon at once that he last hour might be happier than some that he have pass lately that be she -- though at first i do not know she mary see a vessel standing in towards oyster pond and she familiarity with object of that nature be such as to tell she at once that it be a schooner but so completely have she give up the sea lion that it do not occur to she that this could be the long-missing craft at what be you point joe the wonder girl ask with perfect innocence at that craft -- at the sea lion of sterling which have be so long set down as miss but which have turn up just as she owner be about to cast off from this ` arth altogether joe might have talk for a hour : he do chatter away for two or three minute with he head and half he body out of the window uninterrupted by mary who sink into a chair to prevent fall on the floor at length the dear girl command herself and speak you can not possibly be certain joe she say that schooner do not look to I like the sea lion nor to I in some thing while in other some she do she upper work seem strangely out of shape and there be precious little on 'em but no other fore-taw-sail schooner ever come in this-a-way and i know of none likely to do it ay by jupiter there go the very blue peter i help to make with my own hand and it be agree to set it as the deacon 's signal there be no mistake now joe might have talk half a hour longer without any fear of interruption for mary have vanish to she own room leave he with he head and body still out of the window make he stricture and conjecture for some time longer while the person to whom he fancy he be speak be in truth on she knee render thanks to god a hour later all doubt be remove the schooner come in between oyster pond and shelter island and make the best of she way to the well-known wharf be not it wonderful mary exclaim the deacon in a hollow voice it be true but with a animation and force that do not appear to have any immediate connection with death -- be not it wonderful that gar ` ner should come back after all if he have only do he duty by I this will be the greatest ventur ' of my whole life it will make the evening of my day comfortable i hope i have always be grateful for blessing and i be sure i be grateful from the bottom of my heart for this give I prosperity and i be not apt to forget it they have be ask I to make a will but i tell 'em i be too poor to think of any such thing and now my schooner have get back i s ` pose i shall get more hint of the same sort should anything happen to I mary you can bring out the seal paper i give you to keep and that must satisfy 'em all you 'll remember it be address to gar ` ner there be not much in it and it will not be much thought of i fancy but such as it be ` tis the last instrument i sign unless i get better to think of gar ` ner 's come back after all it have put new life in I and i shall be about ag ` in in a week if he have only not forget the key and the hidden treasure mary pratt 's heart have not be so light for many a weary day but it grieve she to be a witness of this linger longing after the thing of the world she know that not only she uncle 's day but that he very hour be number and that notwithstanding this momentary flickering of the lamp in consequence of fresh oil be pour into it the wick be nearly consume and that it must shortly go out let roswell 's success be what it might the news of the sudden and unlooked-for return of a vessel so long believe to be lose spread like wildfire over the whole point and greatly do it increase the interest of the relative in the condition of the die man if he be a subject of great concern before doubly do he become so now a vessel freight with fur would have cause much excitement of itself but by some means or other the deacon 's great secret of the bury treasure have leak out most probably by means of some of he lamentation during he illness and though but imperfectly know it add largely to the expectation connect with the unlooked-for return of the schooner in short it would not have be easy to devise a circumstance that should serve to increase the liveliness of feeling that just then prevail on the subject of deacon pratt and he asset than the arrival of the sea lion at that precise moment and arrive she do that tempest-tossed cripple ice-bound and half-burned little craft after roam over a extent of ocean that would have make up half a dozen ordinary sea voyage it be in truth the schooner so well know to the reader that be now settle away she mainsail and jib as she keep off under she fore-topsail alone towards the wharf on which every human being who could with any show of propriety be there at such a moment be now collect in a curious and excited crowd altogether include boy and female there must have be not less than a hundred person on that wharf and among they be most of the anxious relative who be in attendance on the vessel 's owner in he last hour by a transition that be natural enough perhaps under the circumstance they have transfer they interest in the deacon to this schooner which they look upon as a inanimate portion of a investment that would soon have little that be animate about it bait joe be a sort of oracle in such circumstance he have pass he youth at sea have often double the horn and be know to possess a very respectable amount of knowledge on the subject of vessel of all sort and size rig and quality he be now consult by all who could get near he as a matter of course and he opinion be receive as _ re adjudicata _ as the lawyer have it that be the boat say joe affect to call the sea lion by a diminutive as a proof of regard yes that be the craft herself but she be wonderfully deep in the water i never seed a schooner of she tonnage come in from a v ` y' ge with she scupper so near awash do not you think jim there must be suthin ' heavier than skin in she hold to bring she down so low in the water jim be another loafer who live by take clam oyster fish and the other treasure of the surround bay he be by no means as bigh authority as baiting joe still he be always authority on a wharf i never seed the like o not answer jim that schooner must ha ' make most of she passage under water she be as deep as one of we coaster comin ' in with a load o ' brick she be deep but not as deep as a craft i once make a cruise in i be aboard of the first of uncle sam 's gun-boat that cross the pond to gibraltar when we get in it make the mediterranean stare i can tell you we have furrin officer aboard we the whull time lookin ' about and wonderin ' as they call it if we be not amphibby what be that demand jim rather hastily there be no sich rope in the ship i know that well enough but a amphibby as i understand it be a new sort of whale that come up to breathe like all of that family as old dr mitchell of cow neck call the crittur so the furrin officer think we must be of the amphibby family to live so much under water as it seem to they it be wet work i can tell you boy i do not think i get a good breath more than once a hour the whull of the first day we be out one of the furrin officer ask we captain how the gun-boat steer he be not a captain at all -- only a master you see and we all call he jumpin ' billy so jumpin ' billy say ` do not know sir ' ` what cross the atlantic in she and do not know how you craft steer ' say the furrin officer say he -- and well he might jim since nothin ' that ever live could go from norfolk to gibraltar without _ some _ attention to the helm -- but jumpin ' billy have another story to tell ` no sir do not know ' he answer ` you see sir a nor-wester take we right aft as we clear the cape and down she dive with she nose under and she starn out and she come across without have a chance to try the rudder ' this story which joe have tell at least a hundred time before and which by the way be say to be true produce the usual admiration especially among the crowd of lega-tees-expectant to most of whom it be quite new when the laugh go out which it soon do of itself joe pursue a subject that be of more interest to most of he auditor or rather to the principal personage among they skin never bring a craft so low that you may be sartain of he resume i have seed all sort of vessel stow but a hundred press-screw could not cram in fur enough to bring a craft so low to my eye jim there be suthin ' unnat ` ral about that schooner a ` ter all the study be scarce worthy of a diploma but we will take this occasion to say for the benefit of certain foreign writer principally of the female sex who fancy they represent americanism that the vulgar of the great republic and it be admit there be enough of the class never say summat or somethink which be low english but not low american dialect the in-and-in yankee say suth-in in a hundred other word have these ambitious lady do injustice to we vulgar who be not vulgar accord to the law of cockayne in the smallest degree _ the _ broadway for instance be no more use by a american than _ the _ congress or the united state of _ north _ america perhaps answer jim ` tis not the sea lion a ` ter all there be a family look about all the craft some man build and this may be a sort of relation of we missin ' schooner i 'll not answer for the craft though that be she blue peter and they be she mast-head and i turn in that taw-sail halyard-block with my own hand -- i 'll tell you what jim there be be a wrack or a nip up yonder among the ice and this schooner have be build anew out of that there schooner you see if it do not turn out as i tell you ay and there be captain gar ` ner himself alive and well just comin ' forrard a little girl start with this news and be soon pour ing it into the willing ear and open heart of the weep and grateful mary a hour later roswell hold the latter in he arm for at such a moment it be not possible for the most scrupulous of the sex to affect coldness and reserve where there be so much real tenderness and love while folding mary to he heart roswell whisper in she ear the bless word that announce he own humble submission to the faith which accept christ as the son of god too well do the gentle and ingenuous girl understand the sincerity and frankness of she lover nature to doubt what he say or in any manner to distrust the motive that moment be the happiest of she short and innocent life but the welcome tiding have reach the deacon and ere roswell have a opportunity of make any other explanation but those which assure mary that he have come back all that she wish he to be both of they be summon to the bed-side of the die man the effect of the excitement on the deacon be so very great as almost to persuade the expectant legatee that they visit be premature and that they might return home to renew it at some future day it be painful to find it we duty to draw sketch that shall contain such picture of human nature but with what justice could we represent the loathsome likeness of covetousness hover over a grave and omit the resemblance of those who surround it mary pratt alone of all that extensive family connection feel and think as christianity and womanly affection and reason dictate all the rest see nothing but the possessor of a considerable property who be about to depart for that unknown world into which nothing could be take from this but the divine and abused spirit which have be fashion in the likeness of god welcome gar ` ner -- welcome home ag ` in exclaim the deacon so heartily as quite to deceive the young man as to the real condition of he owner a mistake that be perhaps a little unfortunate as it induce he to be more frank than might otherwise have be the case i could not find it in my heart to give you up and have all along believe that we should yet have good news from you the gar ` ner be a reliable family and that be one reason why i choose you to command my schooner they daggett be a torment but we never should have know anything about the island or the key have not it be for one on 'em as the deacon stop to breathe mary turn away from the bed grieve at heart to see the longing of the world thus cling to the spirit of one who probably have not another hour to live the glaze but animated eye a cheek which resemble a fade leaf of the maple lay on a cold and whitish stone and lip that have already begin to recede from the tooth make a sad sad picture truly to look upon at such a moment yet of all present mary pratt alone feel the fullness of the incongruity and alone bethought she of the unreasonableness of encouraging feeling like those which be now uppermost in the deacon 's breast even minister whittle have a curiosity to know how much be add to the sum-total of deacon pratt 's asset by the return of a craft that have so long be set down among the miss when all eye therefore be turn in curiosity on the handsome face of the fine manly youth who now stand at the bed-side of the deacon include those of brother and sister of nephew and niece of cousin and friend those of this servant of the most high god be of the number and not the least expressive of solicitude and expectation as soon as the deacon have catch a little breath and have swallow a restorative that the hire nurse have hand to he he eager thought revert to the one engrossing theme of he whole life these be all friend gar ` ner he say come to visit I in a little sickness that i have be somewhat subject to of late and who will all be glad to hear of we good fortune so you have bring the schooner back a ` ter all gar ` ner and will disapp ` int the sag harbor ship-owner who have be all along foretell that we should never see she ag ` in : -- bring she back -- ha gar ` ner only in part deacon pratt we have have good luck and bad luck since we leave you and have only bring home the best part of the craft the best part -- say the deacon gulp he word in a way that compel he to pause the best part what in the name of property have become of the rest the rest be burn sir to keep we from freezing to death roswell then give a brief but very clear and intelligible account of what have happen and of the manner in which he have cause the hulk of the deacon 's sea lion to be raise upon by the material furnish by the sea lion of the vineyard the narrative bring mary pratt back to the side of the bed and cause she calm eye to become rivet intently on the speaker 's face as for the deacon he might have say with shakspeare 's wolsey have i but serve my god with half the zeal i serve my king he would not in mine age have leave I naked to mine enemy he fall be not that of a loss of power it be true but it be that of a still more ignoble passion covetousness as roswell proceed he mind represent one source of wealth after another release from he clutch until it be with a tremulous voice and a countenance from which all trace of animation have flee that he venture again to speak then i may look upon my ventur ' as worse than nothing he say the insurer will raise a question about pay for a craft that have be rebuild in this way and the vineyard folk will be sartain to put in a claim of salvage both on account of two of they hand help you with the work and on account of the material -- and we with no cargo as a offset to it all no deacon it be not quite as bad as that resume roswell we have bring home a good lot of skin enough to pay the people full wages and to return you every cent of outfit with a handsome advance on the venture a sealer usually make a good business of it if she fall in with seal we cargo in skin can not be worth less than $ 20000 besides half a freight leave on the island for which another craft may be send that be suthin ' the lord be praise ejaculate the deacon though the schooner be as bad as go and the outlay have be awfully heavy i be almost afraid to go any further gardner -- do you -- i grow weak very fast -- do you stop -- mary i wish _ you _ would put the question i be afraid that my uncle mean to ask if you stop at the key in the west indy accord to you instruction roswell the niece say and most reluctantly for she plainly see it be fully time she uncle cease to think of the thing of this life and to begin to turn all he thought on the bless mediation and another state of be i forget no part of you order sir rejoin roswell it be my duty to obey they and i believe i have do so to the letter -- stop gar ` ner interrupt the die man -- one question while i think of it will the vineyard man have any claim of salvage on account of they skin certainly not sir these skin be all we own -- be take cure stow and bring home altogether by ourselves there be a lot of skin belong to the vineyarder stow away in the house which be yours deacon and which it would well pay any small craft to go and bring away if anybody be to claim salvage it will be ourselves no salvage be demand for the loss off cape henlopen i trust no none -- daggett behave what i call _ liberal _ in that affair -- half the critic of the day would use the adjective instead of the adverb here and why should deacon prate english be any better than he neighbor -- and so i have admit to he friend over on the vineyard but gar ` ner we great affair still remain to be account for do you wish to have the room clear before you speak of that -- shall we turn the _ key _ on all these folk and then settle account -- he he he the deacon 's facetiousness sound strangely out of place to roswell still he do not exactly know how to gainsay he wish there might be a indiscretion in pursue he narrative before so many witness and the young man pause until the room be clear leave no one in it but the sick man mary himself and the nurse the last could not well be get rid of on oyster pond where she office give she a assume right to know all family secret or what be the same thing to she to _ fancy _ that she know they among all the saying which the experience of mankind have reduce to axiom there be not one more just than that which say there be secret in all family these secret the world commonly affect to know all about but we think few will have reach the age of threescore without become convinced of how much pretending ignorance there be in this assumption of the world _ tot ou tard tout se scait _ be a significant saying of we old friend the french who know as much of thing in practice as any other people on the face of the earth but _ tot ou tard tout ne se scait pas _ be the door shut ask the deacon tremulously for eagerness unite to debility be sadly shake he whole frame see that the door be shut tight mary this be we own secret and nurse must remember that mary assure he that they be alone and turn away in sorrow from the bed now gar ` ner resume the deacon open you whole heart and let we know all about it roswell hesitate to reply for he too be shock at witness this instance of a soul 's cling to mammon when on the very eve of depart for the unknown world there be a look in the glaze and sunken eye of the old man that remind he unpleasantly of that snap of the eye which he have so often see in daggett you do not forget the key surely gar ` ner ask the deacon anxiously no sir we do we whole duty by that part of the voyage do you find it -- be the place accurately describe no chart could have make it better we lose a month in look for the principal land-mark which have be alter by the weather but that once find the rest be easy the difficulty we meet with in start have bring we home so late in the spring never mind the spring gar ` ner the part that be past be sartain to come round ag ` in in due time and so you find the very key that be describe by daggett we do sir and just where he describe it to be and how about the tree and the little hillock of sand at its foot both be there deacon the hillock must have grow a good deal by reason of the shift sand but all thing consider the place be well enough describe well -- well -- well -- you open the hillock of course we do sir and find the box mention by the pirate a good large box i 'll warrant ye they pirate seldom do thing by half -- he he he i can not say much for the size of the box deacon -- it look to I as if it have once hold window-glass and that of rather small dimension but the contents -- you do not mention the contents they be here sir take a small bag from he pocket and lay it on the bed by the deacon 's side the piece be all of gold and there be just one hundred and forty-three of they -- heavy doubloon it be true and i dare say well worth they 16 dollar each the deacon give a gulp as if gasp for breath at the same time that he clutch the bag the next instant he be dead and there be much reason to believe that the demon who have watch he and encourage he in he beset sin laugh at this consummation of they malignant art if angel in heaven do not mourn at this characteristic departure of a frail spirit from its earthly tenement one who have many of they quality do heavy have be the load on mary pratt 's heart at the previous display of she uncle 's weakness and profound be now she grief at he have make such a end chapter xxx 4 _ cit _ we 'll hear the will : read it mark antony _ cit _ the will the will we will hear caesar 's will _ ant _ have patience gentle friend i must not read it it be not meet you know how caesar loved you _ julius caesar _ there be usually great haste in this country in get rid of the dead in no other part of the world with which we be acquaint be funeral so simple or so touching place the judgment and sin which lead to it in a far more conspicuous light than rank or riches or personal merit scarf and glove be give in town and glove in the country though scarf be rare but beyond these and the pall and the hearse and the weep friend a american funeral be a very unpretending procession of person in they best attire on foot when the distance be short in carriage in wagon and on horseback when the grave be far from the dwelling there be however one feature connect with a death in this country that we could gladly see altered it be the almost indecent haste which so generally prevail to get rid of the dead doubtless the climate have have a effect in establish this custom but the climate by no means exact the precipitancy that be usually practice as there be so many friend from a distance present some of whom take the control of affair mary shrink back into herself with a timidity natural to she sex and year the moment she care could no longer serve she uncle the funeral of the deacon take place the day after that of he death it be the solemn and simple ceremony of the country the rev mr whittle conceive that he ought to preach a sermon on the occasion of the extinguishment of this bright and shine light and the body be carry to the meeting-house where the whole congregation assemble it be the sabbath we can not say much for the discourse which have already serve as eulogium on two or three other deacon with a simple subsittution of name in few thing be the credulous more impose on than in this article of sermon a clergyman shall preach the workings of other man 's brain for year and not one of he hearer detect the imposition purely on account of the confide credit it be customary to yield to the pulpit in this respect preaching be very much like review -- the listener or the reader be too complaisant to see through the great standing mystification of either yet preach be a work of high importance to man and one that doubtless accomplish great good more especially when the life of the preacher correspond with he doctrine and even review though infinitely of less moment might be make a very useful art in the hand of upright independent intelligent and learn man but nothing in this world be as it should be and century will probably roll over it ere the good time shall really come the day of the funeral be the sabbath nothing that touch on business be refer to on the follow morning however the friend assemble early in the parlor and a excuse for be a little press be make on the ground that so many present have so far to go the deacon have probably make a remove much more distant than any that await he relative it be right to look a little into the deacon 's matter before we separate say mr job pratt who if he have the name have not the patience of he of old in order to save trouble and hard feeling among relative and friend there should be nothing but confidence and affection and i be sure i have no other sentiment toward any here i suppose -- all mr job pratt know be ever on a supposition -- i suppose i be the proper person to administer to the deacon 's property though i do not wish to do it if there be the least objection every one assent that he be the most proper person for all know he be the individual the surrogate would be the most likely to appoint i have never set down the deacon 's property as anything like what common report make it resume mr job pratt though i do suppose it will fully reach ten thousand dollar la exclaim a female cousin and a widow who have expectation of she own i would always think deacon pratt worth forty or fifty thousand dollar ten thousand dollar will not make much for each of we divide up among so many folk the division will not be so very great mr martin return mr job as it will be confine to the next of kin and they representative unless a will should be find -- and by all i can learn there be _ none _ -- emphasize the last word with point -- unless a will be find the whole estate real and personal must be divide into just five share which accordin ' to my calculation would make about two thousand dollar a share no great fortin to be sure though a comfortable addition to small mean the deacon be cluss -lrb- anglice close -rrb- yes he be cluss -- all the pratt be a little give to be cluss but i do not know that they be any the worse for it it be well to be curful -lrb- careful -rrb- of one 's means which be a trust give to we by divine providence in this manner do mr job pratt often quiet he conscience for be as curful of he own as of other person 's asset divine providence accord to he morality make it as much a duty to transfer the dollar that be in he neighbor 's pocket to he own as to watch it vigilantly after the transposition have be effect a body should be curful as you say sir return the widow martin and for that reason i should like to know if there be not a will i _ know _ the deacon set store by I and i can hardly think he have depart for another world without bethink he of he cousin jenny and of she widowhood i be afraid he have mr martin -- really afraid he have i can hear of no will the doctor say he doubt if the deacon could ever muster courage to write anything about he own death and that he have never hear of any will i understand mary that she have no knowledge of any will and i do not know where else to turn in order to inquire rev mr whittle think there be a will i ought to say there _ must be _ a will return the parson who be on the ground again early and on this very errand i feel certain of that from the many conversation i have hold with the decease it be not a month since i speak to he of diver repair that be necessary to each and all of the parish building include the parsonage he agree to every word i say -- admit that we could not get on another winter without a new horse-shed and that the east end of the parsonage ought to be shingled this come summer all of which may be very true parson without the deacon 's make a will quietly and we may now add _ patiently _ observe mr job i do not think so return the minister with a warmth that might have be deem indiscreet do it not relate to the horse-shed the parsonage and the meeting-house all of which be public property rather than to anything in which he have a more direct legal interest a pious member of the church would hardly hold out the hope that deacon pratt have hold out to I for more than two year without mean to make he word good in the end i think all will agree with I in that opinion do the deacon then go so far as to promise to do any thing ask mr job a little timidly for he be by no means sure the answer might not be in the affirmative in which case he anticipate the worst perhaps not answer minister whittle too conscientious to tell a downright lie though sorely tempt so to do but a man may promise indirectly as well as directly when i have a thing much at heart and converse often about it with a person who can grant all i wish and that person listen as attentively as i could wish he to do i regard that as a promise and in church matter one of a very solemn nature all the jesuit in the world do not get they education at rome or acknowledge ignatius loyolum as the great founder of they order some be to be find who have never make a public profession of they faith and zeal have naver assume the tonsure or take the vow that be as folk think quietly return mr job pratt though he smile in a manner so significant as to cause mr martin a new qualm as she grow more and more apprehensive that the property be after all to go by the distribution law some folk think a promise ought to be express while other think it may be understand the law i believe commonly look for the direct expression of any binding promise and in matter of this sort one make in write too and that under a seal and before three responsible witness i wish a full inquiry might be make to ascertain if there be no will put in the minister anxiously i be quite willing so to do return mr job whose confidence and moral courage increase each instant quite willing and be rather anxious for it if i could only see where to go to inquire do no one present know of any will make by the deceased demand minister whittle authoritatively a dead silence succeed to the question eye meet eye and there be great disappointment among the numerous collateral present include all those who do not come in as next of kin or as they direct representative but the rev mr whittle have be too long and too keenly on the scent of a legacy to be throw out of the hunt just as he believe the game be come in sight it might be well to question each near relative directly he add mr job pratt do _ you _ know nothing of any will nothing whatever at one time i do think the deacon mean to make he testament but i conclude that he must have change he mind and you mr thoma turn to the sister -- as next of kin i make the same inquiry of you i once talk with brother about it answer this relative who be work away in a rocking-chair as if she think the earth might stop in its orbit if she herself cease to keep in motion but he give I no satisfactory answer -- that be nothin ' that i call satisfactory have he tell I he _ have _ make a will and give I a full shear -lrb- share -rrb- i should have be content or have he tell I that he have _ not _ make a will and that the law would give I a full shear i should have be content i look upon myself as a person easily satisfied this be be explicit and leave little more to be obtain from the deacon 's beloved and only survive sister and you mary do you know anything of a will make by you uncle mary shake she head but there be no smile on she feature for the scene be unpleasant to she then no one present know of any paper that the deacon leave specially to be open after he death demand rev mr whittle put the general question pretty much at random a paper cry mary hastily yes i know something of a _ paper _ -- i think you speak of a will a will be commonly write on paper now-a-day miss mary -- but you have a _ paper _ uncle give I a _ paper _ and tell I to keep till roswell gardiner come back and if he himself should not then be live to give it to he -- the color now mount to the very temple of the pretty girl and she seem to speak with greater deliberation and care as i be to give the paper to roswell i have always think it related to he my uncle speak of it to I as lately as the day of he death that be the will beyond a doubt cry rev mr whittle with more exultation than become he profession and profession -- do you not think this may be deacon pratt 's will miss mary now mary have never think any such thing she know that she uncle much wish she to marry roswell and have all along fancy that the paper she hold which indeed be contain in a envelop address to she lover contain some expression of he wish on this to she the most interesting of all subject and nothing else mary pratt think very little of she uncle 's property and still less of its future disposition while she think a great deal of roswell gardiner and of he suit it be consequently the most natural thing in the world that she should have fall into some such error as this but now that the subject be bring to she mind in this new light she arise go to she own room and soon re-appear with the paper in she hand both mr job pratt and rev mr whittle offer to relieve she of the burthen and the former by a pretty decide movement do actually succeed in get possession of the document the papers be do up in the form of a large business letter be duly seal with wax and be address to mr roswell gardiner master of the schooner sea lion now absent on a voyage the superscription be read aloud a little under the influence of surprise notwithstanding which mr job pratt be very coolly proceed to open the packet precisely as if it have be address to himself in this decide step mr martin and mr thoma and rev mr whittle might be set down as accessory before the act for each approach and so eager be the two woman that they actually assist in break the seal if that letter be address to I say roswell gardiner with firmness and authority i claim the right to open it myself it be unusual for those to whom a letter be _ not _ address to assume this office but it come _ from _ deacon pratt cry the widow martin and may contain he will in which case a body would think i have some rights concern say mr job pratt a little more coolly but with manifest doubt sartain put in mr thoma brother and sister and even cousin come before stranger any day here we be a brother and sister of the deacon and we ought to have a right to read he letter all this time roswell have stand with a extended arm and a eye that cause mr job pratt to control he impatience mary advance close to he side as if to sustain he but she say nothing there be a law with severe penalty against knowingly open a letter address to another resume roswell steadily and it shall be enforce against any one who shall presume to open one of mine if that letter have my address sir i demand it and i will have it at every hazard roswell advance a step nearer mr job pratt and the letter be reluctantly yield though not until the widow martin have make a nervous but abortive snatch at it at any rate it ought to be open in we presence put in this woman that we may see what be in it and by what right ma'am have i not the privilege of other to read my own letter when and where i please if the contents of this however do really relate to the late deacon pratt 's property i be quite willing they should be make know there be nothing on this superscription to tell I to open the packet in the presence of witness but under all the circumstance i prefer it should be do hereupon roswell proceed deliberately to look into the package the seal be already break and he exhibit it in that state to all in the room with a meaning smile after which he bring to light and open some write instrument that be engross on a single sheet of foolscap and have the name of several witness at its bottom ay ay that be it say baiting joe for the room be crowd with all sort of people that be the dockerment i know would it as soon as i lay eye on it and what do _ you _ know about it josy demand the widow eagerly cousin job this man may turn out a most important and considerable witness what do i know mr martin why i seed the deacon sign for the seal and exercute as soon as i hear squire craft who be down here from riverhead on that ` ere very business talk so much about seal i know would captain gar ` ner must have suthin ' to do with the matter the deacon 's very heart be in the schooner and she v ` y' ge and i think it be the craft that finish he in the end will not that set aside a codicil cousin job if so be the deacon have r ` ally codicill off captain gar ` ner and mary we shall see we shall see so you be present josy at the making of a will sartain -- and be a witness to the insterment as the squire call it i s ` pose he send for I to be a witness as i be some acquaint with the sealin ' business have make two v ` y' ge out of stunni n'tun many year since ay ay that be the insterment and pretty well frightened be the deacon when he put he name to it i can tell you frightened echo the brother -- that be ag ` in law at any rate the instrument that a man sign because he be frightened be no instrument at all in law as respects a will it be what we justice of the peace call ` die non ' or do not die that be in law can that be so squire job ask the sister who have say but little hitherto but have think all the more yes that be latin i s ` pose and good latin too they tell I a man may be dead in the flesh but live in law la how cur ` ous law be a wonderful thing to they that understand it the worthy mr thomas express a much more profound sentiment than that of which she be probably aware herself law _ be _ a wonderful thing and most wonderful be he who can tell what it be to-day or be likely to be to-morrow the law of testamentary devise in particular have more than the usual uncertainty the great interest that be take by the community in the large estate of certain individual who be place without the ordinary social category by the magnitude of they fortune prevent anything from become absolutely settle as respects _ they _ in turkey and in america the possession of great wealth be very apt to ruin they possessor proscription in some form or other be pretty certain to be the consequence in turkey such have long and openly be the fact the bow-string usually lie at the side of the strong box but in this country the system be in its infancy though advance towards maturity with giant stride twenty year more resemble the twenty that be just past in which the seed recently sow broadcast shall have time to reach maturity and in we poor opinion the great work of demoralization in this important particular will be achieve we be much afraid that the boast progress of which we hear so much will resemble the act of the man who fancy he could teach he horse to live without food -- just as he believe the poor beast be perfect it die of inanition roswell read bait joe 's ` insterment ' twice and then he place it with manly tenderness in the hand of mary the girl read the document too tear start to she eye but a bright blush suffused she face as she return the will to she lover ah do not read it now roswell she say in a under tone but the stillness and expectation be so profound that every syllable she utter be hear by all in the room and why not read it now miss mary cry the widow martin methink _ now _ be the proper time to read it if i be to be codicill out of that will i want to know it it be better in every respect that the company present should know all that be to be know at once observe mr job pratt before the will be read if that be the will captain gar ` ner -- it be the will of the late deacon pratt duly sign seal and witness i believe sir one word more then before it be read i think you say josy that the decease be _ frightened _ when he sign that will i do not express any opinion until i hear the will perhaps a ` ter it be read i shall think or say nothin ' about this fright though the instrument that a man sign because he be frighten if the fright be what i call a legal fright be no instrument at all but such be not the deacon 's case squire job put in bait joe at once he do not sign the insterment because he be frightened but be frightened because he sign the insterment let the boat go right eend foremost squire read the will captain gar ` ner if you have it say mr job pratt with decision it be proper that we should know who be executor friend will you be silent for a moment amid a death-like stillness roswell gardiner now read as follow : -- in the name of god aman i ichabod pratt of the town of southold and county of suffolk and state of new york being of fail bodily health but of sound mind do make and declare this to be my last will and testament i bequeath to

looking-glass that be hang up in the east bed-room of my house and which be once the property of we beloved mother i bequeath to the widow catherine martin my cousin the big pin-cushion in the say east chamber which she use so much to praise and admire i bequeath to my say niece mary pratt the only child of my late brother israel pratt aforesaid all of my personal estate whether in possession or exist in equity include money at use vessel stock on farm all other sort of stock furniture wear apparel book-debt money in hand and all sort of personal property whatever i nominate and appoint roswell gardiner now absent on a seal voyage in my employment as the sole executor of this my last will provide he return home within six month of my decease and should he not return home within the say six month then i appoint my above-mentioned niece and heiress mary pratt the sole executrix of this my will i earnestly advise my say niece mary pratt to marry the say roswell gardiner but i annex no condition whatever to this advice wish to leave my adopt daughter free to do as she may think best the instrument be in all respects duly execute and there could not be a doubt of its entire validity mary feel a little bewildered as well as greatly embarrass so perfectly disinterested have be all she care of she uncle and so humble she wish that she do not for some time regard herself as the owner of a property that she have all she life be accustom to consider as a part of she late uncle the heir expectant a ` ter read the insterment as baiting joe tell he crony when he relate the circumstance over a mug of cider that evening fore and aft and overhaul it from truck to keelson give the matter up as a bad job they could not make nawthin ' out of oppersition continue joe and so they tuck the horse and the looking-glass and the pin-cushion and clear out with they cargo you could not get one of that breed to leave as much as a pin behind to which he think the law would give he a right squire job go off very unwillingly for so strong be he belief in he claim that he have make up he mind as he tell I himself to break up the north meadow and put it in corn this come season they say that minister whittle take it very hard that nawthin ' be say about he or about meetin ' in the deacon 's will observe jake davi one of bait joe 's crony that he do and he tuck it so hard that everybody allow the two sermon he preach the next sabba ' day to be the very two worst he ever _ do _ preach they must have be pretty bad then quaintly observe davi : i have long set down minister whittle 's discourse as be a _ leetle _ the worst go when you give he a chance it be unnecessary to relate any more of this dialogue nor should we have give the little we have do it not virtually explain what actually occur on the publication of the contents of the will roswell meet with no opposition in prove the instrument and the day after he be admit to act as executor he be marry to mary pratt and become tenant by the courtesy to all she real estate such be the law _ then _ though it be so no longer _ now _ a man and he wife may have a very pretty family quarrel about the ownership of a dozen tea-spoon and the last so far as we can see may order the first out of one of she rock chair if she see fit surely domestic peace be not so trifling a matter that the law should seek to add new subject of strife to the many that seem to be nearly inseparable from the married state let this be as it may no such law exist when roswell gardiner and mary pratt become man and wife one of the first act of the happy young couple after they be unite be to make a suitable disposition of the money find bury at the foot of the tree on the so-much-talked of key its amount be a little more than 2000 dollar the pirate who make the revelation to daggett have in all probability be ignorant himself of the real sum that have be thus secrete by a specific bargain with the crew all this money belong to the deacon and consequently it have descend to he niece and through she be now legally the property of roswell the young man be not altogether free from scruple about use money that have be originally take as booty by pirate and he conscientious wife have still greater objection after confer together on the subject however and see the impossibility of restore the gold to those from whom it have be force in the first place the doubloon be distribute among the family of those who have lose they life at sealer 's land the share do not amount to much it be true but they do good and cheer the heart of two or three widow and dependent sister nor do roswell gardiner 's care for they welfare stop here he have the sea lion put in good order remove she deck raise upon she and put she in she original condition and send she to sealer 's land again under the order of hazard who be instruct to take in all the oil and skin that have be leave behind and to fill up if he could without risk too much by delay all this be successfully do the schooner come back after a very short voyage and quite full the money make by this highly successful adventure have the effect to console several of those who have great cause to regret they previous loss as to roswell and mary they have much reason to be content with they lot the deacon 's means be find to be much more considerable than have be suppose when all be bring into a snug state roswell find that he wife be worth more than thirty thousand dollar a sum which constitute wealth on oyster pond in that day we have however already hint that the simplicity and we fear with it the happiness of the place have depart a railroad terminate within a short distance of the deacon 's old residence bring with it the clatter ambition and rivalry of such a mode of travel what be even worse the venerable and expressive name of oyster pond one that convey in its very sound the idea of savoury dish and a abundance of a certain and a very agreeable sort have be change to orient heaven save the mark long island have hitherto be famous in the history of new york for the homely piquancy of its name which usually convey a graphic idea of the place indicate it be true jerusalem can not boast of its solomon 's temple nor babylon of its hang garden but by common consent it be understand that these two name and some half-a-dozen more of the same quality be to be take by they opposite roswell gardiner do not let stimson pass out of he sight as be customary with seaman when they quit a vessel he make he master of a sloop that ply between new york and southold in which employment the good old man fulfil he time leave to a widow sister who dwell with he the means of a comfortable livelihood for life the only bit of management of which mary could be accuse be practice by she shortly after stimson 's death and some six or eight year after she own marriage one of she school friend and a relative have marry a person who dwell ` west of the bridge ' as it be the custom to say of all the county that lie west of cayuga lake this person whose name be hight have mill and make large quantity of that excellent flour that be get to enjoy its merited reputation even in the old world he be dispose to form a partnership with roswell who sell he property and migrate to the great west as the country ` west of the bridge ' be then term though it be now necessary to go a thousand mile farther in order to reach what be term the western country mary have a important agency in bring about this migration she have see certain longing after the ocean and seal and whale in she husband and do not consider he safe as long as he could scent the odour of a salt marsh there be a delight in this fragrance that none can appreciate as thoroughly as those who have enjoy it in youth it remain as long as human sens retain they faculty a increase family however and el dorado of the west which in that day produce wheat be inducement for a removal there and aid by mary 's gentle management produce the desire effect and for more than twenty year roswell gardiner have be a very successful miller on a large scale in one of the western county of what be call the empire state we do not think the _ sobriquet _ of this country very happy in general but shall quarrel less with this than with the phrase of commercial emporium which be much as if one should say a townish town roswell gardiner have never waver in he faith from the time when he feeling be awaken by the just view of he own insignificance as compare to the power of god he then learn the first great lesson in religious belief that of humility without which no man can be truly penitent or truly a christian he no longer think of measure the deity with he narrow faculty or of set up he blind conclusion in the face of positive revelation he see that all must be accept or none and there be too much evidence too much inherent truth a morality too divine to allow a mind like he to reject the gospel altogether with mary at he side he have continue to worship the trinity accept its mystery in a humble reliance on the word of inspired man the end end of
