at the roach house -- a hotel keep on the entomological plan in bumsteadville -- be a gentleman of such lurid aspect as make every beholder burn to know whom he could possibly be he enormous head of curl red hair not only present a central parting on top and a very much one-sided parting and puffing-out behind but actually cover both he ear while he ruddy semi-circle of beard curl inward instead of out and greatly surprised if it do not positively alarm the looker-on by appear to remain perfectly motionless no matter how actively the stranger move he jaw this ball of improbable inflammatory hair and totally independent face rest in a basin of shirt collar which in its turn be support by a rusty black necktie and a very loose suit of gritty alpaca so that take the gentleman for all in all such a incredible human being have rarely be see outside of literary circle landlord say the stranger to the brown linen host of the roach house who be intently gaze at he with the appreciative expression of one who behold a comic ghost -- landlord after you have finish look at my head and involuntarily open you mouth at some occasional peculiarity of my whisker i should like to have something to eat as you tell I that woodcock be not fit to eat this year and that broil chicken be positively prohibit by the board of health in consequence of the sickly season you may bring I some pork and bean and some cracker bring plenty of cracker landlord for i be uncommon fond of cracker by absorb the superfluous moisture in the head they clear the brain and make it more subtle have be serve with the wholesome country fare he have order together with a glass of the heady native wine call applejack the gentleman have but just move a slice of pork from its bed in the bean when with much interest he closely inspect the spot of vegetable he have uncover and express the belief that there be something alive in it landlord say he musingly there be something amongst these bean that i should take for a raisin if it do not move place upon he nose a pair of vast silver spectacles which give he a aspect of have two attic window in he countenance the landlord bow he head over the plate until he nose touch the bean and thoughtfully scrutinize the living raisin as i think sir it be only a water-bug he observe rescue the insect upon he thumb-nail you need not have be frightened however for they never bite somewhat reassure the stranger go on eat until he knife encounter resistance in the secondary layer of bean when he once more inspect the dish with marked agitation can this be a skewer down here inquire he prod at some hard springy object with he fork the host of the roach house bear both fork and object to a window where the light be less deceptive and be presently able to announce confidently that the object be only a hair-pin then observe that he guest look curiously at a cracker which from the gravelly mark on one side seem to have be dig out of the earth like a potato he hasten to obviate all complaint in that line by carefully wipe every individual cracker with he pocket handkerchief and now landlord say the stranger at last pull a couple of long unidentified hair from he mouth as he hurriedly retire from the meal i suppose you be wonder who i be well sir be the frank answer i can not deny that there be point about you to make a plain man like myself thoughtful there be that about you hair sir with the middle-parting on top and the side-parting behind to give a plain person the impression that you brain must be slightly turn and that by rights you face ought to be where you neck be neither can i deny sir that the curling of you whisker the wrong way and they peculiarity in remain entirely still while you mouth be go be circumstance calculate to excite the liveliest apprehension of those who wish you well the peculiarity you notice return the gentleman may either exist solely in you own imagination or they may be the result of my own ill-health my name be tracey clew and i desire to spend a few week in the country for physical recuperation have you any idea where a dead-beat -lrb- 1 -rrb- like myself could find inexpensive lodgings in bumsteadville the host hastily remark that he own bill for those pork and bean be fifty cent and upon be pay coldly add that a mr smythe wife of the sexton of saint cow 's ritualistic church take hash-eater for the summer as the gentleman prefer a high-church private boarding-house to a unsectarian first class hotel all he have to do be to go out on the road again and keep inquire until he find the place don he panama hat and carry a stout cane mr clew be quickly upon the turnpike and he course take he near the pauper burial-ground he presently perceive a extremely disagreeable child throw stone at pigeon in a field and generally hit the beholder you young alderman what do you mean he exclaim with marked feeling rub the place on he knee which have just be strike then just give I a five-cent stamp to aim at yer and yer will not ketch it onc ' t reply the boyish trifler i could not hit what i be to fire at if it be my own daddy here be ten cent then say the gentleman wildly dodge the last shot at a distant pigeon and now show I where mr smythe live all right old brick-top assent the merry sprite with a vivacious dash of personality d'yer see that house as yer skoot past the church and round the corner yes well that be smythe 's and bumstead life there too -- he as be always tryin ' to put a head on I i 'll play my point on he yet though _ i 'll _ play my point and the rather vulgar young chronic absentee from sunday-school retire to a proper distance and from thence begin stone he benefactor to the latter 's perfect safety reach the boarding-house of mr smythe as direct mr tracey clew soon learn from the lady that he could have a room next to the apartment of mr bumstead to whom he be refer for further recommendation of the establishment though that broken-hearted gentleman be mourn the loss of a beloved umbrella accompany by a nephew and have a bone handle mr smythe be sure he would speak a good word for she house perhaps mr clew have hear of he loss mr clew could not exactly recall that particular case but have a confused recollection of have lose several umbrella himself at various time and have no doubt that the addition of a nephew must make such a loss still heavier mr bumstead be in he room when the introduction take place and have judge sweeney for company over a bowl of lemon tea the new boarder lift he hat politely to both dignitary and involuntarily smack he lip at the mixture they be take for they cough excuse I gentleman say mr tracey clew in a manner almost stealthy but as i be about to take summer board with the lady of this house i beg leave to inquire if she and the man she marry be strictly moral except in have cold dinner on Sunday mr bumstead who sit very limply in he chair say that she be a very good woman a very good woman and would spare no pain to secure the comfort of such a head of hair as he then see before he this be my dear friend judge sweeney continue the ritualistic organist languidly wave a spoon towards that gentleman who have a very good wife in the grave and know much more about woman and gravy than i as for I exclaim mr bumstead suddenly climb upon the arm of he chair and stare at mr clew 's head rather wildly my only bride be of black alpaca with a brass ferrule and i can never care for the sex again here mr bumstead whose eye have be roll in a extraordinary manner tumble into he chair again and then frown intensely help himself to lemon tea i be refer to you honor for further particulars observe mr tracey clew bow again to judge sweeney not to wind we friend further by discussion of the fair sex may i ask if bumsteadville contain many object of interest for a stranger like myself one at least sir answer the judge i think i could show you a tombstone which you would find very good read a epitaph upon my late better-half if you be a married man you can not help enjoy it mr clew regret to inform he honor that he have never be a married man and therefore could not presume to fancy what the literary enjoyment of a widower must be at such a treat a journalist i presume insinuate judge sweeney more and more strike by the other 's perfect pageant of incomprehensible hair and beard he honor flatter I too much something in the lunatic line then perhaps i have tell you honor that i never be marry since last speaking mr bumstead have be stare at the new boarder 's head and face with a countenance expressive of mingled consternation and wrath and now make a startling rush at he from he chair and fairly forced half a glass of lemon tea down he throat there sir say the mourning organist pant with suppress excitement that will keep you from take cold until you can be walk up and down in the open air long enough to get you hair and beard sober they have be indulge sir until the top of you head have fall over backwards and you whisker act as though they belong to somebody else the sight confuse I sir and in my present state of mind i can not bear it cough from the lemon tea and greatly amaze by he hasty dismissal mr clew follow judge sweeney from the room and house in precipitate haste and when they be fairly out of door remark that the gentleman they have just leave have surprise he unprecedentedly and that he be very much put out by it mr john bumstead sir explain the judge be almost beside himself at the double loss he have sustain and i think that the sight of you cane there madden he with the memory it revive why exclaim the gentleman of the hair stare in wonder you do not mean to tell I that my cane look at all like he nephew it look a little like the stick of he umbrella which he lose at the same time be the grave answer after walk on in thoughtful silence for a while as though deeply ponder the striking character of a man whose great nature could thus at once unite the bereaved uncle with the sincere mourner for the dumb friend of he rainier day mr tracey clew ask whether suspicion yet point to any one yes he be tell suspicion do point very decidedly at a certain person but as no specific reward have yet be offer in sufficient amount to justify the exertion of police official have family to support and as no lifeless body have yet be find and as it be not exactly certain that the abstraction of a umbrella by unknown party would justify the criminal prosecution of a person for have in he possession a indian club : -- in view of all these complicated circumstance the law do not feel itself authorize to execute any assassin at present and here we be sir at last near we ritualistic church continue judge sweeney where we stand up for the rite so much that stranger sometimes complain of it as fatiguing upon that monument yonder in the graveyard you may find the epitaph i have mention what be more here come a rather interesting local character of ours who cut the inscription and put up the monument mr mclaughlin come shuffling up the road as he speak follow in the distance by the inevitable smalley and a shower of promiscuous stone here you boy roar judge sweeney beckon the amiable child to he with a bit of small money aim at _ all _ of we -- do you hear -- and see that you do not hit any window and now mclaughlin how do you do here be a gentleman spend the summer with we who would like to know you old mortarity stare at the hair and beard thus introduce to he with undisguised amazement and grimly remark that if the gentleman would come to see he any evening and bring a social bottle with he he would not allow the gentleman 's head to stand in the way of a further acquaintance i shall certainly call upon you assent mr clew if we young friend the stone-thrower will accept a trifle to show I the way before retire to he bed that night the same mr tracey clew take off he hair and beard examine they closely and then break into a strange smile no wonder they all look at I so he soliloquize for i do have my lock on the topside backmost and my whisker turn the wrong way however for a dead-beat with all he imperfection on he head i have form a pretty large acquaintance for one day -lrb- 2 -rrb- -lrb- _ to be continue _ -rrb- -lrb- footnote 1 :

punchinello 's vacation vain head this paper be not intend to communicate anything about a vacation would that it be say mr punchinello from the bottom of he heart last week mr p intend go to the white mountain but he do not go on he way to the twenty-third street depot he meet the count joanne ah ha my noble friend say the latter whither away mr p explain whither he be away and be amaze to see the singular expression which instantly spread itself over the countenance of he noble friend to the white mountainscry the count why my good fellow what be you think of do you not know that this be September certainly i dosaid mr p i know that this be the season when nature revel in she richest hue and aurora gild the fairest landscape when the ray of glorious old sol be temper by the soft caress of the balmiest zephyr and -- oh certainly certainly cry the count i have no doubt of it not the least bit in the world in fact i have be in those place myself when a boy and i know all about it but let I tell you sir as _ amicus curiae _ -lrb- and i assure you that i have often be _ amicus curiae _ before -rrb- that society will not tolerate anything of this kind on you part sir the sky in the country may be bluest at this season sir the air most delicious the scenery most gorgeous and accommodation of all kind most plenty and excellent but it will not do the conductor of a first class journal belong in a manner to society and society will never forgive he for go into the country after the season be over as _ amicus curiae _ -- _ amicus _ you grandmother sir say mr p what do society know about the beauty of nature or the proper time for enjoy they society know enough about it sir cry the count draw he sword a little way from its scabbard and let it fall again with : clang sound and represent society as i do in my proper person here sir i say that any man who would go into the country in the latter part of September be a -- a what sir say mr p nervously finger he umbrella yes sir he be sir do you say that sir in you tooth sir ` tis false sir what sir just so sir to I sir to you sir the count joanne draw he sword mr p stand _ en garde _ just at this moment the greenwich street cordwainer ' target association precede by one half the whole body of metropolitan police approach the spot the target society be out on a street parade and the policeman march before they to clear broadway of all vehicle and foot-passenger and to stop short for the time the business of a great city in order that these twenty spindle-legged and melancholy little cobbler might have a proper opportunity of show they utter ignorance of all rule of march and the management of firearm perceive this vast body of police with superintendent jourdan at its head advance with measure tread upon they the count sheathe he sword and mr p shut up he deadly weapon slowly and in opposite direction they withdraw from the ground it be too late for mr p 's train and he return to he home there in the solitude of he private apartment he come to the conclusion that it would be useless to oppose the decree of society the idea that the count that worthy leader of the metropolitan _ ton _ have put into he head be not to be treat contemptuously he must give up all the fruity richness of September the royal glory of October and the delicious haze of the indian summer pack away he fish-hook and he pocket-flask and stay in the city like the rest of the fool this conclusion however do not prevent mr p from dream he have a delightful dream that night in which he find himself sailing on lake george ascend mount washington and participate in the revelry of a clam-bake on the seagirt shore of king and queen and suffolk county as nearly as circumstance will permit he have endeavor to give a idea of he dream by means of the follow sketch take as a whole mr p be not desirous that this dream should come true but take in part he would have no objection to see it fulfil as soon as society will permit which will be he suppose about next July in the meantime he advise such of he patron as have depend entirely upon he letter for they summer recreation and who will now be deprive of this delightful enjoyment to make every effort to go to some of we summer resort and spend a few week after the fashionable season be over -- that be if they think they can brave the opinion of society it may not be so pleasant to go to these place as to read mr p 's account of they but it be the best that can be do the follow little tail-piece will give a forcible idea of how

to steal it and with it under he arm hurry off to the nearest barn and there rapidly devour it this only seem to give he a appetite he go forage again but this time only pick up a mutton-bone the
