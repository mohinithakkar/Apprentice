death xxxviii the wild goose the untame chapter i pan of the desert even to a high-flying bird this be a country to be pass over quickly it be burn and brown litter with fragment of rock whether vast or small as if the refuse be toss here after the making of the world a pass shower drench the bald knob of a range of granite hill and the slant morning sun set the wet rock aflame with light in a short time the hill lose they halo and resume they brown the moisture evaporate the sun rise higher and look sternly across the desert as if he search for any remain life which still struggle for existence under he burn course and he find life hardy cattle move singly or in small group and browse on the withered bunch grass summer scorch they winter hump they back with cold and arch up they belly with famine but they be a breed school through generation for this fight against nature in this junk-shop of the world rattlesnake be ruler of the soil overhead the buzzard ominous black speck pendant against the white-hot sky rule the air it seem impossible that human being could live in this rock-wilderness if so they must be to other man what the lean hardy cattle of the hill be to the corn-fed stabled beef of the state over the shoulder of a hill come a whistle which might have be attribute to the wind have not this day be deathly calm it be fit music for such a scene for it seem neither of heaven nor earth but the soul of the great god pan come back to earth to charm those nameless rock with he wild sweet piping it change to harmonious phrase loosely connect such might be the exultant improvisation of a master violinist a great wolf or a dog as tall and rough coated as a wolf trot around the hillside he pause with one foot lift and loll crimson tongue as he scan the distance and then turn to look back in the direction from which he have come the weird music change to whistle note as liquid as a flute the sound draw closer a horseman ride out on the shoulder and check he mount one could not choose he at first glance as a type of those who fight nature in a region where the thermometer move through a scale of a hundred and sixty degree in the year to a accompaniment of cold-stabbing wind and swelter sun a thin handsome face with large brown eye and black hair a body tall but rather slenderly make -- he might have be a descendant of some ancient family of norman nobility but could such proud gentry be find ride the desert in a tall-crowned sombrero with chap on he leg and a red bandana handkerchief knot around he throat that first glance make the rider seem strangely out of place in such surroundings one might even smile at the contrast but at the second glance the smile would fade and at the third it would be replace with a stare of interest it be impossible to tell why one respect this man but after a time there grow a suspicion of unknown strength in this lone rider strength like that of a machine which be stop but only need a spark of fire to plunge it into irresistible action strangely enough the youthful figure seem in tune with that region of mighty distance with that white cruel sun with that bird of prey hover high high in the air it require some study to guess at these quality of the rider for they be such thing as a child feel more readily than a grown man but it need no expert to admire the horse he bestride it be a statue in black marble a steed fit for a shah of persium the stallion stand barely fifteen hand but to see he be to forget he size he flank shimmer like satin in the sun what promise of power in the smooth broad hip only a arab poet could run he hand over that shoulder and then speak properly of the matchless curve only a arab could appreciate leg like thin and carefully draw steel below the knee or that flow of tail and windy mane that generous breast with promise of the mighty heart within that arched neck that proud head with the prick ear wide forehead and muzzle as the sheik say which might drink from a pint-pot a rustling like dry leaf come from among the rock and the hair rise bristle around the neck of the wolflike dog with outstretched head he approach the rock sniff then stop and turn shine eye upon he master who nod and swing from the saddle it be a little uncanny this silent interchange of glance between the beast and the man the cause of the dog 's anxiety be a long rattler which now slide out from beneath a boulder and give its harsh warning coil ready to strike the dog back away but instead of growl he look to the man cowboy frequently practice with they revolver at snake but one of the peculiarity of this rider be that he carry no gun neither six-shooter nor rifle he draw out a short knife which might be use to skin a beef or carve meat though certainly no human being have ever use such a weapon against a five-foot rattler he stoop and rest both hand on he thigh he foot be not two pace from the poise head of the snake as if marvelling at this temerity the big rattler tuck back he head and sound the alarm again in response the cowboy flash he knife in the sun instantly the snake strike but the deadly fang fall a few inch short of the ride boot at the same second the man move no eye could follow the leap of he hand as it dart down and fasten around the snake just behind the head the long brown body writhe about he wrist with rattle clash he sever the head deftly and toss the twist mass back on the rock then as if he have perform the most ordinary act he rub he glove in the sand cleansed he knife in a similar manner and step back to he horse contrary to the rule of horse-nature the stallion have not flinch at sight of the snake but actually advance a high-headed pace or two with he short ear lay flat on he neck and a sudden red fury in he eye he seem to watch for a opportunity to help he master as the man approach after kill the snake the stallion let he ear go forward again and touch he nose against he master 's shoulder when the latter swing into the saddle the wolf-dog come to he side rear and rest he forefoot on the stirrup stare up into the rider 's face the man nod to he whereat as if he understand a speak word the dog drop back and trot ahead the rider touch the rein and gallop down the easy slope the little episode have give the effect of a three-cornered conversation yet the man have be as silent as the animal in a moment he be lose among the hill but still he whistle come back fainter and fainter until it be merely a thrilling whisper that dwell in the air but come from no certain direction he course lay towards a road which loop whitely across the hill the road twist over a low ridge where a house stand among a grove of cottonwood dense enough and tall enough to break the main force of any wind on the same road a thousand yard closer to the rider of the black stallion be morgan 's place chapter ii the panther in the ranch house old joseph cumberland frown on the floor as he hear he daughter say : it be not right dad i never notice it before i go away to school but since i have come back i begin to feel that it be shameful to treat dan in this way she eye brighten and she shake she golden head for emphasis she father watch she with a faintly quizzical smile and make no reply the dignity of ownership of many thousand cattle keep the old rancher 's shoulder square and there be a antique gentility about he thin face with its white goatee he be more like a quaint figure of the seventeenth century than a successful cattleman of the twentieth it _ be _ shameful dad she go on encourage by he silence or you could tell I some reason some reason for not let he have a gun ask the rancher still with the quizzical smile yes yes she say eagerly and some reason for treat he in a thousand way as if he be a irresponsible boy why kate gal you have tear in you eye he draw she onto a stool beside he hold both she hand and search she face with eye as blue and almost as bright as she own how do it come that you be so interested in dan why dad dear and she avoid he gaze i have always be interested in he have not we grow up together part way you have and have not we be always just like brother and sister you be talkin ' a little more 'n sisterly kate what do you mean ay ay what do i mean and now you be all red kate i get a idea it be nigh onto time to let dan start on he way he could not have find a surer way to drive the crimson from she face and turn it white to the lip dad well kate you would not send dan away before he could answer she drop she head against he shoulder and break into great sob he stroke she head with he calloused sunburned hand and he eye film with a distant gaze i might have know it he say over and over again i might have know it hush my silly gal she sobbing cease with magic suddenness then you will not send he away listen to I while i talk to you straight say joe cumberland and accordin ' to the way you take it will depend whether dan go or stay will you listen dear dad with all my heart humph he grunt that be just what i do not want this what i be goin ' to tell you be a queer thing -- a mighty lot like a fairy tale maybe i have keep it back from you year a ' year thinkin ' you would find out the truth about dan for yourself but bein ' so close to he have make you sort of blind maybe no man will criticize he own hoss go on tell I what you mean i will not interrupt he be silent for a moment frown to gather he thought have you ever see a mule kate of course maybe you have notice that a mule be just as strong as a horse -- yes -- but they muscle be not a third as big yes but what on earth -- well kate dan be build light a ' yet he be stronger than the biggest man around here be you go to send he away simply because he be strong it do not show nothin ' say the old man gently savin ' that he be different from the regular run of man -- a ' i have see a considerable pile of man honey there be other funny thing about dan maybe you be not notice take the way he have with hoss a ' other animal the wildest man-killin ' spur-hatin ' broncho do not put up no fight when they long leg of dan settle round 'em because they know fight will not help they maybe so maybe so he say quietly but it be kind of queer kate that after most a hundred man on the best hoss in these part have ride in relay after satan a ' could not lay a rope on he dan could jest go out on foot with a halter a ' come back in ten day leadin ' the wildest devil of a mustang that ever hate man it be a glorious thing to do she say old cumberland sigh and then shake he head it show more 'n that honey there be not any man but dan that can sit the saddle on satan if dan should die satan would not be no more use to other man than a piece of haltered lightnin ' a ' then tell I how dan get hold of that wolf black bart as he call he it be not a wolf dad say kate it be a dog dan say so himself sure he say so answer she father but there be a lone wolf prowlin ' round these part for a considerable time a ' raisin ' cain with the calf a ' the colt a ' black bart come pretty close to a description of the lone wolf maybe you remember dan find he ` dog ' lyin ' in a gully with a bullet through he shoulder if he be a dog how would he come to be shoot -- some brute of a sheep herder may have do it what could it prove it only prove that dan be queer -- powerful queer satan a ' black bart be still as wild as they ever be except that they get one master a ' they be not get a thing to do with other people black bart would tear the heart out of a man that so much as pat he head why she cry he 'll let I do anything with he humph say cumberland a little baffled maybe that be because dan be kind of fond of you gal a ' he have sort of introduce you to he pet damn 'em that be just the pint how be he able to make he man-killer act sweet with you a ' play the devil with everybody else it be not dan at all she say stoutly and he _ be not _ queer satan and black bart let I do what i want with they because they know i love they for they beauty and they strength let it go at that growl she father kate you be jest like you mother when it come to arguin ' if you be not my little gal i would say you be plain pig-headed but look here be not you ever feel that dan be what i call he -- different be not you ever see he get mad -- jest for a minute -- a ' watch they big brown eye of he get all packed full of yellow light that chase a chill up and down you back like a wrigglin ' snake she consider this statement in a little silence i see he kill a rattler once she say in a low voice dan catch he behind the head after he have strike he do it with he bare hand i almost faint when i look again he have cut off the head of the snake it be -- it be terrible she turn to she father and catch he firmly by the shoulder look I straight in the eye dad and tell I just what you mean why kate say the wise old man you be beginnin ' to see for yourself what i be drivin ' at have not you get somethin' else right on the tip of you tongue there be one day that i have never tell you about she say in a low voice look away because i be afraid that if i tell you you would shoot black bart he be gnawing a big beef bone and just for fun i try to take it away from he he would be out on a long trail with dan and he be very hungry when i put my hand on the bone he snap luckily i have a thick glove on and he merely pinch my wrist also i think he realize what he be do for otherwise he would have cut through the glove as if it have be paper he snarl fearfully and i spring back with a cry dan have not see what happen but he hear the snarl and see black bart 's bared tooth then -- oh it be terrible she cover she face take you time kate say cumberland softly ` bart ' call dan she go on and there be such anger in he face that i think i be more afraid of he than of the big dog bart turn to he with a snarl and bare he tooth when dan saw that he face turn -- i do not know how to say it she stop a moment and she hand tighten back in he throat there come a sound that be almost like the snarl of black bart the wolf-dog watch he with a terror that be uncanny to see the hair around he neck fairly on end he tooth still bare and he growl horrible ` dan ' i call ` do not go near he ' i might as well have call out to a whirlwind he leap black bart spring to meet he with eye green with fear i hear the loud click of he tooth as he snap -- and miss dan swerve to one side and catch black bart by the throat and drive he into the dust fall with he i could not move i be weak with horror it be not a struggle between a man and a beast it be like a fight between a panther and a wolf black bart be fight hard but fight hopelessly those hand be settle tighter on he throat he big red tongue loll out he struggle almost cease then dan happen to glance at I what he see in my face sober he he get up lift the dog with he and fling away the lifeless weight of bart he begin to brush the dust from he clothes look down as if he be ashamed he ask I if the dog have hurt I when he snap i could not speak for a moment then come the most horrible part black bart who must have be nearly kill drag himself to dan on he belly choke and whine and lick the boot of he master then you _ do _ know what i mean when i say dan be -- different she hesitate and blink as if she be shut she eye on a fact i _ do not _ know i know that he be gentle and kind and love you more than you love he she voice break a little oh dad you forget the time he sit up with you for five day and night when you get sick out in the hill and how he barely manage to get you back to the house alive the old man frown to conceal how greatly he be move i have not forget nothin ' kate he say a ' everything be for he own good do you know what i have be tryin ' to do all these year what i have be tryin ' to hide he from himself kate do you remember how i find he i be too little to know i have hear you tell a little about it he be lose on the range you find he twenty mile south of the house lose on the range repeat she father softly i do not think he could ever have be lose to a hoss the corral be a home to we we ranch be a home to dan barry the whole mountain-desert be a home this be how i find he it be in the spring of the year when the wild goose be honkin ' as they fly north i be ridin ' down a gulley about sunset and wishin ' that i be closer to the ranch when i hear a funny wild sort of whistlin ' that do not have any tune to it that i recognize it give I a queer feelin ' it make I think of fairy story -- a ' thing like that pretty soon i see a figure on the crest of the hill there be a triangle of goose away up overhead a ' the boy be walkin ' along lookin ' up as if he be followin ' the trail of the wild goose he be up there walkin ' between the sunset a ' the star with he head bent back and he hand stuff into he pocket whistlin ' as if he be goin ' home from school a ' such whistlin ' nobody could ever whistle like dan she say and smile i ride up to he wonderin ' go on cumberland ` what be you doin ' round here ' i say say he lookin ' at I casual like over he shoulder : ` i be jest takin ' a stroll a ' whistlin ' do it bother you mister ' ` it do not bother I none ' say i ` where do you belong sonny ' ` I ' say he lookin ' sort of surprised ` why i belong around over there ' a ' he wave he hand careless over to the settin ' sun there be somethin' about he that make my heart swell up inside of I i look down into they big brown eye and wonder -- well i do not know what i wonder but i remember all at once that i do not have no son ` who be you folk ' say i gettin ' more a ' more curious he jest look at I sort of bored ` where do you folk live at ' say i ` oh they live around here ' say he a ' he wave he hand again a ' this time over towards the east say i : ` when do you figure on reachin ' home ' ` oh most any day ' say he a ' i look around at they brown naked hill with the night comin ' down over they then i stare back at the boy a ' there be something that come up in I like hunger you see he be lose he be alone the queer ring of he whistlin ' be still in my ear a ' i could not help rememberin ' that i do not have no son ` then supposin ' you come along with I ' say i ` a ' i 'll send you home in a buckboard tomorrow ' so the end of it be I ridin ' home with the little kid sittin ' up before I whistlin ' he heart out when i get he home i try to talk to he again he could not tell I or he would not tell I where he folk live but jest keep wavin ' he hand liberal to half the point of the compass a ' that be all i know of where he come from i do all i could to find he parent i inquire and send letter to every rancher within a hundred mile i advertise it through the railroad but they say nobody would yet be report lose he be still mine at least for a while a ' i be terrible glad i give the kid a spare room i sit up late that first night listenin ' to the wild goose honkin ' away up in the sky a ' wonderin ' why i be so happy kate that night there be tear in my eye when i thought of how that kid have be out there on the hill walkin ' along so happy a ' independent but the next mornin ' he be go i send my cowpuncher out to look for he ` which way shall we ride ' they ask i do not know why but i think of the wild goose that dan have seem to be followin ' ` ride north ' i say a ' sure enough they ride north a ' find he after that i do not have no trouble with he about runnin ' away -- at least not durin ' the summer a ' all those month i keep plannin ' how i would take care of this boy who have come wanderin ' to I it seem like he be sort of a gift of god to make up for I havin ' no son and everythin ' go well until the next fall when the goose begin to fly south sure enough that be when dan run away again and when i send my cowpuncher south after he they find he and bring he back it seem as if they would bring back half the world to I when i see he but i see that i would have to put a stop to this runnin ' away i try to talk to he but all he would say be that he would better be movin ' on i take the law in my hand a ' tell he he have to be discipline so i start thrashin ' he with a quirt very light he take it as if he do not feel the whip on he shoulder a ' he smile but there come up a yellow light in he eye that make I feel as if a man be standin ' right behind I with a bare knife in he hand a ' smilin ' jest like the kid be doin ' finally i simply back out of the room a ' since that day there be not be man or beast ever have put a hand on whistlin ' dan to this day i reckon he be not quite forgive I why she cry i have never hear he mention it that be why i know he be not forget it anyway kate i lock he in he room but he would not promise not to run away then i get a inspiration you be jest a little toddlin ' thing then that day you be cryin ' a awful lot a ' i suddenly think of puttin ' you in dan 's room i do it i jest unlock the door quick and then shove you in a ' lock it again first of all you scream terrible hard i be afraid maybe you would hurt yourself yellin ' that way i be about to take you out again when all at once i hear dan start whistlin ' and pretty quick you cryin ' stop i listen a ' wonder after that i never have to lock dan in he room i be sure he would stay on account of you but now honey i be gettin ' to the end of the story a ' i be goin ' to give you the straight idea the way i see it i have watch dan like -- like a father almost i think he love I sort of -- but i have never get over be afraid of he you see i can not forget how he smile when i lick he but listen to I kate that fear have be with I all the time -- a ' it be the only time i have ever be afraid of any man it be not like be scare of a man but of a panther now we 'll jest nacherally add up all the point we have make about dan -- the queer way i find he without a home a ' without wantin ' one -- that strength he have that be like the power of a mule compare with a horse -- that funny control he have over wild animal so that they almost seem to know what he mean when he simply look at they -lrb- have you notice he with black bart and satan -rrb- -- then there be the yellow light that come in he eye when he begin to get real mad -- you a ' i have both see it only once but we do not want to see it again more than this there be the way he handle either a knife or a gun he have not practice much with shootin ' iron but i never see he miss a reasonable mark -- or a unreasonable one either for that matter i have speak to he about it he say : ' i dunno how it be i do not see how a feller can shoot crooked it jest seem that when i get out a gun there be a line draw from the barrel to the thing i be shootin ' at all i have to do be to pull the trigger -- almost with my eye close ' now kate do you begin to see what these here thing point to tell I what you see she say and then i 'll tell you what i think of it all all right he say i see in dan a man who be different from the common run of we i read in a book once that in the age when man live like animal a ' have no weapon except stick and stone they muscle must have be two or three time as strong as they be now -- more like the muscle of brute a ' they hearin ' a ' they sight a ' they quickness a ' they endurance be about three time more than that of ordinary man kate i think that dan be one of those man the book describe he know animal because he have all the power that they have a ' i know from the way he eye go yellow that he have the fightin ' instinct of the ancestor of man so far i have keep he away from other man which i may say be the main reason i buy dan morgan 's place so be to keep fightin ' man away from we whistlin ' dan so i have be hidin ' he from himself you see he be my boy if he belong to anybody maybe when time go on he 'll get tame but i reckon not it be like takin ' a panther cub -- or a wolf pup -- a tryin ' to raise it for a pet some day it get the taste of blood maybe its own blood a ' then it go mad and become a killer a ' that be what i fear kate so far i have keep dan from ever havin ' a single fight but i reckon the day 'll come when someone 'll cross he and then there 'll be a tornado turn loose that 'll jest about wreck these part she anger have grow during this speech now she rise i will not believe you dad she say i would sooner trust we dan than any man alive i do not think you be right in a single word i be sure loco sigh cumberland to ever dream of convincin ' a woman let it drop kate we be about to get rid of morgan 's place a ' now i reckon there will not be any temptation near dan we 'll see what time 'll do for he let the thing drop there now i be goin ' over to the bar xo outfit a ' i will not be back till late tonight there be only one thing more i tell morgan there be not to be any gun-play in he place today if you hear any shootin ' go down there a ' remind morgan to take the gun off 'n the man kate nodded but she stare travel far away and the thing she see be the yellow light burning in the eye of whistle dan chapter iii silent shoot it be a great day and also a sad one for morgan he general store and saloon have be buy out by old joe cumberland who declare a determination to clear up the landscape and thereby plunge the cowpuncher in gloom they partially forgive cumberland but only because he be a old man a younger reformer would have meet armed resistance morgan 's place be mile away from the next oasis in the desert and the closing mean dusty thirsty league of add journey to every man in the neighborhood the word neighborhood of course cover a territory fifty mile square if the day be very sad for this important reason it be also very glad for rustling morgan advertise the day of close far and wide and he most casual patron drop all business to attend the big doings a long line of buckboard and cattle pony surround the place newcomer gallopp in every few moment most of they do not stop to tether they mount but simply drop the rein over the head of the horse and then go with rattle spur and slouch step into the saloon every man be greet by a shout for one or two of those within usually know he and when they raise a cry the other join in for the sake of good fellowship as a rule he respond by order everyone up to the bar one man however receive no more greeting than the slamming of the door behind he he be a tall handsome fellow with tawny hair and a little smile of habit rather than mirth upon he lip he have ride up on a strong bay horse a full two hand taller than the average cattle pony and with leg and shoulder and straight back that unmistakably tell of a blooded pedigree when he enter the saloon he seem nowise abashed by the silence but greet the turn head with a wave of the hand and a good-natured howdy boy a volley of greeting reply to he for in the mountain-desert man can not be stranger after the first word line up and hit the red-eye he go on and lean against the bar as he speak he habitual smile broaden into one of actual invitation except for a few group who watch the gambling in the corner of the big room there be a general movement towards the bar and make it a tall one boy go on the genial stranger this be the first time i ever irrigated morgan 's place and from what i have hear today about the closing i suppose it will be the last time so here be to you morgan and he wave he glass towards the bartender he voice be well modulate and he enunciation bespoke education this in connection with he careful clothes and rather modish riding-boot might have give he the reputation of a dude have it not be for several other essential detail of he appearance he six-gun hang so low that he would scarcely have to raise he hand to grasp the butt he hold he whisky glass in he left hand and the right which rest carelessly on he hip be deeply sunburned as if he rarely wear a glove moreover he eye be marvellously direct and they linger a negligible space as they touch on each man in the room all of this the cattleman note instantly what they do not see on account of he veil finger be that he pour only a few drop of the liquor into he glass in the meantime another man who have never before irrigated at morgan 's place ride up he mount like that of the tawny-haired rider be considerably larger and more finely build than the common range horse in three day of hard work a cattle pony might wear down these blood animal but would find it impossible to either overtake or escape they in a straight run the second stranger short-legged barrel-chested and with a scrub of black beard enter the barroom while the crowd be still drink the health of morgan he take a corner chair push back he hat until a mop of hair fall down he forehead and begin to roll a cigarette the man of the tawny hair take the next seat seem to be quite a party stranger say the tall fellow nonchalantly sure growl he of the black beard and after a moment he add : be out on the trail long pardner hardly start so be i as a matter of fact i have get a lot of hard ride before I so have i and some long ride too perhaps it be because he turn he head suddenly towards the light but a glint seem to come in the eye of the bearded man long ride he say more amiably be sure hell on hoss and on man too nod the other and tilted back in he chair the bearded man speak again but though a dozen cowpuncher be close by no one hear he voice except the man at he side one side of he face remain perfectly immobile and he eye stare straight before he drearily while he whisper from a corner of he mouth : how long do you stay lee noon say lee once more the shorter man speak in the manner which be learn in a penitentiary : I too we must be slate for the same ride lee do you know what it be it be nearly noon and the chief ought to be here there be a loud greet for a newcomer and lee take advantage of the noise to say quite openly : if silent say he 'll come he 'll be here but i say he be crazy to come to a place full of range rider bill take it easy respond bill this hangout be away off we regular beat nobody 'll know he he hide be he own and he can do what he want with it say lee i warn he before shut up murmured bill here 's jim now and hal purvi with he through the door stride a great figure before whom the throng at the bar give way as water roll back from the tall prow of a ship in he wake go a little man with a face dry and wither by the sun and small bright eye which move continually from side to side lee and bill discover they thirst at the same time and make towards the newcomer they have no difficulty in reach they the large man stand with he back to the bar he elbow spread out on it so that there be a little space leave on either side of he no one care to press too close to this sombre-faced giant purvi stand before he and bill and lee be instantly at he side the two lean on the bar face he yet the four do not seem to make a group set apart from the rest well ask lee i 'll tell you what it be when we be on the road say jim silent plenty of time haine who 'll start first ask bill you can kilduff say the other go straight north and go slow then haine will follow you purvi next i come last because i get here last there be not any hurry -- what be this here i tell you i see it call a angry voice from a corner you must of be drunk a ' seein ' double

be grave except jim silent and he three companion who be smile grimly by god jack say the first man with ominous softness i 'll take a lot from you but when it come to doubtin ' my word -- morgan with pop eye and a very red face slap he hand on the bar and vault over it with more agility than he plumpness warrant he shoulder he way hurriedly through the crowd to the rapidly widen circle around the two disputant they stand with they right hand rest with rigid finger low down on they hip and they eye fix on each other forget the rest of the world morgan burst in between they look here he thunder it be only by way of a favor that i be lettin ' you boy wear shootin ' iron today because i promise old cumberland there would not be no fuss if you get trouble there be enough room for you to settle they out in the hill but there be not none at all in here the gleam go out of they eye like four candle snuff by the wind obviously they be both glad to have the tension broken mike wipe he forehead with a rather unsteady hand i be not huntin ' for no special brand of trouble he say but jack have be ridin ' the red-eye pretty hard and it be get into that dry up bean he call he brain say partner drawl jack i be not drunk enough of the hot stuff to make I fall for the line you have be hand out he turn to morgan mike here have be tryin ' to make I believe that he know a feller who could drill a

about could drill they every time but he could do it two time out of four mike say morgan and he soften he disbelief with he smile and the good-natured clap on the shoulder you sure must of be drinkin

you calculate to back it up with cold cash morgan whirl upon he with a scowl i be not pull a bluff in my life that i can not back up he say sharply well say silent i be not so flush that i would turn down fifty buck when a kind christian soul as the preacher say slide it into my glove not I lead out the dollar pal a ' kiss it farewell who 'll hold the stake ask morgan let you friend mike say jim silent carelessly and he place fifty dollar in gold in the hand of the irishman morgan follow suit the crowd hurry outdoors a dozen bet be lay in as many seconds most of the man wish to place they money on the side of morgan but there be not a few who stand willing to risk coin on jim silent stranger though he be something in he unflinching eye he stern face and the nerveless surety of he movement command they trust how do you stand jim ask lee haine anxiously be it a safe bet i have never see you try a mark like this one it be not safe say silent because i be not mad enough to shoot my best but it be about a even draw take you pick not I say haine if you have ten chance instead of one i might stack some coin on you if the dollar be stationary i know you could do it but a move coin look pretty small here you be call morgan who stand at a distance of twenty pace be you ready silent whip out he revolver and poise it let ` er go the coin whirl in the air silent fire as it commence to fall -- it land untouched as a kind christian soul say morgan sarcastically i be not in you class stranger charity always sort of interest I when i be on the receivin ' end the crowd chuckle and the sound infuriate silent do not go back jest yet partner he drawl mister morgan i get one hundred bone which holler that i can plug that dollar the second try boy grin morgan i be leavin ' you to witness that i hate to do it but business be business here you be the coin whirl again silent with he lip press into a straight line and he brow draw dark over he eye wait until the coin reach the height of its rise and then fire -- miss -- fire again and send the coin spin through the air in a flash semicircle it be a beautiful piece of gun-play in the midst of the clamor of applause silent stride towards morgan with he hand outstretch after all he say i knowed you be not really hard of heart it only need a little time and persuasion to make you dig for coin when i pass the box morgan red of face and scowl hand over he late winnings and he own stake it take you two shot to do it he say a ' if i want to argue the pint maybe you would not walk off with the coin partner say jim silent gently i get a wanderin ' hunch that you be showin ' a pile of brain by not arguin ' this here pint there follow that little hush of expectancy which precede trouble but morgan after a glance at the set lip of he opponent swallow he wrath i s ` pose you 'll tell how you do this to you kid when you be eighty he say scornfully but around here stranger they do not think much of it whistlin ' dan -- he pause as if to calculate how far he could safely exaggerate -- whistlin ' dan can stand with he back to the coin a ' when they be throw he drill four dollar easier than you do one -- a ' he would not waste three shot on one dollar he be not so extravagant chapter iv something yellow the crowd laugh again at the excitement of morgan and silent 's mirth particularly be loud and long a ' if you be still bent on charity he say at last maybe we could find somethin' else to lay a bet on anything you name say morgan hotly i suppose say silent that you be some rider eh i c 'n get by with most of 'em yeh -- i suppose you never pull leather in you life not any hoss that another man could ride straight up be that so well partner you see that roan over there that tall horse you get he you c 'n win back that hundred if you stick on he back two minute d'you take it morgan hesitate a moment the big roan be foot it nervously here and there sometimes throw up he head suddenly after the manner of a horse of bad temper however the loss of that hundred dollar and the humiliation which accompany it weigh heavily on the saloon owner 's mind i 'll take you he say a high thrilling whistle come faintly from the distance that fellow on the black horse down the road say lee haine i guess he be the one that can hit the four dollar ha ha ha sure grin silent listen to he whistle we 'll see if we can drag another bet out of the bar-keep if the roan do not hurt he too bad look at he now morgan be have a bad time get he foot in the stirrup for the roan rear and plunge finally two man hold he head and the saloon-keeper swing into the saddle there be a little silence the roan as if doubtful that he could really have this new burden on he back and still fearful of the rope which have be lately tethering he go a few short prance step and then feel something akin to freedom rear straight up snort the crowd yell with delight and the sound send the roan back to all fours and race down the road he stop with brace foot and morgan lurch forwards on the neck yet he strike to he seat gamely whistle dan be not a hundred yard away morgan yell and swing the quirt the response of the roan be another race down the road at terrific speed despite the pull of morgan on the rein just as the run horse reach whistle dan he stop as short as he have do before but this time with a add buck and a sidewise lurch all combine which give the effect of snap a whip -- and poor morgan be hurl from the saddle like a stone from a sling the crowd wave they hat and yell with delight look out yell jim silent grab the rein but though morgan make a valiant effort the roan easily swerve past he and go race down the road my god groan silent he be go saddle call someone we 'll catch he catch hell answer silent bitterly there be not a hoss on earth that can catch he -- a ' now that he be not get the weight of a rider he 'll run away from the wind anyway there go dan on satan after he no use the roan be not carryin ' a thing but the saddle satan never see the day he could make the roan eat dust anyway look at 'em go boy there be not no use say jim silent sadly he 'll wind he black for nothin ' -- a ' i have lose the best hoss on the range i believe he whisper one man to a neighbor because i have get a idea that hoss be red peter himself he companion stare at he agape red pete he say why pal that be the hoss that silent -- maybe it be a ' maybe it be not but why should we ask too many question let the marshal tend to he he be not ever trouble this part of the range anyway i be goin ' to remember he face if it be really jim silent i get something that be worth tellin ' to my kid when they grow up they both turn and look at the tall man with a uncomfortable awe the rest of the crowd swarm into the road to watch the race the black stallion be handicapped many yard at the start before dan could swing he around after the roan dart past with poor morgan in ludicrous pursuit moreover the roan have the inestimable advantage of a empty saddle yet satan lean to he work with a stout heart there be no rock and pitch to he gait no jerk and labor to he stride those smooth shoulder be cord now with a thousand line where the steel muscle whip to and fro he neck stretch out a little -- he ear lay back along the neck -- he whole body settle gradually and continually down as he stride lengthen whistle dan be lean forward so that he body would break less wind he laugh low and soft as the air whir into he face and now and then he speak to he horse no yell of encouragement but a sound hardly louder than a whisper there be no longer a horse and rider -- the two have become one creature -- a centaur -- the body of a horse and the mind of a man for a time the roan increase he advantage but quickly satan begin to hold he even and then gain first inch by inch then at every stride the distance between they diminish no easy task the great roan have muscle heart and that empty saddle as well perhaps as a thought of the free range which lay before he and liberty from the accursed thraldom of the bit and rein and galling spur what he lack be that small whisper voice -- that hand touch lightly now and then on he neck -- that thrill of generous sympathy which pass between horse and rider he lose ground steadily and more and more rapidly now the outstretched black head be at he tail now at he flank now at he girth now at he shoulder now they race nose and nose whistle dan shift in the saddle he left foot take the opposite stirrup he right leg swing free the big roan swerve -- the black in response to a word from he rider follow the motion -- and then the miracle happen a shadow plunge through the air a weight thud on the saddle of the roan a iron hand jerk back the rein red pete hate man and fear they but this new weight on he back be different it be not the pressure on the rein which urge he to slow up he have the bit in he tooth and no human hand could pull down he head but into the blind love blind terror blind rage which make up the consciousness of a horse enter a force which he have never know before he realize suddenly that it be folly to attempt to throw off this clinging burden he might as well try to jump out of he skin he racing stride shorten to a halt gallop this to a sharp trot and in a moment more he be turn and head back for morgan 's place the black who have follow turn at the same time like a dog and follow with jounce bridle rein black bart with loll red tongue run under he head look up to the stallion now and again with a comical air of proprietorship as if he be show the way it be very strange to red pete he prance sideways a little and shake he head up and down in a effort to regain he former temper but that iron hand keep he nose down now and that quiet voice sound above he -- no cursing no rake of sharp spur to torture he tender flank no whir of the quirt but a calm voice of authority and understanding red pete break into a easy canter and in this fashion they come up to morgan in the road red pete snort and start to shy for he recognize the clumsy bounce weight which have insult he back not long before but this quiet voice master reassure he and he come to a halt that red devil have cost I a hundred bone and all the skin on my knee groan morgan and i can hardly walk damn he eye but say dan -- and he eye glow with a admiration which make he momentarily forget he pain -- that be some circus stunt you do down the road there -- that changin ' of saddle on the run i never see the equal of it if you get hurt in the fall say dan quietly overlook the latter part of the speech why do not you climb onto satan he 'll take you back morgan laugh say kid i would take a chance with satan but there be not any hospital for fool handy go ahead he will not stir a foot steady satan all right say morgan every step be sure like pullin ' tooth he venture closer to the black stallion but be stop short black bart be suddenly change to a green-eyed devil he hair bristle around he shoulder he tooth bare and a snarl that come from the heart of a killer satan also greet he propose rider with ear lay flat back on he neck and a quiver anger if i be goin ' to ride satan declare morgan i get to shoot the dog first and then blindfold the hoss no you do not say dan no one else have ever have a seat on satan but i get a idea he 'll make a exception for a sort of temporary cripple steady boy here you bart come over here a ' keep you face shut the dog after a glance at he master move reluctantly away keep he eye upon morgan satan back away with a snort he stop at the command of dan but when morgan lay a hand on the bridle and speak to he he tremble with fear and anger the saloon-keeper turn away thankin ' you jest the same dan he say i think i c 'n walk back i would as soon ride a tame tornado as that hoss he limp on down the road with dan ride beside he black bart slunk at he heel sniff dan i be goin ' to ask you a favor -- a ' a big one will you do it for I sure say whistle dan anything i can there be a skunk down there with a bad eye a ' a gun that jump out of its leather like it have

tellin ' he about you -- maybe i be sort of exaggeratin ' -- a ' i say you could have you back turn when the coin be toss a ' then pick off four dollar before they hit the ground i make it a bit high dan he eye be wistful nick four round boy before they hit the dust say dan maybe i could i do not know i can not try it anyway morgan because i tell dad cumberland i would never pull a gun while there be a crowd aroun ' morgan sigh he hesitate and then : but you promise you would do I a favor dan the rider start i forget about that -- i do not think -- it be only to do a shootin ' trick say morgan eagerly it be not pullin ' a gun on any one why lad if you 'll tell I you get a ghost of a chance i 'll bet every cent in my cash drawer on you agin that skunk you have give I you word dan whistle dan shrug he shoulder i have give you my word he say a ' i 'll do it but i guess dad cumberland 'll be mighty sore on I a laugh rise from the crowd at morgan 's place which they be near rapidly it be like a mock comment on dan 's speech as they come closer they could see money change hand in all direction what would you do to my hoss ask jim silent walk out to meet they he hypnotize he say hal purvi and he lip twist over yellow tooth into a grin of satisfaction git out of the saddle damn quick growl silent it be not nacheral he would let you ride he like he be a plough-hoss a ' if you have try any fancy stunt i 'll -- take it easy say purvi as dan slip from the saddle without show the slightest anger take it easy you be a bum loser when i see the black settle down to he work he explain to dan with another grin i knowed he would nail he in the end a ' i stake twenty on you agin my friend here that be sure a slick change of hoss you make there be other loser money chink on all side to a accompaniment of laughter and curse jim silent be examine the roan with a scowl while bill kilduff and hal purvi approach satan to look over he point purvi reach out towards the bridle when a murderous snarl at he foot make he jump back with a shout he stand with he gun poise face black bart who be get any money to bet this damn wolf live more 'n five seconds he say savagely i have say dan who in hell be you what d'you mean by trail this man-killer around he turn to dan with he gun still poise bart be not a killer say dan and the gentleness of he voice be oil on troubled water but he get peeve when a stranger come nigh to the hoss all right this time say purvi slowly restore he gun to its holster but if this wolf of yours look cross-eye at I agin he 'll hit the long trail that be not get any end savvy sure say dan and he soft brown eye smile placatingly purvis keep he right hand close to the butt of he gun and he eye glint as if he expect a answer somewhat stronger than word at this mild acquiesence he turn away sneering silent have discover that he could find no fault with dan 's treatment of he horse now approach with a ominously thin-lipped smile lee haine read he face and come to he side with a whisper : better cut out the rough stuff jim this chap have not hurt anything but you cash and he be already take water from purvis i guess there be no call for you to make any play shut you face haine respond silent in the same tone he be make a fool of I by showin ' up my hoss a ' by god i be goin ' to give he a man-handlin ' he 'll never forgit he whirl on morgan how about it bar-keep be this the dead shot you be spillin ' so many word about dan as if he could not understand the broad insult merely smile at he with marvellous good nature keep away from he stranger warn morgan jest because he ride you hoss you be not get a cause to hunt trouble with he he be be teach not to fight silent still look dan over with insolent eye reply : he sure stick to he daddy 's lesson nice a ' quiet a ' house break be not he in my part of the country they dress this kind of a man in gal 's clothes so 's nobody 'll ever get sore at he a ' spoil he pretty face better go home to you ma this be not any place for you they 's man aroun ' here there be another one of those grimly expectant hush and then a general guffaw dan show no inclination to take offence he merely stare at brawny jim silent with a sort of childlike wonder all right he say meekly if i be not want around here i figger there be not any cause why i should stay you do not figger to be peeve at I do you the laughter change to a veritable yell of delight even silent smile with careless contempt no kid he answer if i be peeve at you you would learn it without askin ' question he turn slowly away maybe i get jaundice boy he say to the crowd but it seem to I i see something kind of yellow around here the delightful subtlety of this remark rouse another side-shaking burst of merriment dan shake he head as if the mystery be beyond he comprehension and look to morgan for a explanation the saloon-keeper approach he struggle with a grin it be all right dan he say do not let 'em rile you you be not get any cause to fear that say silent because it can not be do chapter v four in the air dan look from morgan to silent and back again for understand he feel that something be wrong but what it be he have not the slightest idea for many year old joe cumberland have patiently teach he that the last offence against god and man be to fight the old cattleman have instil in he the belief that if he do not cross the path of another no one would cross he way the code be perfect and satisfying he would let the world alone and the world would not trouble he the placid current of he life have never come to white water of wrath wherefore he gaze bewildered about he they be laugh -- they be laugh unpleasantly at he as he have see man laugh at a fiery young colt which struggle against the rope it be very strange they could not mean harm therefore he smile back at they rather uncertainly morgan slap at he shoulder by way of good-fellowship and to hearten he but dan slip away under the extended hand with a motion as subtle and swift as the twist of a snake when it flee for its hole he have a deep aversion for contact with another man 's body he hate it as the wild horse hate the shadow of the fly rope steady up pal say morgan the lad mean no harm that tall man be considerable rile which he 'll now bet he sombrero agin you when it come to shootin ' he turn back to silent look here partner he say this be the man i say could nail the four dollar before they hit the dust i figger you do not think how it can be do eh he say silent in deep disgust send he back to he ma before somebody muss he all up why he do not even pack a gun morgan wait a long moment so that the little silence would make he next speech impressive stranger he say i have still get somewhere in the neighborhood of five hundred dollar in that cash drawer a ' every cent of it holler that dan can do what i say silent hesitate he code be loose but he do not like to take advantage of a drunk or a crazy man however five hundred dollar be five hundred dollar moreover that handsome fellow who have just take water from hal purvi and be now smile foolishly at he own shame have actually ridden red peter the remembrance infuriate silent hurry up say morgan confidently i dunno what you be thinkin ' stranger which i be kind of deaf a ' i do not understand the way anything talk except money corral that talk morgan call a voice from the crowd you be plumb locoe if you think any man in the world can get away with a stunt like that pick four in the air you keep you jaw for yourself say silent angrily if he want to donate a little more money to charity let he do it morgan i have get five hundred here to cover you stake make he give you odds morgan say another voice because -- a glance from silent cut the suggestion short after that there be little loud conversation the stake be large the excitement make the man hush the very tone in which they speak morgan moisten he white lip you c 'n see i be not packin ' any shootin ' iron say dan have anybody get any suggestion every gun in the crowd be instantly at he service they be heartily tempt to despise dan but as one with the courage to attempt the impossible they would help he as far as they could he take they gun one after the other weigh they try the action and hand they back it be almost as if there be a separate intelligence in the end of he finger which inform he of the quality of each weapon nice gun he say to the first man whose revolver he handle but i do not like a barrel that be quite so heavy there be a whole ounce too much in the barrel what d'you mean ask the cowpuncher i have pack that gun for pretty nigh eight year sorry say dan passing on but i can not work right with a top-heavy gun the next weapon he hand back almost at once what be the matter with that ask the owner aggressively cylinder too tight say dan decisively and a moment later to another man bad handle i do not like the feel of it over jim silent 's gun he pause longer than over most of the rest but finally he hand they back the big man scowl dan look back to he in gentle surprise you see he explain quietly you get to handle a gun like a horse if you do not treat it right it will not treat you right that be all i know about it you gun be not very clean stranger a ' a gun that be not keep clean get off foot silent glance at he weapon curse softly and restore they to the holster lee he mutter to haine who stand next to he what do you think he mean by that d' you figger he be get somethin' up he sleeve a ' that be why he act so like a damned woman i do not know say haine gravely he look to I sort of queer -- sort of different -- damned different chief by this time dan have secure a second gun which suit he he whirl both gun try they action alternately and then announce that he be ready in the dead silence one of the man pace off the twenty yard dan with he back turn stand at the mark shift he revolver easily in he hand and smile down at they as if they could understand he caress how you feelin ' dan ask morgan anxiously everything fine he answer be you gettin ' weak no i be all right steady up partner steady up look at my hand dan extend he arm there be not a quiver in it all right dan when you be shootin ' remember that i get pretty close to everything i own stake on you there be the stranger gettin ' he four dollar ready silent take he place with the four dollar in he hand be you ready he call let she go say dan apparently without the least excitement jim silent throw the coin and he throw they so as to increase he chance as much as possible a little snap of he hand give they a rapid rotary motion so that each one be merely a speck of wink light he fling they high for it be probable that whistle dan would wait to shoot until they be on the way down the higher he throw they the more rapidly they would be travel when they cross the level of the markman 's eye as a shout proclaim the throwing of the coin dan whirl and it seem to the bystander that a revolver explode before he be fully turn but one of the coin never rise to the height of the throw there be a light cling and it spin a dozen yard away two more shot blended almost together two more dollar dart away in twinkling streak of light one coin still fall but when it be a few inch from the earth a six-shooter bark again and the fourth dollar glance sidewise into the dust it take long to describe the feat actually the four shot consume less than a second of time that last dollar say dan and he soft voice be the first sound out of the silence be not good it do not ring true counterfeit it seem that no one hear he word the man be make a wild scramble for the dollar they dive into the dust for they rise white of face and clothes to fight and struggle over they prize those dollar with the chip and neat round hole in they would confirm the truth of a story that the most credulous might be tempt to laugh or scorn a cowpuncher offer ten dollar for one of the relic -- but none would part with a prize the moment the shooting be over dan step quietly back and restore the gun to the owner the first man seize he weapon carelessly he be in the midst of he rush after one of the chip coin the other cowpuncher receive he weapon almost with reverence i be thankin ' you for the loan say dan a here 's hopin ' you always have luck with the gun luck say the other i sure _ will _ have luck with it i be goin ' to oil she up and put she in a glass case back home a ' when i get grandchild i be goin ' to point out that gun to 'em and tell 'em what man use to do in the old day let 's go in a ' surround some red-eye at my expense no thanks answer dan i be not drinkin ' he step back to the edge of the circle and fold he arm it be as if he have walk out of the picture he suddenly seem to be aloof from they all out of the quiet burst a torrent of curse exclamation and shout chance draw jim silent and he three follower together my god whisper lee haine with a sort of horror in he voice it be not human do you see do you see be i blind ask hal purvis a ' think of I walkin ' up a ' bracin ' that killer like he be a two-year-old kid i figger that be the nearest i ever come to a undeserved grave a ' i have have some close call ` that last dollar be not good it do not ring true ' say he when he finish i never see such nerve you be wrong as hell say silent a _ woman _ can shoot at a target but it take a cold _ nerve _ to shoot at a man -- a ' this feller be yellow all through be he growl bill kilduff well i would hate to take he by surprise so 's he would forget himself he get as much action out of a common six-gun as if it be a gatle he be right about that last dollar too it be pure -- lead all right haine say silent you c 'n start now any time a ' the rest of we 'll follow on the way i say i be leavin ' last i get a little job to finish up with the kid but haine be stare fixedly down the road i

somewhat confused they seem to be wearin ' they he say weakly and he eye wander about the armed circle pause on the ominous form of hal purvi bill kilduff and especially jim silent a head taller than

they reach jim silent he stare fixedly upon haine then he draw he gun slowly and present they to he comrade while he eye shift to kate and he say coldly : lady i hope i be not the last one to congratulate you she do not understand but haine scowl and color dan in the meantime be sweep into the saloon by a influx of the cowpuncher that leave only lee haine outside with kate she have detain

the wrist and that mighty sweep of arm be stop in mid-air they be in the middle of the room they stand perfectly erect and close together embrace they position have a ludicrous resemblance to the posture of dancer but they body be tremble with effort with every ounce of power in he huge frame silent strove to complete he grip at the throat he feel the right arm of dan tighten around he closer closer closer it be not a bulky arm but it seem to be make of link steel which be shrink into he and promise to crush he very bone the strength of this man seem to increase it be limitless he breath

and the weight of it fairly drive he into the floor he fall with a limp thud on the board silent reel and blind staggered to and fro in the center of the room morgan and lee haine reach dan at the same moment and kneel beside he chapter vii the mute messenger almost at once haine raise a hand and speak to the crowd : he be all right boy badly cut across the head and stunned but he 'll live there be a deep gash on the upper part of the forehead if the cross-bar of the chair have not break the skull might have be injure the impact of the blow have stunned he and it might be many minute before he sens return as the crowd close around dan a black body leap among they snarl hideously they spring back with a yell from the rush of this green-eyed fury but black bart make no effort to attack they he sit crouch before the prostrate body lick the deathly white face and growl horribly and then stand over he fallen master and stare about the circle those who have see a lone wolf make its stand against a pack of dog recognize the attitude then without a sound as swiftly as he have enter the room he leap through the door and dart off up the road satan for the first time desert by this wolfish companion turn a high head and neigh after he but he race on the man return to they work over dan 's body cursing softly there be a hair-raising unearthliness about the sudden come and departure of black bart jim silent and he comrade wait no longer but take to they saddle and gallop down the road within a few moment the crowd at morgan 's place begin to thin out evening be come on and most of they have far to ride they might have linger until midnight but this peculiar accident damp they spirit probably not a hundred word be speak from the moment silent strike dan to the time

then faster and faster at the threshold she whirl and plunge into the night up the road she race once she stumble and fall to she knee she cry out and glance behind she breathing again when she see that nothing follow at the house she make no pause though she hear the voice of she father singing she could not tell he he should be the last in all the world to know she go to she room and huddle into bed presently a knock come at she door and she father 's voice ask if she be ill she plead that she have a bad headache and wish to be alone he ask if she have see dan by a great effort she manage to reply that dan have ride to a neighbouring ranch she father leave the door without further question afterwards she hear he in the distance singing he favorite mournful ballad it double she sense of woe and bring home the clinging fear she feel that if she could weep she might live but otherwise she heart would burst and after hour and hour of that torture which burn the name of woman in

and the crackling of the wood she see he drag himself with he hand across the floor only to be beat back by a solid wall of flame black bart crouch beside he and would not leave he doomed master fascinate by the rage fire the black stallion satan would break from the shed and rush into the flame -- and so the inseparable three must have perish together why do not you speak kate call she

conviction with it he know that the faith of lone rider to each other be a inviolable bond accordingly he follow at the heel of the other man into the outside room so long old timer he call slapping silent on the shoulder i 'll be seein ' you agin before long calder 's man look up with curious eye hardy watch silent swing onto he horse and gallop down the street then he go hurriedly back to he office once inside he drop into the big swivel-chair bury he face in he arm and weep like a child chapter xii partner dust powdered he hat and clothes as tex calder trot he horse north across the hill he face be a sickly gray and he black hair might have be a eighteenth century wig so thoroughly be it disguise it have be a long ride many a long mile wound back behind he and still the cattle pony with hang head stick to its task now he be draw out on a highland and below he stretch the light yellow-green of the willow of the bottom land he halt he pony and swing a leg over the horn of he saddle then he roll a cigarette and while he inhale it in long puff he scan the tree narrowly mile across and stretch east and west farther than he eye could reach extend the willow somewhere in that wilderness be the gang of jim silent a army corps might have be easily conceal there if he be not utterly discourage in the beginning of he search it be merely because the ranger of the hill and plain be teach patience almost as soon as they learn to ride a horse he survey the yellow-green forest calmly in the west the low hanging sun turn crimson and bulge at the side into a clumsy elipse he start down the slope at the same dog-trot which the pony have keep up all day just before he reach the skirt of the tree he bring he horse to a sudden halt and throw back he head it seem to he that he hear a faint whistle he could not be sure it be so far off and unlike any whistle he have ever hear before that he half guess it to be the movement of a breeze through the willow but the wind be hardly strong enough to make this sound for a full five minute he listen without move he horse then come the thing for which he wait a phrase of melody undoubtedly from human lip what puzzle he most be the nature of the music as he ride closer to the tree it grow clearer it be unlike any song he have ever hear it be a strange improvisation with a touch of both melancholy and savage exultation run through it calder find himself nod in sympathy with the irregular rhythm it grow so clear at last that he mark with some accuracy the direction from which it come if this be silent 's camp it must be strongly guard and he should approach the place more cautiously than he could possibly do on a horse accordingly he dismount throw the rein over the pony 's head and start on through the willow the whistle become louder and louder he move stealthily from tree to tree for he have not the least idea when he would run across a guard the whistle cease but the marshal be now so near that he could follow the original direction without much trouble in a few moment he might distinguish the sound of voice if there be two or three man in the camp he might be able to surprise they and make he arrest if the outlaw be many at least he could lie low near the camp and perhaps learn the plan of the gang he work he way forward more and more carefully at one place he think a shadowy figure slip through the brush a short distance away he poise he gun but lower it again after a moment 's thought it must have be a stir of shadow no human being could move so swiftly or so noiselessly nevertheless the sight give he such a start that he proceed with even greater caution he be crouch close to the ground every inch of it he scan carefully before he set down a foot fearful of the crack of a fall twig like most man when they hunt he begin to feel that something follow he he try to argue the think out of he brain but it persist and grow stronger half a dozen time he whirl suddenly with he revolver poise at last he hear a stamp which could come from nothing but the hoof of a horse the sound dispel he fear in another moment he would be in sight of the camp do you figger you 'll find it ask a quiet voice behind he he turn and look into the steady muzzle of a colt behind that revolver be a thin handsome face with a lock of jet black hair fall over the forehead calder know man and now he feel a strange absence of any desire to attempt a gun-play i be just take a stroll through the willow he say with a mighty attempt at carelessness oh say the other it appear to I you be sort of huntin ' for something you be head straight for my hoss calder strive to find some way out he could not there be no waver in the hand that hold that black gun the brown eye be decidedly discourage to any attempt at a surprise he feel helpless for the first time in he career go over to he bart say the gentle voice of the stranger stand fast the last two word direct to calder come with a metallic hardness for the marshal start as a great black dog slip from behind a tree and slunk towards he this be the shadow which move more swiftly and noiselessly than a human be keep back that damned wolf he say desperately he be not goin ' to hurt you say the calm voice jest toss you gun to the ground there be nothing else for it calder drop he weapon with the butt towards whistle dan bring it here bart say the latter the big animal lower he head still keep he green eye upon calder take up the revolver in he white fang and glide back to he master jest turn you back to I a ' keep you hand clear of you body say dan calder obey sweating with shame he feel a hand pat he pocket lightly in search for a hidden weapon and then with he head slightly turn he sense the fact that dan be drop he revolver into its holster he whirl and drive he clenched fist straight at dan 's face what happen then he would never forget to the end of he life calder 's weapon still hang in dan 's right hand but the latter make no effort to use it he drop the gun and as calder 's right arm shoot out it be catch at the wrist and jerk down with a force that jar he whole body down bart shout dan the great wolf check in the midst of he leap and drop whine with eagerness at calder 's foot at the same time the marshal 's left hand be seize and whip across he body he wrench away with all he force he might as well have struggle with steel manacle he be helpless stare into eye which now glint with a yellow light that send a cold wave tingle through he blood the yellow gleam die he hand be loose but he make no move to spring at dan 's throat chill horror have take the place of he shame and the wolf-dog still whine at he foot with lip grin back from the long white tooth who in the name of god be you he gasp and even as he speak the truth come to he -- the whistle -- the panther-like speed of hand -- whistle dan barry the other frown if you do not know my name why be you trailin ' I i be not after

younger git down bart stand behind I the dog obey sullenly i have hear a pile of man talk about you tex calder they hand and they eye meet there be a mutual respect in the glance a ' i be a pile sorry for this he pick up the gun from the ground and extend it butt first to the marshal who restore it slowly to the holster it be the first time it have ever be force from he grasp who be it you talk about a while ago ask dan jim silent dan instinctively drop he hand back to he revolver the tall man the one you fight with in morgan 's place the unpleasant gleam return to dan 's eye i think there be only one reason why he should die but now i see there be a heap of 'em calder be all business how long have you be here he ask about a day have you see anything of silent here among the willow no do you think he be still here yes why i dunno i 'll stay here till i find he among the tree or he break away into the open how 'll you know when he leave the willow whistle dan be puzzle i dunno he answer somethin' will tell I when he get far away from I -- he a ' he man it be a inner sense eh like the smell of the bloodhound say calder but he eye be strangely serious this day 's about do he go on have you any objection to I camp with you here not a cowpuncher within five hundred mile but would be glad of such redoubted company they go back to calder 's horse we can start for my clearing say dan bart 'll bring the hoss fetch he in the wolf take the dangling bridle rein and lead on the cowpony calder observe he performance with start eye but he be averse to ask question in a few moment they come out on a small open space the ground be cover with a quantity of dry bunch grass which a glorious black stallion be crop now he toss up he head so that some of he long mane fall forward between he ear and at sight of calder he ear drop back and he eye blaze but when dan step from the willow the ear come forward again with a whinny of greet calder watch the beautiful animal with all the enthusiasm of a expert horseman satan be untethered the saddle and bridle lay in a corner of the clearing evidently the horse be a pet and would not leave its master he speak gently and step forward to caress the velvet shine neck but satan snort and start away tremble with excitement how can you keep such a wild fellow as this without hobble he ask calder he be not wild say dan why he will not let I put a hand on he yes he will steady satan the stallion stand motionless with the veritable fire of hell in he eye as calder approach the latter stop not for I he say i would rather rub the moustache of the lion in the zoo than touch that black devil bart at that moment lead in the cowpony and calder start to remove the saddle he have scarcely do so and hobble he horse when he be startle by a tremendous snarl and snort he turn to see the stallion plunge hither and thither striking with he fore-hoof while around he dart in and out under the driving foot spring the great black wolf he tooth clash like steel on steel in another moment they might sink in the throat of the horse calder with a exclamation of horror whip out he revolver but check himself at the very instant of firing the master of the two animal stand with arm fold actually smile upon the fight for god 's sake cry the marshal shoot the damned wolf man or he 'll have you horse by the throat leave 'em be say dan without turn he head satan a ' black bart be not get any other dog a ' hoss to run around with they be jest play a little by way of exercise calder stand agape before what seem the incarnate fury

join he the marshal 's mind be too full for speech but now and again he turn a long glance of wonder upon the stallion or black bart in the same silence they sit under the last light of the sunset and eat they supper calder with head bent ponder over the man of mystery and he two tame animal tame not one of the three be tame the man least of all he see dan pause from he eat to stare with wide vacant eye among the tree the wolf-dog approach look up in he master 's face whine softly and get no response go back to he place and lay down he eye never move from dan still he stare among the tree

interpretation of the vast space of the mountain of the pitiless desert of the limitless silence and the whistler be a understanding part of the whole he become aware of a black shadow behind the musician it be satan who rest he nose on the shoulder of the master without cease he whistle dan raise a hand touch the small muzzle and satan go at once to a side of the clearing and lay down it be almost as if the two have say good-night calder could stand it no longer dan i have get to talk to you he begin the whistle cease the wide brown eye turn to he fire away -- partner ay they have eat together by the same fire -- they have watch the come of the night -- they have shake hand in friendship -- they be partner he know deep in he heart that no human being could ever be the actual comrade of this man this lord of the voiceless desert need no human companionship yet as the marshal glance from the black shadow of satan to the gleaming eye of bart and then to the visionary face of barry he feel that he have be admit by whistle dan into the mysterious company the thought stir he deeply it be as if he have make a alliance with the wander wind why he have be accept he could not dream but he have hear the word partner and he know it be mean after all stranger thing than this happen in the mountain-desert where man be greater and convention less a single word have be know to estrange lifelong comrade a single evening beside a camp-fire have change foe to partner calder draw he mind back to business with a great effort there be one thing you do not know about jim silent a reward of ten thousand dollar lie on he head the notice be not post yet whistle dan shrug he shoulder i be not after money he answer calder frown he do not appreciate a bluff look here he say if we

know more than the name of half the man who sit around the smoky fire they be eager to forget the past and the only allusion to former time come in chance phrase which they let fall at rare interval when they tell a anecdote they erase all name by instinct they would begin : i hear about a feller over to the circle y outfit that be once ridin ' -- etc as a rule they themselves be that feller over

in the whole world for he and I chapter xvi the three of we in the clearing of whistle dan and tex calder the marshal have turn into he blanket once more there be no thought of sleep in dan 's mind when the heavy breathing of the sleeper begin he rise and commence to pace up and down on the farther side of the open space two pair of glowing eye follow he in every move black bart who trail he up and down during the first few turn he make now sit down and watch he master with a wistful gaze the black stallion who lay more like a dog than a horse on the ground keep he ear prick forwards as if expect some order once or twice he whinny very softly and finally dan sit down beside satan he shoulder lean against the satiny side and he arm fling out along the stallion 's back several time he feel hot breath against he cheek as the horse turn a curious head towards he but he pay no attention even when the stallion whinny a question in he ear in he heart be a numb strange feeling which make he weak he be even blind to the fact that black bart at last slip into the shadow of the willow presently something cold touch he chin he find himself stare into the yellow-green eye of black bart who pant from he run and now drop from he mouth something which fall into dan 's lap it be the glove of kate cumberland in the grasp of he long nervous finger how small it be and yet the hand which have wrinkle the leather be strong enough to hold the heart of a man he slip and catch the shaggy black head of bart between he hand the wolf know -- in some mysterious way he know the touch of sympathy unnerve he all he sorrow and he weakness burst on he soul in a single wave a big tear strike the shine nose of the wolf bart he whisper do you figger on plumb bustin ' my heart pal to avoid those large melancholy eye bart press he head inside of he master 's arm delilah whisper dan after that not a sound come from the three the horse the dog or the man black bart curl up at the foot of he master and seem to sleep but every now and then a ear raise or a eye twitch open he be on guard against a danger which he do not understand the horse also with a high head scan the circle willow alert but the man for whom the stallion and the wolf watch give no heed to either there be a vacant and dreamy expression in he eye as if he be search he own inner heart and find there the greatest enemy of all all night they sit in this manner silent moveless the animal watch against the world the man watch against himself before dawn he rouse himself suddenly cross to the sleep marshal and touch he on the arm it be time we hit the trail he say as calder sit up in the blanket what be happen be not it we job to comb the willow silent be not in the willow calder start to he foot how do you know they be not close to we that be all i know tex smile incredulously i suppose he say good humouredly that you _ instinct _ bring you this message instinct repeat dan blankly i dunno calder grow serious we 'll take a chance that you may be right at least we can ride down the river bank and see if there be any fresh track in the sand if silent start this morning i have a idea he 'll head across the river and line out for the railroad in twenty minute they breakfast be eat and they be in the saddle the sun have not yet rise when they come out of the willow to the broad shallow basin of the river in spring when the snow of the mountain melt that river fill from bank to bank with a yellow torrent at the dry season of the year it be a dirty little creek meander through the sand down the bank they ride at a sharp trot for a mile and a half until black bart who scout ahead of they at he glide wolf-trot come to a abrupt stop dan speak to satan and the stallion break into a swift gallop which leave the pony of tex calder labor in the rear when they draw rein beside the wolf they find seven distinct track of horse which go down the bank of the river and cross the basin calder turn with a wide-eyed amazement to dan you be right again he say not without a touch of vexation in he voice but the dog stop at these track how do he know we be hunting for silent 's crew i dunno say dan maybe he jest suspect they can not have a long start of we say calder let 's hit the trail well get they before night no say dan we will not why will not we i have see silent 's hoss and i have ride he if the rest of he gang have the same kind of hoss flesh you c 'n never catch he with that cayuse of yours maybe not today say calder but in two day we 'll run he down seven horse can not travel as two in a long chase they start out across the basin keep to the track of silent 's horse it be the marshal 's idea that the outlaw would head on a fairly straight line for the railroad and accordingly when they lose the track of the seven horse they keep to this direction twice during the day they verify they course by information receive once from a range rider and once from a man in a dusty buck-board both of these have sight the fast travel band but each have see it pass a hour or two before calder and dan arrive such tiding encourage the marshal to keep he horse at a increase speed but in the middle of the afternoon though black satan show little or no sign of fatigue the cattle-pony be nearly blow and they be force to reduce they pace to the ordinary dog-trot chapter xvii the panther 's paw evening come and still they have not sight the outlaw as dark fall they draw near a house snuggle away among a group of cottonwood here they determine to spend the night for calder 's pony be now almost exhaust a man of fifty come from the house in answer to they call and show they the way to the horse-shed while they unsaddle they horse he tell they he name be sam daniel yet he evince no curiosity as to the identity of he guest and they volunteer no information he eye linger long and fondly over the exquisite line of satan from behind from the side and in front he view the stallion while dan rub down the leg of he mount with a care which be most foreign to the range finally the cattleman reach out a hand toward the smoothly muscle shoulder it be calder who stand nearest and he

but i 'll stack old mike agin the best of they a ' there be a dog along with the hoss -- a dog that be the nearest to a wolf of any i ever see there be a sudden change in buck -- a change to be sense rather than definitely note with the eye it be a stiffening of he body -- a alertness of which he be at pain to make no show for almost immediately he begin to whistle softly idly he eye rove carelessly across the wall while he tilted back in he chair dan drop he hand close to the butt of he gun instantly the eye of buck flash down and center on dan for a instant of keen scrutiny certainly buck have connect that mention of the black horse and the wolf-dog with a disturbing idea when they go to they room -- a room in which there be no bed and they have to roll down they blanket on the floor -- dan open the window and commence to whistle one of he own wild tune it seem to calder that there be a break in that music here and there and a few note group together like a call in a moment a shadowy figure leap through the window and black bart land on the floor with soft padding foot recover from he start calder curse softly what be the main idea he ask dan make a signal for a lower tone there be not no idea he answer but these daniels people -- do you know anything about they no why they interest I that be all anything wrong i guess not why do you whistle for this infernal wolf it make I nervous to have he around get out bart the wolf turn a languid eye upon the marshal let he be say dan i do not feel no way nacheral without havin ' bart around the marshal make no farther objection and have roll himself in he blanket be almost immediately asleep and breathing heavily the moment dan hear he companion draw breath with a telltale regularity he sit up again in he blanket bart be instantly at he side he pat the shaggy head lightly and point towards the door guard he whisper then he lay down and be immediately asleep bart crouch at he foot with he head point directly at the door in other room there be the sound of the daniels family go to bed -- noise distinctly hear throughout the flimsy frame of the house after that a deep silence fall which last many hour but in that darkest moment which just precede the dawn a light creak come up the hall it be very faint and it occur only at long interval but at the first sound black bart raise he head from he paw and stare at the door with those glowing eye which see in the dark now another sound come still soft regular there be a movement of the door in the pitch dark a man could never have notice it but it be plainly visible to the wolf still more visible when the door finally stand wide be the form of the man who stand in the opening in one hand he carry a lantern thoroughly hood but not so well wrap that it keep back a single ray which flash on a revolver the intruder make a step forward a step as light as the fall of feather but it be not half so stealthy as the movement of black bart as he slink towards the door he have be warn to watch that door but it do not need a warn to tell he that a danger be approach the sleep master in the crouch form of the man in the cautious step he recognize the unmistakable stalk of one who hunt another soft step the man make forward then with appalling suddenness a blacker shadow shoot up from the deep night of the floor and white tooth gleam before the stranger 's face he throw up he hand to save he throat the tooth sink into he arm -- a drive weight hurl he against the wall and then to the floor -- the revolver and the lantern drop clatter and the latter rolling from its wrap flood the room with light but neither man nor wolf utter a sound calder be stand gun in hand but too bewildered to act while dan as if he be play a part long rehearse stand cover the fallen form of buck daniel stand back from he bart he command the wolf slip off a pace whine with horrible eagerness for he have taste blood far away a shout come from sam daniels dan lower he gun stand up he order the big fellow pick himself up and stand against the wall with the blood streaming down he right arm still he say nothing and he keen eye dart from calder to whistle dan give I a strip of that old shirt over there will you tex say dan a ' keep he cover while i tie up he arm before calder could move old daniel appear at the door a heavy colt in he hand for a moment he stand dumbfounded but then with a cry jerk up he gun -- a quick movement but a fraction of a second too slow for the hand of dan dart out and he knuckle strike the wrist of the old cattleman the colt rattle on the floor he lunge after he weapon but the voice of buck stop he short the game 's up dad he growl that older feller be tex calder the name like a blow in the face straighten old daniel and leave

last i use to think there be only two way of handle man -- one with the velvet touch and one with the touch of steel mine have be the way of steel but i begin to see there be a third possibility -- the touch of the panther 's paw -- the velvet with the steel claw hide beneath that be you way and i wonder if it be not the best i think buck daniel would be glad to die for you he turn directly to dan but all this be aside from the point which be that the whole country be full of these silent partner of the outlaw the law play a lone hand in the mountain-desert you have play the lone hand and win twenty time say dan ay but the twenty-first time i may fail the difference between success and failure in this country be just the length of time it take to pull a trigger -- and silent be fast with a gun he be the root of the outlaw power we may kill a hundred man but till he be go we have only mow the weed not pull they but what be the use of talk one second will tell the tale when i stand face to face with jim silent and we go for we six-gun and somewhere between that rise sun and those mountain i 'll find jim silent and the end of thing for one of we he start he cattle-pony into a sudden gallop and they drive on into the bright morning chapter xviii cain hardly a score of mile away jim silent and he six companion top a hill he raise he hand and the other draw rein beside he kate cumberland shift she weight a little to one side of the saddle to rest and look down from the crest on the sweep of country below a mile away the railroad make a streak of silver light across the brown range and directly before they stand the squat station-house with red-tiled roof just before the house a slightly broader streak of that gleaming light show the position of the siding rail she turn she head towards the outlaw they be listen to the final direction of they chief and the darkly intent face tell they own story she know from what she have gather of they casual hint that this be to be the scene of the train hold-up it seem impossible that this little group of man could hold the great fabric of a train with all its score of passenger at they mercy in spite of herself half she heart wish they success there be terry jordan forgetful of the wound in he arm shorty rhinehart he saturnine face longer and more calamitous than ever hal purvi grin and nod he head bill kilduff with he heavy jaw set like a bull dog 's lee haine with a lock of tawny hair blow over he forehead smile faintly as he listen to silent as if he hear a girl tell a story of love and finally jim silent himself huge solemn confident she begin to feel that these six man be worth six hundred she hate they for some reason she fear they for other but the brave blood of joe cumberland be thick in she and she love the danger of the coming moment they plan be finally agree upon they mask arrange and after haine have tie a similar visor over kate 's face they start down the hill at a swing gallop in front of the house of the station-agent they draw up and while the other be at they horse lee haine dismount and rap loudly at the door it be open by a grey-bearded man smoking a pipe haine cover he he toss up he hand and the pipe drop from he mouth who be in the house here with you ask haine not a soul stammer the man if you be lookin ' for money you c 'n run through the house you will not find a thing worth takin ' i do not want money i want you say haine and immediately explain you be perfectly safe all you have to do be to be oblige as for the money you just throw open that switch and flag the train when she roll along in a few moment we 'll take care of the rest you do not have to keep you hand up the hand come down slowly for a brief instant the agent survey haine and the group of mask man who sit they horse a few pace away and then without a word he pick up he flag from behind the door and walk out of the house throughout the affair he never utter a syllable haine walk up to the head of the siding with he while he open the switch and accompany he back to the point opposite the station-house to see that he give the stop signal correctly in the meantime two of the other outlaw enter the little station bind the telegrapher hand and foot and shatter he instrument that would prevent the send of any call for help after the hold-up purvi and jordan -lrb- since terry could shoot with he left hand in case of need -rrb- go to the other side of the track and lay down against the grade it be they business to open fire on the top of the window as the train draw to a stop that would keep the passenger inside the other four be distribute along the side nearest to the station-house shorty rhinehart and bill kilduff be to see that no passenger break out from the train and attempt a flank attack haine would attend to have the fire box of the engine flood for the crack of the safe silent carry the stick of dynamite now the long wait begin there be a dreamlike quality about bright morning in the open country and everything seem unreal to kate it be impossible that tragedy should come on such a day the moment steal on she see silent glance twice at he watch and scowl evidently the train be late and possibly they would give up the attempt then a light humming catch she ear she hold she breath and listen again it be unmistakable -- a slight thing -- a tremor to be feel rather than hear she see haine peer under shaded eye far down the track and follow the direction of he gaze she see a tiny spot of haze on the horizon the tiny puff of smoke develop to a deeper louder note the station-agent take he place on the track now the train bulk big the engine waver slightly to the unevenness of the road bed the flag of the station-agent move kate close she eye and set she tooth there be a rumble and puff and a mighty grind -- a shout somewhere -- the rattle of a score of pistol shot -- she open she eye to see the train roll to a stop on the siding directly before she kilduff and shorty rhinehart crouch against the grade be splinter the window one by one with nicely place shot the baggage-car be farther up the siding than silent calculate he and haine now run towards the head of the train the fireman and engineer jump from they cab hold they arm stiffly above they head and haine approach with poise revolver to make they flood the fire box in this way the train would be delay for some time and before it could send out the alarm the bandit would be far from pursuit haine have already reach the locomotive and silent be run towards the first baggage-car when the door of that car slide open and at the entrance appear two man with rifle at they shoulder as they open fire silent pitch to the ground kate set she tooth and force she eye to stay open even as the outlaw fall he revolver speak and one of the man throw up he hand with a yell and pitch out of the open door he companion still keep he post pump shot at the prone figure twice more the muzzle of silent 's gun jerk up and the second man crumple on the floor of the car a great hissing and a jet cloud of steam announce that haine have succeed in flood the fire box silent climb into the first baggage-car step as he do so on the limp body of the well fargo agent who lay on the road bed a moment later he fling out the body of the second messenger the man flop on the ground heavily face downward and then -- greatest horror of all -- drag himself to he hand and knee and begin to crawl laboriously kate run and drop to she knee beside he be you hurt badly she plead where where he sag to the ground and lay on he left side breathing heavily where be the wound she repeat he attempt to speak but only a bloody froth come to he lip that be sufficient to tell she that he have be shoot through the lung she tear open he shirt and find two purple spot high on the chest one to the right and one to the leave from that on the left run a tiny trickle of blood but that on the right be only a small puncture in the midst of a bruise he be far past all help speak to I she plead he eye roll and then check on she face do for he say in a horrible whisper that devil do I kid -- cut out -- this life i have play this game -- myself -- a ' now -- i be goin ' -- to hell for it a great convulsion twist he face what can i do cry kate tell the world -- i die -- game he body writhe and in the last agony he hand close hard over hers it be like a silent farewell that strong clasp a great hand catch she by the shoulder and jerk she to she foot the charge be goin ' off jump for it shout silent in she ear she spring up and at the same time there be a great boom from within the car the side bulge out -- a section of the top lift and fall back with a crash -- and silent run back into the smoke haine purvi and kilduff be instantly at the car take the ponderous little canvas sack of coin as they chief hand they out within two minute after the explosion ten small sack be deposit in the saddlebag on the horse which stand before the station-house silent 's whistle call in terry jordan and shorty rhinehart -- a sharp order force kate to climb into she saddle -- and the train robber strike up the hillside at a racing pace a confused shouting rise behind they rifle commence to crack where some of the passenger have take up the weapon of the dead guard but the bullet fly wide and the little troop be soon safely out of range on the other side of the hill-top they change they course to the right for half a hour the killing pace continue and then as there be not a sign of immediate chase the lone rider draw down to a soberer pace silent call : keep bunch behind I we be head for the old salton place -- a ' a long rest chapter xix real man some people point out that sheriff gus morri have never make a single important arrest in the ten year during which he have hold office and there be a few slanderer who speak insinuatingly of the manner in which the lone rider flourish in morri 's domain these knocker however be vote down by the vast majority who swear that the sheriff be the finest fellow who ever throw leg over saddle they like he for he inexhaustible good-nature the mellow baritone in which he sing the range song at any one 's request and perhaps more than all for the very laxness with which he conduct he work they have have enough of the old school of sheriff who live a few month gun in hand and die fight from the saddle the office have never seem desirable until gus morri run for it and smile he way to a triumphant election before he career as a office-holder begin he run a combined general merchandise store saloon and hotel that be to say he run the hostelry in name the real executive head general manager clerk bookkeeper and cook and sometimes even bartender be he daughter jacqueline she find the place only a saloon and a poorly patronize one at that she unaided energy gradually make it into a hotel restaurant and store

jacqueline out of the stable behind this hostelry dan and tex calder walk on the evening of the train robbery they have reach the place of the hold-up a full two hour after silent 's crew depart and the fireman and engineer have be work frantically during the interim to clean out the soaked fire box and get up steam again tex look at the two dead body speak to the conductor and then cut short the voluble explanation of a score of passenger by turn he horse and ride away follow by dan all that day he be gloomily silent it be a shrewd blow at he reputation for the outlaw have actually carry out the robbery while he be on they trail not till they come out of the horse-shed after stable they horse do he speak freely dan he say do you know anything about sheriff gus morri no then listen to this and salt every word away i be a officer of the law but i will not tell that to morris i hope he do not know I if he do it will spoil we game i be almost certain he be play a close hand with the lone rider i 'll wager he would rather see a stick of dynamite than a marshal remember when we get in that place that we be not after jim silent or any one else we be simply travel cowboy no question i expect to learn something about the location of silent 's gang while we be here but we 'll never find out except by hint and chance remark we have to watch morri like hawk if he suspect we he 'll find a way to let silent know we be here and then the hunter will be hunt in the house they find a dozen cattleman sit down at the table in the dining-room as they enter the room the sheriff who sit at the

peculiar fascination at dan who start to speak again he voice have change -- not greatly for its pitch be the same and the drawl be the same -- but there be a purr in it that make every man stiffen in

not a breath be draw in the room hand remain frozen in air in the midst of a gesture lip which have part to speak do not close the steady voice of the clock break into the silence -- a die space between every tick for the second time in he life tex calder know fear he see no mere man before he but he own destiny and he know that if he stand before those glare eye another minute he would become like poor sandy a few minute before -- a white-faced palsied coward the shame of the thought give he power silent he say there be a quick end to the longest trail because -- he hand dart down no eye could follow the lightning speed with which he whip out he revolver and fan it but by a mortal fraction of a second the convulsive jerk of silent 's hand be faster still two shot follow -- they be rather like one drawn-out report the woodwork splintered above the outlaw 's head tex calder seem to laugh but he lip make no sound he pitch forward on he face he fire that bullet say silent after mine hit he then he leap back through the door keep 'em back one minute lee a ' then after I he say as he run haine stand in the door with fold arm he know that no one would dare to move a hand two

clear of its holster when whistle dan 's weapon speak haine with a curse clap he left hand over he wounded right forearm and then reach after he weapon as it clatter to the floor once more he be too

terror-stricken guard to save he from the most horrible of death then come fate and tear he away and give he to the liberty of the boundless hill fate in the person of this slender sombre man he stare at dan with awe at the top of a hill he companion draw rein reel in the saddle with the suddenness of the halt however in such a horseman this could not be it must be merely a freak feature of he ride move say dan he breath come in pants line out and get to she to who say haine utterly bewildered delilah what damn you she be waitin ' for you in the name of god barry why do you talk like this after you have save I from hell he stretch out he hand eagerly but dan rein satan back keep you hand i hate you worse 'n hell there be not room enough in the world for we both if you want to thank I do it by keepin ' out of my path because the next time we meet you be goin ' to die haine it be writ in a book now feed you hoss the spur and run for kate cumberland but remember -- i be goin ' to get you again if i can kate -- begin haine she send you for I only the yellow blaze eye make answer and the wail of a coyote far away on the shadowy hill kate cry haine again but now there be a world of new meaning in he voice he swing he horse and spur down the slope at the next hill-crest he turn in the saddle see the motionless rider still outline against the sky and bring the bay to a halt he be greatly trouble for a reason mysterious and far beyond the horizon of he knowledge dan be surrender kate cumberland to he he be do it while he still love she mutter haine and be i cur enough to take she from he after he have save I from god know what he turn he horse to ride back but at that moment he catch the weird the unearthly note of dan 's whistle there be both melancholy and gladness in it the storm wind run on the hill and exult in the blind terror of the night have such a song as this to sing if he be a man haine argue briefly with himself i would do it but he be not a man he be a devil he have no more heart than the wolf which own he as master shall i give a girl like kate cumberland to that wild panther she be mine -- all mine once more he turn he horse and this time gallop steadily on into the night when haine drop out of sight dan 's whistle stop he look up to the pitiless glitter of the star he look down to the sombre sweep of black hill the wind be like a voice say over and over again : failure everything be lose he slip from the saddle and take off he coat from he left shoulder the blood well slowly steadily he tear a strip from he shirt and attempt to make a bandage but he could not manage it with one hand the world throng with hostile force eager to hunt he to the death he need all he strength and now that be ebb from a wound which a child could have staunch for he but where could he find even a friendly child truly all be lose the satyr or the black panther once have less need of man 's help than have dan but now he be hurt in body and soul that matchless co-ordination of eye with hand and foot be go he see kate smile into the eye of haine he imagine bill kilduff sit on the back of satan control all that glorious force and speed he see hal purvi fight venomously with bart for the mastery which eventually must belong to the man he turn to the wild pair vaguely they sense a danger threaten they master and they eye mourn for he hurt he bury he face on the strong smooth shoulder of satan and groan there come the answer whinny and the hot breath of the horse against the side of he face there be the whine of black bart behind he then the rough tongue of the wolf touch the drip finger then he feel a hot gust of the wolf 's breath against he hand too late he realize what that mean he whirl with a cry of command but the snarl of black bart cut it short the wolf stand bristle tremble with eagerness for the kill he great white fang gleam he snarl shrill and guttural with the frenzy of he desire for he have taste blood dan understand as he stare into the yellow green fury of the wolf 's eye yet he feel no fear only a glory in the fierce silent conflict he could not move the finger of he left hand but those of he right curved stiffen he desire nothing more in the world than the contact with that great bristling black body to leap aside from those ominous tooth to set he finger in the wolf 's throat reason might have tell he the folly of such a strife but all that remain in he mind be the love of combat -- a blind passion he eye glow like those of the wolf yellow fire against the green black bart crouch still lower gathering himself for the spring but he be hold by the man 's yellow gleaming eye they invite the battle fear set its icy hand on the soul of the wolf the man seem to tower up thrice he normal height he voice ring harsh sudden unlike the utterance of man or beast : _ down _ fear conquer black bart the fire die from he eye he body sink as if from exhaustion he crawl on he belly to the foot of he master and whine a unutterable submission and then that hand warm and wet with the thing whose taste set the wolf 's heart on fire with the lust to kill be thrust against he nose he leap back with bare tooth growl horribly the eye command he back command he relentlessly he howl dismally to the senseless star yet he come and once more that hand be thrust against he nose he lick the finger that blood-lust come hotter than before but he fear be greater he lick the strange hand again whine then the master kneel another hand clean and free from that horrible warm wet sign of death fall upon he shaggy back the voice which he know of old come to he blow away the red mist from he soul comfort he poor bart say the voice and the hand go slowly over he head it be not you fault the stallion whinny softly a deep growl form in the throat of the wolf a mighty effort at speech and now like a gleam of light in a dark room dan remember the house of buck daniel there at least they could not refuse he aid he draw on he coat though the effort set he sweating with agony get he foot in the stirrup with difficulty and drag himself to the saddle satan start at a swift gallop faster satan faster partner what a response the strong body settle a little closer to the earth as the stride increase the rhythm of the pace grow quicker smoother there be no adequate phrase to describe the matchless motion and in front -- always just a little in front with the plunge forefoot of the horse seem to threaten he at every stride run black bart with he head turn as if he be the guard and guide of the fugitive dan call and black bart yelp in answer satan toss up he head and neigh as he race along the two reply be like human assurance that there be still a fight chance the steady loss of blood be tell rapidly now he clutch the pommel set he tooth and feel oblivion settle slowly and surely upon he as he sens leave he he note the black outline of the next high range of hill a full ten mile away he only know the pace of satan never slacken there seem no effort in it he be like one of those fabled horse the offspring of the wind and like the wind tireless eternal of motion a longer oblivion fall upon dan as he rouse from it he find himself slip in the saddle he struggle desperately to grasp the saddlehorn and manage to draw himself up again but the warning be sufficient to make he hunt about for some means of make himself more secure in the saddle it be a difficult task to do anything with only one hand but he manage to tie he left arm to the bucking-strap if the end come at least he be sure to die in the saddle vaguely he be aware as he look around that the black hill be no longer in the distance he be among they on go satan he breath be come more and more labor it seem to dan 's dim consciousness that some of the spring be go from that glorious stride which sweep on and on with the slightest undulation like a swallow skim before the wind but so long as strength remain he know that satan would never falter in he pace as the delirium sweep once more shadow-like on he brain he allow himself to fall forward and wind he finger as closely as possible in the thick mane he left arm jerk horribly against the bond black night swallow he once more only he invincible heart keep satan go throughout that last stretch he ear lay flat on he neck lift only when the master mutter and rave in he fever foam fly back against he throat and breast he breath come shorter harder with a rasp but the gibbering voice of he rider urge he on faster and faster they top a small hill and a little to the left and a mile away rise a group of cottonwood and dan recover consciousness know the house of buck he also know that he last moment of consciousness be come surge of sleepy weakness sweep over he brain he could never guide satan to the house bart he call feebly the wolf whine drop back beside he dan point he right arm straight ahead black bart leap high into the air and he shrill yelp tell that he have see the cottonwood and the house dan summon the last of he power and throw the rein over the head of satan take we in bart he say and twist he finger into satan 's mane fall across the saddlehorn satan understand the throwing of the rein as a order to halt come to a sharp stop and the body of the senseless rider sag to one side black bart catch the rein they be bitter and salt with blood of the master he tug hard satan whinny he doubt and the growl of black bart answer half a threat in a moment more they be pick they way through the brush towards the house of buck daniel satan be far go with exhaustion he head droop he leg sprawl with every step he eye be glaze yet he stagger on with the great black wolf pull at the rein there be the salt taste of blood in the mouth of black bart so he stalk on saliva drip from he mouth and he eye glaze with the lust to kill he furious snarl be the threat which urge on the stallion chapter xxvi black bart turn nurse it be old mr daniel who wake first at the sound of scratch and growl she rouse she husband and son and all three go to the door buck in the lead with he six-gun in he hand at sight of the wolf he start back and raise the gun but black bart fawn about he foot do not shoot -- it be a dog a ' there be he master cry sam by the lord they be a dead man tie on that there hoss dan lay on satan half

I with the man he be hurt bad mr daniel run ahead and light a lamp they lay the body carefully upon a bed it make a ghastly sight the bloodless face with the black hair fall wildly across the forehead the mouth loosely open and the lip black with dust dad say buck i think i have see this feller god know if he be livin ' or dead he drop to he knee and press he ear over dan 's heart i can not feel no motion ma get that hand mirror -- she have it already and now hold it close to the lip of the wounded man when she draw it away they three head draw close together they be a mist on it he be livin ' cry buck it be not nothing say sam the glass be not quite clear that be all mr daniel remove the last doubt by run she finger across the surface of the glass it leave a unmistakable mark they waste no moment then they bring hot and cold water wash out he wound cleanse away the blood and while mr daniel and she husband fix the bandage buck pound and rub the limp body to restore the circulation in a few minute he effort be reward by a great sigh from dan he shout in triumph and then : by god it be whistlin ' dan barry it be say sam buck they be be devil workin ' tonight it sure take more 'n one man to nail he this way they fall to work frantically there be a perceptible pulse the breathing be faint but steady and a touch of color come in the face he arm will be all right in a few day say mr daniel but he may fall into a fever he be turnin ' he head from side to side and talkin ' what be he sayin ' buck he be sayin ' : ` faster satan ' that be the hoss interpret sam ` hold we straight

be certain dan do not guide he all the way how do the wind find its way say buck it be the wolf that bring dan here but standin ' here talkin ' will not tell we how let 's go out a ' fix up satan it be by no mean a easy task as they approach the horse he heave himself up snort and stand with leg brace and pendant head even he eye be glaze with exhaustion but behind they it be easy to guess the dauntless anger which rage against these intruder yet he would have be helpless against they it be black bart who interfere at this point he stand before they he hair bristle and he tooth bare sam suggest : leave the door of the house open a ' let he hear whistlin ' dan 's voice it be do at once the delirious voice of dan steal out to they faintly the wolf turn he head to satan with a plaintive whine as if ask why the stallion remain there when that voice be audible then he race for the open door and disappear into the house hurry in buck call sam maybe the wolf 'll scare ma they run inside and find black bart on the bed straddle the body of whistle dan and growl at poor mr daniel who crouch in a corner of the room it require patient work before he be convince that they actually mean no harm to he master what be the reason of it query sam helplessly the damn wolf let we take dan off the hoss without makin ' any fuss sure he do assented buck but he be not sure of I yet a ' every time he come near I he send the cold chill up my back have decide that he might safely trust they to touch dan 's body the great wolf go the round and sniff they carefully he hair bristle and the forbid growl linger in he throat in the end he apparently decide that they might be tolerate though he must keep a eye upon they action so he sit down beside the bed and follow with a anxious eye every movement of mr daniel the man go back to the stallion he still stand with leg brace far apart and head hang low another mile of that long race and he would have drop dead beneath he rider nevertheless at the come of the stranger he rear up he head a little and try to run away buck catch the dangling rein near the bit satan attempt to strike out with he forehoof it be a movement as clumsy and slow as the blow of a child and buck easily avoid it realize he helplessness satan whinny a heart-breaking appeal for help to he unfailing friend black bart the wail of the wolf answer dolefully from the house good lord groan buck now we 'll have that black devil on we hand again no we will not chuckle sam the wolf will not leave dan come on along old hoss nevertheless it require hard labor to urge and drag the stallion to the stable at the end of that time they have the saddle off and a manger full of fodder before he they go back to the house with the impression of have do a day 's work which it show the fool nature of a hoss moralize sam that stallion would be willin ' to lay right down and die for the man that be jest ride he up to the front door of death but he wish everlastingly that

to rise among separate group where the crime attribute to whistle dan barry be number and talk over it surprise buck to discover the number who believe the story which he and haine have tell they make a strong faction though manifestly in the minority hardly a man who do not from time to time nervously fumble the butt of he six-gun as three o'clock draw on the talk grow less and less it break out now and again in little uneasy burst someone would tell a joke half hysterical laughter would greet it and die suddenly as it begin these be all hard-faced man of the mountain-desert warrior of the frontier what unnerve they be the strangeness of the thing which be about to happen the big wooden clock on the side of the long barroom strike once for half-past two all talk cease man seem unwilling to meet each other 's eye some of they drum lightly on the top of the bar and strove to whistle but the only sound that come through they dry lip be a whispering rush of breath a grey-haired cattle ranger commence to hum a tune very low but distinct finally a man rise stride across the room shake the old fellow by the shoulder with brutal violence and with a curse order he to stop he damned death song everyone draw a long breath of relief the minute hand creep on towards three o'clock now it be twenty minute now fifteen now ten now five then a clatter of hoof a heavy step on the porch and the giant form of jim silent block the door he hand rest on the butt of he two gun buck guess at the tremendous strength of that grip the eye of the outlaw dart about the room and every glance drop before he with the exception of buck 's fascinate stare for he see a brand on the face of the great long rider it lay in no one thing it be not the unusual hollowness of eye and cheek it be not the feverish brightness of he glance it be something which include all of these it be the fear of death by night he hand fall away from the gun he cross the room to the bar and nod he head at the bartender drink he say and he voice be only a whisper without body of sound the bartender with pasty face round and blank do not move either he hand or he fascinate eye there be a twitch of the outlaw 's hand and naked steel gleam instantly revolver show in every hand a youngster moan the sound seem to break the charm silent put back he great head and burst into a deep-throated laughter the gun whirl in he hand and the butt crash heavily on the bar drink damn you he thunder step up a ' drink to the health of jim silent the waver line slowly approach the bar silent pull out he other gun and shove they both across the bar take 'em he say i do not want 'em to get restless a ' muss up this joint the bartender take they as if they be cover with some deadly poison and the outlaw stand unarmed it come suddenly to buck what the whole maneuver mean he give away he gun in order to tempt someone to arrest he better the hand of the law than the yellow glare of those follow eye yet not a man move to apprehend he unarmed he still seem more dangerous than six common man the long rider jerk a whisky bottle upside down over a glass half the contents splash across the bar he turn and face the crowd he hand drip with the spill liquor whose liquorin ' he bellow not a sound answer he damn you yaller soul then all by myself i 'll drink to -- he stop short he eye wild he head tilted back one by one the cowpuncher give back foot by foot softly until they stand close to the opposite wall of the saloon all the bar be leave to silent the whisky glass slip from he hand and crash on the floor in he face be the meaning of the sound he hear and now it come to they own ear -- a whistle thin with distance but clear only phrase at first but now it rise more distinct the song of the untame the terror and beauty of the mountain-desert a plea and a threat the clock strike sharp hurry brazen -- one two three before the last quick unmusical chime die out black bart stand in the entrance to the saloon he eye be upon jim silent who stretch out he arm on either side and grip the edge of the bar yet even when the wolf glide silently across the room and crouch before the bandit at watch he lip grin
