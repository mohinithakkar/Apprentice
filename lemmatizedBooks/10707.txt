who have hear vaguely of and rather look down upon such new-fangled toy as radium and thorium and helium and argon -- for the latest astonishing development in the theory of radio-activity have bring sir angus mccurdie he world-wide fame -- say somewhat ironically : if the experiment be so important why do not you lock yourself up with you test tube and electric battery and finish they alone man say mccurdie bend across the carriage and speak with a curious intensity of voice d'ye know i would give a hundred pound to be able to answer that question what do you mean ask the professor startle i

christmas as to whose irritating and meaningless annoyance i cordially agree with you among stranger than among my married sister ' numerous and nerve-racking family sir angus mccurdie the hard metallic apostle of radio-activity glance for a moment out of the window at the gray frost-bitten field then he say : i be a widower my wife die many year ago and thank god we have no child i generally spend christmas alone he look out of the window again professor biggleswade suddenly remember the popular story of the great scientist 's antecedent and reflect that as mccurdie have once run a barefoot urchin through the glasgow mud he be likely to have little kith or kin he himself envy mccurdie he be always pray to be deliver from he sister and nephew and niece whose embarrassing demand no calculated coldness could repress child be the root of all evil say he happy the man who have he quiver empty sir angus mccurdie do not reply at once when he speak again it be with reference to they prospective host i meet deverill say he at the royal society 's soirée this year one of my assistant be demonstrate a peculiar property of thorium and deverill seem interested i ask he to come

interested in you conversation say he and as you have be frank i 'll be frank too i know mr deverill 's mother lady carstair very well year ago and of course mr deverill when she be a child deverill i

celebrity hunter in england she inherit the faculty from she mother who entertain the whole world we be sure to find archbishop and eminent actor and illustrious divorcées ask to meet we that be one thing but why i who loathe country house party and child and christmas as much as biggleswade be go down there to-day i can no more explain than you can it be a devilish odd coincidence the three man look at one another suddenly mccurdie shiver and draw he fur coat around he i 'll thank you say he to shut that window it be shut say doyne it be just uncanny say mccurdie look from one to the other what ask doyne nothing if you do not feel it there do seem to be a sudden draught say professor biggleswade but as both window and door be shut it could only be imaginary it be not imaginary muttered mccurdie then he laugh harshly my father and mother come from cromarty he say with apparent irrelevance that be the highland say the professor ay say mccurdie lord doyne say nothing but tug at he moustache and look out of the window as the frozen meadow and bit of river and willow race past a dead silence fall on they mccurdie break it with another laugh and take a whiskey flask from he hand-bag have a nip thanks no say the professor i have to keep to a strict dietary and i only drink hot milk and water -- and of that sparingly i have some in a thermos bottle lord doyne also decline the whiskey mccurdie swallow a dram and declare himself to be better the professor take from he bag a foreign review in which a german sciolist have dare to question he interpretation of a hittite inscription over the man 's ineptitude he fall asleep and snore loudly to escape from he immediate neighborhood mccurdie go to the other end of the seat and face lord doyne who have resume he gold glass and he listless contemplation of obscure actress mccurdie light a pipe doyne another black cigar the train thunder on presently they all lunch together in the restaurant car the window steam but here and there through a wipe patch of pane a white world be reveal the snow be fall as they pass through westbury mccurdie look mechanically for the famous white horse carve into the chalk of the down but it be not visible beneath the thick covering of snow it 'll be just like this all the way to gehenna -- trehenna i mean say mccurdie doyne nod he have do he life 's work amid all extreme fierceness of heat and cold in burn drought in simoon and in icy wilderness and a ray or two more of the pale sun or a flake or two more of the gentle snow of england matter to he but little but biggleswade rub the pane with he table-napkin and gaze apprehensively at the prospect if only this wretched train would stop say he i would go back again and he think how comfortable it would be to sneak home again to he book and thus elude not only the deverill but the christmas jollity of he sister ' family who would think he mile away but the train be time not to stop till plymouth two hundred and thirty-five mile from london and thither be he be relentlessly carry then he quarrel with he food which bring a certain consolation \* \* \* \* \* the train do stop however before plymouth -- indeed before exeter a accident on the line have dislocate the traffic the express be hold up for a hour and when it be permit to proceed instead of thunder on it go cautiously subject to continual stopping it arrive at plymouth two hour late the traveller learn that they have miss the connection on which they have count and that they could not reach trehenna till nearly ten o'clock after weary wait at plymouth they take they seat in the little cold local train that be to carry they another stage on they journey hot-water can put in at plymouth mitigate to some extent the iciness of the compartment but that only last a comparatively short time for soon they be set down at a desolate shelterless wayside junction dump in the midst of a hilly snow-covered waste where they go through another weary wait for another dismal local train that be to carry they to trehenna and in this train there be no hot-water can so that the compartment be as cold as death mccurdie fret and shake he fist in the direction of trehenna and when we get there we have still a twenty mile ' motor drive to foullis castle it be a fool name and we be fool to be go there i shall die of bronchitis wail professor biggleswade a man die when it be appoint for he to die say lord doyne in he tired way and he go on smoking long black cigar it be not the die that worry I say mccurdie that be a mere mechanical process which every organic be from a king to a cauliflower have to pass through it be the be force against my will and my reason to come on this accursed journey which something tell I will become more and more accursed as we go on that be drive I to distraction what will be will be say doyne i can not see where the comfort of that reflection come in say biggleswade and yet you have travel in the east say doyne i suppose you know the valley of the tigri as well as any man living yes say the professor i can say i dig my way from tekrit to bagdad and leave not a stone unexamined perhaps after all doyne remark that be not quite the way to know the east i never want to know the modern east return the professor what be there in it of interest compare with the mighty civilization that have go before mccurdie take a pull from he flask i be glad i thought of have a refill at plymouth say he at last after many stop at little lonely station they arrive at trehenna the guard open the door and they step out on to the snow-covered platform a oil lamp hang from the tiny pent-house roof that structurally be trehenna station they look around at the silent gloom of white undulating moorland and it seem a place where no man live and only ghost could have a bleak and unsheltered be a porter come up and help the guard with the luggage then they realize that the station be build on a small embankment for look over the railing they see below the two great lamp of a motor car a fur-clad chauffeur meet they at the bottom of the stair he clap he hand together and inform they cheerily that he have be wait for four hour it be the bitterest winter in these part within the memory of man say he and he himself have not see snow there for five year then he settle the three traveller in the great roomy tour car cover with a cape-cart hood wrap they up in many rug and start after a few moment the huddle together of they body -- for the professor be a spare man there be room for they all on the back seat -- the pile of rug the serviceable and all but air-tight hood induce a pleasant warmth and a pleasant drowsiness where they be be drive they know not the perfectly upholstered seat ease they limb the easy swinging motion of the car soothe they spirit they feel that already they have reach the luxuriously appoint home which after all they know await they mccurdie no longer rail professor biggleswade forget the danger of bronchitis and lord doyne twist the stump of a black cigar between he lip without any desire to relight it a tiny electric lamp inside the hood make the darkness of the world to right and leave and in front of the talc window still darker mccurdie and biggleswade fall into a doze lord doyne chew the end of he cigar the car speed on through a unseen wilderness suddenly there be a horrid jolt and a lurch and a leap and a rebound and then the car stand still quiver like a ship that have be strike by a heavy sea the three man be pitch and toss and throw sprawl over one another onto the bottom of the car biggleswade scream mccurdie cursed doyne scramble from the confusion of rug and limb and tear open the side of the cape-cart hood jump out the chauffeur have also just leap from he seat it be pitch dark save for the great shaft of light down the snowy road cast by the acetylene lamp the snow have cease fall what be go wrong it sound like the axle say the chauffeur ruefully he unshipp a lamp and examine the car which have wedge itself against a great drift of snow on the off side meanwhile mccurdie and biggleswade have alight yes it be the axle say the chauffeur then we be do remark doyne i be afraid so my lord what be the matter can not we get on ask biggleswade in he querulous voice mccurdie laugh how can we get on with a broken axle the thing 's as useless as a man with a break back gad i be right i say it be go to be a infernal journey the little professor wring he hand but what be to be do he cry tramp it say lord doyne light a fresh cigar it be ten mile say the chauffeur it would be the death of I the professor wail i utterly refuse to walk ten mile through a polar waste with a gouty foot mccurdie declare wrathfully the chauffeur offer a solution of the difficulty he would set out alone for foullis castle -- five mile farther on be a inn where he could obtain a horse and trap -- and would return for the three gentleman with another car in the meanwhile they could take shelter in a little house which they have just pass some half mile up the road this be agree to the chauffeur go on cheerily enough with a lamp and the three traveller with another lamp start off in the opposite direction as far as they could see they be in a long desolate valley a sort of no man 's land deathly silent the eastern sky have clear somewhat and they face a loose rack through which one pale star be dimly visible \* \* \* \* \* i be a man of science say mccurdie as they trudge through the snow and i dismiss the supernatural as contrary to reason but i have highland blood in my vein that play I exasperating trick my reason tell I that this place be only a commonplace moor yet it seem like a valley of bone haunt by malignant spirit who have lure we here to we destruction there be something guide we now it be just uncanny why on earth do we ever come croaked biggleswade lord doyne answer : the koran say ` nothing can befall we but what god have destine for we ' so why worry because i be not a mohammedan retort biggleswade you might be worse say doyne presently the dim outline of the little house grow perceptible a faint light shone from the window it stand unfenced by any kind of hedge or railing a few foot away from the road in a little hollow beneath some rise ground as far as they could discern in the darkness when they draw near the house be a mean dilapidated hovel a gutter candle stand on the inner sill of the small window and afford a vague view into a mean interior doyne hold up the lamp so that its ray fall full on the door as he do so a exclamation break from he lip and he hurry forward follow by the other a man 's body lay huddle together on the snow by the threshold he be dress like a peasant in old corduroy trousers and rough coat and a handkerchief be knot round he neck in he hand he grasp the neck of a broken bottle doyne set the lamp on the ground and the three bent down together over the man close by the neck lay the rest of the broken bottle whose contents have evidently run out into the snow drunk ask biggleswade doyne feel the man and lay he hand on he heart no say he dead mccurdie leap to he full height i tell you the place be uncanny he cry it be fey then he hammer wildly at the door there be no response he hammer again till it rattle this time a faint prolonged sound like the wail of a strange sea-creature be hear from within the house mccurdie turn round he tooth chatter do ye hear that doyne -lrb- illustration : i tell you the place be uncanny -rrb- perhaps it be a dog say the professor lord doyne the man of action push they aside and try the door-handle it yield the door stand open and the gust of cold wind enter the house extinguish the candle within they enter and find themselves in a miserable stone-paved kitchen furnish with poverty-stricken meagreness -- a wooden chair or two a dirty table some broken crockery old cooking utensil a fly-blown missionary society almanac and a fireless grate doyne set the lamp on the table we must bring he in say he they return to the threshold and as they be bend over to grip the dead man the same sound fill the air but this time louder more intense a cry of great agony the sweat drip from mccurdie 's forehead they lift the dead man and bring he into the room and after lay he on a dirty strip of carpet they do they best to straighten the stiff limb biggleswade put on the table a bundle which he have pick up outside it contain some poor provision -- a loaf a piece of fat bacon and a paper of tea as far as they could guess -lrb- and as they learn later they guess rightly -rrb- the man be the master of the house who come home blind drunk from some distant inn have fall at he own threshold and get freeze to death as they could not unclasp he finger from the broken bottleneck they have to let he clutch it as a dead warrior clutch the hilt of he broken sword then suddenly the whole place be rent with another and yet another long soul-piercing moan of anguish there be a second room say doyne point to a door the sound come from there he open the door peep in and then return for the lamp disappear leave mccurdie and biggleswade in the pitch darkness with the dead man on the floor for heaven 's sake give I a drop of whiskey say the professor or i shall faint presently the door open and lord doyne appear in the shaft of light he beckon to he companion it be a woman in childbirth he say in he even tired voice we must aid she she appear unconscious do either of you know anything about such thing they shake they head and the three look at each other in dismay master of knowledge that have win they world-wide fame and honor they stand helpless abashed before this the commonest phenomenon of nature my wife have no child say mccurdie i have avoid woman all my life say biggleswade and i have be too busy to think of they god forgive I say doyne \* \* \* \* \* the history of the next two hour be one that none of the three man ever care to touch upon they do thing blindly instinctively as man do when they come face to face with the elemental a fire be make they know not how water draw they know not whence and a kettle boil doyne accustomed to command direct the other obey at he suggestion they hasten to the wreck of the car and come staggering back beneath rug and travel bag which could supply clean linen and needful thing for amid the poverty of the house they could find nothing fit for human touch or use early they see that the woman 's strength be fail and that she could not live and there in that nameless hovel with death on the hearthstone and death and life hover over the pitiful bed the three great man go through the pain and the horror and squalor of birth and they know that they have never yet stand before so great a mystery with the first wail of the newly bear infant a last convulsive shudder pass through the frame of the unconscious mother then three or four short gasp for breath and the spirit pass away she be dead professor biggleswade throw a corner of the sheet over she face for he could not bear to see it they wash and dry the child as any crone of a midwife would have do and dip a small sponge which have always remain unused in a cut-glass bottle in doyne 's dressing-bag in the hot milk and water of biggleswade 's thermos bottle and put it to he lip and then they wrap he up warm in some of they own woollen undergarment and take he into the kitchen and place he on a bed make of they fur coat in front of the fire as the last piece of fuel be exhaust they take one of the wooden chair and break it up and cast it into the blaze and then they raise the dead man from the strip of carpet and carry he into the bedroom and lay he reverently by the side of he dead wife after which they leave the dead in darkness and return to the living and the three grave man stand over the wisp of flesh that have be bear a male into the world then they task be accomplish reaction come and even doyne who have see death in many land turn faint but the other lose control of they nerve shake like man stricken with palsy suddenly mccurdie cry in a high pitched voice my god do not you feel it and clutch doyne by the arm a expression of terror appear on he iron feature there it be here with we little professor biggleswade sit on a corner of the table and wipe he forehead i hear it i feel it it be like the beating of wing it be the fourth time say mccurdie the first time be just before i accept the deverill ' invitation the second in the railway carriage this afternoon the third on the way here this be the fourth biggleswade pluck nervously at the fringe of whisker under he jaw and say faintly it be the fourth time up to now i think it be fancy i have feel it too say doyne it be the angel of death and he point to the room where the dead man and woman lay for god 's sake let we get away from this cry biggleswade and leave the child to die like the other say doyne we must see it through say mccurdie \* \* \* \* \* a silence fall upon they as they sit round in the blaze with the new-born babe wrap in its odd swaddle clothes asleep on the pile of fur coat and it last until sir angus mccurdie look at he watch good lord say he it be twelve o'clock christmas morning say biggleswade a strange christmas muse doyne mccurdie put up he hand there it be again the beating of wing and they listen like man spellbound mccurdie keep he hand uplift and gaze over they head at the wall and he gaze be that of a man in a trance and he speak : unto we a child be bear unto we a son be give -- doyne spring from he chair which fall behind he with a crash man -- what the devil be you say then mccurdie rise and meet biggleswade 's eye stare at he through the great round spectacles and biggleswade turn and meet the eye of doyne a pulsation like the beating of wing stir the air the three wise man shiver with a queer exaltation something strange mystical dynamic have happen it be as if scale have fall from they eye and they see with a new vision they stand together humbly divest of all they greatness touch one another in the instinctive fashion of child as if seek mutual protection and they look with one accord irresistibly compel at the child at last mccurdie unbent he black brow and say hoarsely : it be not the angel of death doyne but another messenger that draw we here the tiredness seem to pass away from the great administrator 's face and he nod he head with the calm of a man who have come to the quiet heart of a perplexing mystery it be true he murmur unto we a child be bear unto we a son be give unto the three of we biggleswade take off he great round spectacles and wipe they gaspar melchior balthazar but where be the gold frankincense and myrrh in we heart man say mccurdie the babe cry and stretch its tiny limb -lrb- illustration : instinctively they all kneel down -rrb- instinctively they all kneel down together to discover if possible and administer ignorantly to its want the scene have the appearance of a adoration \* \* \* \* \* then these three wise lonely childless man who in furtherance of they own greatness have cut themselves adrift from the sweet and simple thing of life and from the kindly way of they brethren and have grow old in unhappy and profitless wisdom know that a inscrutable providence have lead they as it have lead three wise man of old on a christmas morning long ago to a nativity which should give they a new wisdom a new link with humanity a new spiritual outlook a new hope and when they watch be end they wrap up the babe with precious care and carry he with they a inalienable joy and possession into the great world -lrb- illustration : carry with they a inalienable joy and possession into the great world -rrb- end of the project gutenberg ebook of a christmas mystery by william j locke
