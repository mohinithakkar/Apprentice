damon and delia part the first chapter i _ contain introductory matter _ the race at southampton have for time immemorial constitute a scene of rivalship war and envy all the passion incident to the human frame have here assume as true a scope as in the more noisy and more tragical contention of statesman and warrior here nature have display she most hidden attraction and art have furnish out the artillery of beauty here the coquet have surprise and the love-sick nymph have sap the heart of the unwary swain the scene have be equally seek by the bolder and more haughty as by the timid sex here the foxhunter have seek a new subject of he boast in the _ nonchalance _ of _ dishabille _ the peer have play off the dazzling charm of a coronet and a star and the _ petit maître _ have employ the anxious nicety of dress of all the beauty in this brilliant circle she who be incomparably the most celebrated be the graceful delium she person though not absolutely tall have a air of dignity she form be bewitching and she neck be alabaster she cheek glow with the lovely vermilion of nature she mouth be small and pout she lip be coral and she tooth whiter than the drive snow she forehead be bold high and polish she eyebrow be arched and from beneath they she fine blue eye shine with intelligence and sparkle with heedless gaiety she hair be of the brightest auburn it be in the greatest abundance and when unfettered by the ligament of fashion it flow about she shoulder and she lovely neck it present the most ravishing object that can possibly be imagine with all this beauty it can not be suppose but that delium be follow by a train of admirer the celebrated mr prattle for whom a thousand fair one crack they fan and tear they cap be one of the first to enlist himself among she adorer squire savage the fox-hunter who like hippolitus of old chase the wily fox and timid hare and have never yet acknowledge the empire of beauty be subdue by the artless sweetness of delium nay it have be report that the incomparable lord martin a peer of ten thousand pound a year have make advance to she father it be true he lordship be scarcely four foot three inch in stature he belly be prominent one leg be half a foot shorter and one shoulder half a foot higher than the other he temper be as crooked as he shape the sight of a happy human be would give he the spleen and no mortal man could long reside under the same roof with he but in spite of these trifling imperfection it have be confidently affirm that some of the haughtiest beauty of hampshire would have be proud of he alliance thus assail with all the temptation that human nature could furnish it might naturally be suppose that delium have long since resign she heart but in this conjecture however natural the reader will find himself mistaken she seem as coy as daphne and as cold as diana she divert herself indeed with the insignificant loquaciousness of mr prattle and the aukward gallantry of the squire but she never bestow upon either a serious thought and for lord martin who be indisputably allow to be the best match in the county she could not bear to hear he name with patience and she always turn pale at the sight of he but delium be not destine always to laugh at the dart of cupid mr bridget she wait maid delighted to run over the list of she adorer and she be much more eloquent and more copious upon the subject than we have be when she mistress receive the mention of each with gay indifference mr bridget would close the dialogue and with a sagacious look and a shake of she head would tell the lovely delium that the longer it be before she time come the more surely and the more deeply she would be catch at last and to say truth the wisest philosopher might have join in the verdict of the sage bridget there be a softness in the temper of delium that seem particularly form for the tender passion the voice of misery never assail she ear in vain she purse be always open to the orphan the maim and the sick after read a tender tale of love the intricacy of the princess of cleve the soft distress of sophium western or the more modern story of the sorrow of werter she gentle breast would heave with sigh and she eye suffuse with tear confess a congenial spirit the father of delium -- let the reader drop a tear over this blot in we little narrative -- have once be a tradesman he be naturally phlegmatic methodical and avaricious he ear be form to relish better the hoarse voice of a exchange broker than the finest tone of handel 's organ he find something much more agreeable and interesting in the perusal of he ledger and he day book than in the scene of shakespeare or the elegance of addison with this disposition he have notwithstanding when age have chill the vigor of he limb and scatter she snow over those hair which have escape the hand of the barber resign he shop and retire to enjoy the fruit of he industry it be as natural for a tradesman in modern time to desire to die in the tranquillity of a gentleman as it be for the saxon king of the heptarchy to act the same inevitable scene amidst the severity of a cloister the old gentleman however find and it be not impossible that some of he brethren may have find it before he when the great transaction be irretrievably over that retirement and indolence do not constitute the situation for which either nature or habit have fit he it have be observe by some of those philosopher who have make the human mind the object of they study that idleness be often the mother of love it might indeed have be suppose that mr hartley for that be he name by have attain the age of sixty might have outlive every danger of this kind but opportunity and temptation supply that which might have be deficient on the side of nature within a little mile of the mansion in which he have take up he retreat reside two ancient maiden lady under cover of the venerable age to which they have attain they have lay aside many of those mode which coyness and modesty have prescribe to they sex the visit of a man be avowedly as welcome to they and indeed much more so than those of a woman they want of attraction either external or mental have indeed hinder the circle of they acquaintance from be very extensive but there be some as well as mr hartley who prefer the company of ugliness censoriousness and ill nature to solitude such be the miss cranley 's the name of the elder of whom be amelia and that of the younger sophium miss amelium be nominally forty and she sister thirty year of age perhaps if we state the matter more accurately we should rate the elder at fifty-six and the younger somewhere about fifty they both of they be masculine in they behavior and studious in they disposition miss amelium delighted in the study of theology she dispute with the curate maintain a godly correspondence with a neighbouring cobler and be even say to be prepare a pamphlet in defense of the dogma of mr whitfield miss sophium who will make a much more considerable figure in this history be altogether as indefatigable in the study of politics as she sister be in that of theology she adhere indeed to none of we political party for she suspect and despise they all my lord north she treat as stupid sleepy and void of personal principle mr fox be a brawl gamester devoid of all attachment but that of ambition and who treat the mob with flattery and contempt mr burke be a jesuit in disguise who under the most specious profession be capable of the blackest and meanest action for she own part she be a steady republican that couplet of dr garth be continually in she mouth _ from my very soul i hate all king and minister of state _ chapter ii _ a ball _ thus much it be necessary to premise in order to acquaint the reader with the situation of we heroine and that of some other personage in this history have discharge this task we will return to the point from which we set out it be at one of the ball at the race at southampton -- the company be already assemble the card table be set and we maiden lady together with many other venerable piece of antiquity be assemble around they in another and

she hand she smile assent and they cross the room among a croud of envious rival besides the lover we have mention there be four other who have secretly determine to dance with delium but if the gentleman be disappoint to whose eye the beauty of delium however unrivalled be familiar the disappointment and envy of the fair sex upon the loss of damon whose external and natural recommendation

consign to silence the evening be bright and calm it be in the close of autumn and every thing tempt we lovely fair one to take the air by the way she call upon she inseparable friend and companion they direct they course towards the sea side here they have not advance far before they enter a grove a spot particularly the favorite of delium in a little opening there be a bank embroider with daisy and butter-cup a little row of willow bend they head forward form a kind of canopy and directly before it there be a vista through the tree which afford a distant prospect of the sea with every here and there a vessel pass along and the beam of the setting sun quiver on the wave delium and she companion advance towards the well know spot the mellow voice of the thrush and the clear pipe of the blackbird diversify at interval with the tender note of the nightingale form the most agreable natural concert the breast of delium frame for softness and melancholy be fill with sensation responsive to the object around she and even the eternal clack of miss fletcher be still presently however a new and unexpected object claim they attention a note stronger and sweeter than that of any of the native chorister of the grove swell upon the air and float towards they have approach a few pace they stand still to listen it seem to proceed from a flute play upon by a human voice the air be melancholy but the skill be divine the native curiosity of miss fletcher be not upon this occasion a match for the sympathetic spirit of delium she press forward with a eager and uncertain step and look through a interstice form by two venerable oak she perceive the figure of a young man sit in she favorite alcove he back be turn towards the side upon which she be have finish the air he throw he flute carelesly from he and fold he arm in a posture the most disconsolate that can be imagine he rise and advance a little with a irregular step ah lovely mistress of my soul cry he thou little regardest the anguish that must for ever be a inmate of this breast while i be a prey to a thousand torment imagination thou riotest in the empire of beauty heedless of the wound thou inflict and the slave thou chainest to thy chariot wretch that i be what be to be do but i must think no more say this he snatch up he flute and thrust it into he bosom hurry out of the grove while he speak delium imagine that the voice be one that she have hear before though she know not where she heart whisper she something more than she understanding could disentangle but as he stoop to take he flute from the ground he profile be necessarily turn towards the inner part of the grove delium start and tremble damon stand confess but she scarcely recollect he feature before he rush away swifter than the winged hawk and be immediately out of sight delium be too full of a thousand reflection upon this unexpected rencounter to be able to utter a word but miss fletcher immediately begin god bless we cry she do you ever see the like why it be my belief it be a ghost or a wizard i never hear any thing so pretty -- i vow i be terribly frightened delium now catch hold of she arm for heaven 's sake let we quit the grove i do not know what be the matter -- but i feel myself quite sick good god good heaven well i do not wonder you be all in a tremble -- but suppose now it should be nothing but mr prattle -- he be always somewhere or other -- and then he play _ god save the king _ and _ darby and joan _ like any thing oh say the lovely tremble nymph they be the sweetest note ah say she companion he be a fine man and then he be so modest -- he will play at one and thirty and ride upon a stick with little tommy all day long but sure it could not be mr prattle -- he always wear he hair in a queue you know -- but the ghost have a bag and solitaire well cry delium let we think no more of it but do we hear anything -- law child why he play the nicest glee -- and then he make such a speech for all the world like mr button that i like so to see in hamlet true say delium -- but what he say be more like the soft complaining of my dear castalio do not he complain of a false mistress why he do say something of that kind -- if it be neither a ghost nor mr prattle i hope in god he be go to appear upon the southampton stage i do so love to see a fine young man come on for the first time with _ may this alspishus day be ever sacred _ or _ i be thy father 's spirit _ chapter iv _ a love scene _ in such conversation the moment pass till they reach the habitation of mr hartley miss fletcher now take she leave and after a supper as dull and much more tedious to delia than the dinner she retire to she chamber she retire indeed but not to rest she brain be fill with a croud of uneasy thought alas say she how short have be the illusion -- but yesterday i be flush with all the pride of conquest and busily frame a thousand scheme of ideal happiness -- where be they now -- the lovely youth the only man i ever see in whose favor my heart be prepossess and with whom i should have feel no repugnance to have engage in the tenderest tie be nothing to I -- he love another he too complain of slight passion and ill-fated love ah have he make he happiness depend on I what would not i have do to reward he carefully i would have soothe every anguish and teach he heart to bind with joy but what be i say -- where be i go -- be i that delia that bad defiance to the art of man -- that saw with indifference the havock that my charm have make with every opening morn i smile each hour be speed with joy and my heart be light and frolic and shall i dwindle into a pensive melancholy maid the sacrifice of one that heed I not whose sigh no answering sigh encounter -- let it not be say i have hitherto assert the independence of my sex i will continue to do so too amiable unknown i give thee to the wind propitious fate i thank thee that thou hast so soon discover how much my partiality be misplace i will abjure it before it be too late i will tear the little intruder from my heart before the mischief be become irretrievable the follow evening delium repair again by a kind of irresistible impulse to the grove she ask not the company of she friend she dare alone hazard the encounter of that object at which she have tremble so much the precede day unknown to herself she still image a kind of uncertainty in she fate which would not permit she to lay aside all thought of damon she determine at all event to have she doubt resolve when there be no longer say she to herself any room for mistake i shall then know what to do as she draw near the alcove she perceive the same figure stretch along the bank and with he eye immoveably fix upon a little fountain that rise in a corner of the scene he seem lose in think delium approach doubtfully but he hear she not advance near to she object she recline forward in a posture of wonder and attention at this moment a sigh burst from the heart of damon and he raise himself upon the seat he eye catch the figure of delium ------ ah say he start from he trance what do i see art thou lovely intruder a mere vision a aerial be that shun the touch i beg ten thousand pardon i meaned not sir to interrupt you i will be go no go not answer he thou art welcome to my troubled thought i could gaze for ever say this he rise and advance towards she seize she hand be not afraid say he gentle fair one my breast be a stranger to violence and rudeness i have feel the dart of love unhappy myself i learn to feel for other but you be happy as he say this a tear unbidden steal into the eye of delium and she wipe it away with the hand which be disengage from he and dost thou pity I say he and do such softness dwell within thy breast if you know the story of my woe you would have reason to pity I i be in love to destraction but i dare not disclose my passion i be banish from the presence of she i love ah cruel fate i be entangled inextricably entangled and how sir say delium can i serve you alas say he in no way my case be hopeless and irretrievable and what be i do why do i talk when the season call for action oh i be lose dear sir answer delium you terrify I to death oh no i would not for the world give you a uneasy moment let I be unhappy -- but may misfortune never disturb you tranquility i return to seek she whose fate be surely destine to mix with mine pardon loveliest of thy sex the distraction in which i have appear i would ask you to forget I -- i would ask you to remember I -- i know not what i be or what to think with these word he take the hand which he still hold in one of he and raise it to he lip kiss it with the utmost fervor immediately he catch up he hat which lay beside he on the ground and begin to advance along the path that lead out of the grove on the side furthest from the town but he eye be still fix upon delium he heed not the path by which he go and scarcely have he go twenty pace ere he change he mind and return delium be seat on the bank and seem lose in reverie damon throw himself upon he knee before she ah why say he be i constrain to depart -- why must i talk in riddle perhaps we may never see each other more perhaps the time will come when i shall be able to clear up the obscurity that at present i be oblige to preserve but no it can not be i never be happy but for two poor hour that i enjoy you smile and drinking in the poison of you charm i forget myself the time too soon arrive for bitter recollection my mistress call the mistress of my fate i must be go -- farewel -- for ever say this he heave a sigh that seem almost to tear he breast asunder and with the utmost apparent violence he tear himself away and rush along the path with incredible velocity delium be now alone but instead as she have flatter herself of have she doubt resolve she be more uncertain more perplexed than ever what cry she can all this mean how strange and how inexplicable be it a real person that i have see or be it a vision that mock my fancy be i love or be i hate oh foolish question oh fond illusion be we not part for ever be he not go to seek the mistress of he soul alas he view I not but with that general complacency which youth and the small pretension i have to beauty be calculate to excite he have nothing to relate that concerned myself he merely intend to make I the confidante of he passion for another too surely he be unhappy he heart seem ready to burst with sorrow probably in this situation there be no greater or more immediate relief than to disclose the subject of we distress and to receive into we bosom the sympathetic tear of a simple and a generous heart he behavior today correspond but too well with the suspicion that yesterday excite oh delium then add she be firm thou shalt see the conqueror no more think of he no more in spite however of all the resolution she could muster delium repair day after day sometimes alone and sometimes in company with she friend to that spot which by the umbrage of melancholy it wear be become more interesting than ever miss fletcher could scarcely at first be persuade to direct she course that way lest she should again see the ghost but she need not have terrify herself no ghost appear disappointed and baffle on this side delium by the strictest enquiry endeavor to find out who the unknown person be in whose fate she have become so greatly interested the result of these enquiry however diligent be not entirely satisfactory she learn that he have be for a few day upon a visit to a mr moreland a gentleman who live about three mile from southampton mr moreland be a person of a very singular character he have the reputation in the neighborhood of be a cynic a misanthrope and a madman he keep very little company and be even seldom see but by night he have a garden sufficiently spacious which be carefully render impervious to every human eye and to this and he house he entirely confine himself in the day-time the person he see be not the gentleman of the neighborhood he have no toleration for character that do not interest he when he first come down to he present residence he be visit by mr hartley mr prattle squire savage lord martin and all the most admire personage in the country but they visit have never be return mr prattle pronounce he a scoundrel squire savage say he be a nincompoop and lord martin be near send he a challenge but the censure of the former and the threat of the latter have never reach he ear he domestic be numerous but they be hire from a distance and be permit as little communication as possible with the powdered lacquie of southampton of consequence however much the unaccommodating conduct of mr moreland dispose he neighbor to calumniate he scandal be deprive of that daily food which be requisite for she subsistence and the name of that gentleman be scarcely ever hear chapter v _ a man of humor _ we will now return to lord martin all he messenger from what cruel fate we can not exactly ascertain miscarry and it be not till damon have leave the country that he learn that he have be a visitor at the house of mr moreland finding that he have miss he expected vengeance he discharge he anger in unavailing curse and for three day he breathe nothing but dagger death and damnation have thus vapour away the paroxysm of he fury he become tolerably compose but adverse fate have decree a short duration to the tranquility of he lordship scarcely have the field be clear from the enemy he so greatly dread ere a new rival come upon the stage to whose arm though without any great foundation the whole town of southampton have consign the charming delium the name of this gentleman be prettyman he be just return from he travels and be reckon perfectly accomplish he be six foot high he shoulder be broad he leg brawny and he whole person athletic the habit however he have form to himself in foreign country will not perhaps be allow exactly to correspond with the figure which nature have bestow upon he he generally spend two hour every morning at he toilette he face be paint and patch he whole person strongly perfumed and he have continually in he hand a gold snuff-box set with diamond he voice be naturally hoarse and loud but with infinite industry he have bring himself to a pronunciation shrill piping and effeminate he conversion be lard with foreign phrase and foreign oath and every thing he say be accompany with a significant shrug the same period which have introduce this new pretender to the heart of delium have be distinguish by the arrival of a sir william twyford who pay he address to miss fletcher sir william be exactly the reverse of mr prettyman with a genteel person and a open and agreable phisiognomy he manners be perfectly careless and unstudied a predominant feature in he character be good nature but this be not he ruling passion he have a infinite fund of wit and humor and he never be so happy as when he be able to place the foible of affectation in a whimsical and ridiculous light as it be vanity alone that have induce mr prettyman to pay he address to the lady who be universally allow to surpass in beauty and every elegant accomplishment in the place in which he be he would have be less pleased that he amour should have terminate in a marriage than that by he affectation and coquetry he might break the heart of the simple fair one accordingly it be he business to make the affair as public as possible lord martin have be sufficiently irritated by the pretension of damon the new intruder have work up he passion to the highest pitch in the mean time he have renew a acquaintance which he have formerly make with sir william twyford sir william upon all occasion cultivate the intimacy of such as by any striking peculiarity seem to furnish a proper subject for he humor he now contribute every thing in he power to inflame he lordship against mr prettyman he offer to become the bearer of a challenge and to be he lordship 's second in any future combat lord martin break off the conversation somewhat abruptly and begin to reflect with himself upon what have pass he have hitherto contrived by some means or other though he deal very largely in challenge never to have come to actual battle but he have too much reason to think that if he make sir william he messenger he should not be able with any degree of honor to contrive a evasion it be true say he i be in a most confounded passion but a wise general never proceed to action without have first deliberate zound blood and fire would i could put a end to the existence of so presumptuous a villain but then it must be consider that mr prettyman be six foot high and i be not five he be as athletic as ajax but to I nature have be unfavourable it be true i understand cart and terce parry and thrust but i have hear that prettyman study under olivier many a man have outlive the passage of a bullet or the thrust of a sword through he but my constitution be so delicate curse blast it death and the devil i do not know what to do sir william as soon as he have leave lord martin repair to the lodgings of mr prettyman after a short general conversation he begin my dear friend here have happen the unluckiest thing in nature you have make some advance you know to the charming delium true cry prettyman i have bestow upon she a few condescend glance _ c'est une charmante fille _ well add sir william and the whole town give she to you _ parbleu _ the town be very impertinent there will go two word to that bargain my lord martin you know have enlist himself amongst she admirer pox take the blockhead i suppose he would marry she _ bien _ after i have lead she a dance he shall do what he please with she but say sir william my lord intend to call you to a account _ morbleu _ cry prettyman i think i have be in a land of liberty but let I tell you my lord be very absolute he have fight some half a dozen duel in he time and every body be afraid of he _ j' en suis excèdè _ ` pon honor the girl be not worth fight for oh say the

nothing at all answer the young lady it be all _ à la mode de paris _ in france no man of fashion can presume to accost a lady whether young or old but in the language of love but it mean no more than when a minister of state say to he first clerk _ you humble servant _ or to the widow of a poor seaman _ you devoted slave _ oh cry sir william that be all and by my faith it be mighty pretty what think you damon i hope when you be marry you will have no objection to lord osborne or any other person of fashion make love to you wife before you face what a indelicate question say miss frampton i declare baronet you be grow a absolute boor nobody ever talk of marriage now a woman of fashion blush to hear it mention before a third person why to say the truth madam i have be honor with so great a intimacy by damon that i think that might excuse the impropriety and now pray you ladyship must i wait till we be alone before i ask my friend whether he happy day be fix since you will talk say miss frampton of the odious subject i believe i may tell you that it be not we be in no such hurry my dear sweet play-fellow say the baronet i must tell you once for all that i be no adept in french fashion so that you will give I leave to use the unceremonious language of a englishman my friend here you know be a little sheepish but i have word at will i think matter have be nearer a termination and pray my good sir let the gentleman speak for himself if he be not dissatisfied why should you be in such haste indeed madam interpose damon i be not perfectly satisfied perhaps indeed a lover ought to think himself happy enough in be permit to dance attendance upon a lady of you charm but i once think madam that we have advance somewhat farther i can not tell answer the lady with a air of levity just as you please but i can not see why we should put ourselves to any inconvenience lord osborne -- lord osborne interrupted sir william with some warmth and pray what have he lordship to do with the matter really sir william reply miss frampton you be very free but he lordship be my friend and i hope damon have no objection to he continue so look you answer sir william i would neither have lord osborne for the rival of damon now nor for you _ chichisbee _ hereafter and yet i be not sure cry she that he may not be both be there then say the baronet no engagement subsist between you and damon i believe cry miss frampton a little hesitate there may be something of the kind but we may change we mind you know and i do not think that i shall prosecute upon it ha ha ha to say the truth reply sir william i believe lord osborne be not only the rival of damon but a very formidable one too but let I tell you bella a character so respectable as that of my friend and so true a englishman must not be allow to dance attendance as he please i believe we understand one another and to say the truth at once perhaps some time hence i may have no aversion to lord osborne the reader will not suppose that the conversation continue much longer damon and the young lady come to a perfect understanding and part without any very ungovernable desire of see each other again and thus by the gay humor and active friendship of sir william twyford a affair be happily terminate which from the timidity and gentleness of we hero might otherwise have linger several month to the mutual dissatisfaction of both party damon quit the house in rapture and be no sooner seat in the chariot than he press he friend repeatedly to he breast and commit a thousand extravagancy of joy chapter ix _ a tragical resolution _ damon and he friend spend the evening together in the chamber of we hero they now discuss a variety of those subject which naturally arise between friend who have be for any time separated damon throw aside that reserve which the consciousness of a fault have hitherto involuntarily impose upon he and related more explicitly who the lady be of whom he be so much enamoured and in what manner he have first see she recollecting that the baronet be just return from the environs of southampton he eagerly enquire into the health and situation of he mistress sir william related to he the adventure of mr prettyman as we have already state it to we reader and deeply lament the persecution to which delium be subject from the haughty victor and be there cry damon eagerly no prospect of he lordship 's success i believe answer sir william that he be of all man she mortal aversion and be there no happy lover in all she train that she regard with a partial eye none reply the baronet she be chaste as snow and firm as mountain oak propitious coldness exclaim damon for that may heaven send down a thousand blessing on she head but you talk add he of some occasion of you journey which you defer relate to I the occasion answer sir william determine to preserve inviolate the secret of delium be already fulfil i hear from young eustace of the appearance and address of osborne and suspect the rest i determine to deliver you from the clutch of a girl whom i always think unworthy of you and now add he cheerfully free as the wind we can pursue uncontrolled the device of we own heart the next morning the two friend proceed to the house of lord thoma villier the father of damon he have already learn something of the visit of lord osborne at beaufort place he be not therefore much surprised to hear of the scene which have pass between he son and the lady of that mansion but there be something more to be do in order to gain the approbation of the father to the new project in the prosecution of which both these friend be equally sanguine lord thoma villier be as we have already say avaricious he be not therefore much pleased with the proposal of a match with a lady whose fortune be not the half of that of miss frampton he be tincture with the pride of family and he could not patiently think for a moment of marry he only son to the daughter of a tradesman sir william employ all he eloquence and accommodate himself with infinite dexterity to the humor of the person with whom he have to deal damon indeed say but little but he look express more than the baronet with all he ability and all he friendship be able to suggest in spite of both the father continue inexorable the mind of damon be impress with the most exalted idea upon the subject of filial duty have he heart be pre-engaged before the affair of miss frampton be propose to he he might not perhaps have carry he complaisance so far as to have marry the indifferent person in spite of all he view and all he prepossession but in he estimate the actual enter into a connection for life in opposition to the will of a parent be a mode of conduct very different from and far more exceptionable than the refuse to unite oneself with a person in whose society one have not the smallest reason to look for happiness there be another inducement that have much weight with damon and even with he more sanguine friend sir william twyford the fortune neither of damon nor delium be independent lord thoma villier be fill with too many prepossession and too much pride easily to retract a opinion he have once adopt or to forgive a opposition to he judgment the narrow education of a tradesman it be natural to suppose have render the mind of mr hartley still more tenacious and unmanageable and neither would sir william have be willing to see he friend nor would the lover readily have involve he mistress in circumstance of pecuniary distress the resolution of damon be therefore speedily take every motive that could have weight serve to counteract the bias of he inclination he by no means want either firmness or spirit he resolve to struggle nor to cease he effort till he have conquer with this design he entreat and after some difficulty obtain of he father leave to enter himself in the army and to make a campaign in america the character of he heart seem particularly form for military pursuit he be grave and thoughtful he be generous and humane to a mind contemplative and full of sensibility he unite a temper frank open and undisguised he be usually mild gentle and pliant but in a situation that call for determination and spirit it be impossible to appear more bold and manly more cool and decide -- affectionate be the farewel of he father and still more affectionate that of he friend damon though he endeavor to summon all he resolution could not restrain a sigh when he consider himself as about to sail for distant climate and recollect that probably before he return he beloved mistress _ dearer than life and all its joy _ would be unite irrevocably unite to another but here we must take leave of we hero and return to he fair inamorata damon and delium part the second damon and delium part the second chapter i _ in which the story begin over again _ sir william twyford have take care to inform miss fletcher and by she means delia herself of every

expression of damon in the interesting scene that have pass between they in the alcove she no longer doubt of the reality of he attachment she heart be soothe and she pride secretly flatter in recollect that she have not suffer herself to be catch by one who be perfectly indifferent to she but the information that stifle all she hope and give she the prospect of so long and too probably a

himself of the time when she be to return to southampton and he trust to be there not long after she in the mean time as he situation be at present very precarious he prevail upon she to permit he to write to she from time to time and to promise to communicate to he in return any thing of consequence that might happen to herself during the remainder of the evening miss fletcher make several ingenious observation upon what have pass delium gently blame she for have so strangely occasion the interview though in reality she be by no means displeased by the event it have produce bless we child you be as captious as any thing why i would not but have see it for ever so much well he be a sweet dear man and so kind and so polite for all the world i think he just such another as mr prattle but then he be grave and make such fine speech it do one 's heart good to hear he i vow i wish i have such a lover sir william never say any thing half so pretty bless we my dear _ he _ talk about love just as if he be talk about any thing else the next morning after breakfast mr godfrey appear he bring from damon a thousand vow full of passion and constancy he have part he say more determine not to leave england more resolute to prosecute he love than ever have discharge he commission he offer he service to escort the lady in any party they might propose for the present day he say that be perfectly acquaint with windsor and its environs he flatter himself he might be able to contribute to they entertainment the very gallant manner in which this offer be make determine miss fletcher as something singular and interesting in the appearance of mr godfrey do we heroine cheerfully to close with the proposal the person of mr godfrey as we have already say be tall and genteel there be a diffidence in he manner that seem to prove that he have not possess the most extensive acquaintance with high life but he have a natural politeness that amply compensate for the polish and form of society he air be serious and somewhat melancholy but there be a fire and animation in he eye that be in the highest degree striking delium engage he to talk of the character and quality of damon upon this subject mr godfrey speak with the warmth of a honest friendship he represent damon as of a disposition perfectly singular and unaccommodated to what he stile the debauched and unfeeling manners of the age he acknowledge with readiness and gratitude that he owe to he the most important obligation by degree delium collect from he several circumstance of a story which she before apprehend to be interesting she observe that as he shake off the embarrassment of a first introduction he language become fluent elegant pointed and even sometimes poetical since however he relate he own story imperfectly and by piece meal we shall beg leave to state it in we own manner and we the rather do it as we apprehend it to be interesting in itself and as we foresee that he will make a second appearance in the course of this narrative we will not however deprive we reader of the reflection he throw out upon the several situation in which he have be place we will give they without pretend to decide how far they may be consider as just and well-founded mr godfrey be not bear to affluent circumstance at a proper age he have be place at the university of oxford and here it be that he commence he acquaintance with damon at oxford he ability have be universally admire he public exercise though public exercise by they very nature ought to be dull have in they many of those sally by which he disposition be characterise and much of that superiority which he indisputably possess above he contemporary but though admire he be not court in we public place of education a wide distance be studiously preserve between young man of fortune and young man that have none but mr godfrey have a stiffness and unpliableness of temper that do not easily bend to the submission that be expect of he he could neither flatter a blockhead nor pimp for a peer he love he friend indeed with unbounded warmth and it be impossible to surpass he in generousness and liberality but he have a proud integrity that whisper he with a language not to be controle that he be the inferior of no man he be destine for the profession of a divine and have finish he study retire upon a curacy of forty pound a year he ambition be grievously mortify at the obscurity in which he be plunge and he great talent in spite of real modesty forcibly convinced he that this be not the station for which nature have form he but he have a enthusiasm of virtue that lead he for a time to overlook these disadvantage i be go say he to dwell among scene of unvitiated nature i will form the peasant to generosity and sentiment i will teach laborious industry to look without envy and without asperity upon those above they i will be the friend and the father of the meanest of my flock i will give sweetness and beauty to the most rugged scene the man that banish envy and introduce contentment the man that convert the little circle in which he dwell into a terrestrial paradise that render man innocent here and happy for ever may be obscure may be despise by the superciliousness of luxury but it shall never be say that he have be a blank in creation the supreme be will regard he with a complacency which he will deny to king that oppress and conqueror that destroy the work of he hand such be the suggestion of youthful imagination but mr godfrey presently find the truth of that maxim as paradoxical as it be indisputable that the heart of man be naturally hard and unamiable he conduct himself in he new situation with the most unexceptionable propriety and the most generous benevolence but there be man in he audience man who love better to criticise than to be amend and woman who feel more complacency in scandal than eulogium he displeased the one by disappointing they it be impossible to disappoint the other he labor unremittedly but he labor return to he void and be it for this say he that i have sacrifice ambition and bury talent be humility to be reward only with mortification be obscurity and retirement the favorite scene of uneasiness ingratitude and impertinence they shall be no longer my torment in no scene can i meet with a more scanty success he now obtain a recommendation to be private tutor to the child of a nobleman this nobleman be celebrate for the politeness of he manners and the elegance of he taste it be he boast and he ambition to be consider as the patron of man of letter with he prospect therefore in this connection mr godfrey be perfectly satisfied i shall no longer say he be the slave of ignorance and the victim of insensibility my talent perhaps point I a step higher than to the business of form the mind of youth but at least the youth under my care be destine to fill the most conspicuous station in future life if propitious fortune might have raise I to the character of a statesman depress by adversity i may yet have the honor of mould the mind and infuse generosity into the heart of a future statesman i have hear the second son of my patron celebrate for the early promise of capacity to unfold the spring germ of genius to direct they in the path of general happiness be a employment by no means unworthy of a philosopher in this situation mr godfrey however once more look for pleasure and find disappointment the nobleman have more the affectation of a patron than any real enthusiasm in the cause of literature the ability of mr godfrey be universally acknowledge and so long as the novelty remain he be caress honor and distinguish in a short time however he be completely forget by the patron in the hurry of dissipation and the pursuit of a unbounded ambition he eldest care be universally confess stupid and impracticable and in the younger he find nothing but the prate forwardness of a boy who have be flatter without sentiment and without mean she ladyship treat mr godfrey with superciliousness as a intruder at she lord 's table the servant catch the example and show he a distinction of neglect which the exquisiteness of he sensibility would not permit he to despise mortified irritated depressed he now quit he task half finish and throw himself upon the world the present age say he be not a age in which talent be overlook and genius depress he have hear much of the affluence of writer a churchil a smollet and a goldsmith who have depend upon that only for they support he see the celebrated dr johnson caress by all party and acknowledge to be second to no man whatever be he rank however conspicuous he station full of these idea he soon complete a production fraught with the fire and originality of genius point in its remark and elegant in its style he have now to experience vexation of which he have before entertain no idea he carry he work from bookseller to bookseller and be every where refuse he performance be not seasoned to the time he be a person that nobody know and he have no man of rank by he importunity and eloquence to force he into the rank of fashion at length he find a bookseller foolish enough to undertake it but he presently perceive that the gentleman at the head of that profession be wiser than he all the motive they have mention and one more operate against he the monarch of the critic realm scout he with one voice because he work be not write in the same cold phlegmatic insupportable manner as they own he have now advanced however too far to retreat he have too much spirit to resume either of those profession which for reason so cogent in he opinion he have already quit he write essay squib and pamphlet for a extemporary support but though these be finish with infinite rapidity he find that they constitute a very precarious means of subsistence the time of dinner often come before the production that be to purchase it be complete and when complete it be frequently several day before it could find a purchaser and he copy money and he taylor 's bill be too little proportioned to one another he now recollect what in the gaiety of hope he have forget that _ many a flower _ only blow with its sweetness to refresh the _ air of a desert _ he recollect many instance of work raise by the breath of fashion to the very pinnacle of reputation that sink as soon again he recollect instance scarcely fewer of work exquisite in they composition pregnant with beauty almost divine that have pass from the press without notice many have be revive by the cooler and more deliberate judgment of a future age and more have be lose for ever the instance of chatterton as a proof that the universal patronage of genius be by no mean the virtue of he contemporary flash in he face and he look forward to the same fate at no great distance as he own to mr godfrey however fortune be in one degree more propitious damon be among the few whose judgment be not guide by the dictate of fashion have meet accidentally with the performance we have mention he be strike with its beauty as he have hear nothing of it in the politest circle he conclude with he usual penetration that the author of it be in obscure and narrow circumstance _ open as day to sweet humanity _ interested warmly in the fortune of the writer of so amiable a performance he fly to he bookseller 's with the usual enquiry the bookseller stare and have it not be for the splendor of he dress and he gilded chariot would have be tempt to smile at so unfashionable and absurd a question he soon however obtain the information he desire and he eagerness be increase when the name of godfrey and the recollection of the talent by which he have be so eminently distinguish lead he to apprehend that he be one to whose ability and character he have be greatly attach he find some difficulty to obtain admission but this be quickly remove as from the dignity of he appearance it be not probable that he be a person from whom mr godfrey have any thing to apprehend he find he in a wretched apartment he hair dishevelled and he dress threadbare and neglect mr godfrey be unspeakably surprise at he appearance and it be with much difficulty that damon prevail upon he to accept of a assistance that he assure he should be but temporary if it be in the power of he or any of he connection to render he respectable and independent in such a situation as himself should chuse disappointment and misfortune be calculate to inspire asperity into the gentlest heart mr godfrey inveigh with warmth and sometimes with partiality against the coldness and narrowness of the age he say that man of genius in conspicuous station have no feeling for those whom nature have make they brother and that those who have rise from obscurity themselves forget the mortification of they earlier life and do not imitate the generous justice which have enable they to fulfil the destination of nature but though misfortune have teach he asperity upon certain subject it have not corrupt he manners debauch he integrity or narrow he heart he have still the same warmth in the cause of virtue as in day of the most unexperienced simplicity he still dread a oath and reverence the divinity of innocence he still believe in a god and be sincerely attach to he honor though he have often be tell that this be a prejudice unworthy of he comprehension of think upon all other subject chapter iii _ a misanthrope _ such be the story in its most essential circumstance that mr godfrey related delium be exceedingly interested in the gaiety of he imagination the cruelty of he disappointment and the acuteness and goodness of heart that appear in he reflection miss fletcher listen to the whole with gaping wonder but as soon as he be go she begin with she usual observation well say she i never see a author before i could not have think that he could have look like a gentleman why i vow i could sometimes have take he for a beau ay but then he talk for all the world as if it have be write in a book well by my troth it be a mighty pretty story but i should have like it better if there have be a sigh nymph or a duel or two in it but do you think it be all of he own making we will not trouble the reader to accompany we lady from stage to stage during the remainder of they journey nothing more remarkable happen and in ten day they arrive again at southampton damon meet mr moreland in london and with that simplicity and candor by which he be distinguish related to he every circumstance of he story mr moreland have no predilection in favor of lord thoma villier he sister whom he esteem in all respects a amiable woman have by no means live happily with she husband avarice and pride of rank be the farthest in the world from be the foible of mr moreland and the sensibility of he disposition do not permit he to treat the fault to which himself be a stranger with much indulgence he therefore encourage damon to persevere in the pursuit of he inclination and invite he to return with he into the country he promise himself to propose the match to mr hartley and assure he nephew that he should never feel any narrowness in he circumstance in case of he father 's displeasure while it be in he power to render they affluent in pursuit of this plan damon mr moreland and sir william twyford whom they find in london and whose goodness of humor lead he heartily to approve of the alteration in the plan of he friend arrive almost as soon as we traveller in the neighborhood of southampton sir william and damon soon wait upon they respective mistress and in company so mutually acceptable time speed with a greater velocity than be usual to he and day appear no more than hour it be impossible that such a connexion should pass long unnoticed it must be confess however that it meet with no interruption from lord martin perhaps it might have escape he notice though it escape that of no other person perhaps he be satiate with the glory he have acquire and have conquer one beau would not like alexander have sigh if there have remain no other beau to conquer perhaps the countenance of mr hartley of which he consider himself as securer than ever lead he like a wise general to reflect that in stake he life against that of a lover whose chance of success be almost wholly preclude he mould make a very unfair and unequal combat be this as it will mr hartley have no such motive to overlook this new occurrence just however as he have begin to take it into he mature consideration he receive the compliment of mr moreland with a intimation of he design to make he a visit that very afternoon at this message mr hartley be a good deal surprised mr moreland he have never but once see and in that visit he think he have have reason to be offend with he if that gentleman treat the company of mr prattle and lord martin person universally admire as not good enough for he it seem unaccountable that he should have recourse to he he be neither distinguish by the elegance of he accomplishment nor do he much pride himself in the attainment of literature after many conjecture he at length determine with infinite sagacity to suspend he judgement till mr moreland mould solve the enigma this determination be scarcely make before he visitor arrive that gentleman who though full of sensibility and benevolence be not a man of empty ceremony immediately open he business mr hartley draw himself up in he chair and with the dignity of a citizen of london who think that the first character in the world cry well sir and who be this nephew of yours i think i never hear of he he be the son answer mr moreland of lord thoma villier lord thoma villier then i suppose he be a great man and pray now sir if this great man have a mind that he son should marry my daughter why do he not come and tell I so himself why in truth say the other lord thoma villier have no mind but my nephew be he only son and therefore can not be deprive of the principal part of he estate after he death in the mean time i will take care that he shall have a income perfectly equal to the fortune of miss hartley you will sir and so in the first place this young spark would have I encourage he in disobedience which be the greatest crime upon god 's earth and in the second he think that i bob hartley as i sit here will marry my daughter into any family that be too proud to own we as to that sir say moreland you must judge for yourself the young gentleman be a unexceptionable match and i sir whose fortune and character i flatter myself be not inferior to that of any gentleman in the county shall always be proud to own and receive the young lady why as to that to be sure you may be in the right for _ auft _ that i know but _ howsomdever _ my daughter do you see be already engage to lord martin i should have think reply moreland that objection might have be state in the first instance without any reflexion upon the conduct and family of the young gentleman but be you sure that lord martin be the man of you daughter 's choice i can not say that i ever _ ax _ she for i do not see what that have to do with the matter lord martin do you see be a fine young man and a fine fortune and delium be my own daughter and if she should boggle about have he i would cut she off with a shilling sir answer moreland with much indignation that be a conduct that would deserve to be execrate my nephew without any sinister means be master of you daughter 's affection and lord martin i have authority to tell you be she aversion oh ho be it so well then sir i will tell you what i shall do you nephew shall never have my daughter though she have but a rag to she tail and as for she affection and she aversion i will lock she up and keep she upon bread and water till she know that she ought to have neither before she own father have tell she _ what be what _ mr moreland all of whose nerve be irritated into a fever by so much vulgarity and such brutal insensibility could retain he seat no longer he start up and regard he entertainer with a look of ineffable indignation fling the door in he face and retreat to he chariot chapter iv _ much ado about nothing _ damon be inexpressibly afflict at the success of he uncle 's embassy when mr moreland related to he the particulars of he visit damon recollect the opposite temper of the two gentleman and blame himself for not have foresee the event mr hartley be infinitely exasperated at the cavalierness with which he have be treat he now discover the true cause of he daughter 's pertinacity and proceed with more vigor than ever and so cry he you have dare to engage you affection without my privity have you a pretty story truly and you would disgrace I for ever by marry into the family of a lord that despise we and a old fellow that for half a word would knock you father 's brain out indeed sir reply delium i never think of marry without you consent i only give the young gentleman leave to ask it of you you give he leave and pray who be you and so you be in league with he to send this fellow to abuse I upon my word i be not and i be very sorry if mr moreland have behave improperly _ if _ mr moreland and so you pretend to doubt of it but let I tell you i have provide you a husband worth fifty of this young prig and i will make you think so indeed sir i can never think so you can not and pray who tell you to object before i have name the man why child lord martin have ten thousand pound a year and be a peer and be not ashamed of we one bit in all the world alas sir i can never have lord martin do not mention he i be in no hurry i will live single as long as you please yes and when you have persuade I to that you will jump out at window the next day to this ungracious rascal oh pray sir do not speak so he be good and gentle why hussey be i not master in my own house i shall have a fine time of it indeed if i must give you a account of my word sir say delium i will never marry without you consent that be a good girl no more you shall and i will lock you up upon bread and water if you do not consent to marry who i please the despotic temper of mr hartley lead he to treat he daughter with considerable severity he suffer she to go very little abroad and employ every precaution in he power to prevent any interview between she and she lover he try every instrument in turn threat promise intreaty bluster to bend she to he will and when he find that by all these means he make no progress as he last resource he fix a day at no great distance when he assure she he would be disappointed no longer and she should either voluntarily or by force yield she hand to lord martin during these transaction the communication between delium and she lover be with no great difficulty keep open by the instrumentality of they two friend they scarcely dare indeed to think of see each other as in case this be discover delium would be subject to still greater restraint and the intercourse between she and miss fletcher be render more difficult in one instance however this lady venture to procure the interview so ardently desire by both party damon make use of this opportunity to persuade he mistress to a elopement you have already carry say he you obedience to the utmost exremity you have try every mean to bend the inflexible will of you father if not for my sake then at least for you own avoid the crisis that be prepare for you you detect the husband that you father design you if unite to he you confess you must be miserable but who can tell in the midst of person inflexibly bent upon you ruin no friend at hand to support you you damon banish and at a distance what may be the event you will hesitate and tremble you father will endeavor to terrify you into submission the odious peer will force from you you hand if in that moment you heart should misgive you if one faultering accent belie the sentiment you have so generously avow for I what ah what may be the consequence no my fair one fly instantly fly no duty forbid you have do all that the most rigid moralist could demand of you put yourself into my protection i will not betray you confidence you shall be as much mistress as ever of all you action if you distrust I at least chuse we common friend sir william twyford chuse any protector among the numerous friend that you beauty and you worth have raise you i have rather sacrifice my own prospects of felicity forever than see the smallest chance that you should be unhappy such be the argument which with all the eloquence of a friend and all the ardor of a lover we hero urge upon he mistress but the gentleness of delium be not yet sufficiently rouse by the injury she have receive to induce she to cast off all the tie which education and custom have impose upon she and determine upon so decisive a step surely say she there be some secret reward some unexpected deliverance in reserve for filial simplicity oh how harsh how bold how questionable a step be that to which you would persuade I circumstance in this manner the fairest reputation might provoke the tongue of scandal and the most spotless innocence open a door to the blast of calumny i will not say that such a step may not be sometimes justifiable i will not say to what i may myself be urge but oh how unmingled the triumph how sincere the joy if by persevere in a conduct in which the path of duty be too palpable to be mistaken propitious fate may rather grant I the happiness after which i aspire than i be force as it be myself to wrest it from the hand of providence such be the result of this last and decisive interview delium could not be move from that line of conduct upon which she have so virtuously resolve and damon have in vain exert all the rhetoric of which he be master now give way to the gloomy suggestion of despair and now flatter himself with the gleam of hope he sometimes think that delium might yet be induce to adopt the plan he have propose and sometimes he give way to the serene confidence she express and indulge the please expectation that virtue would not always remain without its reward chapter v _ a woman of learn _ we be now bring in the course of we story to the memorable scene at miss cranley 's miss cranley 's exclaim one of we reader in a tone of admiration miss cranley 's cry another and pray who be she i distribute my reader into two class the indolent and the supercilious and shall accordingly address they upon the present occasion to the former i have nothing more to say than to refer they back to the latter part of chapter i part i where my dear lady you will find a accurate account of the character of two personage who it seem you have totally forget to the supercilious i have a very different story to tell most learn sir i kiss you hand i acknowledge my error and throw myself upon you clemency you see however gentleman that you be somewhat mistaken when you imagine that i like my fair patron the indolent have quite lose these character from my memory to speak ingenuously i do indeed suppose as far as i could calculate the event of this important narrative beforehand that the miss cranley would have come in earlier and have make a more conspicuous figure than they now seem to have any chance of do have thus settle account with my reader i take up again the thread of my story and thus i proceed mr hartley be now as he believe upon the point of dispose of he daughter in marriage begin seriously to consider that he should want a female companion to manage he family to nurse he ailment and to repair the breach that the hand of wintry time have make in

yourselve the charm of sophium as deck and burnish with a suit of sable she exterior indeed be sable and gloomy but she heart be far superior to the attack of wayward fate she sit aloft in the region of philosophy she steel she heart with the dignity of republicanism for she to drop one tear of sorrow would have be a eternal disgrace about this time -- it be perhaps in reality a maneuver to forward the affair to which she have no aversion at bottom with the father of delium -- that miss cranley give a grand entertainment at which be present mr hartley mr prattle sir william twyford lord martin most of the lady we have already commemorate and many other the repast be conduct with much solemnity the masculine character of the mind of sophium have render she particularly attach to the grace of action when she drink the health of any of she guest she accompany it with a most profound _ congè _ when she invite they to partake of any dish she point towards it with she hand this action might have serve to display a graceful arm but alas upon hers the hand of time have be make depredation and it appear somewhat coarse and discolor after dinner the lady of the house as usual turn the conversation upon the subject of politics she inveigh with much warmth against the effeminacy and depravity of the modern time we be slave and we deserve to be so in almost every country there now

julius in the very paroxysm of she oratory she chance to cast she eye upon mr prattle with the character of mr prattle the reader be already partly acquaint but he do not yet know for it be not necessary for we story he should do so that the honorable mr prattle be a commoner and a placeman good god sir represent to yourself with what a flame of indignation we amazon survey he she rise from she seat and take he by the hand very familiarly turn he round in the middle of the company this say she be one of we fabius one of we decius good god my friend what would you do if a brother officer

sake oh dear oh lack a daisy why miss sure you be mad miss cranley unheedful of he exclamation be however just go to begin with more vehemence than ever when a sudden accident put a stop to the
