dislike to he and he people whom they flout upon all occasion call they english _ tail _ -lrb- 3 -rrb- and other opprobrious name insomuch that the king of france have much ado to keep peace between

advance without wait for the come up of the main body of the army under the king of france vainly believe that he be able with the power he have to conquer the whole force of the saracen the master of the templar and other experienced officer endeavor to dissuade he from this rash conduct advise he rather to return to the main army satisfy with the signal advantage he have already achieve that thereby the whole army of the christian might act in concert and be the better able to guard against the danger of any ambush or other stratagem of war that might have be devise for they destruction they represent to he that the horse of this vanguard be already tired and the troops without food and besides that they number be utterly unable to withstand the vastly superior multitude of the enemy who besides have now obviously to fight for they last stake the capital of they dominion might be expect to exert they utmost effort to this salutary counsel the proud earl arrogantly answer with opprobrious taunt revile the whole templar as dastardly coward and betrayer of they country and even allege that the holy land of the cross might easily be win to christendom if it be not for the rebellious spirit of the templar and hospitaller and they follower : which indeed be a common belief among many to these contumelious remark the master of the templar angrily desire he in he own name and that of he follower to display he ensign when and where he dare and he should find they as ready to follow as he to lead the earl of salisbury now remonstrate with artoi advise he to listen to these experienced person who be much better acquaint with the country and people than he could be and endeavor to convince he that they advice be discreet and worthy to be follow he then address he discourse to the master of the templar prudently endeavor to sooth he anger against the arrogance of the count of artoi but artoi cut he short exclaim in anger with many oath away with these cowardly englishman with tail the army would be much better rid of these tail people and many other scandalous and disdainful expression to this the english earl reply well earl robert wherever you dare set you foot my step shall go as far as yours and i believe we shall go this day where you shall not dare to come near the tail of we horse and it so happen as earl william say : for earl robert of artoi persist to march forward against the soldan vainly hope to win all the glory to himself before the come up of the main body of the host he first enterprize be order a attack on a small castle or fortify village call mansor whence a number of the villager run out on see the approach of the christian make a great outcry which come to the ear of the soldan who be much nearer with he army than have be suppose in the mean time the christian make a assault on mansor with too little precaution and be repulse with considerable loss many of they be slay by large stone throw upon they as they enter the place by which the army not only lose a considerable number of man but be much dispirited by this unexpected repulse immediately on the back of this discomfiture the soldan come in sight with he whole army and see the christian in this divided state brother separate from brother joyfully seize the opportunity he have long wish for and inclose they on all side that none might escape attack they with great fury in this situation the earl of artoi sore repent of he headstrong rashness when it be too late and see earl william longespee fighting bravely against the chief brunt of the enemy he call out to he in a cowardly manner to flee as god fight against they but william bravely answer god forbid that my father 's son should flee from the face of a saracen earl robert turn out of the fight and flee away think to escape from death or captivity by the swiftness of he horse and take the river thafni -lrb- 6 -rrb- sink through the weight of he armor and be drown on the flight

who first conceive and execute the sublime idea of extend the knowledge and commerce of the globe by a judicious series of maritime expedition expressly for the purpose of discovery yet as madeira be say to have be visit and the canary be actually discover and settle before that era it appear necessary to give a previous account of these discovery before proceed to the second part of this work several author have leave account of the real or pretended original discovery of this island of madeira all of whom concur in assert that it be first discover by a englishman juan de barro the livy of portugal mention it briefly in the first decade of he asia the history of this discovery be write in latin by doctor manoel clemente and dedicate to pope clement v manoel tome compose a latin poem on

maritime discovery and to whom he present he work no person be more capable of give a exact account of that singular event than alcaforado as he be one of those who assist in make the second discovery he work be first publish in portuguese by don francisco manoel and be afterwards publish in french at paris in 1671 -lrb- 3 -rrb- from this french edition the follow account be extract because the original portuguese have not come to we knowledge neither can we say when that be print but as the anonymous french translator remark that don francisco _ keep _ the original m with great care it may be conclude that the portuguese impression do not long precede the french translation the french translator acknowledge that he have alter the style which be extremely florid and poetical and have expunge several useless and tedious digression etymology reflection and comparison but declare that he have strictly present the truth and substance of the history so as not to vary from it in the least or to omit the smallest material circumstance it be remarkable that there be no mention whatever in any of the english history of machin macham or marcham the suppose author of this discovery so that hakluyt be beholden to antonio galvano for the imperfect account he give of that transaction -lrb- 4 -rrb- by the follow abstract the complete history become we own and we shall be no longer stranger to a event which have for several age render a englishman famous in foreign country while wholly unknown in he own it must not however be omit to observe that some objection may be state against the authenticity of this history on account of certain circumstance which do not quadrate with the time assign for machin 's voyage by the author from these it be obvious either that the relation give by alcaforado be not genuine or that it have be interpolate how far this objection may be admit without prejudice to the authority of the whole story must be leave to the judgment of we reader we shall only add that so far as relate to macham it agree with the tradition of the inhabitant of madeira accord to alcaforada juan gonsalvo zarco a gentleman of the household of don henry be send out by that prince upon a expedition of discovery to the coast of africa make prize in the year 1420 of a spanish vessel fill with redeem captive on they way from morocco to spain in this vessel there be one john de morale a experienced and able pilot whom he detain as a acceptable present to he master don henry and set all the rest at liberty morale on be make acquaint with the cause of he detention enter freely into the service of the prince and give a account to gonsalvo of the adventure of machin and the situation and land-mark of the new discover island all of which he have learn from certain english captive in the jail of morocco who have accompany macham or machin in he expedition the year of this extraordinary adventure be not mention by galvano who only say that in 1344 pedro iv reign in arragon the chronicle of he age report that about this time the island of madeira be discover by one macham a englishman it must be confess that a objection arise against this history which be not easily remove we be tell that immediately after the death of macham he companion sail over to morocco and that morale be in prison when they arrive suppose the discovery by macham to have be make about 1344 as relate by galvano from the castilian chronicle morale must have be no less than seventy-six year a prisoner when redeem and when he be detain by gonsalvo in 1420 herbert place the adventure of macham in 1328 which would increase the captivity of morale to ninety-two year alcaforado place the event in the reign of edward iii of england which begin in 1327 and end in 1378 even suppose it to have happen in the last year of edward morale must have remain forty-two year in captivity which be not only highly improbable but be even contrary to the sense of the historian who suppose but a small space to have elapse between the two event besides the record quote by galvano be say expressly to assert that macham go himself into africa whence he be send to the king of castile this last circumstance may have be invent by the spaniard to give they a better title to the island of madeira : but the former objection remain in full force and can only be obviate by suppose that either morale advance a falsehood in assert that he have the account of this discovery from the english themselves instead of learn it from the other slave among whom the tradition might have be current for many year after the event or alcaforado may have mistake the report of morale in this particular the follow be the substance of the narrative as give by alcaforado in the

name of nivarium be obviously derive they appear likewise to have be know in the middle age to the arab of morocco as the nubian geographer mention two island under the name of mastahan and laco as among the six fortunate island describe by ptolemy these probably be lancerota and fuertaventura the latter of which may be see in clear weather from the nearest coast of africa all knowledge however of these island have cease in europe till some time between the year 1326 and 1334 when a french ship happen to be drive among they by a storm upon this discovery don luis de la cerda count of

be write in the portuguese language by antonio galvano who have be governor of ternate the chief of the molucca island and be first translate into english by the celebrated richard hakluyt who dedicate it to sir robert cecil principal secretary of state to queen elizabeth it be afterwards insert in osborne or the oxford collection of voyage and travels and form a appendix to the first volume of clarke 's progress of maritime discovery and from these source the present edition have be carefully prepare of richard hakluyt the original translator the follow notice be worthy of be preserve the _ great _ richard hakluyt be descend from a ancient family at yetton in herefordshire and be educate at westminster school from whence he be elect a student of christ church in the university of oxford where he take the degree of bachelor and master of art enter into holy order he be first make a prebendary of bristol and afterwards of westminster and rector of witheringset in suffolk besides this translation he illustrate the eight decade of peter martyr angelericus _ de novo orbe _ with curious note he also translate from the portuguese _ virginium _ richly value by the description of florida she next neighbor and write note of certain commodity in good request in the east indy molucca and china but what have most deservedly perpetuate he name be he great pain and judgment in collect _ english voyage navigation traffick and discovery _ -lrb- 2 -rrb- both from the nature of this treatise on the origin and progress of maritime discovery and from respect to the memory of hakluyt the father of we english collection of voyage and travel it have be select for insertion in this place as a appropriate introduction to the _ second part _ of we arrangement because its author may be consider as almost a original authority for the early discovery of the portuguese and spaniard although it may be consider in some measure as not precisely conformable with we plan yet one portion of this summary be directly in point and the whole be curious and in no respect tedious it be here give entire change the antiquated english of hakluyt into modern language although say in its title to extend to the year 1555 the chronological series of galvano properly end in 1545 and the only subsequent incident be a very slight notice of the voyage of sir hugh willoughby and richard chancellor towards the white sea in 1553 in the original translation and in the oxford collection this treatise be precede by a dedication from hakluyt to _ sir robert cecil _ and another dedication from the portuguese editor francis de sousa tavare to don john duke of aveira both of which be here omit as have no directly useful tendency except so much of the latter as refer to the history of galvano besides the present discourse galvano compose a history of the molucca island of which he have be governor which work have unfortunately be lose or at least be unknown in this country he be likewise say to have publish at lisbon in 1555 a account of the different route by which the merchandize of indium have be convey into europe at different period antonio galvano the author of the follow summary of the discovery of the world be a portuguese gentleman who be several year governor of the molucca island and perform signal service to he country in that honorable station by dissipate a formidable league which have be enter into by the native prince of these island for the expulsion of the portuguese and though possess very inadequate resource for the protection of so important a commercial establishment he confirm and extend the dominion and influence of portugal in these island when first appoint to the command in the molucca galvano carry with he a private fortune of 10000 crusado all of which he expend in the public service though he add a clear revenue to the crown of 500000 crusado in consequence of he successful vigilant and pure administration he be so zealous in patronize the propagation of the christian religion among the island belong to he government that on he return to lisbon in 1540 he be reduce to such extreme poverty as to be under the necessity of take refuge in the _ hospital _ where he die in 1557 francis de sousa tavare the original portuguese editor of this treatise in a dedication of the work to don john duke of aveira give the follow account of the work and of its author : antonio galvano when on he death-bed leave I this book along with he other papers by he testament and as i be certain he design that it should be present to you highness i have think proper to fulfil he intention in that respect it be fitting that this treatise should be write by a native of portugal as it treat of the various way in which the spicery and other commodity of indium be formerly bring to we part of the world and give a account of all the navigation and discovery of the ancient and modern in both of which thing the portuguese have labor above all other nation in this treatise and in nine or ten other book concern indium and the molucca this true portuguese describe the unfortunate and sorrowful time before we day in which he have be engage when he be appoint to the command of the island and fortress of the molucca all the king and chief of these island have agree to make war against we nation and to drive they out of the country yet he fight against they all in tidore though he have only 130 portuguese soldier against they whole united power and give they a signal overthrow in which they king and one ternate the principal author of the war be both slay besides which he conquer they fortress and compel they all to submit to the obedience and service of we sovereign in this war two great and wonderful event take place : the _ first _ that all the chief and king of these island unite against we who use ever to be at variance among themselves and _ secondly _ that galvano with only the ordinary garrison should obtain the victory against so great a combination it have happen to other governor of the molucca with a extraordinary number of european troops and assist by all the other native lord to go to war with one king only and to come back with loss whereas he with a small and inadequate force successfully wage war against a confederacy of all the lord of these island three brilliant exploit have be perform in indium beyond all other the capture of muar by emanuel falcon the winning of bitam by peter mascarena and this victory obtain by galvano besides this great exploit he father and four brother be all slay in the king service and he be the last of he lineage carry with he about 10000 crusado into the molucca all of which he expend in propagate we holy faith and in preserve these valuable island use all he power and influence to bring all the clove into the king coffer by which he add 500000 crusado yearly to the royal revenue have he gather clove on he own account as other governor of the molucca have do he might have come home very rich but return poor and in the simplicity of he nature expect to be reward for he honest service he be entirely neglect and have to take refuge in a hospital where he remain seventeen year till he death when he be 2000 crusado in debt partly for demand upon he from indium and partly borrow from he friend to maintain he in the hospital after he death the cardinal desire I to give he other writings to damien de go promise to content I for they which otherwise i should not have do yet hitherto i have not receive any thing with which to execute he will yet for all this as in the prosperity of he victory he make no boast so in he adversity he always preserve a unabated spirit you grace therefore may perceive that this treatise and he other work be write under great affliction yet be he not willing to use the remedy of zelim the son of the great turk mahomet who take constantinople and die in rome who use to make himself drunk that he might forget the high estate from which he have fall neither would he follow the council of many of he friend in withdraw from the kingdom say he have rather resemble timocle the athenian than the roman coriolanus for all which this treatise ought to receive favor from you grace allow for any oversight of the author if there be any such as i be unfit to detect or correct then god prosper you grace with long life and increase of honor -lrb- 1 -rrb- oxford collection ii 353 clarke progr of marit disc i app 1 -lrb- 2 -rrb- oxford collection i viii section i _ epitome of the ancient and modern discovery of the world chiefly by means of navigation from the flood to the close of the fifteenth century _ when i first desire to compose a account of the ancient and modern discovery by sea and land with they true date and situation these two principal circumstance seem involve in such difficulty and confusion that i have almost desist from the attempt even in regard to the date of the flood the hebrew reckon that event to have happen 1656 year after the creation : while the seventy interpreter make it 2242 and st augustine extend the time to 2262 year -lrb- 1 -rrb- in regard to geographical situation likewise there be many difference for there never sail ten or a hundred pilot in one fleet but they make they reckoning in almost as many different longitude but consider that all these difficulty might be surmount by just comparison and the exercise of judgment i at length resolve to persist in my undertake some allege that the world be fully know in ancient time for as it be people and inhabit it must have be navigable and frequented and because the ancient people be of longer life and have all one law and one language they could not fail to be acquaint with the whole world other again believe that though the world might be once universally know by mankind yet by the wickedness of man and the want of justice among nation that knowledge have be lose but as all the most important discovery have be make by sea and that chiefly in we own time it be desirable to learn who be the first discoverer since the flood some allege the greek other the phenician while other say the egyptian the inhabitant of indium on the contrary pretend that they be the first navigator particularly the tabenco whom we now call chinese and allege in proof of this that they be lord of all the indy even to cape bona speranca and the island of st lawrence -lrb- 2 -rrb- which be inhabit by they as likewise all the coast of the indian sea also the java timore celebe macassar the molucca borneo mindanao luones lequeo the japan and many other island also the country of cochin-china lao brama -lrb- 3 -rrb- pegu arracone -lrb- 4 -rrb- till you come quite to bengalum besides all these new spain peru brazil the antille and all the adjoining land be possess by the same race as appear by the fashion and manners both of the man and woman who have small eye flat nose with other proportion resemble the chinese and to this day many of these island and country be call by such name as bato-china bocho-china and the like indicate the country of or belong to china it farther appear that the ark of noah rest upon the north part of the mountain of armenia in 40 degree of latitude or upward and that scythium be a high land and the first that appear out of the universal deluge be first peopled and as the province or country of the tabenco or chinese be one of the chiefest of all tartary its inhabitant may be consider as the most ancient nation and the oldest navigator they sea be calm and as lie between the tropics they day and night be nearly equal and they season differ little in temperature and as no outrageous wind swell they sea into storm navigation among they be safe and easy they small bark call catamoran have only a large bough of a tree set up in the middle serve as mast and sail the master steer only with a oar and the passenger sit on pole fasten to the bark it be say that the people of china be anciently lord of almost all scythium and be in use to sail along that coast which reach from east to west in seventy degree of north latitude cornelius nepo say that in the time when metellus the colleague of afranius be proconsul of gaul the king of the suevus send to he certain indian who come to he country in a ship by the north and the flat of germany -lrb- 5 -rrb- these people probably come from china as in that country in the latitudes of 20 30 and 40 degree they have strong and well-fastened ship which can bear the sea and encounter the severity of the northern climate cambaium also have ship and its inhabitant be say to have long use the sea but it be not likely they should have go to gaul for they only trade to cairo and be indeed a people of little trade and less clothing those who escape from the flood keep the hill not daring for a long time to descend into the plain and low country and nimrod a hundred and thirty year afterwards build the tower of babel intend it as a refuge in case of any future deluge -lrb- 6 -rrb- upon the whole it seem probable that the inhabitant of china and the east be the first sailor though other think the inhabitant of the west particularly of syrium be the first to use the sea -lrb- 7 -rrb- this contest about the antiquity of navigation i leave to the scythian and egyptian who each challenge the honor to themselves but leave all contest point in this matter i now apply to my propose deduction rest only upon what have be record in authentic history ancient history say that tubal in the hundred and forty-third year after the flood come by sea into spain -lrb- 8 -rrb- whence it appear that in these early time navigation be usual from ethiopium to we part of western europe it be also say that semiramis invade the country on the river indus whence the indian derive they name and give battle to king stabrobate in which he lose a thousand ship -lrb- 9 -rrb- by which it clearly appear there be then many ship in those part and that the sea be much frequent in the six hundred and fiftieth year after the flood there be a king in spain name hesperus -lrb- 10 -rrb- and gonsalvo fernandez de oviedo the chronicler of antiquity -lrb- 11 -rrb- affirm that he make discovery by sea as far as cape verde and the isle of st thoma of which he be prince and that in he time the island of the west indy be discover and call the hesperide after he name he allege many reason in proof of this assertion and even say particularly that these early navigator sail in forty day from cape verde to these island other say that the island of st thoma and de principe be the hesperide and not the antille which be the more probable as these ancient navigator only sail along the coast not daring to pass through the main ocean have no compass nor any means of take altitude for they guidance it be not to be deny that many country island cape isthmus and point the name of which be find in history be now unknown because in course of age the force of the water have waste and consume they and have separate country from each other formerly join both in europe asia africa new spain peru and other place in he dialogue call timaeus plato say there be anciently a great country and large island in the atlantic name atlantide greater than europe and africa and that the king of these part be lord of a great part of spain but that by the force of great tempest the sea have overflow the country leave nothing but bank of mud and gravel so that no ship could pass that way for long after it be also record by pliny -lrb- 12 -rrb- that close by the island of cadiz there be a well inhabit island call aphrodisia towards the strait of gibraltar abound in garden and orchard but we have now no knowledge of this island except from the bare mention of it in ancient author the isle of cadiz be say to have be anciently so large as to join the continent of spain the aores be hold to have be a continuation of the mountain of estrellum which join the sea coast beside the town of cintra and the sierra verde or green-mountain which reach the coast near the city of _ sasin _ in the land of _ cucu _ or the island of moudim in which algarbe be situate be suppose to have reach to porto santo and madeira for it be consider as a indubitable fact that all island derive they root from the firm land or continent however distant as otherwise they could not stand firm other author say that from spain to ceuta in barbary people sometimes travel on foot on dry land that the island of corsica and sardinium be once join that sicily be unite with italy and the negropont with greece -lrb- 13 -rrb- we read also of the hull of ship iron anchor and other remnant of shipping have be find on the mountain of susa far inland where there be now no appearance of the sea have ever be many writer affirm that in indium and malabar which now abound in people the sea once reach the foot of the mountain and that cape comorin and the island of ceylon be once unite also that sumatra once join with malacca by the shoal of caypasium and not far from thence there be a small island which only a few year ago be join to the opposite coast ptolemy advance the point of malacca three or four degree to the south of the line whereas its most southerly point now call jentana be in one degree of north latitude by which people pass daily the strait of cincapura to the coast of siam and china and the island of aynan be say to have formerly join the land of china the southern extremity of which ptolomey place far to the south of the line though it now only reach to twentieth degree of north latitude it may even have be that malacca and china as ptolemy set forth extend beyond the line to the south as malacca might join with the land call jentana and the island of bintam banca and salistre and the land might be all slime and ouze likewise china might be unite with the luones borneo lequeuo mindanao and other some be of opinion that sumatra join with java across what be now the strait of sunda and that java also join with the island of balus anjave cambava solor hogalcao maulva vintara rosalaguin and other in that range all of which be so near as to appear continuous when see from a small distance and they still be so near together that in pass through the channel which divide they the bough of the tree on each side may be touch by the hand it be not long since several of the island of banda in the east be drown by the sea overflow they and in china about 180 mile of firm land be say to have become a lake all these thing be to be consider as come within the limit of probability especially when we take into account what have be relate of similar event by ptolemy and other but which i here omit to return to my subject about 800 year after the deluge the city of troy be build by the dardanian and even before that time spice drug and many other kind of merchandize which be then more abundant than now be bring from indium to europe by the red sea hence if credit can be give to these account we may conclude that the sea of old be much frequent those of the east bring they commodity to the haven of arsinoe in the arabian gulf now call suez -lrb- 14 -rrb- in lat 30  n and at the northern extremity of the arabian gulf from whence the goods be carry by caravan upon camel ass and mule to cassou a city on the coast of the levant sea in lat 32  n allow seventeen league and a half to every degree of latitude these two city be say to have be 35 league or 105 -lrb- 15 -rrb- mile distant from each other on account of the heat these caravan or great company of carrier travel only in the night direct themselves by the star and by land-mark fix in the ground for that purpose but find this journey attend with many inconveniency the course be twice alter in search of a more commodious route -lrb- 16 -rrb- about nine hundred year after the flood and previous to the destruction of troy egypt be rule by a king name sesostri who cause a canal to be cut from the red sea to that arm of the nile which flow past the city of heroum that ship might pass and repass between indium and europe to avoid the expence and trouble of carry merchandize by land across the isthmus of suez and sesostri have large carak or ship build for this purpose -lrb- 17 -rrb- this enterprize however do not completely succeed for if it have africa would have be convert into a island as there be even now only twenty league or sixty mile of land between the red sea and the mediterranean about this time the grecian gather a fleet and army call the argonautic expedition under the command of jason and alceus -lrb- 18 -rrb- some say they sail from crete and other from greece but they pass through the proponti and the _ sleeve _ of st george into the euxine where some of the vessel perish and jason return back to greece alceus report that he be drive by a tempest to the palus maeoti where he be desert by all he company and those who escape have to travel by land to the german ocean where they procure shipping and sailing past the coast of saxony friesland holland flander france spain and italy return to the peloponnesus and greece after discover a great portion of the coast of europe strabo on the authority of aristonicus the grammarian say that king menelaus after the destruction of troy sail from the grecian sea to the atlantic coast along africa and guinea double the cape bona sperana and arrive in indium -lrb- 19 -rrb- concern which voyage many other particulars might be collect from the writings of the ancient this mediterranean sea be sometimes call the adriatic the aegean and the herculean sea and have other name accord to the land coast and island which it skirt till run through the strait of hercule between spain and africa it communicate with the great atlantic ocean thirteen hundred year after the flood solomon cause a navy to be construct at ezion-geber on the red sea which sail to tharsis and ophir which some believe to have be island in the east indy this fleet be three year on its voyage and on its return bring gold silver cypress-wood and other commodity -lrb- 20 -rrb- the island to which the navy of solomon trade be probably those we now call the luones the lequeo and china for we know of few other place whence some of the thing mention as form they cargo can be have or where navigation have be so long practice necho one of the king of egypt be desirous to have join the red sea with the mediterranean and be say in history to have command some phenician to sail from the red sea by the strait of mecca and to endeavor to return to egypt by the mediterranean -lrb- 21 -rrb- this they accomplish and sail along the coast of melinda quiloa and sofalum till they reach the cape of good hope which they double and continue they course to the north they sail along the coast of guinea all the way to the mediterranean and return to egypt after two year absence be the first who have circumnavigate africa in the year 590 before the incarnation a fleet belong to carthaginian merchant sail from cadiz through the ocean to the west in search of land -lrb- 22 -rrb- they proceed so far that they come to the island now call the antille and to new spain -lrb- 23 -rrb- this be give on the authority of gonzalo fernandez de oviedo in he general history who say that these country be then discover and that christopher columbus by he voyage in after time only acquire more exact knowledge of they and have leave we a more precise notice of they situation and of the way to they but all those historian who formerly write concern the antille as of doubtful and uncertain existence now plainly allow they to be the same with new spain and the west indy in the year 520 before christ cambys king of persium conquer egypt and be succeed by darius the son of hystaspe this latter prince determine upon complete the project of sesostri and necho by digging a canal between the red sea and the nile : but be assure that the red sea be higher than the nile and that its salt water would overflow and ruin the whole land of egypt he abandon he purpose lest that fine province should be destroy by famine and the want of fresh water -lrb- 24 -rrb- for the fresh water of the nile overflow the whole country and the inhabitant have no other water to drink it may not be too great a digression from the subject to say a few word concern egypt the native allege that they have in they country certain animal of which one half of they body seem earth and the other like rat one species of which keep continually in the water while another species live on the land in my opinion it be these animal which break the serpent egg of which there be many in the nile but which serpent be also call crocodile it be say that in ancient time these animal be inchant so that they could not do harm to any one : but since they have be free from the power of inchantment by the art and learning of the egyptian decay they have do much hurt by kill people wild beast and cattle more especially those which live in the water and come often on land those that live continually on the land become strongly venomous -lrb- 25 -rrb- the people beyond the city of cairo use to catch these animal and even to eat they set up they head on the wall of the city concern these crocodile it be related -lrb- 26 -rrb- that they often lie along the shore of the river with they mouth wide open on which occasion certain white bird little larger than we thrush fly into the mouth of the crocodile and pick out the filth from between he tooth to the great delight of the crocodile which however would surely close he mouth and devour the bird have not nature provide the bird with a sharp sting grow from the top of he head which prick the roof of the crocodile mouth and force he to gape so that the bird fly away unhurt in this manner by means of a succession of these bird the crocodile get they tooth cleanse in this same river there be many beast resemble horse and upon the land there be certain bird like we crane which continually make war upon the serpent which come thither out of arabium : which bird and likewise the rat which eat the egg of the crocodile be hold in great reverence and estimation by the egyptian but now to return to my subject of discovery in the year 485 before christ xerx king of persium send he nephew sataspi to discover indium who sail from the mediterranean through the strait of hercule and pass the promontory of africa which we now call the cape of good hope but weary of the length of the voyage he return back again as bartholomew diaz do in we day -lrb- 27 -rrb- in 443 a c hamilco and hanno two carthaginian commander who govern that part of spain now call andalusium sail from thence with two squadron hamilco sailing towards the north discover the coast of spain france england flander and germany and some allege that he sail to gothland and even to thule or iceland stand under the arctic circle in 64 degree north and continue he voyage during two year till he come to that northern island where the day in June continue for twenty-two hour and the night in December be of a similar length on account of which it be there wonderfully cold he brother hanno take he course to the south along the coast of africa and guinea and discover the fortunate island now the canary and the orcade hesperide and gorgade now call the cape de verde island proceed onward hanno double the cape of good hope and go along the eastern coast of africa to another cape call aromaticum now call gardafu and thence to the coast of arabium and be five year employ in this voyage before he return to spain -lrb- 28 -rrb- other allege that hanno proceed no farther than sierra leona which he colonize and afterwards discover as far as the equinoctial line but it would rather appear from the length of time he employ that he must have accomplish the more extended navigation it be report that the inhabitant of the country at the cape of good hope be great witch and by inchantment bring certain serpent so much under command that they preserve they church churchyard garden orchard barn and cattle both from wild beast and thief when these serpent see any person do or intend to do harm they wind themselves in such a manner around they as to make they prisoner and then command they young one to give notice to they master that they may come and secure the thief but if the thief be numerous or the wild beast of too much strength so that the serpent dare not encounter they they go to they master house and if it happen to be in the night they give many stroke with they tail so as to awaken they master that they may provide for they defense -lrb- 29 -rrb- a certain italian name aloisius cadamosta relate that when he be upon the discovery of guinea and reside in the house of bisboral the grandson of king budomel he hear one night when in bed a great noise and many blow give about the house upon which bisboral arise and go out and upon he return cadamosta demand of he where he have be and he answer that he have be with he cobra or snake which call he -lrb- 30 -rrb- in the indy there be many snake and some of they very full

command i be inform by a certain portuguese who have be beyond the cape of good hope towards sofalum quiloa and melinda that there be certain bird in that country which would come to the negro on a call and as the negro move on through the wood the bird would do the same from tree to tree till at length they would alight on a tree whence they would not remove : and on examine that tree the negro be sure to find wax and honey but know not whether it grow there naturally or not -lrb- 31 -rrb- in the same country they find much wax and honey in ant-hole make by the ant but somewhat bitter in the sea of that coast there be certain fish know to the fisherman which commonly swim upright in the water have the face and breast of woman -lrb- 32 -rrb- in the year 355 before christ the spaniard be say to have go by sea to the flat of indium arabium and the adjoining coast to which they carry various merchandize in great ship and sailing to the north - west they come to certain flat which be cover by the tide and leave bare by the ebb where they catch many _ tunny _ of great size which fishing turn out to they great profit as they be very abundant and much esteem -lrb- 33 -rrb- alexander who flourish 324 year before christ travel from europe into asia and africa pass through armenia assyrium persium and bactrium whence he descend by the mountain of imaus and the vally of parapomissus into indium and prepare a navy on the river indus with which he pass into the ocean he there turn by the land of gedrosium caramanium and persium to the great city of babylon leave the command of he fleet to onesicratus and nearchus who sail through the strait of the persian sea and up the river euphrate discover the whole coast between the indus and that river after the death of alexander ptolemy become king of egypt who by some be repute to have be the bastard son of philip the father of alexander : he imitate the before name king sesostri and darius cause dig a canal from the branch of the nile which pass by pelusium now by the city of damieta -lrb- 34 -rrb- this canal of ptolemy be a hundred foot broad and thirty foot deep and extended ten or twelve league in length till it come to the _ bitter well _ he mean to have continue it to the red sea but desist on the idea that the red sea be three cubit higher than the land of egypt and would have overflow all the country to its entire ruin ptolemy philadelphus in the year 277 before christ change the direction of the indian traffic the goods from europe by he order be carry up the nile from alexandrium to the city of coptus and convey across the desert from thence to the sea-port of myos-hormo on the red-sea -lrb- 35 -rrb- to avoid the excessive heat the caravan travel only in the night direct they course by the star and water be very scarce in the desert they have to carry a sufficient quantity with they for the journey afterwards to avoid this trouble deep well be dig at certain interval and in other place large cistern or reservoir be construct for the reception of rain water still later in consideration of the danger attend the port of myos-hormo on account of flat and island philadelphus send a army into troglodytica where he construct a haven call berenice in which the ship engage in the indian commerce take shelter as a place of greater security from thence the goods be transport to the city of coptus and afterwards to alexandrium which become rich and famous through its trade with indium beyond any other city in the world insomuch that it be assert that the custom of alexandrium yield every year to ptolemy aulete the father of cleopatra seven million and a half of gold though the traffic have then scarcely subsist in that direction for twenty year -lrb- 36 -rrb- after the reduction of egypt and alexandrium under the power of the roman the custom be say to have advance to double that amount and the trade be so great that 120 ship use to be send yearly from myos-hormo to india the ship set sail every year from myos-hormo about the middle of July and return back within the year -lrb- 37 -rrb- the merchandize they carry amount to the value of one million two hundred thousand crown and the return be a hundred for one and through this prodigious increase of wealth the matron and noble lady of those day in alexandrium be exceedingly profuse in decorate themselves with purple pearl and precious stone and in the use of musk amber and other rich perfume of various kind of all which the historian and other writer of that age treat at great length -lrb- 38 -rrb- pliny -lrb- 39 -rrb- on the authority of cornelius nepo say that one eudoxus fly from ptolemy lathyrus pass by sea through the gulf of arabium and sailing along the eastern coast of africa double the cape of bona sperana arrive by the atlantic at cadiz and it would appear that this navigation be as often use in those day as it now be caius caesar the son of augustus go into arabium find in the red sea certain piece of the ship which have go thither from spain long after these day it be usual to pass to indium by land this be do by the king of the sogdian the prince of bactrium and other famous captain and many merchant who travel thither and into scythium by land marcus paulus venetus write largely of these country and though he book at first be reckon fabulous yet what he and other have report be now find true by the experience of traveller and merchant who have since be to the same part it be report that the roman send a army by sea to indium against the great khan of cathaium 200 year before the incarnation which pass through the strait of gibraltar and run to the north-west find ten island opposite to cape finisterre produce large quantity of tin which perhaps may have be those afterwards call the cassiteride be come to 50 degree of latitude they find a strait pass to the west through which they arrive in indium and give battle to the king of cathaium after which they return to rome whether this story may appear possible or not true or false i can only say that i give it as i find it write in the history of these time in the year 100 after the incarnation of christ the emperor trajan fit out a fleet on the river tigri and euphrate whence he sail to the island of zyzara and pass the strait of persium enter into the ocean by which he sail along the coast to indium till he come to the place where alexander have be he there take some ship which come from bengal and learn the state of the country from the mariner but be in year and weary of the sea and because he find it difficult to procure necessaries for he army he return back to assyrium -lrb- 40 -rrb- after the roman have subdue most part of the world many notable discovery be make but then come the goth moor and other barbarous nation who destroy all ad 412 the goth take the city of rome thereafter the vandal go out of spain and conquer africa in 450 attilum destroy many city in italy at which time venice begin and in this age the frank and vandal enter into france in 474 the empire of rome be lose and fall from the roman to the goth in 560 the lombard come into italy about this time the sect of the arian prevail greatly and merlin the english prophet flourish in 611 the mahometan sect spring up and the moresco government which invade both africa and spain by this it may appear that all the world be in a state of war and all place so very tumultuous that traffic and merchandize cease no nation daring to trade with another by sea or land nothing remain stedfast neither in kingdom signory religion law art science or navigation even the record and writings of these thing be burnt and destroy by the barbarous power of the goth who propose to themselves to begin a new world and to root out the memory and knowledge of all other nation those who succeed in the government of europe perceive the great loss of the christian world by want of traffic and the stoppage of navigation begin to devise a way of pass into indium quite different from the route of the nile and the red sea and much longer and more costly -lrb- 41 -rrb- the goods of indium be bring up the river indus as far as it be navigable they be then carry by land in caravan through the country of parapomissus into the province of bactrium and ship on the river oxus which fall into the caspian and thence across that sea to the haven of citracan or astracan on the river rha or volga thence up that river and to the city of novogrod in the province of resan which now belong to the great duke of muscovy in lat 54  n the goods be carry thence overland to the province of sarmatium and the river tanai or don which be the division between europe and asia be there load in bark they be carry down the stream of that river into the paulus maeoti to the city of caffa anciently call theodosium which then belong to the genoese who come thither by sea in _ galliass _ or great ship and distribute indian commodity through europe in the reign of commodita emperor of armenia a better course be provide for this traffic : the goods be transport by land from the caspian through the country of hiberium now georgia and thence by the phasis into the euxine and to the city of trebisond they be thence ship for the various part of europe -lrb- 42 -rrb- it be record that demetrius nicanor determine or actually begin to open a canal of above 120 mile in length between the caspian and euxine for the greater convenience of the indian trade but he be slay by ptolemy cerauno and this famous enterprize fall to nothing -lrb- 43 -rrb- all other way be lose by reason of the war of the turk the spicery of the indian island particularly of java sumatra and the city of malacca be carry up the river gange in bengal to the city of agra thence they be carry by land to another city near the indus name boghar where they be discharge because the city of cabor or laor the principal city of the mogore stand too far within the land from thence they be carry to the great city of samarcand in bactrium in which the merchant of indium persium and turkey meet together with they several commodity as cloth of gold velvet camblet scarlet and woollen cloth which be carry to cathay and the great kingdom of china whence they bring back gold silver precious stone pearl silk musk rhubarb and many other thing of great value in after time these merchandize drug and spicery be carry in ship from indium to the strait of ormus and the river euphrate and tigri and be unladen at the city of basora from whence they be carry overland to aleppo damascus and baruttus and there the venetian galliass which transport pilgrim to the holy land come and receive the goods in the year 1153 in the time of the emperor frederick barbarossa it be say there come to the city of lubeck in germany a canoe like a long barge with certain indian who be suppose to have come from the coast of baccalao -lrb- 44 -rrb- which be in the same latitude with lubeck the german greatly wonder to see such a boat and strange people not know whence they come nor be able to understand they language especially as there be then no knowledge of they country although the boat be small in comparison with the sea it have to cross it be yet possible that it might have be convey by the wind and wave for in we day the _ almadia _ of the negro which be very small boat venture to navigate from quiloa mosambique and sofala around the cape of good hope even to the island of st helena a very small spot in the ocean at a great distance from land in the year 1300 after christ the great soldan of cairo restore the trade of spicery drug and merchandize from indium by the red sea at which time they unloaded the goods at the port of judea -lrb- 45 -rrb- and carry they to mecca whence they be distribute by the mahometan pilgrim -lrb- 46 -rrb- so that each prince endeavor to increase the honor and profit of he own country the soldan translate this trade to they own city of cairo whence the goods be carry to the country of egypt lybium africa tuni tremessen fez morocco and suz and some of they be carry beyond the mountain of atla to the city of tombuto and the kingdom of the jalopho till afterwards the portuguese bring the indian trade round the cape of good hope to lisbon as we propose to shew more at large in a convenient place ad 1344 peter iv

say that fidalgo sail for 250 league along the coast of this island which be in the midway-between mindanao and china and he report that the land be fruitful and well clothe with tree and verdure and that the inhabitant will give two pezo of gold for one of silver although so near china in which the relative value of these metal be so well understand in the year 1553 certain ship be send out from

there be a wall above 200 league in length between tartary and china in about lat 50  n from all the precede discovery it may be conclude that as the whole earth be 360 degree and the ancient writer allow 17-1\/2 league for every degree the entire circuit of the earth would thus be 6300 league but as in my opinion each degree be exactly seventeen league the circuit will then be only 6120 league however this may be the whole circuit of the globe have be discover and sail over from east to west even almost as it be encompass and visit by the sun in its diurnal course it be quite otherwise however in respect to the northern and southern part of the earth for towards the north pole there have only be discover hitherto to the latitude of 77  or 78  which make a extent of 1347 league and between the equinoctial and the south pole there have only be discover to the latitude of 52  or 53  south or to the strait of magellan which amount to no more than 960 league now add these two

when we get over we have to remain a whole day on the other side to collect and replace we baggage while among the tartar they officer eye I with much attention and suspicion and during we new journey through the desert beyond the river the lithuanian ambassador inform I by means of the interpreter that the tartar officer have come to a resolution to carry I to they prince as they could not allow a

original say April but attention to the context distinctly point out this necessary correction -- e -lrb- 9 -rrb- from this circumstance it evidently appear that the journey from kiow have hitherto be

that river they have now to cross to have be somewhere about cherson -- e -lrb- 10 -rrb- name arcercheriher in the french translation of contarinus but which must necessarily be some corruption of

which they could not exist they only production consist in a small quantity of hemp and wax if they be industrious they might procure abundance of fish which be very numerous in they river they be christian accord to the greek ritual to which they have add many gross superstition i leave phasis on the 4th of July accompany by nichola capellum and cross the river _ mare _ on a float that day and the next we travel through a considerable portion of mingrelium always among wood and mountain towards the evening of the 5th we come to the habitation of prince bendian whom we find with all he court recline on a plain under the shade of some tree i send nichola capella to inform he of my quality and to ask permission to pay he my respects which be accordingly grant i salute he therefore with great respect as he sit on the ground with he wife and child and he make I sit down beside he after explain the purpose of my journey i request he would have the goodness to appoint I a guide he express he satisfaction at my arrival in he dominion and grant my request he afterwards send I some bread a piece of beef and the head of a sow but so under do that it require the extreme necessity in which we then be to induce we to eat of he provision but when we can not get what we like we must put up with what can be have we have to wait a whole day for the promise guide the plain in which we find prince bendian be surround by very fine tree resemble box but much more lofty the prince seem about fifty year of age and have a tolerably handsome countenance but he manners be perfectly ridiculous on the 7th of July we continue we journey always among wood and mountain and next day pass the river which divide mingrelium from georgium have to pass the night in the open air and what be worse we have nothing to eat on the 9th we arrive at a small city name _ cotachi _ -lrb- 3 -rrb- which be defend by a stone fort and where we see a temple that seem very ancient we have here to pass a bridge over a large river before reach the plain in which the hut of plangion king of georgium be situate the fort and city of cotachi belong to plangion i wait upon the commander of this place who invite I to dinner he be seat on the ground on which i and those of my suite who accompany I and some friend of the governor all sit down before we be lay a greasy skin on which they serve we with bread radish some flesh and other execrable article with which i be not acquaint they continually offer I wine in large goblet to fill I drunk accord to they abominable custom as they be as foolish and beastly as the mingrelian find that i would not join they in deep drinking they hold I in great contempt insomuch that i find it extremely difficult to get leave to retire and to continue my journey but at length they bring I a guide to conduct I to the king of georgium i leave cotachi on the 12th of July and after travel the whole day through wood and mountain we rest for the night in a meadow at the foot of a mountain near a castle name _ scande _ -lrb- 4 -rrb- in which king _ pangrate _ -lrb- 5 -rrb- reside my guide here leave I on purpose to inform the king of my arrival promise to return immediately with another guide to serve I during the rest of the journey we have accordingly to pass the whole night in the wood starve of hunger and full of anxiety the guide come back early in the morning accompany by two of the king secretary who inform I that the king be go to cotachi and have order they to make a inventory of all we baggage and of every thing we have about we after which we should be provide with a passport to travel free from payment of any duty through the whole country they proceed accordingly in they examination and inventory with the most rigorous exactness even note down the very shirt we then wear after this they order I to mount my horse and to go along with they to the king leave all my people behind i use my best endeavor to be excuse from this but instead of listen to I they load I with insolence and the only favor i could obtain and that with the utmost difficulty be permission to take my interpreter along with I we accordingly resume we journey without meat or drink and arrive much fatigue at cotachi towards night where my interpreter and I be leave all night to we repose under a tree where indeed they send we some bread and fish the remainder of my people be take to a miserable village where they be leave in charge of the priest and we mutual anxiety may be easily guess next morning i be carry before the king whom i find sit on the ground in a hut surround by several of he noble after pay my respects he ask I a great number of question and among the rest how many king there be in the world it come into my fancy to answer that there be twelve on which he signify that i be right and that he be one of the number and that he be much surprised that i should come into he dominion without bring he a letter from my sovereign to this i answer that when i leave my own country i do not expect to travel through he dominion otherwise my sovereign would assuredly have give I letter in charge for he majesty and with this answer he seem satisfied he ask many other extraordinary question from which i conjecture that my guide have maliciously represent I as carry many valuable thing and it be probable if this have be the case that i have never be allow to escape out of they hand the royal secretary endeavor to persuade I that i ought to make the king a present of any article that might strike he fancy among my small baggage but i get off without make any present except compliment and request he to appoint some one to conduct I through he dominion this he be please to promise as likewise to give I a free passport without pay any duty as i carry no merchandize accordingly i take my leave of the king on the 14th of July return to the tree i formerly mention as my lodging where the secretary bring I the promise passport and a guide i then return to my people at the village where they be keep in my absence and be receive with much joy as the priest have represent the king as the cruellest tyrant in the world my people could not contain themselves for excess of joy at my safe return and even the miserable priest be so touch at the scene that he provide we with something to eat and we sleep there that night as well as we could next day be the 15th of July we provide ourselves with some bread and wine to comfort ourselves on the way and resume we journey through thick forest and terrible mountain which continue for two day in the evening of the 16th we stopt near a spring where we remain during the night in the open air be oblige to light a fire on account of the coldness of the weather though in the middle of summer on the 17th of the same month we arrive at _ goride _ -lrb- 6 -rrb- which belong to the king of georgium this city be build on a plain water by a large river and be defend by a citadel which be build upon a rock we guide notify we arrival to the commandant who order we a house for we lodgings apparently for the purpose of extort a present for shortly afterwards he inform I that he have letter from the king by which he be order to receive twenty-six ducat from I for himself and that i should pay six to my guide i endeavor to evade this demand by say that the king have receive I favourably to whom i have already give seventy ducat and could not give any thing more and urge my free passport but he would listen to nothing i could urge and i be force to comply with he extortion he even detain I till the 19th of the month and even then i have extreme difficulty to get leave to depart the inhabitant of the city who deserve rather to be rank among beast look at we with as much astonishment as if they have never see any other man than ourselves they tell we that on the top of a high mountain in a neighbouring forest there be a great church in which be a image of the virgin which work many miracle and that the church be serve by forty monk whom they name _ calojerien _ -lrb- 7 -rrb- but we anxiety to get out of this abominable country prevent we from pay we devotions at that famous church georgium indeed be a somewhat better country than mingrelium but the manners of the people and they way of living be equally brutal and such be the distress and difficulty i encounter in travel through both that it would be tedious to relate they on the 20th of July we leave the abominable city of goride where we have suffer so many vexation and continue we journey through forest and over mountain occasionally fall in with village where we purchase provision we have always to pass the night on the ground near some spring or rivulet during most part of we journey through mingrelium and georgium -lrb- 1 -rrb- we have already see that it be the 16th of that month when contarinus arrive at kaffa much confusion have occur in the date of this journey which we have no means of correct and must therefore be contented with they as they be -- e -lrb- 2 -rrb- the name of place in this journal be so corrupt as to be often quite unintelligible varsus may possibly be vardon in the district to the northwest of mingrelium name abkha and caltichea may perhaps be sulhuali a sea port about 30 mile to the east phasis probably refer to some town on the river of that name perhaps subastei -- e -lrb- 3 -rrb- probably cutai in imeritium on the river riene -- e -lrb- 4 -rrb- perhaps sarassan about forty mile s e from cutais -- e -lrb- 5 -rrb- apparently the same prince name plangion a little before -- e -lrb- 6 -rrb- gorus in georgium on the river kur the journey hitherto must have be through mingrelium then apparently subject to the prince or king of georgium -- e -lrb- 7 -rrb- probably caloyer -- e section iii _ arrival of contarinus at tauri or ecbatana the royal city of uzun - hassan and continuation of he journey through persium to ispahan

decapitation of _ busech _ be represent we be again invite to a entertainment at which many different kind of confection be serve up we remain at ispahan till the 25th of November during which period we be frequently invite to court the city of ispahan like the rest of the persian city be surround by earthen-rampart it stand in a plain and be abundantly supply with all the necessaries of life have rebel against the king it be besiege and suffer much injury for be obstinately defend it be subject to the resentment of the conqueror and the fury of the soldier persium be a very flat and arid country in many part of which there be salt lake in such part as can be supply with water grain and other fruit of the earth be produce in abundance and there be plenty of beast of all kind as it be everywhere intersect and surround by fertile mountain but every thing be very dear the venetian quart of wine be sell for three or four ducat but bread be not so dear in proportion a camel load of wood cost a ducat flesh be dearer than with we and seven hen cost a ducat but other article of provision be cheaper the persian be a civil and humane people and though mahometan they do not hate the christian the woman be very modestly dress and ride on horseback with even more grace than the man and judge from the good appearance of the man the woman be probably handsome -lrb- 1 -rrb- uzun-hassan in the turkish language signify hassan the long which prince be likewise name hassan-beg or lord hassan and ozun-azembeg or the long lord azem or hassan by different european writer he name have be corrupt into unsun cassan uxun-cassan and usum - chasan he be a turkman emir of the ak-koyunla dynasty or white sheep tribe whose ancestor the governor of a province under the descendant of timor have render himself independent in the north and west of persium -- e -lrb- 2 -rrb- this prince whose real name be probably abu say be the emir of the kara-koyunla dynasty or black sheep tribe of the turkman who have rise to independence after the death of timor and who have long contend with the prince of the white sheep tribe for ascendancy these two tribe derive they distinctive appellation of the black and white weather from some peculiarity in they ensign or dress equivalent to the distinguishing uniform and banner of we european army -- e -lrb- 3 -rrb- call tebriz in modern time -- e -lrb- 4 -rrb- in the original this name be corrupt to gurlumamech but we learn from the modern universal history that he real name be that express in the text of we translation -- e -lrb- 5 -rrb- the ruin suppose to be those of persepoli be situate near istakar about forty mile north from the modern city of shiraz in the province of far or persium proper but the name in the original be often so corrupted as to defy even conjecture syla be probably mean for shira -- e -lrb- 6 -rrb- name chalus in the original but it be to be note that the _ ch _ of the italian be pronounce as _ k _ in english -- e -lrb- 7 -rrb- it be difficult to determine whether contarinus here mean maksud-beg or masih-beg as uzun-hassan have two son of these name maksad be the elder and may have be the person name in the text masu bec or beg signify lord or prince -- e -lrb- 8 -rrb- the person mention before by contarinus as a messenger from venice and whom he meet with at kaffa be name

extraordinary river so numerous in persium which lose themselves in the sand after a short but useful run -- e -lrb- 10 -rrb- about sixty mile s s e from kom i be dispose to think that contarinus have slumpt he journey on the present occasion as it be hardly to be believe a person in the weak state he describe himself could have travel with so much rapidity besides so far as we can learn from he journal he travel always with the same set of horse indeed the sequel immediately justify this suspicion as the subsequent date be more distant than the travel day of the text would warrant -- e -lrb- 11 -rrb- see travels of josaphat barbaro to asof in 1436 in we collection vol i p 501 in the introduction to which article it will be see that he have be send on a embassy from venice to uzun-hassan in 1572 two year before contarinus and appear to have remain in the east for fourteen year in that capacity after the departure of contarinus on he return to venice -- e -lrb- 12 -rrb- this nowhere distinctly appear but we may easily understand incidentally and from the history of the period that the venetian republic endeavor to stir up enemy to the turkish empire in the east be unable to resist its power now exert against they in the morea and the greek island and we may even surmise that uzun - hassan be subsidize by the venetian to make war upon the turk -- e section iv _ contarinus accompany uzun-hassan from ispahan to tauri where he find ambassador from the duke of burgundy and the prince of muscovy and get leave to return to venice _ the king leave ispahan with all he court on

persian nation be very magnificent and exceedingly fond of pomp and shew and it be very agreeable to see they march at some distance they be very careful of they camel of which they have great number

surprise at see so many additional troops come to the royal camp the better to favor this deception some of he slave exclaim as astonished that there be a great many soldier and that at least 10000 be

have a skin spread before we instead of a table-cloth and be serve with roasted meat and fowl very ill dress but by way of make amends they frequently present we with large goblet of wine as they seem to place all dignity and merit in deep drinking for this reason it be they custom at the conclusion of they meal to challenge one another to drink and he who empty the greatest number of goblet be hold in highest esteem as the turk drink no wine they presence be some restraint that day on they usual bacchanalian contest and as we neither could nor would compete with they we be hold in great contempt the king be about forty year old and of large make with a strong resemblance to the tartar countenance we part from the king of georgium next day and on the 22d of July on the confines of mingrelium we fall in with a georgian commander at the head of some troops both cavalry and infantry who be post in this place to prevent injury from the disorder that have break out in mingrelium in consequence of the death of bendian prince of that country these people stop and frighten we with many cruel menace but at length after be rob of two quiver full of arrow and have to gratify they with some money we escape from they and make the best of we way to a distance leave the public road we strike off into a thick wood where we pass the night in prodigious apprehension on the follow day while approach the city of _ cotatus _ -lrb- 2 -rrb- we meet some peasant in a narrow pass who prevent we for some time from go forwards and even threaten to put we to death after much altercation and many threat they seize three horse belong to the turk -lrb- 3 -rrb- which be with great difficulty redeem for twenty ducat on the evening we reach cutai which be a royal fortress while pass a bridge

to continue we journey after pass this bridge we enter mingrelium where we follow we wonted custom of sleep under the canopy of heaven though we have many worse inconveniency and danger to encounter : for on the 25th of July have pass over a river by means of raft we be conduct to the dwelling of a certain lady name _ maresca _ sister of the deceased prince badian who receive we at first with much civility and treat we with bread and wine after which we be conduct into a field belong to she which be close shut on all side on the morrow when we be about to depart we offer she a present of twenty ducat as a return for she hospitality which at first she pretend to refuse but we soon discover she treachery as she insist on we pay two ducat as a ransom for each of we horse we express we astonishment at this rapacity and endeavor to represent we inability to comply with such exorbitant demand but all to no purpose and we be force to comply be afraid that she might even have plunder we of every thing leave this rapacious dame we arrive at _ phasis _ on the 27th of July some on horseback and other in boat where we again lodge with _ martha _ the circassian lady whom i formerly mention after have run many risk in we journey we here learn a piece of most afflictive news that the turk have take possession of kaffa or theodosium in the crimea by which we be deprive of we last resource and shut out apparently from every hope of continue we voyage homewards we distress on receive this intelligence may easily be conceive and in fact we be so much cast down as not to know what measure to pursue or to which hand to turn we loui the patriarch of antioch resolve upon go through tartary and russium with which route he be acquaint it be to no purpose that i urge the promise we have mutually come under at the beginning of we journey never to separate on any account to this he answer that the unforeseen circumstance which have occur be a sufficient warrant to every one to consult he own individual safety i insist and beseech he not to treat I with such unfeeling cruelty but all in vain for he prepare to set off along with the turkish ambassador who have be send by uzun-hassan as he particular companion in this extremity i go to marcus ruffus and the turkish ambassador who be join with he by the king of persium to whom i mention my intention of return back to uzun-hassan they pretend to approve my plan and even to join I and we embrace as enter into promise of keep together but they secretly come to a determination of take they journey through the province of _ gorgore _ which be subject to _ calcicanus _ and to the city of _ vatus _ -lrb- 4 -rrb- which be on the frontier of the turk and pay tribute to the grand signior the patriarch set out on the 6th of August and the next day marcus ruffus follow he accompany by several russian partly on horseback and partly by means of boat they intention be to travel from vatus by shamakus anciently cyropoli and thence into tartary thus leave alone in a strange land i leave any reasonable person to think what be the embarrassment with which i be surround i be unacquainted with a single individual have no company but that of my domestic and have very little money remain in short i be reduce almost to despair of ever be able to get out of the country in this state of distress i fall into a violent fever and could get no other nourishment but bread and water and a pullet occasionally with much difficulty and my fever increase to such a degree that i become delirious all my domestic be attack soon after with the same fever the priest stephen only except who have to take care of we all my only bed be a wretched mattress which have be lend I by a person name john volcan and my life be despair of by every one till the 9th of September when by the care of stephen and of martha my good hostess or rather through the mercy of god the fever abate and i soon recover my former health to the astonishment of every one my domestic likewise recover and we begin again to consult on the best means of escape out of we present situation some propose to take the road of syrium but i deem this too dangerous and we at length come to the determination of go by shamakus into tartary and thence by russium poland and germany i get accordingly on horseback on the 10th of September but have hardly ride two mile when i be force to dismount and rest myself on the ground i be therefore oblige to return to my lodging in phasis where we remain till the 17th when be all of we restore to health and strength we again resume we journey after have implore the protection and assistance of god i now take a certain greek into my service who could speak the mingrelian language who occasion I a thousand trouble which it be tedious to recount -lrb- 1 -rrb- this in all probability be a corruption of tifli or teffliz the capital of georgium georgium which be situate on the river kur or cyrus erroneously name _ tigre _ in the text the proper name of this country be gurgi-stan or the country of the gurgus which have be corrupt by the european into georgium -- e -lrb- 2 -rrb- cutai in imeritium name cotachi on a former occasion in the text -- e -lrb- 3 -rrb- these turk must have be the persian ambassador of uzun-hassan -- e -lrb- 4 -rrb- this propose route seem to have be through the province of _ gurium _ to batum and from the sequel to have return to georgia and shirvan pass through derbent and the caspian gate or daghisten into western tartary but the name in the text be too corrupt for any certainty calcicanus in the text be probably a corruption of kalo johannes who be then prince or emperor of trebisond -- e section vi _ leave phasis contarinus travel through mingrelium and georgium into media and pass the caspian arrive in tartary _ leave phasis as before mention on the 17th of September and take the road of mingrelium we come to _ cotatus _ or cutai on the 21st of that

i could we remain two day at cutai among people who know we not and whose language we be quite ignorant of leave that place and trace back we former step we pass over several mountain in much fear and arrive at tifli on the 30th of September where we take shelter in the chapel of a certain armenian catholic who have more the appearance of a dead person than of a living man but who render we every possible service this man have a son who live with he and who unfortunately for we be seize with the plague which have rage in that part of the country this year from he one of my servant name maffeo of bergamo catch the distemper who still keep about I during two day though ill as he be my own particular domestic at length grow worse he have to take to he bed when the distemper shew itself and as he lay in the same room with I and the house could not afford I another i be force to take refuge in a hovel where some cow be keep at night and as the armenian refuse to allow maffeo to remain in he house i be constrain to take he into the same place with myself where stephen take care of he till god pleased to take he out of the world after the death of maffeo i experienced great difficulty to procure another stable for myself that i might get away from the morbid air of that in which my poor servant die in this extremity we be utterly abandon except by one old man who understand a little of we language and who serve we with much affection we remain at this place till the 21st October and on the evening before we intended departure the persian ambassador who have accompany the

as tauri but as far as i could judge surpass that place in the goodness and abundance of every thing especially in excellent cattle it produce great quantity of excellent silk of which they manufacture various kind of very slight stuff while here i have the good fortune to be rejoin by marcus ruffus the muscovite ambassador who have part from I at phasis as formerly related immediately on learn that i be in the city he come to visit I and we embrace with cordiality i now earnestly entreat he to receive I and my domestic into he society for the remainder of the journey to which he

_ sivanse _ and stand on the frontier of tartary on we journey we travel sometimes over plain and sometimes on mountain and be tolerably well treat by the turkish inhabitant with whom we lodge by the way about mid-way between these two city we come to a large village where we find great abundance of excellent fruit particularly admirable apple we arrive on the 12th of November at derbent and be advise to pass the winter in that place as it be necessary in we way to russium to cross the desert of tartary which be much easier in the spring of the year and likewise because it be proper for we to cross over the caspian to the tartar city of citracan the city of derbent be situate on the shore of the caspian which the mardian call the sea of bachaan or bacou this city be say to have be build by alexander the great and be call the _ iron gate _ because it entirely close up the only passage from tartary into media and persium by means of a deep valley reach from circassium derbent be fortify with a thick well build wall reach from the castle at the foot of the mountain all the way to the sea but not above a sixth part of the space within the wall be inhabit all that end nearest the sea be in ruin among which be several tomb the country about this city produce abundance of all kind of fruit among which be plenty of grape from which the inhabitant make wine the caspian or sea of hircanium which have no communication whatever with the ocean be about the same size with the euxine or black sea and be very deep they catch in this sea great quantity of sturgeon and sea - wolf as they be call and there be prodigious quantity of sea - dog or seal have the head foot and tail like ordinary dog the only other remarkable fish be of a round form about a yard and a half in diameter with no perceptible head or other member from which the native extract a great quantity of oil which they use in they lamp and with which they anoint they camel the inhabitant of this country who be all mahometan be neither cruel nor barbarous and use we exceedingly well have once ask we who we be and be answer that we be christian they trouble we with no farther inquiry my dress at this time consist of coarse and much worn cloth line with lamb skin above which i wear a leathern robe and my hat be of skin in which dress i frequently go to the market to purchase flesh and other provision which i carry home myself on one of these occasion a person eye I attentively and turn to some of he comrade say this man be not bear to the employment of carry meat marcus ruffus who happen to be along with I explain what the man have say and i be astonish at be recognize in so shabby a dress which i think must have prove a sufficient concealment : but in truth as i have say before they be a very good kind of people during my residence in derbent i be anxious to learn some certain intelligence respect the state of affair at the court of uzun-hassan for which purpose i send demetrius de seze my interpreter with letter to josaphat barbaro at tauri which be twenty day journey from derbent he return at the end of fifty day bring answer from barbaro inform I that the king still remain at tauri but that he be utterly ignorant of he affair spring be arrive we begin to think of pursue we journey and marcus procure a boat for transport we to _ curere _ -lrb- 3 -rrb- the boat which be use in this country be draw up on the shore all winter as the sea be then too rough for they use they be sharp at both end and wide in the middle they plank be fasten with tree-nail and they bottom pay over with pitch and as the native use no compass or other maritime instrument they always creep along the coast these boat which be very crazy and dangerous be move forwards by means of oar and the people be very ignorant of navigation though they believe themselves the best mariner in the world on the 5th of April 1475 we embark and depart from derbent be thirty-five person in all include the master of the boat and the crew the rest of the passenger be merchant carry rice silk and silken goods to _ citrarchan _ -lrb- 4 -rrb- where they propose to sell they commodity to the russian and tartar or to barter they for other article have coast along during three day with a favourable wind always keep about fifteen mile from the shore the wind become contrary on the third evening and increase during the night to so violent a tempest that we expect to have be lose although we have all reason to believe we bark would be dash to piece on the shore we make every effort to gain the land and fortunately we vessel run into a kind of ditch or dock between sand bank very near the beach where she stick fast impel by the unite force of the wind and wave and of we oar between we and the shore there be a pool through which we have to wade carry we baggage on we shoulder and we be almost perish with cold owe to the wind and we be drench with water yet we unanimously agree to refrain from make a fire lest that circumstance might attract the notice of the tartar whom we fear to meet with at day light we notice trace of horse have be on the spot and the recent fragment of a ruin skiff from which we be lead to conclude that some person must have be here but some other circumstance give we reason to believe that the tartar be not near the shore we remain undisturbed at this place till the 14th of April when the wind and weather become favourable we get we bark from the creek and again resume we voyage and advance near thirty mile the same day towards evening the wind become again contrary but we avoid the danger of a impending storm by take refuge amidst some reed among which we mariner haul the boat so as to be out of danger from the wave and we make we way to the land through the reed in do which we be much fatigued and thoroughly drench in water we rest here all that night and the day follow which be easter day have nothing on which to commemorate that festival except some butter and a few egg which we fortunately gather on the sandy beach the mariner and passenger be often inquisitive to know who i be and pursuant to the advice of marcus ruffus i pass myself among they as the physician and servant of _ despima _ the consort of the grand duke of moscovy to whom i be go a short time after this one of we mariner happen to be afflict by a large boil and come to consult I in my assumed character and as i have the good fortune to discover some oil in we bark i make a poultice for he with bread and flour by which he be soon cure from this circumstance they actually believe I to be a physician and be very anxious that i should remain among they but marcus draw I out of this difficulty by say that i have no medicinal preparation with I but would soon return from russium with a proper assortment -lrb- 1 -rrb- this name be probably corrupt for bagration or bagrathion which be once the family name of the sovereign of georgium and if i mistake not there be or be lately a prince of that family and name in the service of russium -- e -lrb- 2 -rrb- the kingdom of media in the text be obviously mean to indicate the province of shirvan on the west of the caspian -- e -lrb- 3 -rrb- perhaps saray on the eastern branch of the wolga -- e -lrb- 4 -rrb- probably astracan be here mean -- e section vii _ arrival of contarinus at citracan and journey from thence through several danger among the tartar to muscovy along with some merchant _ on the 15th of April we put again to sea with a favourable wind and coast along a series of reedy island we arrive on the 26th of that month at the mouth of the wolga a large river which flow from russium into the caspian from the mouth of this river it be compute to be seventy-six mile to the city of citracan -lrb- 1 -rrb- which we reach on the 30th near this city there be excellent _ saline _ -lrb- 2 -rrb- from which all the neighbouring province be supply with salt the tartar who command in the city would not permit we to enter that evening so that we have to pass the night in a hut without the wall in the morning three broad - face tartar come and order we to go along with they to they prince they treat marcus with respect say that he be a friend of they sovereign but allege that i be he slave as they consider all the frank or christian as they enemy these news be most cruelly mortify for I and afflict I severely but i be oblige to submit in spite of I and marcus advise I to allow he to speak for I force in this manner to return disconsolate to my hut i be long expose to every indignity and danger to my great mortification and distress the tartar insist that i be possess of pearl and even plunder I of some merchandize i have purchase in derbent intend to have barter it in this place for a good horse to carry I during the rest of my journey they inform I afterwards by means of marcus that they intend to sell we all to certain people whom they wait for and who be to go into muscovy with other merchant after many mortification and distress it be resolve to hold a grand consultation concern we at a large village name _ alermus _ about two mile from the city where they lord reside at this time i be not possess of a single farthing and be oblige to borrow money from the russian and tartar merchant at a high interest to supply we urgent necessity for which marcus become my bondsman one day while marcus be absent the khan or prince of the tartar -lrb- 3 -rrb- break open the door of we hut and endeavor to compel I by threat to deliver up the pearl which he believe i be possess of and i have infinite difficulty to escape out of he hand and to persuade he not to put I to death the tartar use often to come to we hut in the night when drunk with mead demand with loud outcry to deliver up the frank to they and the bravest among we be terrify at the dangerous situation in which we be among these savage in this horrible situation we remain from the 1st of may to the 10th of August the city of citracan belong to three brother who be son to the brother of the tartar emperor and the inhabitant often make plunder inroad into the plain of _ cinassium _ -lrb- 4 -rrb- and along the border of the don during the height of summer they travel with they flock in search of pasturage to the northern part of russium and hardly spend above a month every year in citracan that city which stand on the bank of the wolga be by no means large its house be build of earth : it be surround by a slight wall and do not appear to have have any better building for a long time past it be say to have have a very considerable fair formerly and that the perfume and spicery which use to be bring to venice come first to this place from the east whence they be carry to the tanai or don which be only eight day journey from the wolga the prince of citracan whose name be _ casinach _ send every year a ambassador to the grand duke of muscovy on purpose to extort a present and on this occasion several tartar merchant accompany the ambassador carry silk silken vestment and other article of trade which they barter for saddle fur and other thing which be in request among they countryman the only way of travel into russium from this place be through extensive desert on which account traveller have to go in large band or caravan for mutual security and to carry provision for the journey the tartar care little for the latter precaution as they have always plenty of spare horse and kill one when need as they live entirely on flesh and milk without care for any other food they use no bread and only a few of they merchant who have be in russium know any thing of this article previous to the commencement of we journey -lrb- 5 -rrb- we provide provision for the journey as well as we could in this view we procure some rice with much difficulty which boil in milk and then dry in the sun make when afterwards boil in water a excellent and nourishing food we have likewise some onion a small quantity of biscuit and some other trifle and i buy during the journey the salted tail of a sheep -lrb- 6 -rrb- the usual road from citracan to russia lay between two branch of the wolga but the road be then exceedingly dangerous as the tartar emperor be then at war with he nephew who pretend a right to the throne as he father have once be emperor on this account it be propose to pass over to the other side of the river and to travel towards the strait between the don and the wolga which be about five day journey from citracan after which it be presume we should be out of danger we baggage be accordingly carry across the river on raft and marcus desire I to keep always along with he and the tartar ambassador name _ auchiolus _ i and my interpreter accordingly set out about mid-day along with the ambassador to go to the place where the boat wait for we which be about twelve mile from the city we other companion have already go there on we arrival about sunset while i prepare to go into one of the boat on purpose to cross the river marcus seem suddenly strike with a extraordinary panic and command the interpreter and I to take to flight instantly to avoid inevitable danger we mount therefore immediately have likewise a russian woman along with we and a tartar guide of a most horrible aspect and set out at full speed in this manner we follow we guide the whole of that night and part of the next day without be ever allow to stop i frequently ask we guide by means of my interpreter what be the reason of all this and where he propose to carry I at length he explain the cause of marcus have make we set off with such precipitation as the khan have send a order to examine all the boat and he be apprehensive they would have detain I as a slave if i have be find about mid-day of the 13th of August 1475 we arrive at the bank of the river and we tartar guide endeavor to find a boat in which to carry we into a island in which the flock of auchiolus be keep but not find one he cut down some branch which he tie together so as to form a raft on this he place the saddle of we horse and tie this raft to he horse tail he mount the horse on which he swim across the river to the island which lay a bow-shot from the shore he then come back with the raft on which he carry over the russian woman after which he come back for I and i strip myself naked before trust myself to the crazy raft that i might be in readiness to save myself by swim in case of any misfortune he afterwards return for we horse and my interpreter swim across the passage of the river be thus happily effect the tartar carry we to a wretched hovel cover by a miserable woollen cloth where he give we some sour milk which we find very refreshing as we have be long without food and be much fatigue immediately on we arrival in the island be know several tartar leave they flock to come and see we seem infinitely surprized and much gratify by the sight as we be probably the first christian who have ever be on the island be exceedingly fatigued and distressed in mind i do not care to speak with they yet we tartar guide treat I with much kindness and make I as good cheer as he be able next day be the eve of the festival of the virgin he kill a fat lamb to entertain I part of which he roasted and part be boil and though contrary to the rule of we religion to eat meat on that day i make a hearty meal notwithstanding that every thing be disgustingly dirty we have likewise sour milk to drink and the tartar drink mare milk of which they be very fond but i would not drink this though i could easily perceive my dislike do not please the tartar i remain here two day and at last on the 26th of August marcus and the rest make they appearance on the other side of the river and send a boat for I in which be two of he servant a russian and a tartar stephen testa and john ungaret my two attendant be very much rejoice at see I again as they believe I entirely lose and we rest two day at this place before enter upon the desert marcus have be so attentive as to provide a horse for I of which i stand in great need in this caravan which be under the command of the tartar ambassador there be about three hundred person russian and tartar who carry with they above two hundred -lrb- 7 -rrb- horse partly intend to serve as food by the way and partly for sale in russium we arrive in good order at night on the bank of the river and we rest every day at noon during the fifteen day of we journey as we be now consider to be out of danger from any attack by the tartar i do not recollect the name of the emperor of the tartar who inhabit this part of the country between the wolga and the tanai this nation have no fixed place of abode but shift they encampment from place to place wherever they can find pasture and water for they cattle on which they have they whole dependence as they subsist entirely on flesh and milk they have cow heifer and sheep of admirable beauty the flesh of which be excellent as they feed on fine pasture but these people prefer mare milk to every other delicacy though i have not be in the country of these tartar i have be inform that it be flat and agreeable have neither hill nor mountain but the inhabitant addict themselves excessively to robbery and plunder as they sole occupation and continually infest the border of russium and circassium by predatory incursion they horse be very wild and unmanageable and be never shoe we be tell that there be another tribe of tartar beyond the wolga name wild tartar who allow they hair to grow extremely long in the middle of winter they often make inroad to the very skirt of the city of citracan whence they carry off cattle but do no other damage these people like all the tartar shift they encampment in search of pasturage and water after travel for fifteen day along the eastern bank of the wolga we come to a small forest where the tartar and russian of the caravan cut down tree to construct raft for cross the river while they be at this work we discover a small bark which be by no means in good repair by means of which we company propose to convey we baggage across marcus cross over with a part of we baggage leave I in charge of the rest and send back the boat when he be land in my trip with the remainder of we baggage the boat begin to leak when we be about half way over the breadth of the river at this place be about two mile stephen and two russian accompany I in the boat leave demetrius my interpreter and john ungar in charge of the horse we have much ado to bale out the water but by the blessing of god we get over in safety after we baggage be land the russian put off to go back for the rest of we people and the horse but the boat fall to piece this necessarily delay we other servant and the horse from get over till next day during which interval they be badly off as all we provision be on we side it be fortunate that i now examine the state of we provision which i find diminish much beyond expectation so that we be under the necessity of abridge we allowance for the remainder of the journey that we might not run short altogether we principal food consist of millet with garlic and onion and some sour milk and we find some wild apple at this place which we roasted in the course of two day the whole baggage of the caravan be transport to the western side of the river by means of seven raft draw by horse and direct by the tartar the horse swimming and have the raft tie to they tail the sight of this be very amusing but seem very dangerous to those who be employ after rest some time we quit the bank of the river and resume we journey this river wolga be certainly the largest and deepest river in the world be as well as i could judge two mile broad and have very high bank -lrb- 1 -rrb- call citrarchan in the former section but certainly what we now call astracan then the capital of a tartar principality which now form one of the province of the vast russian empire -- e -lrb- 2 -rrb- these be large shallow pond in which sea water be expose to evaporation to procure salt -- e -lrb- 3 -rrb- in the original this person be call the cham of the _ camercherien _ the tartar government of astracan belong to one of the mongal tribe of kipschak but the word use in the original may have be a local term not now explicable -- e -lrb- 4 -rrb- perhaps the kingdom or province of cazan higher up the wolga -- e -lrb- 5 -rrb- contarinus have forget to give we any account in what manner he procure leave to quit astracan perhaps by means of marcus he be permit to pass for one of he attendant -- e -lrb- 6 -rrb- it may be necessary to remark that the tail of a peculiar species of sheep o platyurus or the broad-tailed sheep common among the tartar and other part of the world be say sometimes to weigh twenty-five pound -- e -lrb- 7 -rrb- probably a error for 2000 -- e section viii _ contarinus after cross european sarmatium arrive at moscow the capital of white russium and be present to the grand duke _ after recommend ourselves to the protection of god we continue we journey through immense and terrible desert sometimes towards the north and sometimes westerly -lrb- 1 -rrb- always rest at noon and take up we quarter for the night on the bare ground without any protection against the weather to prevent we from be surprize in the night by the wander tartar outguard be place every night in three direction around we resting-place during the greater part of this long and dreary journey we be very ill off for water both for ourselves and we cattle and we never see any wild animal one day we see about forty horse which we be tell have escape from a caravan of merchant the year before we fall in one day with a small horde of tartar have twenty waggon but i be not able to learn where they be go as we provision decrease rapidly we be force to use the remainder very sparingly and be consequently reduce to a very short allowance on the 22d of September 1475 we enter russium and discover a few hut in the middle of a wood on the inhabitant learn that marcus they countryman be in we caravan they come to see he that he might protect they from the tartar and bring he a present of honey and wax a part of which he give to we this be a most providential supply as we be so much reduce by fatigue and spare diet that we be hardly able to sit on horseback the first city we come to in this country be _ rezan _ -lrb- 2 -rrb- the prince of which place have marry a sister of the grand duke of russium the castle and all the house of this city be build of wood we here procure bread and meat and mead in abundance to we great comfort and satisfaction the next city we come to be _ kolomna _ pass a very large bridge over the _ monstrus _ -lrb- 3 -rrb- which flow into the wolga at this place marcus quit the caravan which travel too slowly in he opinion and push on for moscow where we arrive on the 26th of September after a journey of forty-seven day through the desert from the 10th of August on which day we leave citracan in a great part of this journey we find no wood and be force to cook we victuals with fire make of dry cow dung we return thanks to god on we arrival for we preservation through so many and great danger on we arrival marcus procure a dwelling for we consist of a small stove - room and some chamber with stable for we horse though small and mean i feel as if lodge in a palace when i compare my present state of tranquil security with the danger and inconvenience i have be so long subject to marcus make I a visit two day afterwards and supply I with some necessaries exhort I as on the part of he sovereign to keep a good heart i return he visit next day and be very desirous to return home to venice i request he to introduce I to the grand duke which he promise to do as soon as possible and i soon afterwards be desire to go to court immediately on my get there i be conduct to a audience on which i make my obeisance in due form to the grand duke to whom i return thanks for all the attention i have receive from he ambassador marcus in the course of my journey by whose assistance and advice i have escape a thousand danger assure he highness that i attribute these mark of kindness as do to the republic of venice whose ambassador i be and that the republic would unquestionably evince a due sense of the obligation to which i owe my life and safety the grand duke interrupted my harangue by complain with much emotion of the conduct of _ john baptista _ of treviso and say a great deal on this subject which be not proper for I to report after a conversation of some length in which i speak to he highness about my departure he close my audience postpone he answer to my request to a future opportunity the grand duke be very shortly to quit moscow on purpose to visit several part of he dominion and particularly the tartar frontier where one of he officer be station with the command of 500 horse -lrb- 4 -rrb- to repress the incursion of robber on that side : i therefore endeavor to procure a answer about my departure and solicit a second audience for that purpose on this occasion i be very politely receive by the grand duke accompany by three of he principal baron at first they expatiate at some length on the subject of john baptista formerly mention but at length i receive liberty to remain or to depart as i think proper they dismiss I with this vague answer and the grand duke set out from moscow soon afterwards i owe a great deal of money to marcus which he have expend for I and my people as he have defray the whole expence of we journey and have supply I with many thing of which i stand in need i request permission from he to go away give he the most solemn assurance that i would transmit full payment to he immediately after my arrival at venice but he declare this be not in he power as he be under the necessity of repay the tartarian and russian merchant who have advance all these thing for we and to whom he have become security for payment finding every application to the duke and marcus on this subject ineffectual as i could not procure the necessary fund for my journey from either i be under the necessity of send stephen testa to venice to solicit a remittance from we illustrious senate by which i might be enable to pay my debt stephen left moscow on the 7th of October accompany by one _ nicola leopolitain _ -lrb- 5 -rrb- who know the country i become acquaint at moscow with one triphon a goldsmith a native of ascravium or cathara who be employ in make several article of silver plate for the grand duke i likewise form acquaintance with a very ingenious architect of bologna name aristotle who be build a new church in the market-place as the house in which i lodged be small and disagreeable i go to live with this person by the advice of marcus : but i be soon after oblige to change my quarter by order from court to a house near the castle in which i remain for the rest of my stay at moscow this city which be the capital of the russian dominion and the residence of the grand duke or sovereign be build on a small elevation on the bank of the mosqua over which there be several bridge the castle and all the house of the city be build of wood which be procure from several thick forest near the place the soil of this country be fertile and produce abundance of corn of all kind which sell here much cheaper than with we the country abound in cattle and swine and with incredible number of poultry duck goose and hare but they have no venison either because there be no deer or because the native be ignorant of the art of take they but they have no vine and they only fruit be cucumber wild apple and nut the country be extremely cold and the inhabitant be under the necessity of live for nine month of the year in stove they provide during winter for they living in summer -lrb- 6 -rrb- when the whole country be envelop in frost and snow they use sledge draw by horse which be very convenient and useful for travel and be even use in summer on account of the miry bad road which be exceedingly difficult and unpleasant the river ordinarily freeze over about the end of October when the merchant erect booth on the ice in which they expose they wares of all kind for sale as in a fair or market and they here sell great number of cattle and swine and great quantity of corn timber and all other necessaries of life every thing be procurable in great abundance all the winter about the end of November they kill all the cattle sheep and other animal that be require for winter provision and expose they for sale on the river in a frozen state and the rigor of the season preserve these provision for two or three month without any risk of spoil fish poultry and all other article of food be keep in the same manner the horse run with great ease and swiftness on the ice yet they sometimes fall and break they neck both man and woman of this country have very good face but they manners be exceedingly bad the russian church be rule over by a patriarch whose election or appointment be dependent on the grand duke and who do not acknowledge subjection to the roman pontiff and they hold all sectary in abhorrence as people doom to perdition the native be much addict to drunkenness and he who excel in drinking be much esteem among they they have no wine as i have say before instead of which they drink mead make of honey and water which be very pleasant when sufficiently keep it be not allow to every one to make this liquor for which purpose a license or permission must be have from the grand duke for if every person have liberty to make mead they would drink perpetually like so many beast and would kill one another from morning till noon they be employ in the market-place occupy in they various business and employment after which they adjourn to the tavern in which they spend all the rest of the day every winter great number of merchant come to moscow from germany and poland who purchase fur of all kind which be indeed exceedingly beautiful among these fur be the skin of fox wolf martin sable ermine and many other from scythium and the alpine region many day journey to the north of moscow many of these be likewise carry for sale to novogorod -lrb- 7 -rrb- a city towards the frontier of germany eight day journey west from moscow the government of that city be democratic and only pay a stipulate yearly tribute to the grand duke the country subject to the grand duke of russium be of vast extent and a infinite number of people be subject to he dominion but they be by no means warlike this empire extend from the north towards the west to that part of germany which be under the dominion of the king of poland -lrb- 8 -rrb- and some reckon among he subject a wander nation of idolater who acknowledge no sovereign not even submit to the authority of the grand duke but when it suit they own convenience these wander tribe be say to worship during the day whatever first present itself to they view on go out in the morning many other ridiculous thing be report of they which i do not repeat as i have not see they and can hardly give credit to the report the grand duke -lrb- 9 -rrb- appear to be about thirty-five year of age be handsomely make and have very dignified manners and a air quite royal he mother be still alive and he have two brother by a former wife he have two son who do not agree with despina the reign grand duchess and be not therefore on very friendly term with they father despina he second wife have bring he two daughter and be say to be again with child the grand duke return to moscow from he journey to the frontier about the end of December and as i could not reconcile myself to the manners and mode of life of the russian i become exceedingly impatient to leave the country and could not persuade myself to stay for the return of stephen from venice with money for this reason i make interest with one of the lord of the court to prevail on the grand duke to supply I with money and to give I leave to depart a few day afterwards the grand duke send for I to court and invite I to dinner when he agree from respect to the republic to lend I as much money as be necessary to clear all my debt to the tartarian and russian merchant and to enable I to return to venice the dinner be quite magnificent consist of every delicacy and of abundance of exquisitely dress dish when the repast be finish i retire accord to custom some day afterwards i be again invite to court and the grand duke give order he treasurer to give I all the money necessary for pay my debt besides which he present I with 1000 ducat and a magnificent dress of scythian squirrel skin to wear in he presence when i come to court before return to my quarter he order I to be present to the grand duchess who receive I very graciously and desire I to offer she respectful salutation to we illustrious republic which i promise to do -lrb- 1 -rrb- this journey appear to have be through the country on the west of the wolga which they probably pass about czariein through the province of saratov woronez and penza avoid the ilaflum to rezan or riazan -- e -lrb- 2 -rrb- rezan or riazan in the province of that name on the oka in a considerable part of the track of this journey there be now town and village but the whole of this south-eastern frontier of european russium appear to have be then entirely waste and pervade by the wander tartar we be quite in the dark respect the particulars of the route from astracan to rezan it be certainty on the east of the wolga at the first to avoid the tartar which occupy the country between the caspian and euxine the passage of that vast river may have be at czariein at its great elbow in lat 48  30 'n or about saratov in 51  20 'n neither of which town seem to have then exist from thence they would probably proceed to avoid the larger river between where penza and tchenbar now stand and by the scite of morbansk towards riazan -- e -lrb- 3 -rrb- in the original this large bridge be say to have be at kolomna which be on the river mosqua of very inferior magnitude and flow into the oka which most probably be the monstrus of the text -- e -lrb- 4 -rrb- in the original the commander of this body of cavalry be say to have be a tartarian general -- e -lrb- 5 -rrb- the word leopolitain may possibly be a corruption for neopolitan or a native of naple perhaps it may refer to leopol in that part of poland now belong to austria and call galicium -- e -lrb- 6 -rrb- such be the expression in the original which ought perhaps to be reverse yet contarini possibly mean to say that the inhabitant of moscow lay up a sufficient stock of money from the profit of they long winter labor for they subsistence during summer when by the absence of the court they have little employment -- e -lrb- 7 -rrb- there be two city name novogrod or novgorod in russium nearly at equal distance from moscow one to the northwest and the other to the southwest the latter of which name novgorod sieverskov be probably mean in the text and which ought rather to have be describe as towards the frontier of poland the other novgorod do not then belong to the russian sovereignty -- e -lrb- 8 -rrb- the geographical idea of contarinus be very vague and superficial this be perhaps the only instance wherein poland a portion of european sarmatium be consider as belong geographically to germany -- e -lrb- 9 -rrb- the reign sovereign of russium at the period be john iii who begin to reign in 1463 and be succeed in 1505 by basil iv -- e section ix _ contarinus leave moscow and have pass through lithuanium poland and germany arrive at venice _ on the day before that which i have fix for my departure i be invite to dine at court before dinner i be take into one of the hall of the palace where i find the grand duke accompany by marcus and a secretary he highness address I very graciously and desire I to report all the mark of esteem and friendship he have shew I from respect to we illustrious republic and offer I every thing i could desire and which lay in he power to grant while speak i draw back from respect but as i retire he always advance i answer every thing to he satisfaction and humbly offer my most grateful thanks for all he benevolence to I he treat I with the utmost politeness and familiarity and even condescend to shew I some robe of gold tissue magnificently line with scythian sable after which we go to dinner the repast be extraordinarily magnificent at which several of the baron and great officer of state assist when we rise from table the grand duke call I to he and give I my audience of leave in the most gracious term speak so loud as to be hear by all the company and express he high esteem for the illustrious republic of venice after this by he order a silver cup be bring to I fill with mead of which he make I a present as a mark of high regard with which he honor ambassador and other person to whom he shew favor this present be to I a matter of very serious consideration as the etiquette require I to empty its contents and the cup be very large when i have drain about a quarter of the liquor know the sobriety of the italian and perceive that i be much difficult the grand duke have the goodness to order the remainder to be empty and the goblet give to I have thank the grand duke in as respectful term as i be able i take my leave and retire accompany by several baron and other person of rank every thing be now in readiness for my departure but marcus would by no means hear of my leave moscow without take a dinner with

of don henry -lrb- 1 -rrb- introduction the knowledge possess by the ancient respect indium will be the subject of discussion in a future portion of this work we have now to contemplate the tedious yet finally successful effort of the portuguese nation in its age of energetic heroism to discover a maritime passage to that long famed commercial region some general knowledge of which have be preserve ever since the day of the persian macedonian and roman empire of all the great event which have occur in the modern age previous to we own time the voyage and discovery which be make by the european in the fifteenth and sixteenth century of the christian era be justly entitle to preference whether we appreciate the vast improvement which they make in navigation and consequently in commerce -- the astonishing abundance of wealth which they bring into europe -- the surprising feat of bravery which be perform in they various expedition and conquest -- the extensive populous and valuable territory which be subdue or colonize -- or the extended knowledge which be suddenly acquire of the greater part of the earth till then either altogether unknown or very partially and erroneously describe by these discovery we allude to those of the southern and western hemisphere a new heaven and a new earth be open up to the astonishment of mankind who may be say to have be then furnish with wing to fly from one end of the earth to the other so as to bring the most distant and hitherto utterly unknown nation acquaint with each other in the ordinary course of human affair it have be observe that similar event frequently occur but the transaction of these time which we now propose to narrate be as singular in they kind as they be great surprising and unexpected neither can any such ever happen again unless providence be to create new and accessible world for discovery and conquest or to replunge the whole of mankind for a long period into the grossest ignorance the merit and glory of these wonderful achievement be unquestionably due to the portuguese nation and the first and principal share to the sublime genius of they illustrious prince the infant don henry _ duke of viseo and grand master of the order of christ _ whose enlarged mind first plan the fitting out of maritime expedition for discovery and by the imitation of whose example all subsequent discovery have be accomplish every thing of the kind before he time be isolate or accidental and every subsequent attempt have be pursue on scientific or known principle which he invent and establish although america be discover by columbus in the service of spain some year before the portuguese be able to accomplish they long seek route to indium and although the discovery of america be perform infinitely quicker than that of southern africa and the route to indium columbus have accomplish he design at the very first attempt and even without any previous knowledge of the country he go in search of while the endeavor of the portuguese occupy a great number of year in almost fruitless attempt and extremely tedious progression yet don henry first set on foot the navigation of the ocean through unknown sea and inspire other nation with the idea of make discovery of distant and unexplored region and ultimately great as be the discovery of columbus they may be say to have be accidentally make in the erroneous attempt to go by a nearer route to the region of which don henry and he successor have long be in search these attempt of the portuguese have be continue for nearly fourscore year before any of they neighbor seem to have entertain the most distant idea of engage in foreign discovery even view they endeavor as downright knight-errantry proceeding from a distempered imagination as well in the first promoter as in those who continue to prosecute he scheme in a word the relation of these discovery form one of the most curious portion of modern history as comprize a great number of the most extraordinary transaction that ever happen in any period of the world for this reason they be well worthy of be particularly narrate that the curious may be make acquaint with every successive step in such important enterprize and by what almost insensible degree such vast undertaking be ultimately accomplish and as the intercourse of european have operate a great change in the country to which they penetrate and upon they original inhabitant so that both now appear in a very different light from what they do before these expedition and discovery therefore every circumstance belong to these transaction deserve the most serious notice john 1 of portugal married philippa the eldest daughter of john of gaunt duke of lancaster son to edward iii of england by whom he have several son of whom don henry be the _ fifth _ after serve with great bravery under he father at the capture of ceuta he be raise to the dukedom of viseo and be send back with a large reinforcement to preserve the conquest to which he courage have largely contribute during he continuance in command at ceuta he acquire much information by occasional converse with some moor relative to the sea and coast of western africa which raise and encourage the project of maritime discovery and these become afterwards the favorite and almost exclusive pursuit of he active and enlarged mind from the moor he obtain intelligence respect the nomadic tribe who border upon and pervade the great desert and of the nation of the jaloof whose territory be conterminous with the desert on the north and guinea to the south by one ingenious author -lrb- 2 -rrb- he have be suppose instigate to he first attempt at maritime discovery by the desire of find a way by sea to those country from whence the moor bring ivory and gold dust across the desert it unfortunately happen that we have no record of the particular voyage themselves and be therefore reduce to the necessity of

discovery undertake by the portuguese or by any other nation in modern time the commander be instruct to endeavor to follow the western coast of africa to the southward of cape chaunar call by the portuguese mariner cape nao non or nam which extend itself from the foot of mount atla have hitherto be the _ non plus ultra _ or impassable limit of european navigation and have accordingly receive its ordinary name from a negative term in the portuguese language as imply that there be no navigation beyond and respect which a proverbial say be then current of the follow import : whoe'er would pass the cape of non shall turn again or else be go the success of this earliest voyage fit out for the purpose of discovery be not record but don henry continue to send some vessel every year to the same coast with the same instruction of endeavor to explore the coast beyond cape non not daring to trust themselves beyond sight of land the mariner creep timorously along the coast and at length reach cape bojador only sixty league or 180 mile beyond cape non this cape which stretch boldly out into the ocean from which circumstance it derive its name -lrb- 1 -rrb- fill the portuguese mariner with terror and amazement owing to the shoal by which it be environ for the space of six league be perpetually beat by a lofty and tremendous surge which preclude they from all possibility of proceed beyond it in they ordinary manner of creep along the coast and they dare not to stretch out into the open sea in quest of smoother water lest lose sight of land altogether they might wander in the trackless ocean and be unable to find they way home it be not impossible that they might contemplate the imaginary terror of the torrid zone as hand down from some of the ancient with all its burning soil and scorching vapor and they might consider the difficulty of cape bojador as a providential bar or omen to warn and oppose they against proceed to they inevitable destruction they accordingly measure back they wary step along the african coast and return to portugal where they give a account of they proceedings to don henry in which of course the danger of the newly discover cape would not be diminish in they narrative -lrb- 2 -rrb- return from ceuta where he presence be no longer necessary and where he have mature he judgment by intercourse with various learn man whom he bounty have attract into africa and have enlarged he view by the perusal of every work which tend to illustrate the discovery which he project don henry fix he residence at the romantic town of sagre in the neighborhood of cape st vincent where he devote he leisure to the study of mathematics astronomy cosmography and the theory of navigation and even establish a school or academy for instruct he countryman in these science the parent of commerce and the sure foundation of national prosperity to assist he in the prosecution of these he favorite study he invite from majorca a person name diego or jame who be singularly skilful in the management of the instrument then employ for make astronomical observation at sea and in the construction of nautical chart some trace of nautical discovery along the western coast of africa still remain in ancient author particularly of the report voyage of menelaus hanno eudoxus and other from a attentive consideration of these don henry and he scientific coadjutor be encourage to hope for the accomplishment of important discovery in that direction and they be certainly incite in these view by the rooted enmity which have so long rankle among the christian inhabitant of spain and portugal against the moor who have formerly expel they ancestor from the greatest part of the peninsula and with whom they have wage a incessant war of several century in recover the country from they grasp section ii _ discovery of the madeira island _ after some time usefully employ in acquire and diffuse a competent knowledge of cosmopographical nautical and astronomical science don henry resolve to devote a considerable portion of the revenue which he enjoy as grand master of the order of christ in continue and extend those project of nautical discovery which have long occupy he attention accordingly about the year 1418 a new expedition of discovery be fit out for the express purpose of attempt to surmount the peril of cape bojador in this expedition juan gonzale zarco and tristan vaz texeira two naval officer of the household of don henry volunteer they service and embark in a vessel call a _ barcha _ -lrb- 3 -rrb- steer for the tremendous cape the portuguese be hitherto ignorant of the prevail wind upon the coast of africa and the cause by which they influence be varied or increase near the land and between the latitudes of 28  and 10  north a fresh gale almost always blow from the ne long sand-banks which extend a great way out to sea and which be extremely difficult to be distinguish in the morning and evening and the prevail current be powerful obstacle to the enterprise of these navigator about six league off cape bojador a most violent current continually dash upon the breaker which present a most formidable obstacle to the brave but inexperienced mariner though they voyage be short they encounter many danger and before they could reach the cape they be encounter by a heavy gale from the east by which the billow of the atlantic become too heavy to be resist by they small vessel and they be drive out to sea on lose sight of they accustomed head land and be force into the boundless ocean for the first time the ship company give themselves up to despair but on the abatement of the tempest they find themselves unexpectedly within view of a island situate about 100 league west from the coast of africa with extreme joy they behold the coast of this island extend about twenty mile in length to which they give the name of puerto santo because first discover upon the feast of all saint this be the smaller of the madeiras be only about two mile broad and as the only roadstead be upon the south-west side the portuguese probably anchor upon that side to be under the lee shelter of the island from the remnant of the tempest from which they have happily escape the island of _ puerto santo _ or of the holy haven be almost directly west from cape cantin whence it would appear that these portuguese navigator could hardly have pass much beyond cape de geer when drive off the coast by this fortunate easterly tempest have they even advance as far as cape non they would almost certainly have be drive among the canary it be perfectly obvious that they never even approach cape bojador in this voyage unless we could suppose after have be drive directly west from that cape that they shape a northern course after the subsidence of the tempest and fall in with puerto santo while on they return to portugal greatly pleased with the soil and climate of this island and with the gentle manners of the native whom they describe as in a intermediate state of civilization and entirely destitute of any appearance of savage ferocity zarco and vaz immediately return to portugal where they make a report of the incident of they voyage and to confirm they opinion of the value of they discovery they request permission from don henry to return for the purpose of establish a settlement in puerto santo by this discovery a advanced and favourable station be secure towards the south whence any discovery along the coast of africa might be prosecute with greater ease and safety and from whence the danger of the hitherto formidable cape bojador might be avoid by keep a southerly or s w course from puerto santo from these consideration don henry grant they request and yield to the adventurous spirit which this accidental discovery have excite he permit several person to join in a new project voyage among whom be bartholomew perestrello a nobleman of he household three vessel be soon fit out -lrb- 4 -rrb- which be place under the respective command of zarco vaz and perestrello these commander have order to colonize and cultivate the newly discover island and be furnish with a considerable assortment of useful seed and plant for that purpose they happen likewise to take with they a female rabbit great with young which litter during the voyage and which be let loose with she progeny multiply so rapidly that in two year they become so numerous as to occasion serious injury to the early attempt at cultivation and to baffle every hope of render puerto santo a place of refreshment for the portuguese navigator insomuch that a resolution be form to abandon the newly establish settlement after have land the different animal and seed which have be send out by don henry and see they properly distribute perestrello return into portugal to make a report to the prince and zarco and vaz remain to superintend the infant colony soon after the departure of perestrello the attention of zarco and vaz be strongly excite by observe certain cloud or vapor at a great distance in the ocean which continually present the same aspect and preserved exactly the same bearing from puerto santo and at length occasion a conjecture that the appearance might proceed from land in that quarter gonsalvo and vaz accordingly put to sea and sail towards the suspected land and soon discover that the appearance which have attract they notice actually proceed from a considerable island entirely overgrow with wood to which on that account they give the name of madeira -lrb- 5 -rrb- after bestow considerable attention upon the soil and other circumstance of this island which be utterly destitute of inhabitant gonzalvo and vaz return to portugal with the welcome intelligence and give so favourable a report of the extent fertility and salubrity of madeira that don henry determine to colonize and cultivate it accordingly with the consent of the king of portugal the island of madeira be bestow in hereditary property upon zarco and vaz one division name _ funchal _ be give to zarco and the other moiety name _ machico _ to vaz in the year 1420 zarco begin the plantation of madeira and be much impede in he progress by the immense quantity of thick and tall tree with which it be then everywhere encumber he set the wood on fire to facilitate the clearing of the surface for cultivation the wood be report to have continue burn for seven year -lrb- 6 -rrb- and so great be the devastation as to occasion great inconvenience to the colony for many year afterwards from the want of timber don henry appear to have be a prince of most uncommonly enlarged and liberal view not only capable of devise the means of make maritime discovery which have never be think of before he time but of estimate they value when make and of apply they to purpose the most useful and important for he country reflect upon the report fertility of the soil and the excellence of the climate of madeira and compare both with the judicious foresight of a philosopher politician and naturalist in reference to the most valuable production of similar climate and soil he wisely conceive and successfully execute the idea of introduce the cultivation of sugar and wine into this new colony for these purpose portugal would readily supply he with vine and with people conversant in they management : but he have to procure sugar cane and person experience in they cultivation and in the process of manufacture sugar from they juice from the island of sicily into which that article of culture have be introduce by the arab so great be the success of this new subject of industry in madeira that the fifth part of the produce of one district only little more than nine mile in circumference which proportion the prince reserve as the patrimony of he military order amount in some year to 60000 aroba of twenty-five pound each give the entire acknowledged produce of one district only of the island at 7500000 pound or 2350 ton this at the modern price of eightpence a-pound amount to the enormous sum of l 250000 value of merchantable produce from a district which could not contain above 5760 english acre or above the value of l 43 of average yearly value from every acre of that district this astonishingly valuable produce be in the infancy of the sugar trade when that bland and wholesome condiment be still a article of luxury and not as now almost a indispensable necessary even in the lowest cottage of modern europe the sugar of madeira be long famous but after the establishment of the sugar plantation in brazil and the destructive ravages of a worm which infested the sugar cane of madeira that article of cultivation have to be abandon and the principal attention of the islander be transfer to the grape which still continue to supply europe america and the east indy with the justly celebrated madeira wine at the same time with the grant of madeira to zarco and vaz perestrello receive a donation of the island of puerto santo on condition of colonize it and bring it into culture but so great be the multitude of rabbit all say to have be produce from one doe transmit in a pregnant state from portugal that cultivation be attend with peculiar difficulty occasion by they ravages insomuch that in one islet only 3000 be report to have be kill at one time section iii _ prosecution of discovery in africa to cape branco _ partly divert from the original object of prosecute discovery along the african coast by the attention requisite for form this first establishment of modern colonization but chiefly owe to the extreme difficulty of the navigation in the infancy of that art fifteen year be pass from the first discovery of cape bojador before that formidable obstacle could be surmount in all age of the world ignorant and indolent man have represent new and unusual enterprise in scientific pursuit as rash or improper deviation from the established experience and vaunted wisdom of antiquity and those who promote they have be hold out as dangerous or even impious innovator it so fare with don henry who far outstrip the science or ignorance rather of he day at home the discontented spirit ignorant of he enlarged view perhaps envious of the reputation he very limited discovery have already attain represent that the tempestuous sea strong current and whirlpool which they fancy must prevail on the other side of cape bajadore would necessarily destroy every vessel which should attempt to penetrate beyond that absolute limit of human navigation they allege that all the country to the south of that cape be utterly unfit for the habitation of mankind sterile burn up and destitute of soil and water like the sandy desert of lybium and they pretend to object on principle of patriotism that the native of portugal be improvidently waste on idle discovery which if at all advisable would have be undertake by they former wise sovereign who contented with the known world do not vainly seek for conquest in the torrid zone which be altogether unfit for the habitation of mankind they insinuate that the expence which have be lavish upon those fruitless and dangerous maritime expedition might lave be much more profitably employ for the improvement of some of the more barren part of portugal even the probable profit and advantage derivable from the new colony of madeira and puerto santo as they be only eventual and contingent do not satisfy the mind of those discontented detractor from the merit and enlighten view of the prince but don henry despise those vain endeavor to misrepresent and counteract the important enterprise in which he be engage and undismay by the natural difficulty which have hitherto retard the progress of he mariner continue he laudable endeavor to extend he discovery along the coast of africa the people likewise whom he employ in he service frequently make predatory invasion on the coast take every moorish vessel which they be able to master and make many slave by the sale of which the charge attend those maritime expedition be partly defray about the year 1433 one gilianez a native of lago whom the prince have entrust with the command of a vessel return from a unsuccessful attempt to conquer the invincible obstacle which obstruct the passage round cape bojador he have be drive by stress of weather into one of the canary island and have imprudently seize some of the inoffend native whom he bring captive to sagre don henry be much offend by this conduct of gilianez whom he receive with much coldness and reserve insomuch that gilianez on purpose to retrieve the prince favor and to make ample amends for the fault he have commit make a vow that if entrust with a new expedition he would perish rather than return unsuccessful in the enterprize which the prince have so much at heart the date of the second expedition of gilianez in which he surmount the terror and difficulty of cape bajador be variously refer by different author to the year 1433 and 1434 -lrb- 7 -rrb- however this may have be he succeed in this herculean labor as it be then esteem and return with great exultation to sagre where he be again receive into the favor and confidence of don henry contrary to the assertion or supposition rather of the discontented opposer of the patriotic and enlighten effort of don henry gilianez report that the sea beyond cape bojador be perfectly susceptible of navigation and that the soil and climate be both excellent in the following year gilianez again sail for the coast of africa accompany by alphonzo gonzale baldaya -lrb- 8 -rrb- cupbearer to the prince the weather continue favourable during the voyage and they be able to penetrate ninety mile to the south of cape bojador on landing to take a view of the country and in search of inhabitant they find the former to consist for the most part of a extended desert plain and they be much disappointed in not be able to meet with any of the inhabitant though they see evident trace of they in the sand to the bay in which they land they give the name of angra dos ruyvos or bay of gurnet from the great abundance of fish resemble gurnet which be take by the seaman gilianez and baldaya be again order in the year 1435 to prosecute they discovery with instruction to prolong they voyage if possible till they should meet with inhabitant have proceed about forty mile to the southward of the angra dos ruyvos without be able to see a single inhabitant they adopt a expedient which have be suggest by don henry and for which they be provide with the means two horse be land and two youth name hector homan and diego lopez d'almaida who have be educate in the household of don henry and be scarcely sixteen year of age be direct to penetrate into the interior of the country that they might endeavor to ascertain whether it be inhabit they be direct to keep close together and on no account to leave they horse and if possible to bring back some of the moor and lest they should rashly expose themselves to unnecessary danger they be only allow each a sword and spear without any defensive armor after wander almost a whole day in the barren sandy desert they at length descry nineteen african arm with assagay or javelin whom they venture to attack though contrary to they order the native retreat into a cave where they be safe from the farther assault of the rash portuguese youth and as one of they have receive a wound in the foot they think it prudent to return to the shore which they be unable to reach before the next morning gilianez and baldaya then dispatch a stronger force to the cave in which the african have take shelter where nothing be find but some weapon which have be leave by the fugitive owe to this event the place where the two cavalier be land be name angra dos cavallos or the bay of horse which be in latitude 24  n the navigator proceed along a rugged coast to the south of the bay of horse upon which the sea break with a terrible noise and which on account of be entirely compose of a hilly shore face with rock and small rocky island be call _ otegado _ or the rocky place at about twelve league distance from the bay of cavallo they enter the mouth of a river where they kill a number of sea wolf or seal the skin of which they take on board in defect of any other production of the country these seal be find on a island at the mouth of this river on which the mariner be say to have see at least 5000 asleep on the shore the voyage be continue to punta de gale form the western head-land of the rio de ouro immediately under the tropic where a fishing net be find construct of twine make from the inner bark of some tree of the palm tribe but no native be meet with and as provision begin to grow scarce the adventurous mariner be constrain to return into portugal after range for some time up and down the rocky coast of otegado without make any important discovery about this period or perhaps considerably earlier don henry obtain a bull from pope martin v by which the sovereign pontiff make a perpetual donation to the crown of portugal of all land and island which have be or might be discover between cape bojador and the east indy inclusively and grant a plenary indulgence for the soul of all who might perish in the prosecution of the enterprize and in achieve the conquest of these extensive region from the infidel and pagan enemy of christ and the church in this measure the philosophical genius and enlarged political view of don henry be plainly evince and undismay by the obstacle which have so long oppose he grand project of discovery and the length of time which have be employ in make so very small progress he shew himself to have look steadily forwards to the full accomplishment of he hope of discover the route by sea from europe to india around the still unknown shore of southern africa the date of this papal grant do not certainly appear de barro and lafitau be of opinion that it must have be posterior to 1440 purcha place it in 1441 and de guyon in 1444 but martin v die in 1431 and these writer seem to have confound the original grant from that pontiff with subsequent confirmation by he successor eugenius iv nichola v and sextus iv -lrb- 9 -rrb- the gradual progress of these discovery be interrupt for a time by a unsuccessful attempt of edward i or _ duarte _ king of portugal to gain possession of tangier in the kingdom of fez but the history of this war in which the portuguese arm suffer much misfortune and dishonor be quite irrelevant to the present subject the plague likewise which rage at lisbon in 1438 contribute to the suspension of the patriotic enterprize of don henry at length in 1440 don henry resume he project of maritime discovery and dispatch two caravel from sagre which be force back by unfavourable weather apparently without even reach the coast of africa in 1441 a young officer name antonio gonzale make a voyage in a small vessel with a crew of twenty-one man to the island where so great a number of sea wolf have be see in the former voyage of alphonzo gonzale baldaya in 1435 in this voyage alphonzo gotterez a gentleman of the bed-chamber to don henry act as secretary and the two adventurer be instruct to endeavor to obtain a account of the country and its inhabitant and to procure a cargo of the skin of the seal or sea wolf that the voyage might not be entirely destitute of some commercial advantage after accomplish this part of he instruction gonzale determine to use he utmost effort for procure some of the inhabitant of the country to carry back with he to sagre for this purpose he land at the beginning of the night with nine associate and have advance about ten mile into the interior discover a native follow a camel the sudden appearance of the portuguese render the astonished moor perfectly motionless and before he could recover from he surprize he be seize by gotterez on they return to the shore with they prisoner they trace some recent footstep on the sand which lead they in view of about forty native who withdraw to a adjoining hill but the portuguese secure a female moor who have stray from the party with these two prisoner they return to they vessel not choose to run any unnecessary risk or to make any needless attack upon the native which be contrary to the express order of don henry when prepare next morning to set sail on they return to portugal another portuguese ship arrive which be command by nuno tristan a gentleman of the prince household encourage by this reinforcement a second expedition into the interior be immediately resolve upon in which nuno tristan diego de vigliadore and gonzale de cintra join with alphonzo gonzale and alphonzo gotterez advance again under night they soon perceive a party of the native whom they immediately attack shout out portugal portugal san jago san jago the moor be at first stupify with fear and surprise but recover from they panic a struggle ensue in which three of the moor be slay and ten make prisoner the portuguese be indebted for they safety to they defensive armor after endeavor in vain to establish a intercourse with the moor for the redemption of the prisoner alphonzo gonzale return to sagre with a cargo of skin and the moorish prisoner and be honourably reward by he discerning master the place of this exploit be name puerto del cavallero or the knight harbor on occasion of gonzale be there knight by nuno tristan after careen he vessel nuno tristan proceed along the coast accord to he order and reach a cape in lat 20  50 ' n to which he give the name of cabo branco or the white cape on account of the whiteness of its cliff he there land and find some fishing net on the shore but after repeat incursion into the country be unable to meet with any of the native he make a survey

for they safe return to they native country and to give besides six or seven slave each to the captor don henry as grand master of the order of christ be eager for the acquisition of so many convert from the religion of mahomet and be in hope that the favourable report which the moor might make on they return to africa would induce the native to enter into trade with he navigator and that among the slave which be to be give in exchange some certain knowledge might be acquire of the burning region of africa about which such strange report be then prevalent antonio gonzale be therefore dispatch on another voyage in 1442 accompany by a german gentleman name balthazar who have distinguish himself in the late unfortunate attempt on tangier and who be anxious to carry home some account of the newly discover country after be force to return to port to repair the damages they have sustain in a dreadful tempest they again sail and reach the coast where the moor have be make prisoner the principal moor be land and be receive with great deference and respect by he countryman but he forget all he promise on regain he liberty and never return to pay the ransom he have bargain for it would appear however that he have inform the native of the return of the other two chief as at the end of nine day above a hundred native appear on the coast and enter into treaty for the ransom of they two countryman who remain captive and for whom ten negro native of different part of africa be give in exchange during these transaction the sight of a considerable quantity of gold dust in the possession of the moor excite the most lively emotion in the portuguese as be the first intimation of that valuable commodity be procurable on the coast of they new discovery from this circumstance gonzale give the name of _ rio del ouro _ or gold river to the deep arm of the sea in which he now lay which penetrate about six league n n e from the tropic of cancer section iv _ continuation of discovery to cape de verd _ on the return from this voyage the sight of gold place the fame and advantage of the enterprize and discovery of don henry beyond the reach of prejudice and detraction and the former murmuring and discontent against he proceedings be change into admiration and applause in 1443 nuno tristan be again send out with order to prosecute the discovery of a coast which now seem so likely to prove advantageous to the commerce of portugal he now double cape blanco or branco which he have discover in he former voyage and about ten league farther to the south-east fall in with a island or rather cluster of seven island call _ adeget _ by the native but which have since with the bay in which they lie receive the name of arguim or arguin the small canoe which be use by the native of this coast be at first mistaken for some strange kind of bird as the people sit upon they astride use they foot instead of paddle to urge they along to one of the island in this bay tristan give the name of _ de las _ garas on account of the seasonable supply which he there receive from this place nuno tristan return into portugal with some of the native of the country don henry in 1444 make a exchange with massiot de betancor lord of the canary island for the island of lancerota fuertaventura and ferro give he some possession in the island of madeira in they stead and immediately fit out a powerful squadron command by the grand master of he household fernand de castro to take possession of this new acquisition and to subdue the remain island canaria palma gratioso inferno alegrazze santa-chiara rocca and lobo but as the king of castile afterwards lay claim to the canary don henry resign he conquest find the value of these island by no means answerable to he expectation so greatly have the fame of the new discovery extend in consequence of the small quantity of gold which have be procure by gonzale at the rio del ouro that several of the inhabitant of lago petition don henry in 1444 to be erect into a trading company engage to carry on the discovery along the coast of africa at they own expence the prince grant they request and a company be accordingly form the

slightly extend they knowledge of the coast of africa to the desart island of tider in 19  30 ' n in 1445 the subsequent voyage of gonzale da cintra likewise a gentleman in the household of don henry in some measure expiate the wanton outrage which have be commit in that of lanerot the merit of gonzale have raise he to the rank of a gentleman in the household of don henry and he character be hold in much estimation but he confidence be obtain and betray by a moor of the assanhajus tribe -lrb- 10 -rrb- whom he have take on board to serve as a interpreter with the native on the coast of africa

much eagerness he neglect to attend to the tide which happen then to be on the ebb he boat stick fast and when the morning break he be surround by two hundred moor unable to extricate himself or to contend against such mighty odds gonzale and seven of he man be slay the other five make they escape by swim to the ship which immediately set sail for lago the clumsy denomination of _ angra de

might experience from the negro the portuguese endeavored but ineffectually to conciliate the native and to remove the angry prejudice which they entertain they return to lago with no other fruit from they voyage except one negro whom they have receive in ransom and a aged moor who request permission to accompany they to portugal one of they own companion juan fernandez from a ardent desire to procure information for the prince get leave to remain among the assanhajus arab next year 1447 antonio mendez be order to return in search of juan fernandez from whose inquisitive disposition much information be expect in this expedition he be accompany by two other caravel command by garcium mendez and diego alfonso but they be separate by a storm in the early part of the voyage alfonso be the first who reach the coast at cape branco where he land and set up a wooden cross as a signal to he consort and then proceed to the island of arguin which afford shelter from the tremenduous surf which break continually on the coast of africa while wait at arguin for the other ship alfonso pay many visit to the continent where he make prisoner of twenty-five of the native when the other two ship of the squadron have join they go to the rio del ouro in search of they countryman juan fernandez who have be several day anxiously look out for a vessel to carry he off after experience many hardship fernandez have succeed in gain the friendship of a considerable person among the moor and be accompany to the shore by that man slave in a body the native exert themselves to procure the release of some of they countryman who be prisoner with the portuguese to whom they give nine negro and a quantity of gold dust by way of ransom to the place where this transaction take place the navigator give the name of _ cabo do resgatus _ or cape ransom where likewise fernam tavare a aged nobleman receive the honor of knighthood a distinction he have long be entitle to but which he would only receive upon the newly discover coast during the homeward voyage gonzale touch at a village near cape branco where he increase he captive to ninety juan fernandez describe the native of the coast as wander shepherd of the same race with the moor who have be bring over to portugal by antonio gonzale in the former voyage after he have be convey to a considerable distance inland he be strip of all he

permit he to watch for the arrival of the ship and even assign he a guard for he protection in the interval between these two voyage of gonzale deni fernandez a gentleman of lisbon who have belong to the household of the late king fit out a vessel for discovery under the patronage of don henry with a determination to endeavor to penetrate farther to the southwards than any precede navigator he accordingly pass to the southward of the senegal river which divide the azanhaji moor from the jaloff or most northern negro and fall in with some almadia or canoe one of which he capture with four native proceed still farther on without stop to satisfy he curiosity in visit the coast he at length reach the most westerly promontory of africa to which he give the name of cabo verde or the green cape from the number of palm tree with which it be cover alarm by the breaker with which the shore be everywhere guard deni do not venture to proceed any farther especially as the season be already far advance but return with he captive to portugal where he meet with a flattering reception from don henry both on account of he discovery of the cape de verd and for the native he have procure from the newly discover coast without have be trade for with the moor section v _ progress of discovery from cape de verd to the gambium _ soon after the return of deni from the cape de verd gonzale pacheco a wealthy officer belong to the household of don henry fit out a ship at he own expence of which he give the command to dinisianez da gram one of the prince equerry who be accompany by alvaro gil a essayer of the mint and mafaldo de setubal after touch at cape branco they steer along the coast for the isle of arguin make descent in several place where they make a considerable number of captive from the moor at the isle _ de las garas _ they find another caravel command by loureno dia which form part of a considerable squadron that have be lately fit out from lago two day afterwards the admiral of that squadron lanarot and nine other caravel arrive gram inform lanarot of he success in make fifty prisoner whom he have dearly purchase by the loss of seven of he man who have be murder by the moor lanarot immediately sail for arguin bent on revenge and sacrifice the life of eight and the liberty of four of the native to the memory of gonzale da cintra and the mariner of gram on this occasion two of the portuguese officer be knight on the newly discover coast which seem then to have be a fashionable ambition among they no doubt arise from the prevail zeal for maritime discovery from arguin lanarot pass over to the isle of tider whence the inhabitant make they escape to the adjacent continent but the portuguese soon follow and the astonished moor flee on all side after a sharp skirmish in which a good many of they be slay and sixty take prisoner the fleet now separate a part return home by way of the canary while lanarot with several other caravel advance along the coast of africa southwards till he get beyond what the moor call the ahara or sahara of the assenajus this moorish nation be mention by abulfeda as the ruling tribe in audagost or agadez and as inhabit the southern part of morocco they be therefore to be consider as the peculiar people of the great desert and its environs at its western extremity on the atlantic the latter part of they name _ ajus _ or rather aspirated _ hajus _ signify a pilgrim and be now the appropriate title of one who have make the great pilgrimage of mecca in the present case the name of assenajus probably signify the _ wanderer of the desert _ the sanhaga or assenajus tribe be now place at no great distance from the african coast between the river nun and senegal and this latter river have probably receive its portuguese name of sanaga from that tribe ptolemy likewise probably name cape verd _ arsinarium _ from the same people from which it may be infer that they anciently occupy both side of the senegal river which be name _ dardalus _ by that ancient geographer twenty league beyond the southern boundary of the great desert lanarot come to the mouth of a large river which have be formerly see by deni fernandez and name by he _ rio portugues _ or the portuguese river which be call _ ouedech _ by the native and afterwards get the name of canaga zanaga sanhaga sanaga or senega now the senegal lanarot pass in safety over the bar of this river and endeavor to explore its course upward but the weather become unfavourable and force he again to sea when he proceed with part of he squadron to cape verd near which place he take in a supply of water and goat flesh the fleet be again disperse by a second storm and only three vessel remain under the command of lanarot with these he make a descent on the island of tider where he capture fifty-nine moor and with these and some native he have make prisoner on the bank of the senegal he return into portugal in the year 1447 nuna tristan make another voyage to the coast of africa and advance beyond _ cabo dos mastos _ or the cape of mast so name from some dead palm resemble mast see there by lanarot who make this discovery in the former voyage nuna tristan proceed southwards along the coast of africa 180 mile beyond cape verd where he reach the mouth of a river which he call rio grande or the large river since call gamber gambra or gambium tristan come to anchor at the mouth of this river and go in he boat with twenty-two armed man on purpose to explore its course have reach to a considerable distance from he ship he be environ by thirteen almadia or canoe man by eighty negro who advance with dreadful yell and pour in continual volly of poison arrow by which he and almost every man in he boat be wound before they could regain the ship nuno tristan and all the wound man die speedily of the effect of these poison weapon himself only live long enough to recount the nature of the terrible disaster to the small remainder of the crew who have be leave in charge of the caravel which be bring home by only four survivor after wander for two month in the atlantic scarcely know which way to steer they course there appear some difficulty and contradiction in regard to the river discover by nuna tristan from the vague name of rio grande instead of the gambium in lat 13  30 ' n some of the portuguese historian be incline to believe that this fatal event take place at another river in lat 10  15 ' n at least 500 nautical mile beyond the gambium to the ss e which be afterwards call rio de nuno this be scarcely probable as no notice whatever be take of the great archipelago of shoal and island which extend from cabo rosso to beyond the mouth of that river which be still call rio grande yet it must be acknowledge that we remain information respect these early portuguese voyage of discovery be unfortunately vague and unsatisfactory in the same year 1447 alvaro fernando proceed to the coast of africa and be say to have advance forty league beyond tristan have arrive at the mouth of a river call tabite -lrb- 11 -rrb- 100 mile to the south of rio nuno notwithstanding the appearance of a determine opposition on the part of the native who have man five almadia alvaro resolve to explore its course in he boat and proceed up the river for that purpose with the utmost circumspection one of the almadia stand out from the rest and attack he boat with great bravery discharge a number of poison arrow by which alvaro and several of he man be wound which force he to desist and return to he ship be however provide with _ theriac _ and other antidote against the poison alvaro and all he man recover from they wound he resolve after leave the river tabite to proceed along the coast which he do to a sandy point and apprehend no danger in so open a situation be prepare to land when he be suddenly assail by a flight of poison arrow from 120 negro who start up from a concealment alvaro therefore desist from any farther attempt to explore the coast and return to lago to give a account of he proceedings in the same year ten caravel sail from lago for madeira the canary and the coast of africa but return without make any progress in discover the coast under this year likewise 1447 the antille or caribbee island be pretend to have be discover by a portuguese ship drive thither by a storm but the fact rest only on the authority of galvano a portuguese historian and be not at all credible indeed the story be a absolute fable as the inhabitant be say to have speak the portuguese language and to have have _ seven city _ in they island in the same year gomez perez go with two caravel to rio del ouro whence he carry eighty moor to lago as prisoner about this period the progress of discovery be arrest by political dispute in portugal which end in a civil war between don pedro duke of coimbra and king alphonso v he nephew and son-in-law in the course of which don pedro be slay

continent in addition to all this a inscription appear to have be trace on a rock beneath the statue but in a language which the portuguese do not understand in the slow progress of discovery the peril endure by the officer and man employ by don henry from the moor and negro frequently occasion murmur against he plan of discovery but the several cluster of island the madeira cape verd and aores form a succession of maritime and commercial colony and nursery for seaman which take off from the general obloquy attend the tedious and hitherto unsuccessful attempt to penetrate farther into the southern hemisphere and afford a perpetual supply of navigator and a stimulus to enterprize the original prejudice against the possibility of navigate or exist in the torrid zone still subsist and although the navigator of don henry have gradually penetrate to within ten degree of the equator yet the last successive discovery be always hold forth by the supporter of ignorant prejudice as that which have be place by nature as a insurmountable barrier to farther progress in the atlantic in this situation the settlement of the aores be of considerable importance in 1457 don henry procure the grant of many valuable privilege to this favorite colony the principal of which be the exemption of the inhabitant from any duty on they commerce to the port of portugal and even of spain in 1461 a

the sixty-seventh year of he age and for a time the maritime enterprise of the portuguese nation be palsy by he death thus during a long period of fifty-two year this patriotic prince devote almost he whole attention and the ample revenue which he enjoy as duke of viseo end grand master of the military order of christ in extend the maritime knowledge and consequently the commercial prosperity of he country the incident of the last seven year of the life of this distinguished prince be involve in uncertainty and we know very little with regard to the progress of he maritime discovery from 1456 the date of the second of the voyage of cada mosto of which we propose to give a separate account till the year of he death 1463 from the year 1412 when he begin he operation at which time he could scarcely exceed fifteen year of age the navigator who have be form under he auspices and direction and often instruct by himself in the theory of navigation and cosmography gradually explore the western coast of africa from cape nam or non in lat 28  15 ' certainly to rio grande in lat 11  n or rather to rio de nuno not quite a degree farther south but it be highly probable that the southern limit of discovery in he time extend to cabo verga in lat 10  n the northern boundary of the country usually call the sierra liona or the ridge of lion perhaps to the gulf of mitomba or bay of sierra liona in lat 8  30 ' n a extent of 29  15 ' of latitude or 1185 nautical mile a mere nothing certainly when compare with modern navigation but a wonderful effort in the infancy of the science when even coast voyage of any extent along well know shore and in frequented sea be look upon as considerable effort no brilliant discovery indeed reward the perseverance of don henry and the courage of he servant but a indestructible foundation of useful knowledge be lay for overthrow the ignorant prejudice of the age and by which not long afterwards he plan be perfect by complete the circumnavigation of africa and by the discovery of the _ new _ world dr vincent the learn editor and commentator of the periplus of the erythrean sea be dispose to limit the discovery of don henry to cape verd -lrb- 2

enough continue he impress upon the country they visit even after he lament death about seven year before the decease of don henry two voyage be make to the african coast by alvise da cada mosto a venetian navigator under the auspices of the duke of viseo but which we have choose to separate from the historical deduction of the portuguese discovery principally because they contain the oldest nautical journal extant except those already give in we first part from the pen of the great alfred and be therefore peculiarly valuable in a work of this nature they considerable length likewise and because they be not particularly conducive to the grand object of extend the maritime discovery have induce we to detach they from the foregoing narrative that we might carry it down unbroken to the death of the great don henry these voyage likewise give we a early picture of the state of population civilization and manners of the african not to be meet with elsewhere to this we subjoin a abstract of the narrative of a voyage make by pedro de cintra a portuguese captain to the coast of africa draw up for cada mosto at lago by a young portuguese who have be he secretary and who have

there be a copy in the king library and another in the valuable collection make by mr dalrymple these voyage be afterward publish by ramusio in 1613 and by grynus in latin the latter be mislead in regard to the date which he have inadvertently place in 1504 after the death of prince henry and even subsequent to the discovery of the cape of good hope by bernal diaz even ramusio in he introduction to the voyage of cada mosto have make a mistake in say that they be undertake by the order of john king of portugal who die in 1433 ramusio imagine that the discovery of cada mosto might tend to great importance as he consider the river senegal and rio grande to be branch of the niger by which mean the european might open a trade with the rich kingdom of tombuto and mellus on that river and thus bring gold from the country of the negro by a easier safer and more expeditious manner than as convey by the moor of barbary by land over the vast and dangerous desert that intervene between the country on the niger and senegal river and barbary as by the account of leo salt be the most valuable commodity throughout the country of the negro ramusio propose that the ship should take in cargo of salt at the island of _ sal _ one of the cape de verd and thence supply the country on the niger which be report to be navigable for 500 mile into the interior and that they should bring back gold and slave in return the latter to be bring to market at st jago another of the cape de verd island where they would be immediately buy up for the west indy all this fine speculation however rest on mistaken foundation as the niger be altogether a inland river run to the east and have no communication with the senegal and gambium which run west into the atlantic yet time and the civilization of the native on the senegal and gambium may hereafter realize this scheme of a valuable traffic into the interior of africa but it be fervently to be hope that the trade in slave may never be revive in he preface after a apology for he performance and make a declaration of he strict adherence to truth in all the particulars he relate cada mosto give some account of the infant don henriquez or henry of portugal the great author and promoter of maritime discovery he praise he as a prince of a great soul and sublime genius and of great skill in astronomy and add that he apply himself entirely to the service of christ by make war against the moor while on death - bed in 1432 don john king of portugal exhort he son don henry to pursue he laudable and holy purpose of _ persecute _ the enemy of the christian faith which he promise to perform and accordingly with the assistance of he brother don duarte or edward who succeed to the throne of portugal he make war in fez with success for many year afterwards the more effectually to harass the moor he use to send he caravel or ship of war annually to scour the coast of azafus or al saffi and messa on the coast of africa without the mediteranean by which he do they much damage but have in view to make discovery along that western coast he order they every year to advance farther towards the south they accordingly proceed till they come to a great cape which put a stop to they progress southwards for several year be afraid to go beyond it whence it take the name it still retain of cape non -lrb- 2 -rrb- meaning that such as go beyond should never return don henry however be of a different opinion and add three other caravel to those which have be at the cape send they again next year to make the attempt they accordingly penetrate about 100 mile beyond that cape where they find only a sandy coast with no habitation and return back to portugal encourage by this commencement of successful progress don henry send the same fleet back next year with order to extend they discovery 150 mile farther to the south and even more if they find it proper and promise to enrich all who should embark in this navigation they go again and although they obey the instruction of the prince they could not improve the discovery yet firmly persuade by the strength of he own judgment that people and habitation would certainly be find at length don henry continue to send out he caravel from time to time and they come at length to certain coast frequent by the arab of the desert and to the habitation of the azanaghus a tawny race thus the country of the negro be discover and different nation afterwards which will be mention in the follow relation thus far the preface of cada mosto as

_ which be about 600 mile southward from cape st vincent whence we take we departure puerto santo be discover by the portuguese on all saint day about the year 1418 -lrb- 3 -rrb- and don henry first send inhabitant to settle there under bartholomew perestrello whom he appoint governor it be about fifteen mile in circuit -lrb- 4 -rrb- it bear good bread corn and a sufficiency of oats for its own use and abound with cattle and wild hog and innumerable rabbit -lrb- 5 -rrb- among other tree it produce the drago or dragon tree the sap or juice of which be draw out only at certain season of the

apothecary -lrb- 6 -rrb- the tree bear a yellow fruit round like like a cherry and well taste this island produce the best honey and wax in the world but not in any quantity it have no harbor but a good road in which vessel may moor in safety be well sheltered on all side except the quarter between the south and east all of which wind make it unsafe to ride here at anchor there be plenty of excellent fish on its shore such as dentili gilded fish and other from puerto santo which be discover twenty-seven year before we sail on the 28th of march and come the same day to _ monchrico _ or machico one of the port of the island of madeira forty mile distant from puerto santo in fair weather these island may be see from each other this latter island be only inhabit within the last twenty-four year when the prince appoint two of he gentleman to be its governor tristan vaz have the government of that half of the island in which the port of monchrico be situate and the other district of the island in which fonzal fonchial or funchal stand be under the government of john gonzale zarcho the island of madeira be inhabit in four several place : monchrico santa cruz fonzal and camera-di-lupus which be its principal place though there be other minor establishment and be able to muster about 800 man able to bear arm of whom a hundred be horse there be about eight river which pervade the island in different place by means of which they have many saw-mill from which portugal and other place be supply with board of many different sort of these board two sort be in particular estimation and turn most to account the one be cedar which have a strong odoriferous smell and resemble the cypress tree of this they make fine large and long board or deal which they employ for build house and for various other purpose the other call nasso -lrb- 7 -rrb- be of a red-rose color and extremely beautiful of which they make excellent and very beautiful bow and cross-bow which be send into the west in order to clear the land the first settler set fire to the wood and the fire spread with such fury that several person with they family and gonzale zarcho among the rest be force to take shelter in the sea to save themselves from the flame where they stand up to they neck for two day and two night without sustenance though this island be mountainous its soil be rich and fertile and it produce yearly 30000 venetian _ staras _ -lrb- 8 -rrb- of bread corn at first the newly cultivate land yield seventy for one but have since be reduce to thirty or forty for want of good husbandry owe to the excellence of its soil and climate and the abundance of spring and river prince henry procure sugar cane from sicily which he send to this island where they have yield abundant produce insomuch that 400 cantaro of sugar each contain 112 pound large weight of venice have be make at one boil and the quantity be likely to increase -lrb- 9 -rrb- they have likewise good wine consider how shortly this culture have be introduce and in such abundance that large quantity be export among other kind of vine don henry send thither _ malvasium _ plant procure from the island of candium which have succeed well the soil have turn out so favourable for the vine that in general there be more grape than leaf and the bundle be very large even from two to four span long they have likewise the black _ pergola _ grape without stone in great perfection and so well be the climate adapt to this culture that they begin they vintage about easter or at least by the octave after we sail from madeira follow a southerly course and arrive at the canary island which be at the distance of about 320 mile from madeira there be seven of these island in all four of which have be settle by the christian lanerotta fuerteventura gomera and ferro over which herrera -lrb- 10 -rrb- a spanish gentleman be lord large quantity of a herb call _ oricello _ or orchel -lrb- 11 -rrb- be annually send from these island to cadiz and seville which be use in die and be send from these place to all part of europe great quantity of excellent goat skin be export from these island which likewise produce abundance of tallow and good cheese the original inhabitant of the four island that be subject to the christian be _ canarian _ -lrb- 12 -rrb- who speak various language or dialect not well understand between the different tribe these people have only open village without any fortification except on the mountain which be exceedingly high and there they have a kind of rude wall or redoubt to flee to in case of need the pass of these mountain be so difficult of access that a few resolute man might defend they against a army the other three island of this group grand canarium teneriffe and palma which be larger and better peopled than the other four be still unsubdued and possess by the aboriginal idolater grand canarium have between eight and nine thousand soul and teneriffe which be the largest of all these island be say to contain fourteen or fifteen thousand and be divide into nine separate lordship palma however have very few inhabitant yet it appear to be a very beautiful island every lordship seem to have its own mode of religious worship as in teneriffe there be no less than nine different kind of idolatry some worship the sun other the moon and so forth they practice polygamy and the lord have the jus primae noctis which be consider as confer great honor on the accession of any new lord it be customary for some person to offer themselves to die as a sacrifice to he honor on this occasion the lord hold a great festival on he accession day when all who be willing to give this cruel proof of they attachment be attend to the summit of a high cliff in a certain valley where after some peculiar ceremony and certain word mutter over they the victim precipitate themselves from the cliff and be dash to piece in reward of this sanguinary homage the lord consider themselves bind to heap extraordinary honor and reward on the parent of the victim teneriffe which be the largest of these island and the best inhabit be one of highest island in the world and be see in clear weather from a great distance insomuch that i be inform by some mariner that it have be descry at the distance of between sixty and seventy spanish league which make about 250 italian mile in the middle of the island there be a prodigiously high peaked mountain shape like a diamond which be always burn i receive this account from some christian who have be prisoner in the island who affirm that it be fifteen portuguese league or sixty italian mile from the bottom of the mountain to the top of the peak they have nine lord on this island who be call duke and who do not succeed by inheritance or descent but by force on which account they have perpetual civil war among themselves in which they commit great slaughter they only weapon be stone mace or club and dart or lance some of which be point with horn and other have they point harden in the fire they all go naked except a few who wear goat skin before and behind they anoint they skin with goat tallow mix up with the juice of certain herb which thicken the skin and defend they against the cold of which they complain much although they country be so far to the south they have neither walled nor thatched house but dwell in grotto and cavern of the mountain they feed on barley flesh and goat milk of which they have abundance and some fruit particularly fig as the country be very hot they reap they corn in April and may we learn all these thing from the christian of the four settle island who sometimes go over by night to the three other island and make prisoner of the native whom they send into spain to be sell as slave sometimes the spaniard be themselves make prisoner on these expedition on which occasion the native do not put they to death but employ they to kill and flea they goat and to cure the flesh which they look upon as a vile employment and therefore condemn they christian prisoner to that labor in contempt the native canarian be very active and nimble and be exceedingly agile in run and leap be accustom to traverse the cliff of they rugged mountain they skip barefoot from rock to rock like goat and sometimes take leap of most surprising extent and danger which be scarcely to be believe they throw stone with great strength and wonderful exactness so as to hit whatever they aim at with almost perfect certainty and almost with the force of a bullet from a musket insomuch that a few stone throw by they will break a buckler to piece i once see a native canarian who have become a christian who offer to give three person twelve orange a-piece and take twelve to himself engage at eight or ten pace distance to strike he antagonist with every one of he orange and at the same time to parry all theirs so that they should hit no part of he but he hand but no one would take up the wager as they all know he could perform even better than he mention i be on land in gomera and ferro and touch also at the island of palma but do not land there -lrb- 1 -rrb- in grynaeus

the azanaghus and the country of tegazza _ leave the canary we pursue we course towards ethiopium and arrive in a few day at cape branco which be about 870 mile from these island in this passage steer south we keep at a great distance from the african shore on we leave as the canary be far-advanced into the sea towards the west we stand almost directly south for two-third of the way between the island and the cape after which we change we course somewhat more towards the east or left-hand that we might fall in with the land lest we should have overpass the cape without see it because no land appear afterwards so far to the west for a considerable space the coast of africa to the southward of cape bronco fall in considerably to the eastward form a great bay or gulf call the _ forna of arguin _ from a small island of that name this gulf extend about fifty mile into the land and have three other island one of which be name _ branco _ by the portuguese or the white island on account of its white sand the second be call _ garze _ or the isle of heron where they find so many egg of certain seabird as to load two boat the third be call _ curous _ or cori these island be all small sandy and uninhabited in that of arguin there be plenty of fresh water but there be none in any of the other it be proper to observe that on keep to the southwards from the strait of gibraltar the coast of exterior barbary be inhabit no farther than cape cantin -lrb- 1 -rrb- from whence to cape branco be the sandy country or desert call _ saara _ or _ saharra _ by the native which be divide from barbary or morocco on the north by the mountain of atla and border on the south with the country of the negro and would require a journey of fifty day to cross -- in some place more in other less this desert reach to the ocean and be all a white dry sand quite low and level so that no part of it seem higher than any other cape _ branco _ or the white cape so name by the portuguese from its white color without tree or verdure be a noble promontory of a triangular shape have three separate point about a mile from each other innumerable quantity of large and excellent fish of various kind be catch on this coast similar in taste to those we have at venice but quite different in shape and appearance the gulf of arguin be shallow all over and be full of shoal both of rock and sand and as the current be here very strong there be no sailing except by day and even then with the lead constantly heave two ship have be already lose on these shoal cape _ branco _ lie sw of cape cantin or rather s and by w behind cape branco there be a place call hoden six day journey inland on camel which be not walled but be much frequent by the arab and caravan which trade between tombucto -lrb- 2 -rrb- and other place belong to the negro and the western part of barbary the provision at hoden be date and barley which they have in plenty and the inhabitant drink the milk of camel and other animal as they have no wine they have some cow and goat the former be greatly smaller than those of italy but the number of these be not great as the country be very dry the inhabitant be all mahometan and great enemy to the christian and have no settle habitation but wander continually over the desert they frequent the country of the negro and visit that side of barbary which be next the mediterranean on these expedition they travel in numerous caravan with great train of camel carry brass silver and other article to tombucto and the country of the negro whence they bring back gold and _ melhegette _ or cardamom seed -lrb- 3 -rrb- these people be all of a tawny color and both sex wear a single white garment with a red border without any linen next they skin the man wear turban in the moorish fashion and go always barefoot in the desert there be many lion leopard and ostrich the egg of which i have often eat and find they very good don henry have farm out the trade of the island of arguin under the follow regulation no person must enter this gulf to trade with the arab except those who be licensed accord to the ordinance and have habitation and factor on the island and have be accustom to transact business with the arab on that coast the article of merchandize chiefly provide for this trade be woollen cloth and linen silver trinket _ aldtizelus _ or frock and cloak and other thing and above all wheat and the arab give in return negro slave and gold a castle have be build on the isle of arguin by order of the prince to protect this trade on account of which caravel or ship arrive there every year from portugal the arab of this coast have many barbary horse which they carry to the country of the negro which they barter with the great man for slave receive from ten to eighteen man for each horse accord to they goodness they also carry thither silken staff of granada and tuni with silver and many other thing in return for which they receive great number of slave and some gold these slave be bring first to hoden in the desert and thence by the mountain of barka into barbary whence they be transport across the mediterranean into sicily part of they be sell in tuni and in other place along the coast of barbary and the rest be bring to arguin where they be sell to the licensed portuguese trader who purchase between seven and eight hundred every year and send they for sale into portugal before the establishment of this trade at arguin the portuguese use to send every year four or more caravel to the bay of arguin the crew of which landing well arm in the night be in use to surprise some of the fishing village and carry off the inhabitant into slavery they even penetrate sometimes a considerable way into the interior and carry off the arab of both sex whom they sell as slave in portugal leave arguin we sail along the coast to the river senegal -lrb- 4 -rrb- which be very large and divide the people call azanaghus or azanhajus from the first kingdom of the negro the azanhajus be of a tawny color or rather of a deep brown complexion and inhabit some part of the coast beyond cape branco range through the desert and they district reach to the confines of the arab of hoden they live on date barley and the milk of camel but as they border likewise on the country of the negro they carry on trade with these people from whom they procure millet and pulse particularly bean owe to the scarcity of provision in the desert the azanhajus be but spare eater and be able to endure hunger with wonderful patience as a poringer of barley-meal make into hasty-pudding will serve they a whole day the portuguese use to carry away many of these people for slave as they be prefer to the negro but for some time past this have be prohibit by don henry and peace and trade have be establish with they as he be in hope they may be easily bring over to the catholic faith by intercourse with the christian more especially as they be not hitherto thoroughly establish in the superstition of mahomet of which they know nothing but by hearsay these azenhajus have a odd custom of wear a handkerchief round they head a part of which be bring down so as to cover they eye and even they nose and mouth for they reckon the mouth a unclean part because it be constantly belching and have a bad smell and ought therefore to be keep out of sight even compare it to the posterior and think that both ought alike to be conceal on this account they never let they mouth be see except when eat as i have often have occasion to observe they have no lord among they but the rich man be respect somewhat more than the rest they be of ordinary stature and very lean wear they black hair frizzle over they shoulder like the german and grease it daily with fish oil which give they a nasty smell yet they consider this as modish they be extremely poor egregious liar the greatest thief in the world and very treacherous they have never hear of any christian except the portuguese with whom they have war for thirteen or fourteen year in which many of they be carry off as slave as have be already mention many of these people inform I that when they first see ship under sail which have never be behold by any of they ancestor they take they for large bird with white wing that have come from foreign part and when the sail be furl they conjecture from they length and swimming on the water that they must be great fish other again believe that they be spirit who wander about by night because they be see at anchor in the evening at one place and would be see next morning 100 mile off either proceed along the coast to the southward or put back accord as the wind change or the caravel might happen to steer they could not conceive how human being could travel more in one night than they be able to perform themselves in three day by which they be confirm in the notion of the ship be spirit all this be certify to I by many of the azanhajus who be slave in portugal as well as by the portuguese mariner who have frequent the coast in they caravel about six day journey by land from hoden there be a place call teggazza -lrb- 5 -rrb- which in we language signify a chest or bag of gold in this place large quantity of salt be dig up every year and carry by caravan on camel to _ tombucto _ and thence to the empire of _ mellus _ which belong to the negro oh arrive there they dispose of they salt in the course of eight day at the rate of between two and three hundred _ mitigal _ or ducat for each load accord to the quantity and then return with they gold -lrb- 1 -rrb- this be erroneous as there be several town on the coast of morocco beyond this cape as saffium mogadore santa cruz and other cape cantin be in lat 32  30 'n and the river _ sus _ in 30  25 ' which be 140 mile to the south there be no town on the coast beyond that river but the northern limit of the _ sahara _ or great desert be in lat 27  40 ' 186 mile to the south of the river _ sus _ and be surely inhabit by wander arab even the great desert which extend 750 mile from north to south almost to the river senegal be thinly intersperse by several wander tribe of the _ azanhajus _ -- e -lrb- 2 -rrb- call tombuto in the original and ataubat in grynaeus -- astl hoden stand in a _ ouasis _ or water island in the sea of sand or great desert about lat 19  20 'n and w long 11  40 ' -- e -lrb- 3 -rrb- under the general name of _ azanhajus _ which probably signify the pilgrim or wanderer of the desert the nomadic arab or moor be distinguish into various tribe as beni-amir beni-sabi hilil arab ludaja and hagus sometimes call monselmine mongeart wadelim labdesseba and trasart all name in they order from north to south as occupy the desert towards the atlantic -- e -lrb- 4 -rrb- in the text this river be name senega and its name probably signify the river of the azanhajus it be call in ramusio _ oro tiber _ -- f -lrb- 5 -rrb- the name of this place be explain as signify a chest or bag of gold there be a place mark in the saharra or great sandy desert under the name of _ tisheet _ where there be salt mine in lat 17  40 ' n and long 6  40 ' w which may possibly be teggazza the distance of tisheet from hoden in we map be about 375 mile e s e but there be other salt mine in the desert still farther to the east -- e section iii _ of the empire of mellus and some curious particulars of the salt trade : of the trade in gold : of the azanhajus and concern swarm of locust _ the empire of mellus of which some mention have be make in the precede section be situate in a extremely hot climate and afford very bad nourishment for beast insomuch that out of a hundred camel which go from the desert into that country scarcely twenty-five return several even of the arab and azanhajus belong to the caravan sicken and die likewise every year there be no quadruped keep by the native of the country as indeed none can live there for any time it be reckon to be forty day journey on horseback from tegazza to tombuctu and thirty from thence to mellus -lrb- 1 -rrb- have inquire what use the merchant of mellus make of this salt the trader of the desert inform I that a part of it be consume in that country which lie near the line where the day and night be of equal length certain season of the year be so excessively hot that the blood of the inhabitant would putrify if it be not for the salt and they would all die they have no art or mystery in its use but every one dissolve a small piece every day in a porringer of water and drink it off which in they opinion preserve they health the remainder of the salt be carry a long way in piece on men head every piece be as large as a man can well bear as bring from teggazza the salt be in large piece as take out of the mine each camel be load with two piece and the negro break these down into smaller piece for the convenience of carry they on they head and muster a large number of footman for this yearly traffic these porter have each a long fork stick in they hand and when tire they rest they load on these stick they proceed in this manner till they arrive on the bank of a certain water but whether fresh or salt my informer could not say yet i be of opinion that it must be a river because if it be the sea the inhabitant could not be in want of salt in so hot a climate the negro be hire to carry it in this manner for want of camel or other beast of burden as already mention and from what have be say it may easily be conclude that the number both of the carrier and consumer must be very great when arrive at the water side the proprietor of the salt place they share in heap in a row at small distance set each a particular mark on he own heap and when this be do the whole company retire half a day journey from the place then the other negro who be the purchaser of the salt who seem to be the inhabitant of certain island but who will on no account be see or speak to come in boat to the place where the heap of salt be place and after lay a sum in gold on each heap as its price retire in they turn after they be go the owner of the salt return and if the quantity of gold on they heap be satisfactory to they they take it away and leave the salt if not they leave both and withdraw again in this manner they carry on they traffick without see or speak to each other and this custom be very ancient among they as have be affirm to I for truth by several merchant of the desert both arab and azanhajus and other creditable person -lrb- 2 -rrb- on inquire how it come to pass that the emperor of mellus whom they represent as a powerful sovereign do not find means by friendship or force to discover who these people be who would not suffer themselves to be see or talk to i be inform that this emperor not many year ago resolve to procure some of these invisible people and hold a council on the occasion in which the follow plan be devise and carry into execution before the salt caravan return the half day journey from they salt heap some of the emperor people make certain pit by the water side and near the place where the salt be leave and when the negro come to deposit they gold on the salt those who be conceal in the pit attack they suddenly and take four of they prisoner all the rest make they escape three of those who be thus take be immediately set free by the captor who judge that one would be quite sufficient to satisfy the curiosity of they emperor and that the negro would be the less offended but after all the design prove abortive for though speak to in various language the prisoner would neither speak or take any victuals and die at the end of four day on this account the mellus negro conclude that these other negro be dumb but other be of opinion that be endow with the human form they must necessarily have the power of speech but that find himself treat in this manner so contrary to ancient custom he refuse to speak from indignation this untoward result be much regret by the negro of mellus because it prevent they from gratify the curiosity of they emperor who on be inform of this person death be much dissatisfied yet ask what manner of man the prisoner be he be accordingly inform that they be of a deep black color well shaped and a span taller than the native of mellus that they under lip be thicker than a man fist of a very red color and hang down on they breast with something like blood drop from it but that they upper lip be small like those of other man that the form of the under lip expose they gum and tooth which be larger than they own have great tooth in each corner of they mouth with large black eye and altogether a terrible appearance as the gum drop blood continually as well as the great hanging under lip this cross accident prevent all the succeed emperor of mellus from make any farther attempt of the kind because from that time these negro forbear for three year from come to buy salt as usual it be believe that they lip begin to putrify through the excessive heat of the climate and be no longer able to endure a distemper of which some must have die for want of the effectual remedy which they have experience from the use of salt they return of they own accord to traffic for that commodity in the old way all this have establish a opinion that they can not live without salt the negro of mellus judge of the case of other by they own as for the emperor of mellus he care not whether these black will speak and be see or not so that that he have the profit of they gold -lrb- 3 -rrb- this be all i could learn on this subject which i think may be credit as so many person have vouch for its truth of which i who have both see and hear of many wonderful thing in this world be perfectly satisfy the gold bring to mellus be divide into three part one part be send by the caravan which go annually from mellus to _ kokhium _ -lrb- 4 -rrb- which lie on the road to syrium and cairo the other two part go first to tombuctu whence one of they go by _ toet _ -lrb- 5 -rrb- to tuni and other port of the barbary coast and the other portion be carry to hoden and from thence to _ oran _ and _ one _ -lrb- 6 -rrb- town in barbary which be within the strait of gibraltar and to fez morocco arzilum azafus and messa town on the african coast of the atlantic where the italian and other christian procure it from the moor in return for various commodity gold be the best and principal commodity which come through the country of the azanhajus and a part of it be bring every year from hoden to arguin where it be barter with the portuguese -lrb- 7 -rrb- no money be coin in the land of the _ tawny moor _ or azenhajus nor be any money use by they or in any of the neighbouring

often dethrone they king by force who on the other hand often render themselves so powerful as to stand on they defense this render the government unsettled and be productive of civil war similar to egypt where the soldan of cairo be always in fear of be kill or banish the people be savage and extremely poor have no walled town and they village be entirely compose of thatched cottage they use

cultivate the land which be assign to he and sell the rest to the arab and azanhajus trader who bring horse and other thing for sale as likewise to the christian since they have establish a trade in these part every man may keep as many wife as he please the king have always upward of thirty and distinguish they accord to they descent and the rank of the lord whose daughter they be he keep they

have eat of such thing as he like best the remainder be give to he retinue but as this diet be never very plentiful they be but poorly feed he travel about in this manner from place to place visit he several wife by which mean he have a very numerous issue and whenever one of he wife happen to fall with child he visit she no more the lord or chief of the country live in a similar manner these negro profess I mahometan religion but be not even so well instruct in it as the tawny moor more especially the common people the lord have always about they some arab or azanhajus for this purpose who inculcate on they mind that it would be disgraceful for man of they quality to live in ignorance of the law of god like the common people who have no religion they have become mahometan merely by means of they intercourse with the azanhajus and arab for since they become acquaint with the christian they be by no means so fond of the mahometan faith the generality of the negro go quite naked except a piece of goat skin before but the lord who be able to procure such wear cotton shirt which be spin and manufacture by they woman they web be only a span in width as they have not sufficient

wear a piece of cotton which cover they from the waist to the middle of the leg both sex go barefooted and have no covering to they head and weave and tie they hair though short into neat tress the man often employ themselves in women work such as spin wash clothes and such like employment this country be extremely hot the month of January be not so cold as it be with we in italy in the month of April and the farther we go to the south the weather become so much the hotter both man and woman wash themselves four or five time a-day and be very cleanly in they person but be by no means so in regard of eat in which they observe no rule although very ignorant and extremely awkward in any thing to which they have not be accustom they be as expert as any european can be in they own business and in all thing with which they be acquaint they be full of word and extremely talkative and be for the most part liar and cheat yet they be exceedingly hospitable and charitably dispose as they will most readily give a dinner or a supper or a night lodge to any stranger who come to they house without expect any remuneration or reward the chief of these negro be often at war against each other or against the neighbouring tribe or nation but they have no cavalry for want of horse in war they only defensive armor be a large target make of the skin of a animal call _ danta _ which be very difficultly pierced and they principal weapon be _ azagay _ or light dart which they throw with great dexterity these dart be point with iron the length of a span and barb in different direction so that they make dangerous wound and tear the flesh extremely when pull out they have also a moorish weapon much-bent like a turkish sword or cimeter and make of iron without any steel which they procure from the negro on the river gambium as they either have no iron in they own country or want knowledge or industry in work it have but few weapon or rather no missile they war be very bloody as they soon come to close quarter and they stroke seldom fall in vain and be extremely fierce and courageous they will rather allow themselves to be slay as save themselves by flight neither be they dishearten by see they companion slay they have no ship nor have they ever see any before the portuguese come upon they coast but those who dwell upon the river senegal and some who be settle on the sea coast have _ zoppoly _ or canoe call _ almadias _ by the portuguese which be hollow out of a single piece of wood the largest of which will carry three or four man they use these almadia for catch

therefore be confide in i stop at he country that i might endeavor to dispose of some spanish horse i have on board which be in great request among the negro besides which i have some cloth moorish work silk and other commodity for sale we come therefore to anchor at a place on the coast call palma di budomel which be only a open roadstead and not a port i immediately dispatch my negro interpreter on shore to inform this lord of my arrival and of the goods i have on board for sale not long afterwards budomel come himself to the beach attend by about fifteen horseman and a hundred and fifty foot and send a message desire I to land with profession of a friendly disposition and promise to render I every attention and service in he power i go accordingly on shore immediately and be receive with great civility after some discourse i deliver to he seven horse with they furniture and every other article for which he express a inclination all of which have cost I 300 ducat trust to he honor for payment which be to be in slave and which he promise to deliver at he own residence which be twenty-five mile distant from the shore whither he invite I to accompany he to this invitation i readily agree induce as much by a desire of see the country as on account of receive payment before set out however budomel make I a present of a beautiful negress about twelve year of age who he say be mean to serve I in the cabin and i receive the gift and send she on board the caravel i be furnish by budomel with horse and every thing necessary for the journey and when we arrive within four mile of he residence he give I in charge to he nephew bisboror who be lord of a small town or village at which we stop bisboror take I to he own house where i be treat with much civility and attention during twenty-eight day which i tarry in that place this be in November 1455 in that time i go often to visit budomel accompany by he nephew and have many opportunity to observe the produce of the country and the manners of the inhabitant more especially as on account of the tempestuous weather i be under the necessity of travel back by land to the river senegal for find it impossible to get on board at the coast by reason of the surf i have to order the ship to return to that river and go there by land to re-embark on this occasion be very desirous to transmit instruction to those on board the ship to meet I at the river senegal i inquire among the negro if any one would undertake to carry a letter from the shore several of they readily offer they service though the ship lay three mile from the shore and owe to a strong wind the sea break on the shore with a tremendous surf insomuch that i think it impossible for any one to succeed in the attempt besides the surf there be several sand bank near the shore and other bank about half way to the ship between which there run a strong current sometimes one way and sometimes the other along shore so that it be extremely difficult for any one to swim through without infinite danger of be carry away by the stream and the sea break with such violence on the bank that it seem quite impossible to surmount such complicated obstacle yet two of the negro offer to go and only demand two _ mavulgy _ of tin for each of they one mavulgus be worth no more than a _ grosso _ -lrb- 2 -rrb- at which price they engage to carry my letter in safety to the ship i can not express the difficulty which they encounter in pass the sand bank they be sometimes out of sight for a considerable space so that i often think they be both drown at last one of they find himself unable to resist the violence with which the wave break over he turn back but the other be stronger get over the bank after struggle a whole hour and have carry the letter to the caravel return with a answer this seem to I very wonderful and make I conclude that the negro of this coast must be the most expert swimmer in the world it have be already observe that those who be call lord in this country have neither castle nor city the king even have nothing but village with thatched house budomel be lord of one part of this kingdom yet he place of residence be not a palace nor even a walled house these great man be not lord on account of they riches or treasure as they possess neither nor have they any coin in use among they but they be consider as such out of courtesy and on account of the great retinue by which they be always attend be more fear and respect by they subject than any of the lord in italy budomel have several village appoint for he own habitation and that of he wife as he never fix in one place the village in which i reside with bisboror be one of he habitation contain between forty and fifty thatched cottage build near one another and surround with ditch and strong pallisade have only one or two passage leave for enter and every house have a court-yard inclose by a hedge accord to report budomel have nine wife in this place and more or less in several other village each of these wife have five or six young negress to attend upon she with all of whom he might sleep when he please without give offence to the wife for such be the custom of the country both sex be extremely amorous and budomel strongly importune I for philactery in which he have be inform the european be very expert and offer any reward within he power for my compliance they be very jealous and suffer no man to enter the house which be inhabit by the woman not even they own son budomel be always attend by a retinue of at least 200 negro who be change from time to time some go away and other come back in they room besides which many people repair to wait upon he from the adjacent place which be under he government before arrive at he particular apartment there be seven large court one within the other have a tree in the middle of each where those wait who come to he on business he family be distribute in these court accord to they several rank the most considerable have they station in the court nearest he dwelling and the meanest in the outermost court of all few people be allow to approach he own particular apartment except the christian and azanhajus who have free admission and more liberty be allow to they than to the negro this lord affect great state and gravity in he deportment and do not allow himself to be see except a hour every morning and for a short while in the evening at which time he appear near the door of a apartment in the first court into which only person of note be permit to enter on these occasion of give audience every person who come to speak to he however high may be he rank be in the first place oblige to strip himself stark naked except the small cloth in front formerly mention and immediately on enter the court he fall down on he knee bow down he head to the ground and scatter dust with both hand on he own head and shoulder neither be even the nearest relation of the lord exempt from this humiliating expression of they duty and obedience the person who receive a audience continue in this humble posture a great while strew himself with sand and crawl on he knee till he approach the great man and when within two pace of he lord he stop and begin to relate he case still continue on he knee with he head down and throw sand a he head in token of great humility all the time the lord scarcely appear to notice he and continue to discourse with other person and when the vassal have relate he story the lord give he a answer in two word with a arrogant aspect such be they affected pride and grandeur and such the submission which be shewn he which in my opinion proceed from fear as they lord for every little fault they commit take away they wife and child and cause they to be sell as slave budomel treat I with the utmost attention and civility and use to carry I in the evening into a sort of mosque where the arab and azanhaji priest whom he have always about he person use to say prayer he manner on these occasion be as follow be enter into the mosque which be in one of the court belong to he residence and where he be attend by some of the principal negro he first stand some little time with he eye lift up as if it be to heaven then advance two step he speak a few word in a low tone after which he stretch himself on the ground which he kiss the azanhajus and the rest of he attendant do the same then rise up he repeat the same series of action repeatedly for ten or twelve time which occupy about half a hour when all be over he ask my opinion of they manner of worship and desire one to give a account of the nature of we religion on this i tell he in the presence of all he doctor that the religion of mahomet be false and the romish the only true faith this make the arab and azanhajus extremely angry but budomel laugh on the occasion and say that he consider the religion of the christian to be good as god alone could have gifted they with so much riches and understand he add however that in he opinion the mahometan law must be good also and he believe that the negro be more sure of salvation than the christian because god be just who have give a paradise to the christian in this world and would certainly give one to the negro in the next as they possess scarcely any good in this world in comparison in all he discourse he shew a good understanding and take great pleasure in hear the custom of the christian describe i firmly believe he might easily have be convert to christianity have it not be from fear of lose he power as i be often tell by he nephew with whom i lodged and he take great delight in hearing I discourse of we religion the table of budomel like all other lord and people of condition in this country be supply by he wife in the same manner as have be already mention in regard to zukholin the king of senegal each wife send he a certain number of dish every day he and the other lord eat on the ground without any regularity or company except the arab and azanhajus who be they teacher and priest and one or two of they principal negro attendant the inferior people eat in mess of ten or twelve each have a basket full of victuals set in the midst into which all put they hand at the same time they eat but little at one meal but repeat these four or five time a day -lrb- 1 -rrb- the text seem corrupt in give so large a distance between the senegal river and this country of king budomel as 800 mile to the south or rather s s e would carry we to what be call the _ grain _ or windward coast of guinea in lat 6  n and from the sequel cada mosto do not appear to have pass cape verd till after quit the country of budomel accord to brue as quote by clarke the king of kayor or kayhor be style damel kayor or cayor appear on we map above a hundred mile up the senegal and on its north side which therefore can have no reference to the place in the text i be dispose to believe that the distance in the text ought only to have be 80 mile and that the territory of budomel be in the country of the jalof between the senegal and cape verd at the mouth of a small river on which we chart place two town masaye and enibaul in lat 15  20 ' n -- e -lrb- 2 -rrb- the grosso or venetian groat be worth about three farthing -- astl section vi _ account of the country of budomel continue _ on account of the great heat in the kingdom of senegal and all the other country of the negro on the coast no wheat rye barley or spelt can grow neither be vine cultivate as we know experimentally from a trial make with seed from we ship : for wheat and these other article of culture require a temperate climate and frequent shower both of which be want here where they have no rain during nine month of the year from October to June both include but they have large and small millet bean and the largest and finest kidney bean in the world as large as hazle nut longer than those of the venetian territory and beautifully speckled with various color as if paint they bean be large flat and of a lively red color and they have likewise white bean they sow in July at the beginning of the rain and reap in September when they cease thus they prepare the soil sow the seed and get in the harvest all in three month but they be bad husbandman and so exceedingly averse to labor that they sow no more than be barely sufficient to last they throughout the year and never lay up any store for sale in cultivate the ground four or five of they go into a field with spade with which they turn up the soil about four inch deep yet such be the fertility of the soil that it make ample return for this slight culture without any farther trouble the liquor of the negro be water milk and palm wine which they call mighol or migwol which be take from a tree of the palm tribe very numerous in this country somewhat like the date tree but not the same and which furnish this liquor the whole year round the tree be tap in two or three place near the root and from these wound a brown juice run out as thin as skimmed milk into calabass that be place to receive the liquor which drop but slowly as one tree will only fill two calabass from morning till night this migwol or palm - wine be a exceedingly pleasant drink which intoxicate like wine unless mix with water immediately after it be draw from the tree it be as sweet as any wine whatever but the luscious taste go off more and more as it be keep and at length it become sour it drink better than at first after three or four day as it depurate by keep and be not so sweet i have often drink of it indeed every day that i remain in the country and like it better than the wine of italy this liquor be not so abundant as that every one may have it at discretion yet all may have some especially the chief as the tree be not plant in garden like vine and fruit tree in europe but be find wild in the forest and be consequently accessible to all in this country there be several sort of fruit which resemble those of europe though not exactly the same and which be very good though they grow wild and be they to be cultivate as ours be would prove much better than such as be produce in the northern climate the quality of the soil and air in this part of africa be more nutritive the whole country be plain and fertile abound in good pasture and be cover by a infinite number of large and beautiful tree that be not know in europe it contain several lake of fresh water none of they large but very deep and full of excellent fish which differ much from those that be catch in italy and many water serpent which the native call _ kalkatrici _ they use a kind of oil with they victuals which taste like oil of olive have a pleasant flavor of violet and tinge the food even better than saffron but i could not learn what it be produce from -lrb- 1 -rrb- there be likewise a plant which produce large quantity of small kidney-bean in this country there be many kind of animal but serpent be particularly numerous both large and small some of which be venomous the large one be more than two pace long -lrb- 2 -rrb- but have neither leg nor wing as have be report by some person but some of they be so very thick as to have swallow a goat at one morsel these serpent retire in troops as the native report to certain part of the country where white ant be find in prodigious swarm and which by a kind of instinct be say to build house for these serpent of earth which they carry in they month for that purpose resemble oven and often to the number of 150 in one place -lrb- 3 -rrb- the negro be great enchanter and use charm upon almost all occasion particularly in regard to serpent over which they have great power a genoese worthy of credit who be in this country the year before my arrival and who likewise lodge with bisboror the nephew of budomel tell I he once hear a load noise of whistle about the house in the middle of the night be awaken by the noise he see bisboror get out of bed and order two negro to bring he camel be ask where he mean to go at that time of night he say he have business which must be execute but would soon return on come back after some time and the genoese express curiosity to learn the object in which he have be engage bisboror ask if he have hear the hissing noise about the house during the night and say that it have be make by the serpent which would have kill a great many of he cattle if he have not send they back to they quarter by the employment of certain enchantment the genoese be astonish at this story but bisboror say he have no need to wonder at this small matter as budomed could do a great deal more extraordinary thing with the serpent than he could in particular when he have a mind to envenom he weapon he use to draw a large circle into which by means of he enchantment he bring all the serpent of the neighborhood from which he select those he think most poisonous and allow all the other to go away with the blood of these serpent mix up with the seed of a certain tree he infect he weapon with so deadly a poison that if they draw but the least drop of blood the person or animal wound by they be sure to die in a quarter of a hour bisboror farther offer to shew he a example of the efficacy of this art but the genoese decline witness the experiment this story of the serpent be the more probable that i have hear of person in italy who could charm they in a similar manner but i be apt to believe that the negro be the most expert sorcerer in the world the only tame animal in the kingdom of senegal be oxen cow and goat have no sheep which love a temperate or cold air and could not live in this hot climate nature however have provide mankind with necessaries fit for they various occasion have furnish the european with wool as they have need of warm clothing while the negro who live in such intense heat have be supply with cotton by the almighty owing to the heat in my opinion the cattle of this country be much smaller than those of italy it be a great rarity to see a red cow in this country as they be all black or white or mottled with black and white spot beast of prey such as lion leopard and wolf be numerous and there be plenty of hare wild elephant go about in troops like the wild swine in italy but can never be tame as they be in other part of the world as the elephant be a well-known animal i shall only observe in general that those of africa be of a very large size as may be easily conceive by the size of they tooth which be import into europe of these large tooth or tusk rather each elephant have two in the lower jaw the point of which turn down whereas those of the wild boar be turn up before my voyage to africa i have be tell that the elephant could not bend its knee and sleep standing but this be a egregious falsehood for the bend of they knee can be plainly perceive when they walk and they certainly lie down and rise again like other animal they never shed they large tooth before death neither do they do any harm to man unless provoke in that case the elephant make he attack with he trunk which be a kind of nose protrude to a great length he can contract and extend this proboscis at pleasure and be able to toss a man with it as far as a sling can throw a stone it be in vain to think of escape by run let the person be ever so swift in case the elephant pursue in earnest as he stride be of prodigious length they be more dangerous when they have young one in they company than at any other time of which the female have only three or four at a birth they feed on the leaf and fruit of tree pull down the large bough with they trunk and bring they to they mouth this trunk be compose of a very thick cartilage and be pliable in every direction there be many kind of bird in this country and parrot be particularly numerous which be much hate by the negro because they do much damage to they crop of pulse and millet there be say to be several kind of parrot but i never see more than two one of these be like the kind which be bring into italy from alexandrium in egypt but rather smaller the other kind be much larger have a brown head neck bill and leg with a yellow and green body i procure a considerable number of both sort particularly of the smaller kind many of which die but i bring 150 back to portugal where i sell they for half a ducat each these bird be very industrious in construct they nest which they build with bulrush and the small leaf of the palm and other tree in a very curious and ingenious manner choose the slenderest branch of a tree the parrot fasten a bulrush of about two span long to its outer extremity at the depend end of which rush it weave its nest in a most beautiful manner suspend like a ball and have only one passage for enter by this mean they contrive to preserve they young from be devour by the serpent as the small twig from which the nest be suspend be unable to bear the weight of the serpent there be likewise abundance of those bird call pharaoh 's hen -lrb- 4 -rrb- in europe which come to we out of the levant they have likewise other bird both large and small which be quite different from any that be know in italy as i be long on shore i go several time to see they market or fair which be hold every Monday and Friday in a meadow not far from where i reside the man and woman from four or five mile around come to this place with they various commodity and those who live at a greater distance go to other market nearer they habitation the great poverty of the native appear manifest in the goods they bring to these fair consist of small quantity of cotton cloth and cotton yarn pulse oil millet wooden tub palm matt and every thing else useful to life accord to they manners likewise arm and some small quantity of gold have no money or coin of any kind all they trade be carry on by way of barter or exchange of one thing for another sometimes two or three thing for one accord to they different value all these black use to gaze on I as if i have be a prodigy have never see a white man before some take hold of my hand which they rub with spittle to see if the whiteness be natural or artificial and express they wonder to find that my skin be not paint they be as much astonished at my dress be clothe in the spanish fashion with a black damask waistcoat and a cloak over it : they seem much surprised at the waistcoat and greatly admire the woollen cloth which they have never see any of before my chief purpose in go to these fair be to see what quantity of gold be bring thither horse be very scarce and of great value in the country of the negro be bring all the way from that part of barbary which lie nearest to europe by the arab and azanhajus owe to the great heat horse do not live long here for they grow so fat that they can not stale and so burst they be feed with bean leave which be gather after the bean be bring from the field and be dry like hay be cut small and give to the horse instead of oats they give millet also which contribute greatly to make they fat a horse and he furniture sell for from nine to fourteen negro accord to he goodness and beauty and when a negro lord buy a horse he send for he horse sorcerer who cause a fire to be kindle of the stalk of certain herb and hold the horse head by the bridle over the smoke while they repeat over some few word by way of incantation they afterwards have he anoint all over with fine oil and have keep he eighteen or twenty day without allow any one to see he they affix some moorish charm to he neck which have the appearance of small square billet of write fold up and cover with red leather and affirm that they will go into battle with greater safety by means of these scroll or annulet the woman of this country be very pleasant and merry especially the young one and delight in singing and dancing take this diversion only at night by moonlight and they manner of dancing be very different from that of the italian many thing in we ship seem wonderful to the negro particularly we cross-bow but much more we artillery when some of they be on board my ship i cause one of the gun to be fire off which throw they into a dreadful panic and they terror be much increase on be tell that one cannon-shot could kill a hundred man on which account they allege that it must be something belong to the devil they be likewise greatly astonish at a bag-pipe which one of we sailor play upon to divert they and on examine the several part and ornament of the instrument they conceive that it be a living animal which sing in different voice observe they simplicity i tell they it be a musical instrument and put it into they hand unblown to examine they then perceive that it be a work of art but believe that it be something supernatural and could only have be devise by a superior be it sound so sweetly and in so many different tone have never hear any thing which could be compare to it in they estimation the ship also and its various contrivance as its anchor mast sail and shroud afford they great subject for admiration and wonder they look upon the port-hole in the stern as real eye by which the vessel be able to find she way in the sea and observe that traveller on land find difficulty to find the road from one place to another while we be able to travel along the trackless ocean and that the whites must therefore be the greatest of sorcerer not inferior to the devil himself they shew great admiration on see a light candle in a candlestick have themselves no other artificial light but that proceed from a fire they have honey-comb but when they find these they suck out the honey and throw away the empty comb as useless at one time i buy some honey-comb from a negro and shew he how to extract the honey after which on ask he if he know what remain he say it be good for nothing : but he be greatly astonish on see it make into candle and light in he presence say that the european know every thing they only musical instrument be two one of which they have from the moor which be like a large drum -lrb- 5 -rrb- the other be somewhat like a fiddle have only two string which they play on with they finger but give no sound that can be call harmonious -lrb- 1 -rrb- this be almost certainly palm oil the origin of which will appear in another division of this work -- e -lrb- 2 -rrb- the text must be here erroneous as two pace or ten foot will scarcely suffice in describe the boa constrictor sometimes near thirty foot long -- e -lrb- 3 -rrb- a account of the termite or white ant of africa will appear hereafter the circumstance of serpent take up they abode in the large anthill must be entirely accidental -- e -lrb- 4 -rrb- probably the pintado or guinea fowl -- e -lrb- 5 -rrb- this in ramusio be call tabacche and sambuka in grynaeus -- astl section vii _ continuation of the voyage from senegal by cape verd the river barbasinus and to the river gambium and return to portugal _ have see a considerable part of the dominion of budomel and receive the slave which be bargain for in exchange for my horse and other merchandize i resolve to proceed on my voyage round cape verd and to prosecute discovery along this dangerous coast and in particular to go in search of the kingdom of gambium or gambium which don henry have point out on the information of a person who be well acquaint with the country of the negro as not far from senegal and from whence it be report that considerable quantity of gold might be procure longing to go in quest of this gold i take my leave of budomel and repair to the river senegal where i go on board the caravel and get under weigh as soon as possible soon after leave the river senegal as we be stand onward with a press of sail towards cape verd we descry one morning two ship in the offing on join company we find that one of these belong to antonio a experienced genoese navigator and the other to some gentleman in the service of don henry and that they have sail in company with the intention of pass cape verd to explore the coast beyond it in search of new discovery we intention be similar i offer to join company and we accordingly proceed together along the coast to the southward in sight of land we come in sight of that cape next day be about thirty italian mile from we last anchorage -lrb- 1 -rrb- cape verd be so name by the portuguese who discover it about a year before -lrb- 2 -rrb- because it be cover with tree which continue green all the year this be a high and beautiful cape which run a considerable way into the sea and have two hill or small mountain at its outer extremity there be several village of the senegal negro or jalof upon and about this promontory which be compose of thatched cabin close by the shore and in sight of those who sail past there be also some sand bank which extend about half a mile into the sea -lrb- 3 -rrb- have double the cape we come to three small uninhabited island full of green tree -lrb- 4 -rrb- and be in want of water we anchor at that which seem the largest and most fruitful in hope of meeting with a spring but could find none to answer we purpose we meet however with the nest and egg of several kind of bird such as we have never see before this be in the month of July 1456 and we continue here all day fishing with line and large hook catch a prodigious number of fish among which be _ dentali _ and gilded fish -lrb- 5 -rrb- some of which weigh from twelve to fifteen pound each on the next day we proceed in we course keep always in sight of land and find a kind of gulf form by the coast on the south side of the cape -lrb- 6 -rrb- this coast be all low and full of fine large tree which be continually green as the new leaf grow before the old one fall off and they never wither like those in europe and the tree grow so near the shore that they seem to drink as it be the water of the sea the coast be most beautiful insomuch that i never see any thing comparable to it though i have sail much both in the levant and the western part of europe it be well water every where by small river but these be useless for trade as they do not admit ship of any size beyond this little gulf the coast be inhabit by two negro nation call barbasinus and serrerus which be not subject to the king of senegal neither have they any king or lord of they own but one person be more honor than another accord to he condition or quality they be great idolater without law and live in almost a state of nature and extremely cruel and refuse to become subject to any lord that they wife and child may not be take from they and sell as slave as be the custom among all the negro nation which be under subjection to king or lord they use bow and poison arrow the wound from which be incurable if even the smallest blood be draw and the wound person or animal soon die they color be jet black and they person be well make the country be full of wood lake and stream from which they derive great security as they can only be invade through narrow defile by which mean they set the neighbouring lord at defiance in former time the king of senegal often attempt to reduce these two nation under obedience but be always worst owe to the natural strength of the country and they arrow run along the coast to the south with a fair wind we discover the mouth of a river about a bow-shot wide but not deep to which we give the name of the _ barbasinus _ river and have mark it on the chart which i make of the coast as sixty mile from cape verd -lrb- 7 -rrb- in sailing along the coast we only make sail at sun rise have a man continually on the top and two other on the prow or head to look out for breaker and always come to anchor at sun set about four or five mile from the land in ten or twelve fathom water proceeding on we voyage in this cautious manner we come to the mouth of a river which appear to be as large as the senegal -lrb- 8 -rrb- and strike by the fineness of its appearance and its rich wood which come down to the very shore we cast anchor and determine to send one of we negro interpreter on shore to endeavor to establish a friendly intercourse with the native every ship which sail from portugal for the coast of africa be supply with some of these negro interpreter who consist of slave that have be sell by the lord of senegal to the first portuguese who touch on the coast and who have learn the portuguese language and become christian these be hire from they master in portugal who receive for they hire a prime slave from the cargo on return from the voyage and when any of these interpreter have thus earn four slave for they master they become free have cast lot to determine which of the three ship should send a interpreter on shore it fall on the ship command by the genoese gentleman on which he send a armed boat order the man not to touch the shore but to push off as soon as they have land the interpreter who be charge to inform himself respect the condition and government of the country and to inquire whether it produce gold or any other commodity worth come for no sooner be the interpreter land and the boat shove off to some distance as order than several native come out of the wood who have be in ambush with bow arrow and other weapon from the time they see we ship approach the coast as if they have be in hope that some of we people might land upon the coast after a short parley with we interpreter they furiously assault he with they _ gomy _ or short moorish sword and slew he we people in the boat be unable to give he any assistance this intelligence be bring to the ship where it excite much surprise and conclude that these people must be extremely barbarous who could treat one of they own race with so much barbarity and would consequently use we cruelly if in they power we immediately weigh anchor and stand on we voyage farther to the south which improve in the beauty and verdure of the tree as we advance always sailing within sight of the coast which be everywhere low land cover with tree we come at length to the mouth of a very large river which be not less than six or eight mile wide at the entrance and narrow a little way within to three or four mile and find that it could be safely enter we determine to cast anchor for the night and to endeavor to learn next day if this be the river and kingdom of gambra or gambium of which we be in search -lrb- 9 -rrb- we judge however from its noble river that we have now attain the so anxiously desire country of gambium and flattered ourselves in the hope of find a country of vast riches where we might make we fortune at once by return laden with gold and other rich commodity next day have but little wind we send on the small caravel before well man with direction as they ship be small and draw little water that they be to proceed as far as possible up the river observe whether there be any bar or sand bank at its mouth and to take the sounding with great care and if the river be find navigable they be to return and make signal to that effect find four fathom water at the entrance the caravel bring to and make the concerted signal on which it be think proper as that caravel be small to send another boat well arm along with she up the river and they be strictly enjoin in case the native be hostile to enter into no conflict with they but to return immediately to the other ship as the object of we voyage be to cultivate friendship and trade with the country which could only be accomplish by policy not by force the boat accordingly proceed up the river for two mile leave the small caravel at anchor and find the bank everywhere beautiful with sixteen fathom water but as the river above this make several return or reach they do not think it prudent to venture any higher when on they way back they see three _ almadia _ or canoe near the mouth of a small river which run into the large one these almadia resemble the skiff use in italy which be call _ zoppoli _ and be hollow out of one large piece of wood although we boat be strongly armed yet in obedience to they order and for fear of be attack with poison arrow which the negro of senegal have tell we be use by all the native of gambium they take to they oar and make all possible haste back to the ship by the time they get on board the almadia which follow they close be within arrow flight there be about twenty-five or thirty negro in these three almadia who stop for some time gaze at the caravel which be quite a new sight to they but would neither speak nor come nearer notwithstanding every endeavor by sign to induce they to approach and at length they return to the shore about three next morning the other three caravel that have remain at anchor without the river sail with the rise tide and a light breeze into the river to rejoin the small caravel and to proceed up the river hope to meet with a more civilized people than have be see in the almadia in this way we sail up the river one after the other the small caravel lead and when we have get about four mile up we perceive ourselves to be follow by a number of _ almadia _ without know whence they come on this we tack about and bear down towards the almadia have first fortify ourselves in the best manner we could to defend we against they poison arrow and make every thing ready for battle in case of need though by no means well provide with arm we order of sailing be now reverse and my ship be foremost in go down the river we soon come to the almadia which separate into two division have my ship between they when i have a opportunity to count they number as they give over rowing raise they oar and gaze in wonder at we ship : there be in all fifteen almadia of considerable length have from 130 to 150 negro all well make of a good size and very black they wear white cotton shirt have white cap like those worn by the german on they head but with a wing on each side and a feather in the middle which i suppose to be a distinguishing mark of they be soldier there stand a negro on the prow of each almadium have a round target apparently of leather on he arm and for some time they neither attack we nor we they when they see the other caravel bear down upon they they drop they oar and take up they bow send a flight of arrow on board see this attack we ship discharge four piece of cannon at they and they be so stupified by the report that they throw down they bow and stare about in amazement at the effect which the stone from the cannon make on the water around they they continue in this astonishment for some time but see that the cannon cease to fire they pluck up courage and renew the fight advance within a stone throw of the ship on this we sailor begin to use they cross-bow and the first shot which be make by the natural son of the genoese gentleman hit a negro on the breast who instantly fall down dead those in the almadium where he fall take up the dart and gaze at it with wonder yet they continue the attack with great vigor and be courageously oppose by we caravel insomuch that many of the negro be soon kill without the loss of one man on we side the negro now change they mode of attack and make a furious united attack on the stern of we smallest caravel which be both ill manned and insufficiently arm on observe this i bring up my ship to she assistance and the other large caravel do the same we place the small one between we and we all vigorously ply we cannon and cross-bow against the almadia which be at last force to retire we now link all the three caravel together and drop one anchor which be sufficient for we all as it be calm weather and the current by no means strong we next endeavor to enter into some conversation with the negro and often hail they by means of we interpreter at length one of the almadia draw near and on be ask the reason of they hostility to stranger who come among they only to trade in a friendly manner as they have already do with the negro of the kingdom of senegal and be desirous of be on the same friendly term with they if they think proper and be come from a far distant country with present for they king or lord from the king of portugal who be desirous of peace and friendship with they we interpreter also entreat the negro to inform we what country we be in who be they king and what be the name of the river and desire they to come freely on board and take what goods they please add that they might make a return in any commodity they think proper and in any quantity they please or might have we goods for nothing to all this they make answer that they have some intelligence of the christian already and of they dealings with the negro of senegal who must be very wicked people for enter into friendship with they as they be well assure the christian be meneater who buy the negro only to devour they and for this reason they be resolve to have no correspondence with they except to destroy they and then to send they effect to they lord who dwell three day journey up the country they add that the name of they country be gambra but i have forget the name they give the river -lrb- 10 -rrb- at this time a brisk breeze spring up and as we now thoroughly know the hostile disposition of the negro we bear down upon they almadia but they flee to the shore and we dropt down to the mouth of the river while we remain off the mouth of this river we only once see the north star in clear weather and it be then so low as hardly to appear above the height of a lance above the sea -lrb- 11 -rrb- we likewise observe in about the same elevation due south by the compass a constellation of six large bright star in the figure of a cross in this form : \* \* \* \* \* \* we conjecture this to be the _ southern chariot _ but could not expect to observe the principal star as we have not yet lose sight of the north pole in this place on the _ first _ of July we find the night to be eleven hour and a half long and the day twelve hour and a half the climate be always hot and i be tell that even the rain in the inland part fall warm in consequence of the great heat of the air it be true that there be some difference of the heat at different season and when the heat be a little diminish the native call it winter the rain begin in July and continue till the end of October and fall every day about noon at which time certain cloud arise in the ne by e or ene which be accompany by prodigious thunder and lightning and vast torrent of rain in this season which be in the beginning of July the negro sow they grain in the same manner with the people in senegal they provision consist of millet pulse flesh and milk there be not so much dawn at break of day in this southern latitude as with we in italy for within half a hour after the darkness of the night begin to dispel the sun appear and during all that dawn the atmosphere be turbid as if fill with smoke and the moment the sun appear this mist be dissipate i could only account for this phenomenon by attribute it to the low and flat surface of this country which be destitute of mountain and my companion be of a similar opinion on hold a consultation among the commander of the three caravel we come to a resolution of proceed about a hundred mile up the river in hope of meeting with a less ferocious and better disposed people in the interior than those we have encounter at the mouth of this river : but the sailor be impatient to return home without incur any farther danger and unanimously and loudly refuse they consent to we determination declare that they have already do enough for the present voyage upon this be make know to we and be well aware that seaman be of headstrong and obstinate disposition we concede to they clamor and steer next day for cape verd on we return to portugal -lrb- 12 -rrb- -lrb- 1 -rrb- cape verd be about 100 mile from the southern mouth of the river senegal so that the voyager probably anchor every night within sight of the scarcely know coast -- e -lrb- 2 -rrb- this be erroneous as it be discover in 1446 by deni fernandez nine year before -- clarke -lrb- 3 -rrb- it be necessary to be cautious with respect to these early voyage which have go through various transcription and translation be liable to numerous error in we best chart this sand bank intermix with sink rock extend two mile out to sea -- e -lrb- 4 -rrb- call the bird island or the magdalen -- clarke -lrb- 5 -rrb- in ramusio these fish be call orate vecchi and in grynaeus ostrea vetere -- astl -lrb- 6 -rrb- this appear to indicate the gulf between cape emanuel near the isle of goree and the red cape -- e -lrb- 7 -rrb- the river name barbasinus be above eighty-five mile sse from cape verd measure to its northern entrance and form a small island or delta at its mouth have another entrance about eighteen mile farther south there be a small island name _ fettus _ off its northern entrance of which no notice be take by cada mosto the native on this part of the coast to the north of the gambium be now call barra -- e -lrb- 8 -rrb- from the sequel i be apt to conclude that this second river be the barbasinus of we chart and that the river name barbasinus in the text of cada mosto be that name _ joall _ in modern chart -- e -lrb- 9 -rrb- cada mosto betray strange ignorance of the previous discovery of the portuguese consider that he have reside some time with don henry at sagre this fine river be discover in 1447 nine year before by nuno tristan who ascend it some way and be slay there by the poison arrow of the negro perhaps even don henry be mislead by the name of rio grande which it then receive and confuse the venetian in he search for the gambium -- clarke -lrb- 10 -rrb- from this it would appear that gambra or gambium be the name of the country not of the river johnson say that the native always call it _ gee _ which merely signify the river -- astl -lrb- 11 -rrb- the center of the mouth of the gambium be in lat 13  30 ' n -- e -lrb- 12 -rrb- it may be notice that during the whole of he narrative cada mosto constantly speak of spain and the spanish language as if forget that the ship and crew be portuguese -- clarke section viii _ the second voyage of cada mosto in 1456 to the coast of africa in which the cape de verd island be discover _ -lrb- 1 -rrb- as i could say little or nothing about the condition of the country of gambium on my return to portugal on account of be oblige to leave it so suddenly partly owe to the intractable and fierce disposition of the native and partly through the perversity of we sailor who refuse to proceed in explore the river the genoese gentleman antonio who have be with I in the former voyage and i resolve next season to fit out two caravel in order to return to the river gambium and don henry who be much pleased with we intention determine to send one of he caravel along with we every thing be make ready for we voyage we sail from lago near cape st vincent with a favourable wind in the beginning of may and steer for the canary which we make in a few day but as the wind continue favourable we do not touch there and continue we course to the southward and as we be favor by a current setting to the s w we sail on at a great rate at last we come in sight of cape branco keep well out at sea and on the follow night we be assail by a great storm from the s w which occasion we to steer w by n for two day and three night in order to weather the tempest rather than turn back on the third day to we great joy and surprise we descry land be much astonished to discover land in a quarter where no person could have expect it -lrb- 2 -rrb- two man be immediately send aloft who cry out that two large island be in sight this news be communicate through the ship to we great satisfaction as we be sensible these island be unknown in portugal judge it probable that these island might be inhabit and eager to try we fortune we steer towards one of they which we soon come up with and sail round a part of it till we find safe anchorage the weather be now much calm we send we boat on shore well man and arm the man land and have examine some part of the island bring back word that they could meet with no sign of inhabitant whatever next morning to clear up all doubt i send ten man to land on the island well arm with gun and cross-bow whom i order to go to the top of some mountain within sight and to look from thence not only for people but for more island these man execute my command but find no appearance of any inhabitant they find however a incredible number of pigeon which be so tame be stranger to man that they readily allow themselves to be catch and we people bring great number of they to the caravel but what be of much more importance they bring intelligence of have discover three other island one of which be to leeward towards the north could not be see from the ship while the other two lay to the south all within sight of each other these man likewise notice something resemble island towards the west but at so great a distance that they could not be clearly distinguish neither do i think proper to sail in that direction lest i should lose time in visit uninhabited island like this at which we have touch the fame of my discovery of these four island bring other navigator afterwards to explore this group who round they to be ten in number both large and small include and altogether uninhabited except by pigeon and other bird and have a fine fishery -lrb- 3 -rrb- leave the first island we come in sight of the other two and search for a anchoring place near one of they which be full of tree discover the mouth of a river and be in want of water we come to anchor and send we boat on shore to supply we want some of we people go a little way up the river where they find some small lake contain remarkably fine white salt of which they bring large quantity to the ship lay in what store be think necessary as we do likewise of water we find here great number of tortoise or turtle the shell of which be larger than a target the sailor cook these into different dish as they have do before in the gulf of arguin where these animal be find in plenty but not so large as here out of curiosity i eat some of the flesh of these tortoise which seem very good have a good smell and taste and be not inferior to veal we salt a great number of they which prove a valuable addition to we stock of provision during the voyage we catch likewise a prodigious quantity of fish both off the mouth of the river and in the stream and though we know not the kind they be large and well-flavoured the mouth of this river be a good arrow-shot across and it be deep enough to admit a vessel of 150 ton we remain two day in this place for refreshment take in a good stock of tortoise and fish and large quantity of pigeon which we kill without number to the first island at which we anchor we give the name of _ bona vista _ as be the first we get sight of and to this other which seem the largest of the four the name of st jago have cast anchor there on the day of st philip and st jame every thing be in readiness for pursue we voyage we take we departure from these island and shape we course for cape verd we arrive at _ spedegar _ and keep within sight of land we come to a place name the _ two palm _ which be between cape verd and the river senegal be perfectly acquaint with the coast we double the cape next day and come once more to the river gambium into which we immediately enter and find no opposition from the negro or they almadia we sail up the river always by day and continually sound such of the almadia as we see on the river keep at a distance close to the bank of the river and never venture to approach about ten mile up the river we cast anchor on a Sunday morning at a island where one of we sailor be bury who have die of a fever and as he name happen to be andrew we call it the island of st andrew -lrb- 4 -rrb- leave this island we proceed up the river follow by some of the negro in they almadia yet always keep at a considerable distance we interpreter often hail they and shew they various trinket which be offer for they acceptance and endeavor to entice they to come near by tell they that we be good-natured civilized people from whom they have nothing to fear work upon by these representation the negro at length approach and come up with my caravel and at last one of they who understand the language of we interpreter come on board he be greatly surprize at every thing he see in and about the caravel especially with the sail and rig have no other idea of move a vessel on the water but by means of oar he be no less amaze at we color and dress as he nation mostly go stark naked or with a single white cotton shirt as they sole dress we be exceedingly kind and attentive to this negro and make he many present of trinket and other thing of small value with which he be much delighted i ask he many question respect the country through we interpreter and at length learn that we be in the country of gambium of which forosangolus be chief lord and by what we could learn from he the residence of forosangolus be at the distance of nine or ten day journey in a direction between the south and the southwest he say that forosangolus be tributary to the king of mellus who be the great emperor of the negro that there be many inferior lord who dwell near the river on both side and if we please he would conduct we to the residence of one of these lord name battimansa and would endeavor to negociate a treaty of peace and friendship between he and we be much pleased with this offer we carry this negro along with we and treat he with much attention and sailing up the river we come to the place where battimansa reside which in my opinion be above forty mile from the mouth of the river in go up the river into which several lesser river fall we sail to the eastward and at the place where we come to anchor we find it much narrower than at the mouth be not above a mile in breadth by we estimation -lrb- 5 -rrb- on come to this place we send one of we interpreter and the native negro to battimansa with a present of a handsome garment call a _ alzimba _ make of moorish silk in the form of a shirt and they be desire to inform he of the reason of we come into he country signify that the christian king of portugal have send we thither to enter into a treaty of friendship and peace with he and that if he have any call for we commodity we king would supply he with they every year as soon as we messenger have discharge they commission battimansa send some of he negro to the caravel with whom we enter into friendship and barter several thing for negro slave and some gold but gold be by no means to be have in any thing like the plenty we expect from the account give of this country by the native of senegal who be themselves extremely poor consider that to be a large quantity which we think very trifling the negro value they gold as a very precious thing even at a higher rate than the portuguese yet we get it in barter very reasonably for thing of very small value we continue here eleven day during which the caravel be continually resort to by great number of negro from both side of the river who come to see the novelty and to sell they goods among which there be a few gold ring part of they commodity consist of cotton cloth and cotton yarn some of the piece be all white some striped blue and white and other again with red blue and white stripe all very well work and color they likewise bring civet for sale the skin of civet-cat monky large and small baboon of various sort and these last be very plenty they sell they cheap or for something not exceed ten _ marquet _ in value for each and the ounce of civet for what be not worth more than forty or fifty marquet not that they sell they commodity by weight but i judge the quantity to be about a ounce other negro bring various sort of fruit for sale among which be many small wild date which they seem to think much of but which we people think not good as the taste be different from those of europe : as for I i would not venture to eat any of they lest they might have give I the flux or some other distemper we ship be every day crowd with people of different aspect and language -lrb- 6 -rrb- and the native be continually go up and down the river from one place to another both man and woman in they almadia they have no sail and propel they almadia entirely with oar which they use on both side all the rower stand up one man stand at the stern who row sometimes on one side sometimes on the other to keep the almadium steady in she course they have no pin or row - lock to steady they oar but hold they fast with both hand they oar be a pole like a half lance seven foot and a half long with a round board like a trencher fasten to one end and with these they row with great safety and swiftness in the mouth of they river which be very numerous but they seldom go out to sea or to any distance from they own coast lest they should be take by they neighbor and sell for slave -lrb- 1 -rrb- there be some difficulty respect the date of this second voyage in the former cada mosto sail from portugal in march 1455 in the course of he proceedings the month of November be mention and some subsequent transaction be say to have happen in July which on this arrangement must necessarily have be of the year 1456 if therefore the date of the former voyage be accurate the second ought to have be date in 1457 -- e -lrb- 2 -rrb- this part of the narrative be involve in difficulty and most be erroneous a storm from the s w off cape branco almost in lat 21  n and a n w course could not possibly lead to the discovery of the cape verd island almost six degree farther south and at least six degree farther west this difficulty may be solve by suppose the storm from the ne and that the ship drive to the sw from off cape branco -- e -lrb- 3 -rrb- this passage allude to the voyage of antonio de noli in 1462 and it may be remark that de faria who mention the discovery of these island by noli take no notice of the actual discovery by cada mosto -- astl -lrb- 4 -rrb- the editor of astley collection consider this as have be st jamese island which be about twenty mile up the gambium : but there be a small island near the northern bank now call charle i which exactly correspond with the distance in the text -- e -lrb- 5 -rrb- accord to we best map or chart of the gambium this river be never less than four mile broad and generally above five till we get near 100 mile up the river to the reach which encircle the devil point where it still be two mile wide it be possible that the original journal of cada mosto may have have league of three marine mile each in which case the residence of battimansa may have be at or near the devil point above 100 mile up the river -- e -lrb- 6 -rrb- though this country will be amply describe in other voyage in we collection it may be proper to remark that both side of the river gambium be inhabit by a mixed population of three nation the feloop foley and mandingo each of whom have they own separate village intersperse this population be divide into many state lordship or little kingdom as joallus barrah kolar badibu barsallus & c on or near the northern bank kumbo fonium kaen jagra yamini & c on the southern -- e section ix _ some account of the manners and custom on the gambium and of the elephant and hippopotamus _ it now remain for I to relate what i observe and be inform of concern this country during my short stay the religion of the negro of gambium consist of various kind of idolatry they place great reliance on sorcery and other diabolical thing yet all believe in god there be many mahometan among they who trade to many country yet be not settle in house because the native be ignorant -lrb- 1 -rrb- they live very much in the same manner with the native of senegal and have the same kind of provision but they cultivate more sort of rice they eat dog flesh which i never hear of be use anywhere else they be clothe in cotton garment and have great abundance of cotton in they country which may be the reason of the gambian not go naked as those of senegal do where cotton be very scarce the woman dress in the same manner and when they be very young take great delight in delineate figure on they neck breast and arm with the point of a hot needle which be never obliterate and which resemble the flower and ornament which be work on silk handkerchief the country be excessively hot and the heat increase as we go to the south besides which we find it much hotter up the river than at sea owe to the immense number of tree with which the country everywhere abound some of these tree be of very great dimension near a spring where we sailor be in use to fill we water cask not far from the bank of the river there grow a exceedingly large tree but its height be by no means proportional to its thickness for though it measure seventeen cubit in girth near the ground its height by estimation be only twenty pace this tree be hollow but the branch be very large avid extend to a great distance form a thick and ample shade but there be many other tree much larger than this by which the richness and fertility of the soil may be easily conceive and the country be intersect by numerous stream there be many elephant in this country but the native be ignorant of the art of tame these animal as be practice in other country one day while we lay at anchor in the middle of the river we observe three elephant come out from the wood and walk by the river side on which we send we boat with some of the people towards they but they immediately return into the wood these be all i ever see alive but sometime afterwards guumi-mensa -lrb- 2 -rrb- one of the negro lord shew I a dead young elephant which he have kill after a chase of two day the negro hunt on foot in the wood use only arrow and assagay or javelin which be all poison when they hunt the elephant they conceal themselves behind tree and even sometimes mount to they top leap from one tree to another in pursuit of the elephant which be a large unweildy animal be often wound in many place before it can turn round or place itself in a posture of defense but in a open field no person dare attack one nor could even the swiftest escape from they pursuit as i have be inform by many of the negro the tooth of this dead elephant which be shewn I by guumi-mensa one of which still remain in the jaw do not exceed three span long which distinctly shew that it be quite young in comparison of those whose tooth be from ten to twelve span in length yet small as it be for a elephant we compute that the weight of its carcass be equal to five or six oxen guumi-mensa make I a present of what part of this elephant i like best and give the remainder to he huntsman to feast on understanding that elephant flesh be eat by the negro i have some both roasted and boil of which i taste that i might be able to say that i have feed upon the flesh of a animal which have never be eat by any of my countryman but i find it hard and of a unpleasant relish i bring one of the leg and a part of the trunk on board we caravel together with some of the hair from its body which be a span and a half long of a black color and very thick on my return to portugal i present this hair to don henry together with a part of the flesh salt up for that express purpose which he receive with much satisfaction as it be the first of the kind that have be bring from the country that be discover under he auspices the foot of the elephant be round like that of a horse but without hoof instead of which it be cover by a very thick hard black skin and defend by five nail on the fore part which be round and of the size of a _ grossone _ -lrb- 3 -rrb- though young the foot of this elephant measure a span and a half in diameter from the same negro lord i receive the foot of a full-grown elephant the sole of which be three span and a inch in diameter which together with a tooth of twelve span long i present to don henry on my return who send it afterwards as a great curiosity to the dutchess of burgundy in the river gambium and in other river on this coast besides the _ calcatricus _ -lrb- 4 -rrb- and other animal there be one call the _ river horse _ or hippopotamus of the same nature almost with the sea cow and which live both on land and in the water this animal be as large in the body as a cow with very short leg and cloven foot have a large head like that of a horse and two huge tooth like the tusk of a wild boar some of which i have see upward of two span long this animal when it get out of the river walk on the land like any other fourfooted beast and so far as i know be never before discover by any christian traveller except perhaps in the nile we see likewise a number of bat or rather owl upward of three span long and many other bird quite different from those of we country both in appearance and taste yet very good to eat -lrb- 1 -rrb- the meaning of this expression be obscure perhaps it imply that they mahometan teacher have no mosque because the negro be ignorant of the means and method of construction the knowledge of god among the northern negro be assuredly due exclusively to the mahometan missionary -- e -lrb- 2 -rrb- call gnumi-mensa in grynaeus accord to jobson mensa or mansa signify a king in the mandingo language -- astl -lrb- 3 -rrb- a venetian silver coin not exceed a silver penny -- astl -lrb- 4 -rrb- this animal be nowhere explain perhaps the crocodile or alligator -- e section x _ continuation of the voyage from the gambium to the river kasa-mansa cape roxo the river of st ann and st domingo and the rio grande _ have continue eleven day in the river gambium and many of we people become affect by acute fever we dropt down the river on the evening of the eleventh day depart from the country of batti-mansa -lrb- 1 -rrb- and get out of the river in a few day so stock with commodity as to encourage we to proceed farther and indeed have be so far successful and have a plentiful supply of provision and every thing necessary for prosecute the voyage we consider as incumbent on we to attempt some farther discovery towards the south we accordingly steer southwards with a favourable wind but find the land to run a considerable way to the ssw from the mouth of the gambium to a certain point which we take for a cape -lrb- 2 -rrb- we stand out to the west to gain the open sea the whole coast to the south of the gambium be low and cover with tree to the water edge on gain a offing we find that the beforementioned point be no actual cape or promontory as the shore appear perfectly straight on the other side yet we keep at some distance out to sea as we observe breaker for several mile out to sea -lrb- 3 -rrb- on this account we have to proceed with great caution keep always two man at the head of the ship and one in the main-top to look out for shoal and breaker and as a farther precaution we sail only during the day and come to anchor every night in this cautious progress we caravel sail always one before the other have fix the order of sailing by lot and change the leader every day in order to avoid all dispute at the end of two day sail in this manner always in sight of land we discover on the third day the mouth of a river about half a mile wide -lrb- 4 -rrb- and towards evening we observe a little gulf or inlet which we suppose might be the entrance of another river but as it grow late we come to anchor for the night next morning we sail into this gulf and find that it be the mouth of a large river not a great deal less in my opinion than the gambium and both its bank be full of very beautiful tall tree we cast anchor within the mouth of this river and agree to send two armed boat on shore with we interpreter to get intelligence respect the country accord to we usual practice this be do accordingly and we interpreter bring back word that the river be call kasamansa from a negro lord of that name who reside at a place about thirty mile up the river but who be absent from he residence on a warlike expedition against the lord of a neighbouring territory on receive this intelligence we sail from this river next day without attempt any traffic with the native this river of kasamansa be twenty-five league or 100 mile to the south of the gambium -lrb- 5 -rrb- standing on about twenty-five mile farther we come to a cape which be a little more elevated than the rest of the coast and as its front have a red color we name it cape _ roxo _ or _ rosso _ proceed forwards we come to the mouth of a pretty large river about a crossbow-shot wide which we do not enter but to which we give the name of the river of st ann farther on still we come to the mouth of another river not less than the former which we name st dominic or st domingo -lrb- 7 -rrb- distant from cape rosso by we estimation between fifty-five and sixty mile in another day sailing we come to a very large river which at first appear to be a gulf and be judge to be about twenty mile in breadth but we could observe the beautiful tree on the south side and it take we a considerable time to sail across to that side on get over to that side we observe several island in the sea and as we wish to procure some intelligence concern the country we come to a anchor next morning two almadia come off to we from the land one of which be as long as a caravel and carry about thirty hand the other be smaller and be man by sixteen negro they come towards we with great eagerness and not know what might be they design we take to we arm and wait they approach as they draw near they fix a white cloth to the end of a oar which they hold up as a signal of peace and we answer they in a similar manner the negro then come alongside of we ship the largest of the almadias come up to the caravel in which i be they gaze at every thing they see examine the form of the ship the mast yard sail and rig with much attention and they seem astonish at see the white color of we people we interpreter speak to they in order to learn the name of the country but could not understand a word of they language which be a great mortification to we as we be oblige to leave the place without get any intelligence but we purchase a few gold ring from one of the negro agree about the price by sign find ourselves in a country where we interpreter be of no use and consider therefore that it would be to no purpose for we to proceed any farther we determine to return we stay two day in the mouth of this large river which we therefore name rio grande -lrb- 8 -rrb- and where we find the north pole very low -lrb- 9 -rrb- in this place we find great irregularity in the tide for whereas at venice and all other place in europe the flux and reflux be each of six hour continuance the tide here only flow four hour and ebb eight and the violence of the flow tide be quite incredible insomuch that we have great difficulty to stem it with three anchor a-head nay such be its impetuosity that we be sometimes oblige to hoist we sail and even then it exceed the force of the wind take we departure from the mouth of this vast river on we way back to portugal we direct we course to two large island and some small one which lay about thirty mile distance from the continent which we find quite low yet full of large and beautiful green tree and inhabit by negro -lrb- 10 -rrb- encounter here the same difficulty of intercourse for want of know they language we make no stop but take we departure for portugal where we arrive in safety -lrb- 1 -rrb- at this place grynaeus call he batrinense though he have name he rightly bati-mansa before -- astl -lrb- 2 -rrb- this be now call cape st mary -- e -lrb- 3 -rrb- this seem to allude to what be now call bald cape about twenty mile south from cape st mary and stretch somewhat farther west from which there extend breaker or sunken rock a considerable distance from the land -- e -lrb- 4 -rrb- between the mouth of the gambium and that of the casamansa there be three inlet which appear to be smaller mouth of the latter river the most northern of these be name st peter the most southerly oyster river the intermediate one have no name -- e -lrb- 5 -rrb- the actual distance be barely a degree of latitude or less than seventy english mile cada mosto probably estimate by the log the more circuitous track by sea -- e -lrb- 6 -rrb- cada mosto do not mention the remarkable change which take place here in the direction of the coast from the gambium to cape rosso the coast run direct south after which its direction be ese to the mouth of the river st ann -- e -lrb- 7 -rrb- call in modern chart rio s dominica -- e -lrb- 8 -rrb- accord to de faria rio grande be discover by nunez tristan in 1447 nine year before it be visit by cada mosto -- astl -lrb- 9 -rrb- cada mosto be exceedingly superficial in he account of the rio grande and it even seem dubious if he ever see or enter this river as he appear to have mistake the navigable channel between the main and the shoal of the rio grande for the river itself which channel extend above 150 english mile from the island of bulam in the ese to the open sea in the wnw this channel agree with he description in be twenty mile wide whereas the real rio grande be greatly smaller than the gambium -- e -lrb- 10 -rrb- these may be the island of waring and the marsh island at the north-western entry of the channel of the rio grande form part of the bissago island -- e section xi _ the voyage of piedro de cintra to sierra leona and the windward coast of guinea write by alvise da cada mosto _ the two voyage to the coast of africa in which cada mosto be engage and which have be narrate in the foregoing section of this chapter be follow by other and after the death of don henry two armed caravel be send out upon discovery by order from the king of portugal under the command of piedro de cintra one of the gentleman of he household with injunction to proceed farther along the coast of the negro than have hitherto be effect and to prosecute new discovery in this expedition piedro de cintra be accompany by a young portuguese who have formerly be clerk to cada mosto in he two voyage and who on the return of the expedition to lago come to the house of he former employer who then continue to reside at lago and give he a account of the discovery which have be make in this new voyage and the name of all the place which have be touch at by piedro de cintra begin from the rio grande the extreme point of the former voyage -lrb- 1 -rrb- de cintra first go to the two large inhabit island at the mouth of the rio grande which i have discover in my second voyage where he land and order he interpreter to make the usual inquiry at the inhabitant but they could not make themselves understand nor could they understand the language of the native go therefore into the interior they find the habitation of the negro to consist of poor thatched cabin in some of which they find wooden idol which be worship by the negro be unable to procure any information in this place cintra proceed in he voyage along the coast and come to the mouth of a large river between three and four mile wide which he call besegue from a lord of that name who dwell near its mouth and which he reckon to be about forty mile from the mouth of the rio grande -lrb- 2 -rrb- proceed about 140 mile from the river besegue along a very hilly coast clothe with high tree and have a very beautiful appearance they come to a cape to which they give the name of verga -lrb- 3 -rrb- continue along the coast they fall in with another cape which in the opinion of all the seaman be the highest they have ever see have a sharp conical height in the middle like a diamond yet entirely cover with beautiful green tree after the name of the fortress of sagre which be build by the deceased don henry on cape st vincent the portuguese name this point cape sagre of guinea accord to the account of the sailor the inhabitant of this coast be idolater worship wooden image in the shape of man before which they make offering of victuals as often as they eat or drink these people be more of a tawny color than black have mark on they face and body make with hot iron they go almost entirely naked except that they wear piece of the bark of tree before they they have no arm as there be no iron in they country they live on rice millet bean and kidney bean larger than ours and have also beef and goat flesh but not in any great abundance near to cape sagre there be several very small uninhabited island the inhabitant of this river have large almadia carry from thirty to forty man who row standing without have they oar fix to any thing as formerly notice they have they ear pierce with many hole in which they wear a variety of gold ring both man and woman have also a hole through the cartilage of the nose in which they wear a gold ring just like that of iron in the nose of we buffalo which they take out when eat the lady belong to the king and great man by way of extraordinary grandeur have gold ring on other part of they body which decorum prevent we from particularize pass cape sagre they sail about forty mile farther along the coast and come to the rio de san vincent which be about four mile wide and about five mile farther they find another which they call rio verde larger at the mouth than the former -lrb- 5 -rrb- both of these river be so name by the sailor in the caravel about twenty-four mile beyond the rio verde they come to another cape which they call _ cape liedo _ signify the _ cheerful _ because of the beautifully verdant country in its neighborhood -lrb- 6 -rrb- from cape liedo there extend a large mountain for about fifty mile along the coast all of which be very high and cover with tall verdant tree at the end of this mountain and about eight mile from the shore there be three small island the largest of which do not exceed ten or twelve mile in circumference to these the sailor give the name of _ saluezze _ -lrb- 7 -rrb- and they name the mountain _ sierra leona _ or the lion mountain on account of the continual roaring of thunder on its summit which be always envelop in cloud proceed beyond sierra leona the coast be quite low and the shore full of sand bank run out into the sea about thirty mile from the southern extremity of the mountain they find a river near three mile wide at the entrance and because the water have a red color they call it rio roxo -lrb- 8 -rrb- and farther on they find a cape likewise of a red color which they name cape roxo -lrb- 9 -rrb- and they give the same name of roxo to a small uninhabited island about ten mile off at sea where the north polar star seem only the height of a man above the horizon beyond cape roxo the sea form a gulf about the middle of which there enter a river which the seaman call st mary del nievos or of the snow as have be discover on the day of that saint on the other side of the river there be a cape with a island close beside it -lrb- 10 -rrb- this gulf be full of sand bank run ten or twelve mile along the coast on which the sea break with considerable violence and have a strong current both in the ebb and flow of the tide and the little island just mention be name _ scaunus _ on account of these sand bank twenty-four mile distant from this river be a large cape call st ann have be discover on the day of that saint and the whole coast between be low with very shallow water twenty-four mile beyond this cape be the river of _ palm _ so name from the abundance of these tree which be see there the mouth of this river though of sufficient width be so full of shoal and sand bank as to render its entrance very dangerous about seventy mile farther on there be another small river call _ rio de fumi _ or smoke river so name because at the time of its discovery they see nothing but smoke along this coast make by the negro -lrb- 11 -rrb- beyond this river about twenty-four mile there be a cape which run a great way out into the sea on which stand a high mountain on which account it be call _ cabo del monte _ or cape mount about sixty mile still farther on to the s e there be another and smaller cape on which be a small mountain or hill which be name cape _ cortese _ or _ misurado _ the first night after they arrival at this place the voyager see many fire among the tree make by the negro on see the ship as they have never see such object before about sixteen mile beyond cape misurado there be a large forest of tree close to the shore to which they give the name of st mary 's grove the caravel come to anchor beyond this wood and several almadia come off from the shore towards they there be two or three naked negro in each have sharp pointed stick in they hand which we seaman suppose to be dart some of they have small knife and they have only two target and three bow among they all these negro have they ear and nose pierce from which hang some strange ornament resemble human tooth the interpreter speak to they but could not understand they language three of these negro venture on board one of the caravel one of whom be detain by the portuguese and the other two allow to go away for cintra have be order by the king in case of discover any country where the interpreter do not understand the language that he be to bring away one of the native either by force or fair means that he might be able to give a account of he country either by some of the negro in portugal happen to understand he language or after he have acquire the portuguese piedro de cintra have determine to proceed no farther return back to portugal from cape misarado to which he have trace the coast of africa from the rio grande upon he return this negro who have be detain off cape misurado be examine by several negro and at length be understand by a negress who belong to a inhabitant of lisbon not indeed by he own proper language but by means of another which be know to they both whatever intelligence may have be procure on this occasion be not make public except that there be unicorn in he country after this negro have be keep for some month in lisbon and have be shewn many of the curiosity of portugal the king order he to be supply with clothes and send he back in a caravel to he own country but from that coast no other ship have arrive before my departure which be on the first of February 1463 -lrb- 12 -rrb- -lrb- 1 -rrb- for this exordium or introduction we be indebted to the editor of astley 's collection of voyage and travels say to have be a mr john green the infant don henry of portugal die in 1463 so that there must have be a interval of six or seven year between the second voyage of cada mosto and this of piedro de cintra : though de faria seem to put this voyage as have be execute before the death of that excellent prince yet cada mosto who then actually reside at lago could not be mistake be this important particular -- astl -lrb- 2 -rrb- in a note to the second voyage of cada mosto it have be already notice that he seem to have give the name of rio grande to the channel between the bissago island or shoal of the rio grande and the main this river besegue may possibly be the strait or channel which divide the island name particularly bissago or more properly bissao from that of bassis or bussus yet this river besegue may even have be that now call rio grande in which about twenty-four league above its mouth there be a island call bissaghe -- e -lrb- 3 -rrb- it be strange that the rio de nuno close by this cape the estuary of which be not less than seven or eight mile wide should be here omit but the present voyage be very superficially narrate throughout -- e -lrb- 4 -rrb- the text be here obviously defective as no river be mention before but the allusion must be to the river pongo pongue or pougue at the mouth of which cape sagre be situate indeed that cape seem to be form by one of the island off the mouth of the river -- e -lrb- 5 -rrb- there be a number of small river on the coast between cape sagre and cape tagrin such as tofali danium burium berrea tanna pogone cagrance do casa but we modern chart have none name as in the text on this part of the coast -- e -lrb- 6 -rrb- this be now call cape tagrin and form the northern point at the entrance of the sierra leone river otherwise call the mitomba or tagrin river the southern point be name cape sierra leone and in some map be likewise name liedo very improperly it be necessary to distinguish carefully between the _ cape _ of sierra leone and the mountainous ridge of the same name which appear to extend a considerable way along the coast to the s e near fifty mile to the river kate or sa ma della neue but from the baldness of the narrative there be great difficulty in trace out this voyage -- e -lrb- 7 -rrb- these be now call banana island in lat 8  n -- e -lrb- 8 -rrb- perhaps the camaranca -- e -lrb- 9 -rrb- probably that now call tassa point or cabo de s anna -- e -lrb- 10 -rrb- this account seem again to refer to the river camaranca and tassa point otherwise call cape st ann yet this cape be bring in immediately afterwards indeed this voyage be inextricably confuse probably incorrect or corrupt -- e -lrb- 11 -rrb- the large island of sherbro with sherbro strand and shoal a very prominent feature of this part of the african coast be here entirely overlook unless we suppose de cintra to have go on the outside of that island consider the sound as a river and name the n w point of sherbro island cape st ann -- e -lrb- 12 -rrb- we have already see that don henry die in this year which must therefore be here a error of the press either in the original publication by cada mosto or in some of the after edition -- e chapter v continuation of the portuguese discovery along the coast of africa from the death of don henry in 1463 to the discovery of the cape of good hope in 1486 -lrb- 1 -rrb- section i _ progress of discovery from cape verga to cape st catherine from the death of don henry to that of king alphonzo v _ after the decease of don henry the illustrious father of maritime discovery the progress of the portuguese along the coast of africa receive a considerable check as the military ardor of alphonzo the fifth be principally direct to the support of he pretension to the throne of castile the circumstance of which be unconnected with the plan of this work king alphonzo be not however entirely inattentive to the trade for gold and slave which he illustrious uncle don henry have commence with that part of africa which be now call guinea the origin of this name of guinea or _ ghinney _ be unknown it be not in use among the native and seem to have be impose by the portuguese from the appellation of _ ghenchoa _ give to a country on the south side of the senegal we first mention by leo and afterwards by marmol ever since the year 1453 as already mention considerable importation of gold have be make to portugal from the coast of africa but little or no progress have be make in extend the discovery farther south for some time previous to the decease of don henry in 1470 king alphonzo sail with a considerable army in a fleet of above 300 ship and carry the strong fort of _ arzilum _ on the atlantic coast of africa a little way to the south of the strait of gibraltar but of he military exploit in africa from which he acquire the appellation of _ africanus _ and assume the additional title of _ lord of the coast on both sea _ we present purpose do not call for any recital in 1479 the dispute between the crown of portugal and castile be compromise by a treaty enter into by alphonzo v king of portugal and ferdinand king of castile by which the trade of guinea and the navigation of its coast with the propose conquest of _ fez _ be guarantee to portugal and the canary island be annex to the crown of castile from the want of any accurate history of the progress of the portuguese discovery it be utterly impossible to determine the date or circumstance of many of the progressive discovery along the western coast of africa and of its island in 1469 alphonzo farm the guinea trade for five year to fernando gomez for the yearly rent of 500 ducat or about 138 pound take he bind at the same time to extend the discovery for 500 league to the southward during the period of he exclusive privilege in 1471 accord to marmol juan de santareu and pedro de escobar discover the _ oro de la mina _ or the _ gold coast _ and advance still farther under the guidance of two experienced pilot martin fernandez and alvaro esteve they discover _ cabo catalina _ or cape st catherine in lat 1  40 ' s this promontory which be thirty-one league to the south of cabo de lope gonzale derive its name from the day of the saint on which it be first see and form the northern boundary of the great kingdom of congo the discovery of this cape be assign by some writer

don henry to they developement of china and japan and have even leave a account of all the ship that sail from lisbon for africa and asia down to the year 1600 but be unable to ascertain the date of many important event neither he nor de barros have be able to remove the uncertainty respect the first discovery of the island of st thoma on the coast of africa the south end of which touch the equinoctial during the remainder of the reign of alphonzo the line of coast from cape verga in lat 10  n to cape st catherine in 1  40 ' s be much frequent by the portuguese of this coast a ample account have be give by dapper and barbot chiefly follow a tract publish by gotard artus of dantzick which be to be find in de bry 's collection and that of david von nyendael and other this be the work of a dutch navigator which be first translate in to german and thence by artus into latin but we peculiar department be confine to actual voyage and travels and the progress of discovery and it would both much exceed we proper limit and would be a entire deviation from we plan of arrangement to admit lengthen geographical and topographical disquisition which so far as they be at all admissible must be reserve for the more particular voyage and travels after those of general discovery have be discuss there be four principal island in the gulf of guinea or bight of biafra as it be usually call by english navigator ferdinand poo prince isle st thoma and annobon the discovery of which have be relate as follow by barbot and he account seem the most probable -lrb- 2 -rrb- fernando

for bread the inhabitant also have sheep hog goat and a immense number of poultry but these have probably be introduce by the portuguese the _ ilha de san thome _ or island of st thoma which be say to have receive its name from the saint to whom the chapel of the great monastery of _ thomar _ be dedicate and to which all the african discovery be subject in spiritual have its southern extremity almost directly under the equinoctial and be a very high land of a oval shape about fifteen league in breadth by twelve league long the most southerly of these island in lat 1  30 ' s now call annobon be originally name ilha d'anno bueno or island of the happy year have be discover by pedro d'escovar on the first day of the year 1472 at a distance this island have the appearance of a single high mountain and be almost always topt with mist it extend about five league from north to south or rather from n n w to s s e and be about four league broad be environ by several rock and shoal it have several fertile vally which produce maize rice millet potato yam banana pine-apple citron orange lemon fig and tamarind and a sort of small nut call by the french _ noix de medicine _ or physic nut -lrb- 3 -rrb- it also furnish oxen hog and sheep with abundance of fish and poultry and its cotton be account excellent include the voyage of cada mosto and pedro de cintra which have be already detail as possibly within the period which elapse between the death of don henry in 1463 and king alphonzo which latter event take place on the 28th August 1481 and the detach fragment of discovery related in the present section we have be only able to trace a faint outline of the uncertain progress of portuguese discovery during that period of eighteen year extend as already mention to cape st catherine and the island of annobon a considerable advance therefore have be make since the lament death of the illustrious don henry which comprehend the whole coast of guinea with its two gulf usually name the _ bight _ of benin and biafra with the adjacent island and extend to the northern frontier of the kingdom of congo -lrb- 4 -rrb- if the follow assertion of de barros could be rely on we might conclude that some nameless portuguese navigator have cross the line even before the death of don henry but the high probability be that the naval pupil of that illustrious prince continue to use he impress upon they discovery long after he decease and that the limit of discovery in he time be confine to cape vergas some castilian sailing under the command of garcia de loaysa a knight of malta land in 1525 on the island of st matthew in two degree of southern latitude -lrb- 5 -rrb- they here observe that it have be formerly visit by the portuguese as they find a inscription on the bark of a tree imply that they have be there eighty-seven year before -lrb- 6 -rrb- it also bear the usual motto of that prince _ talent de bien faire _ in the paucity of authentic information respect these discovery it seem proper to insert the follow abstract of the journal of a portuguese pilot to the island of st thoma as insert by ramusio previous to the voyage of vasco de gama but of uncertain date although in the opinion of the ingenious author of the progress of maritime discover this voyage seem to have be perform between the year 1520 and 1540 in this state of uncertainty it be therefore make a section by itself detach in some measure from the regular series of the portuguese discovery -lrb- 1 -rrb- astley i 15 clarke i 290 purcha i harris i 664 -lrb- 2 -rrb- clarke i 295

extensive kingdom of congo be at the sette river ten league ss e from cape st catherine -- e -lrb- 5 -rrb- there be no island of that name in this position so that the island of st matthew of de barros must refer to annobon -- e -lrb- 6 -rrb- these date would throw back the discovery of this island and the passage of the line by the mariner of don henry to the year 1438 at a time when they have not reach the latitude of 25  n which be quite absurd -- e section ii voyage of a portuguese pilot from lisbon to the island of st thoma -lrb- 1 -rrb- before i leave venice i be request by letter from signior hieronimo fracastro of verona that on my arrival at conde i would send he a account of my voyage to san thome to which island we ship often sail for cargo of sugar the passage of the equinoctial line under which that island be situate appear to that gentleman so extraordinary a circumstance as to merit the attention of man of science and you likewise make I a similar request i begin therefore immediately after my return to draw up a account of my voyage from those note which we pilot usual keep of all occurrence and i compare it in my progress with the journal of some friend who have formerly make the same voyage when i afterwards attentively peruse my manuscript it do not appear to I worthy of be communicate to a gentleman of such scientific character as signor hieronimo whose talent i have duly appreciate by the perusal of he publication which i receive from you before my departure from venice i therefore lay my manuscript aside not wish that any one might peruse it but as you have again urge the performance of my promise i now anxiously obey a request which as come from you i must always consider a command apprehensive likewise of appear forgetful of you polite attention i prefer the danger of expose my ignorance to the possibility of be charge with ingratitude or want of attention be a sailor and unused to composition i pretend to little more than copy the remark of those who have sail from we continent to _ ethiopium _ without attempt to reduce my narrative into lucid order or to embellish it with fine write you will therefore have the goodness to destroy this account after its perusal that the error i have commit by compliance with you command may not draw upon I the imputation of presumption the portuguese ship which sail to the island of st thoma from lisbon for cargo of sugar usually put to sea in February though some vessel make this voyage at every period of the year they course be ssw until they reach the canary island after which they steer for the island of palma which be opposite to cape bojador on the coast of africa and be about ninety league from the kingdom of castile this island have plenty of provision and abound in wine and sugar the north - west wind prevail most and a great sea rage continually on its coast particularly in the month of December -lrb- 2 -rrb- if the ship which be bind for the island of st thoma find it necessary to obtain a quantity of salt after have take on board a sufficient supply at the island of _ sal _ they steer for the coast of africa at the rio del oro and if they have calm weather and a smooth sea they catch as many fish in four hour with hook and line as may suffice for all they want during the remainder of the voyage but if the weather be unfavourable for fishing at the rio del oro they proceed along the coast to cape branco and thence along the coast to the island of arguin the principal sort of fish on this coast be _ pagro _ call _ albanus _ by the venetian likewise _ corvus _ and _ onero _ which latter be only a larger and darker-coloured species of _ pagro _ as soon as take the fish be open and salt and serve as a excellent supply of provision to navigator all the coast of africa from cape bojador otherwise call _ cabo della volta _ as far as cape branco and even to arguin be low and sandy at arguin which be inhabit by moor and negro and which be situate on the confines between these two nation there be a capacious harbor and a castle belong to we king of portugal in which some portuguese always reside with the royal agent on leave the island of sal we ship steer next for st jago another of the cape verd island this island be situate in _ fifteen degree on the equinoctial and thirty league towards the south _ -lrb- 3 -rrb- it be seventeen league long and have a city on the coast with a good harbor call _ ribiera grande _ or the great river now st jago from two high mountain one on each side a large river of fresh water flow into the harbor and from its source full two league above the city its bank be line on each side with garden have fine grove of orange cedar pomegranate several sort of fig and the cocoa-nut palm which have be long plant on this island it produce all kind of vegetable in great abundance and perfection but they do not afford good seed so that it be necessary to procure these every year from europe the city be on the south coast of the island and be well build of stone be inhabit by about 500 family of distinction portuguese and castilian its government be entrust to a corregidor or governor appoint by the king of portugal and two judge be choose annually one for the determination of naval and maritime cause and the other for regulate the police this island be very mountainous and be very barren in many part which be entirely destitute of wood but its vally be fertile and well cultivate in June when the sun enter cancer the rain be so incessant that the portuguese call that month _ la luna de las aquas _ or the water month they seed-time begin in August when they sow maize call _ miglio zaburo _ this be a white bean which be ready to be gather in forty day and be the chief food of these islander and of all the inhabitant of the coast of africa -lrb- 4 -rrb- they also sow much rice and cotton the latter of which come to great perfection and be manufacture into striped cloth which be export to the country of the negro and barter for black slave to give a distinct view of the commercial transaction with the negro it be proper to inform you that the western coast of africa be divide into several country and province as guinea _ melegote _ -lrb- 5 -rrb- the kingdom of benin and the kingdom of manicongo over all this extent of coast there be many negro king or chief whose subject be mahometan and idolater and who be continually at war with each other these king be much respect by they subject almost to adoration as they be believe to have originally descend from heaven when the king of benin die he subject assemble in a extensive plain in the center of which a vast pit or sepulchre be dig into which the body be lower and all the friend and servant of the decease be sacrifice and throw into the same grave thus voluntarily throw away they own life in honor of the dead on this coast there grow a species of _ melegete _ extremely pungent like pepper and resemble the italian grain call _ sorgo _ it produce likewise a species of pepper of great strength not inferior to any of that which the portuguese bring from calicut under the name of _ pimienta del rabo _ or _ pepe dalla coda _ and which african pepper resemble _ cubbeb _ but so powerful that a ounce will go farther than a pound of the common sort but its exportation be prohibit lest it should injure the sale of that which be bring from calicut -lrb- 6 -rrb- there be also establish on this coast a manufacture of a excellent kind of soap from palm-oil and ash which be carry on for the king 's account all the trade of this coast to the kingdom of _ manicongo _ exclusively be farm out every four or five year to the highest bidder great negro caravan bring gold and slave to the station on the coast the slave be either prisoner take in war or child whom they parent have part with in the hope of they be carry to a more fertile country for above ninety year after the first discovery of this coast the portuguese merchant be accustom to enter the large river by which the country be everywhere intersect trading independently with the numerous tribe inhabit they bank but now the whole of this commerce be in the hand of stationary licensed factor to whom it be farm on quit st jago we steer southerly for the rio grande which be on the north of ethiopium beyond which we come to the high mountain of sierra liona the summit of which be continually envelop in mist out of which thunder and lightning almost perpetually flash and be hear at sea from the distance of forty or fifty mile though the sun be quite vertical in pass over this mountain and extremely hot yet the thick fog be never dissipate in we voyage we never lose sight of land yet keep always at a considerable distance carefully observe the declination of the sun and keep a southerly course till we arrive in _ four degree on the equinoctial _ -lrb- 7 -rrb- when we suddenly change we course to the south-east keep the ethiopian coast always on we left hand in we way to the island of st thoma on this coast between the tropic and the equinoctial we never meet with any hard gale as storm be very rarely find within the tropics on near the land the sounding in many part of the coast do not exceed fifty _ braccium _ but farther out the depth rapidly increase and the sea usually run high at a distance from the land when we arrive at rio del oro as mention before we observe four star in the form of a cross of a extraordinary size and splendor elevated thirty degree above the antarctic pole and form the constellation call _ il crusero _ while under the tropic of cancer we see this constellation very low and on direct we _ balestra _ -lrb- 8 -rrb- to the lowermost of these star we find it to be directly south and conclude that it must be in the center of the antarctic polar circle we observe the same constellation very high when we be at the island of st thoma and remark that the moon after rain produce a rainbow similar to that occasion by the sun during the day except that the color be dim and ill-defined on leave the strait of gibraltar i do not observe any sensible change on the ebb and flow of the sea but when we approach rio grande which be eleven degree to the north of the equinoctial we observe a considerable tide at the mouth of that river and the rise in some place be much the same as on the coast of portugal whereas at the isle of st thoma it be nearly the same as at venice the island of st thoma be discover above eighty -lrb- 9 -rrb- year ago by some captain in the royal navy of portugal and be altogether unknown to the ancient its horizon or parallel pass at a equal distance between the arctic and antarctic pole and its day and night be always equal the arctic polar star be there invisible but the _ guardianus _ be see in some measure to revolve and the constellation which be know by the name of _ il crusero _ be see in the heaven at a high altitude to the eastward -lrb- 10 -rrb- of st thoma and at the distance of 120 mile the small island call _ il principe _ be situate this latter island be inhabit and cultivate the produce of its sugar cane belong to the revenue of the king eldest son from which circumstance the island derive its name to the s s w or s and by w and in the latitude of almost 2  s be the uninhabited island of annobon on which number of crocodile and venomous serpent be find its rocky shore abound in fish and be much resort to by the inhabitant of st thoma on that account when first discover the island of st thoma be a entire forest contain a variety of tree which though barren be extremely verdant these tree be all remarkably tall and straight they branch all draw close to the stem and not spread out as with we after clear away a great part of the forest the inhabitant build a principal town call _ pouoasan _ which have a excellent harbor the principal dependence of the settler in this island be upon they sugar which they exchange yearly with the merchant who trade thither for flour in barrel wine oil cheese leather sword glass bead drinking-cup pater-noster and _ buzio _ which be a small kind of shell call by the italian _ white porcelain _ and which pass in ethiopium as money the european who reside on this island depend much for provision on the ship as they can not subsist on the fare use by the negro the slave employ in they sugar plantation be procure from guinea benin and congo and some rich planter have from 150 to 300 negro these work five day in every week for they master and be allow the saturday to themselves when they cultivate various article of provision as the _ miglio zaburo _ a species of bean formerly mention a root call _ igname _ and many species of culinary vegetable the seed of which must be import from europe as they do not come to perfection in this climate -lrb- illustration : chart of north western africa -rrb- the soil of st thoma consist of a red and yellow marl or clay of great fertility which be keep soft and mellow by the heavy dew which fall nightly contribute greatly to vegetation and prevent it from be dry up by the great heat and so great be the luxuriant fertility of the soil that tree immediately spring up on any spot leave uncultivated and will grow as high in a few day as would require as many month with we these sprout be cut down and burn by the slave and they ash be use as manure for the sugarcane if plant in January the cane be ready to be cut in June and those which be plant in February become ripe in July and in this manner they keep up a succession throughout the whole year in march and September when the sun be vertical the great rain set in accompany with cloudy and thick weather which be of great service to the sugar plantation this island produce yearly above 150000 aroba of sugar each contain thirty-one of we pound of which the king receive the tenth part which usually produce from 12000 to 14000 aroba though many of the planter do not pay this tythe fully there be about sixty _ ingenio _ drive by water for bruise the cane and press out the juice which be boil in vast chaldron after which it be pour into pan in the shape of sugar-loaves holding from fifteen to twenty pound each in which it be purify by means of ash in some part of the island where they have not stream of water the cane be crush by machine work by the negro and in other by horse the bruised cane be give to the hog which hardly get any other food yet fatten wonderfully and they flesh be so delicate and wholesome as to be prefer to that of poultry many sugar refiner have be bring here from madeira on purpose to endeavor to manufacture the sugar of st thoma more white and harder than its usual produce but in vain this be allege to proceed from the extreme richness of the soil injure the quality of the sugar just as with we wine produce in soil of too great fertility be apt to have a peculiar flavor another cause of this be suppose to proceed from the climate of the island be too hot and too moist except in the month of June July and August at which season a fresh dry wind blow from ethiopium to this island and they then make they best sugar the planter be oblige to ship off they sugar as soon as they can procure shipping because they would become liquid if attempt to be keep for a length of time at present not above two-third of the island be appropriate to the cultivation of sugar but any person who come to this island for the purpose of settle whether from spain or portugal or any other country may procure from the royal intendant as much land as he be able to cultivate and at a moderate price the esculent root which be know in the spanish island by the name of _ bata _ be here name ingame by the negro and be they principal food either boil or roasted under the ash there be different kind of this root produce on the island but that which be know by the name of _ igname cicorero _ be prefer by the merchant vessel all of which purchase considerable quantity as a sea-stock for they homeward voyage and the negro cultivate they largely for the express purpose of supply the ship -lrb- 11 -rrb- this island be distinguish by a high mountain in the middle thickly cover by tall straight and verdant tree and its summit be continually envelop in cloud whence water be diffuse in numerous stream all over the island a large shallow stream flow through the city of pouoasan supply it with abundance of excellent water which the inhabitant reckon of a medicinal quality and allege that st thoma would not be habitable if it be not for this river and its other numerous spring and rivulet the native tree be chiefly barren and though some olive peach and almond be plant by the early settler which soon grow with great luxuriance they never bear any fruit and this have be the case with all stone fruit that have be try but the cocoa-nut palm bring hither from ethiopium have thrive satisfactorily repeat attempt have be make to cultivate wheat but always unsuccessfully though try at different season of the year as the ear would never fill but always run up to straw and chaff only in march and September the sky be always overcast with cloud and mist and continual rain prevail which season be consider by the inhabitant as they winter in may June July and August which they call _ mesi di vento _ or windy month the prevalent wind be from the south southeast and southwest but the island be sheltered by the continent from the north northeast and northwest wind the summer month be December January and February when the heat be excessive and the atmosphere be continually load with vapor occasion the air to feel like the steam of boiling water the shore of this island abound in many kind of fish and during the month of June and July the inhabitant catch a kind which they name _ le chieppe _ which be singularly delicate in the sea between this island and the coast of africa there be prodigious multitude of whale both of the large and small kind -- should you sir be unsatisfied with my ill-written and confused information i beg of you to consider that i be merely a seaman unpracticed in literary composition -lrb- 1 -rrb- ramusio clarke i 298 this voyage be communicate by the relator to count raimond dellum torre a nobleman of verona -- clarke -lrb- 2 -rrb- a description of the island of cape verd and a account of the supply of salt usually take on board by the portuguese ship at the island of sal for the purpose of lay in a sea store of salt fish be here omit -- clarke -lrb- 3 -rrb- this geographical expression be utterly unintelligible but may be a strange mode of denote its latitude which be 15  n but i know not what to make of the thirty league towards the south unless the author mean that it be thirty league in extent from north to south and seventeen league from east to west -- e -lrb- 4 -rrb- the description in the text be not applicable to maize and must refer to some species of bean or kidney-bean -- e -lrb- 5 -rrb- call likewise maleguette and name also the grain-coast and the pepper-coast manicongo be obviously the kingdom of congo -- e -lrb- 6 -rrb- some of this be smuggle and sell in england -- clarke this guinea pepper be probably that now know under the name of jamaica pepper but the extremely pungent kind must be some of the numerous species of capsicum usually call cayenne pepper -- e -lrb- 7 -rrb- this strange expression seem to imply 4  of north latitude -- e -lrb- 8 -rrb- call likewise balestriglium be the venetian name for the cross - staff or fore-staff a astronomical instrument which have be supersede by the quadrant and sextant -- e -lrb- 9 -rrb- in a after part of this narrative the pilot inform we that he first voyage to the island of san thome be in 1520 and that he make five voyage to that place if therefore the date of he present voyage be fix to 1530 it would carry we back to 1450 or even earlier for the date of this discovery near thirteen year before the death of don henry -- clarke in mr clarke note on this passage he erroneously calculate on the above datum that the discovery might have be in 1460 which be only seventy year back from 1530 but the result of the datum in the text shew that either the pilot be mistake as to the real date of the discovery or that he narrative have be corrupt so that no reliance can be place on he date -- e -lrb- 10 -rrb- the direction of _ il principe _ or prince island from st thoma be n n e and the distance do not exceed seventy mile -- clarke -lrb- 11 -rrb- these _ batata _ be probably a different species from we potato and may be what be call sweet potato in the west indy perhaps the _ igname cicorero _ be the west indian _ yam _ four species of _ igname _ or _ bata _ be mention in barbot as originally from benin anwerre mani-congo and saffrance the first of these be remarkably sweet and the second keep well a variety of esculent root might prove of high utility to navigator and be too much neglect among these the parsnip and jerusalem artichoke deserve notice as be very nutritive and proof against all weather -- clarke section iii _ continuation of portuguese discovery from cape st catherine to the kingdom of congo _ we be still oblige to continue the account of the portuguese discovery historically from the want of any regular journal of they early voyage along the african coast in the original effort of the illustrious don henry although the progress be extremely slow we have much to admire in the character of that prince who possess genius to stretch beyond the trammel of custom and authority boldly think for himself point out the way of extend the knowledge of we globe by maritime discovery and persevere nobly in he renew effort in spite of the timid ignorance of he unexperienced pilot and mariner but it be not easy to explain the continuance of that slow progress which be even retard during the year which elapse between the demise of that prince of mariner in 1463 and that of alphonso in 1481 when the increase experience of the portuguese in they frequent voyage to the new discover atlantic island and african coast ought to have inspire they with fresh vigor and extend view of discovery and commerce the military character of alphonso may however explain this in a great degree as all he energy be direct towards the extension of dominion in the moorish kingdom of fez and the business of discovery be devolve as a burdensome and unprofitable task on the farmer of the trade to the coast of africa which appear to have become extensive and lucrative after the discovery of guinea and its island and the establishment of the sugar colony in these island we learn likewise from the precede voyage of the portuguese pilot to the island of st thoma that the mariner still confine themselves almost entirely to creep along the coast from cape to cape and from island to island not daring to trust themselves to the trackless ocean under the now sure guidance of the heavenly luminary but which they then do not sufficiently understand nor do they possess sufficient instrument for direct they course in the ocean it would appear that they have then no other method of compute the longitude but by means of the log or dead reckoning which be liable to perpetual uncertainty from current and lee-way and which a storm even of short continuance must have throw into total confusion they instrument and method for determine even the latitudes appear to have then be imperfect and little understand in the sequel of this deduction we shall find the first portuguese squadron which sail for indium conduct across the indian ocean by a moorish pilot on the accession of john ii to the throne of portugal in 1481 the discovery along the coast of africa be resume with a new spirit while infante or hereditary prince he principal revenue be derive from the profit of the guinea trade and of the importation of gold from the haven of mina and among the first measure of he reign he turn he attention to the improvement and extension of that valuable branch of commerce for this purpose he give order to make all necessary preparation for build a fortress and church at the port of mina all the requisite material even to stone and tile be accordingly ship from lisbon in a squadron of ten caravel and two transport with 500 soldier and 200 labourer or workman of various kind this expedition be place under the command of don diego d'azumbuja a experienced officer under whom be the follow naval captain gonalez da fonseca ruy d'oliveira juan rodrigue gante juan alfonso diego rodrigue inglez bartholomew diaz pedro d'evora and gomez aire this last be a gentleman belong to the household of pedro king of arragon all the other be nobleman of the household of king john pedro de cintra and fernam d'alfonso command the transport and a small vessel attend the squadron as a advice-boat this squadron sail on the 11th December 1481 and reach they destination on the 19th January 1482 at a african village name _ aldea _ where they find juan bernardo who have previously sail for the coast in quest of gold bernardo be immediately send by azumbuja to inform camarana the negro chief of the district with the arrival of the portuguese armament and to desire a conference with direction to endeavor to impress that chief with a high sense of the rank and character of the portuguese officer and of the irresistible power of the armament now upon he coast early next morning azambuja land with all he follower who be secretly arm in case of meeting with any hostility from the native and move forwards in great form to a large tree not far from the negro village of aldea on a spot which have be choose as a convenient situation for the intended fortress a flag bear the royal arm of portugal be immediately display upon the tree and a altar be place under the shade of its bough at which the whole company unite in assist at the first mass that be celebrate in guinea offer up they solemn prayer to god for the speedy conversion of the idolatrous native and for the perpetual continuance and prosperity of the church which be to be erect on this spot the day on which this impressive ceremony be perform be dedicate to st sebastian that name be give to the valley on which the tree stand under which they be now assemble soon after the completion of this religious ceremony camarana approach with a numerous train azambuja sumptuously dress and ornament by a rich golden collar prepare to receive the negro chief seat on a elevated chair have all he retinue arrange before he so as to form a avenue the negro be arm with spear shield bow and arrow and wear a kind of helmet make of skin thickly stud with fish tooth give they a very martial appearance the subordinate chief be distinguish by chain of gold hanging from they neck and have various golden ornament on they head and even on they beard after the exchange of present and other token of mutual respect and confidence azambuja make a speech to camarana through the mediation of a interpreter in which he explain the purpose of he embassy and expedition and use every argument he could think of to conciliate the friendship of the negro chief to make he fully sensible of the power of the king of portugal and to reconcile he to the intended permanent establishment upon the toast camarana listen to the harangue and the explanation of it by the interpreter in respectful silence keep he eye steadily fix on the countenance of azambuja after which cast he eye for some time on the ground as if profoundly meditate on what he have hear he be say to have make the follow guard and judicious answer : i be fully sensible of the high honor do I on this occasion by you sovereign i have always endeavor to deserve he friendship by deal strictly with he subject and by constantly exert myself to procure immediate lading for they ship hitherto the portuguese who have visit my country be meanly dress and easily satisfy with the commodity we have to give they and so far from desire to remain in the country be always anxious to complete they cargo and to return whence they come this day i observe a wonderful difference a great number of person richly dress be eager for permission to build themselves house and to remain among we but assuredly person of such rank under the guidance of a commander who claim he descent from the god who create the day and the night would never be able to endure the hardship of we climate and could not procure in this country those luxury they have be accustom to in they own those passion which be common to all man will certainly produce dispute between we and it be much better that we should continue on the same footing as hitherto allow you ship to come and go as they have always do before in which case the desire of see each other occasionally and of mutual intercourse in trade will preserve peace between you and we the sea and the land which be always neighbor be continually at variance contend for the mastery the sea always violently endeavor to subdue the land which with equal obstinacy defend itself against the encroachment of the sea the prudential jealousy and distrust display on this occasion by camarana astonished and perplex the portuguese commander and it require the exercise of much address on he part to prevail upon the negro chief to allow the fulfilment of he order and to prevent the necessity of have recourse to violent measure when the workman be make preparation next day to lay the foundation of the intended fortress on the coast they observe a large rock which lay very commodious for serve they as a quarry and accordingly proceed to work it for that purpose this happen unfortunately to be venerate by the negro as one of they god and they immediately fly to arm in opposition against the sacrilegious violation of the sanctify rock and many of the workman be wound before the native could be pacify by numerous present at length after the constant labor of twenty day the fort begin to assume a formidable appearance and receive the name of _ fortaleza de san jorge da mina _ or fort st george at mina in a church construct within its wall a solemn mass be appoint to be celebrate annually in honor of don henry duke of viseo of illustrious memory azambuja continue governor of this place during two year and seven month and be honor on he return to portugal with particular mark of royal favor in 1486 king john bestow on this new establishment all the privilege end immunity of a city impressed with the great advantage that might be derive to he kingdom through the prosecution of the maritime discovery in africa and more especially by open a passage by sea to indium of which he hope be now sanguine the king of portugal who have now add to he title that of _ lord of guinea _ make application to the pope as universal father and lord of christendom for a perpetual grant of all the country which the portuguese have already discover or should hereafter discover towards the east with a strict prohibition against the interference of any european state in that immense field of discovery commerce and colonization the pope concede this enormous grant probably without the most distant idea of its extent and importance : not only prohibit all christian power from intrude within those prodigious yet indefinite bound which he have bestow upon the crown of portugal but declare that all discovery that be or might be make in contravention should belong to portugal hitherto the portuguese navigator in the course of they discovery along the shore of western africa have be in use to erect _ wooden _ cross as indication of they respective discovery but the king now order that they should erect _ stone cross _ about six foot high inscribe with the arm of portugal the name of the reign sovereign that of the navigator and the date of the discovery in the year 1484 diego cam or cano proceed beyond cape st catherine in lat 1  40 ' s the last discovery of the reign of king alphonso and reach the mouth of a considerable river in lat 5  10 ' s call _ zayre _ by the native now call congo river or the rio padron diego proceed some distance up this river till he meet with some of the native but be unable to procure any satisfactory intelligence from they as they be not understand by the negro interpreter on board he ship by means of sign however he understand that the country be under the dominion of a king who reside at a considerable distance from the coast in a town or city call banza since name san salvador by the portuguese on which he send a party of he crew conduct by the native carry a considerable present far the king and mean to wait they return unavoidable circumstance however have protracted the return of he people far beyond the appoint time diego resolve to return into portugal with a account of he discovery and have gain the confidence of the native he prevail on four of they to embark with he that they might

splendid ceremonial be close by the baptism of he sable attendant some time previous to this event alphonso de aviero carry a ambassador from the king of benin to the king of portugal request that some missionary might be send for the conversion of he subject and although the artful conduct of that african prince throw many difficulty in the way of this mission many of the negro of that country be convert from the ambassador of benin the king of portugal receive information of a powerful monarch name _ organe _ whose territory lay at the distance of 250 league beyond the kingdom of benin and

christian of the east to the king of abyssinium but it be very difficult to account for this knowledge of abyssinium in the kingdom of benin not only on account of the distance but likewise because several of the most savage nation in the world the _ gallum _ and _ shangallum _ occupy the intervene space the court of abyssinium do indeed then reside in _ shoa _ the south-east extremity of the

exceed six hundred portuguese league while the king of portugal continue to encourage he navigator to proceed to the southward in discover the african coast he become anxious lest some unexpected rival might interpose to deprive he of the expect fruit of these discovery which have occupy the unremitting attention of he predecessor and himself for so many year learn that john tintam and william fabian englishman be prepare at the instigation of the duke of medina sidonia in 1481 to proceed on a voyage to guinea he send ruy de sousa as he ambassador to edward iv of england to explain the

every exertion to conceal the progress of he own navigator on the western coast of africa and to magnify the danger of the voyage represent that the coast be quite inhospitable surround by most tremendous rock and inhabit by savage cannibal and that no vessel could possibly live in those tempestuous sea in which every quarter of the moon produce a furious storm except those of a peculiar construction which have be invent by the portuguese ship - builder a portuguese pilot who have often make the voyage to guinea have the temerity to assert that any kind of ship could make this redoubted voyage as safely as the royal caravel and be send for to court by the king who give he a public reprimand for he ignorance and presumption some month afterwards the same pilot appear again at court and tell the king that be of a obstinate disposition he have attempt the voyage to guinea in a different kind of vessel from those usually employ and find it to be impossible the king could not repress a smile at this solemn nonsense yet honor the politic pilot with a private audience and give he money to encourage he to propagate the deception about this period likewise hear that three

least one degree back towards the north of he most southern range but he may have suppose himself in a deep bite or bay of the coast similar to the well - know gulf of guinea under this impression

have get a interpreter but no one on board the squadron could understand he language the general command this man to have meat and drink and set he on shore next day well dress that he might return satisfied to he countryman accordingly the day follow this man come down to the shore abreast of the ship with about fifteen more native and the general go ashore carry with he spice gold and pearl to

among the native some small bell tin ring counter and such toy which they receive joyfully and from that time till next Saturday morning great number of the native resort to the fleet whence they go back to they town one fernan veloso crave leave of the general to accompany the native to they habitation that he might see they manner of live on go along with they the native take a sea wolf which they roasted at the foot of a hill for they supper after which they make veloso return to the fleet and it appear to he that the native have arm themselves mean to attack we people on he return veloso see that he be secretly follow wherefore he hasten to the shore and hail the ship on this the general who be then at supper look out towards the land where he see number of the savage follow veloso he therefore give order for all the ship to be in readiness against a attack and go himself on shore with several other unarmed not dread any harm on see we boat come towards the shore the savage begin to run away with much clamor but when we people land they return and set upon they furiously throw they dart and use other weapon which constrain we people to take to they boat in all haste take veloso along with they yet in this scuffle the general and three other be wound the negro return to they town and during four day after while we ship remain in the bay they never see any more of the

when the fleet receive plenty of excellent fresh provision in exchange for clothes hawk bell glass bead and other toy but this friendly intercourse be interrupt through the imprudence of a portuguese

in the hottentot fashion to he great astonishment disgust at they loathsome cookery he rise abruptly and be impatient to depart and be accompany by the native on he way back to the ship with the utmost good humor veloso however become apprehensive of personal danger and horridly vociferated for assistance on he approach to the shore coello boat immediately put off to bring he on board and the native flee to the wood these needless apprehension on both side be increase by mutual ignorance of each other language and lead to hostility while de gama be take the altitude of the sun with a astrolabe some hottentot spring from a ambush and throw they spear head with horn very dexterously among the portuguese by which the general and several other be wound on this occasion the portuguese deem it prudent to retreat to they ship -lrb- 7 -rrb- have take in fresh water and provision in st elena bay the squadron leave that place on the forenoon of Thursday the 16th November with the wind

towards the land as night set in in that manner he continue ply to windward until the follow Wednesday which be the 20th of November -lrb- 8 -rrb- when he double the cape with a fair wind sound the trumpet of all the ship and make every demonstration of joy but place the chief confidence in god that he providence would guide and protect they in accomplish the enterprise in which they be engage in this part of the voyage the greatest proof of courage and resolution be evince by de gama while endeavor to double this formidable and almost unknown cape owe to contrary wind and stormy weather the wave rise mountain high at one time he ship be heave up to the cloud and seem the next moment precipitate into the bottomless abyss of the ocean the wind be piercingly cold and so boisterous that the command of the pilot could seldom be hear amid the din of the war element while the dismal and almost constant darkness increase the danger of they situation sometimes the gale drive they irresistibly to the southward while at other time they have to lay to or to tack to windward difficultly preserve the course they have already make during any gloomy interval of cessation from the tempest the sailor exhaust by fatigue and abandon to despair surround de gama entreat he not to devote himself and they to inevitable destruction as the gale could no longer be weather and they must all be bury in the wave if he persist in the present course the firmness of the general be not to be shake by the pusillanimity and remonstrance of the crew on which a formidable conspiracy be enter into against he of which he receive timely information from he brother paulo with he assistance and that of a few who remain stedfast to they duty the lead conspirator and even all the pilot be put in iron whilst de gama and he small remnant of faithful follower remain day and night at the helm undismay at the danger and difficulty that surround they at length on Wednesday the 20th November all the squadron safely double the tremendous promontory -lrb- 9 -rrb- continue the voyage along the coast beyond the cape they see great number of large and small cattle as they pass all well grow and fat but could perceive no town as the village inhabit by the native be all farther inland the house be of earth cover with straw the native be all somewhat black clothe like those they have see at st elena bay speak the same language and use similar dart together with some other kind of arm both for defense and assault the country be very pleasant be diversify with wood and water and adjoining to the cape on the east side they find a great harbor now call false bay almost six league wide at the mouth and run about as much into the land have thus double the cape the squadron come on the Sunday after be st katherine 's day 25th November to the watering-place of st blaze -lrb- 10 -rrb- which be sixty league beyond the cape and be a very large bay exceed safe in all wind except the north -lrb- 11 -rrb- the native here resemble those already see in dress and arm the country produce many large elephant and numerous ox of vast size and extremely fat some of which have no horn on some of the fattest of these the native be see ride on pannel stuff with rye straw as be use in spain and have a frame of wood like a saddle such of they as they choose to sell they mark by means of a piece of wood like the shaft of one of they arrow put through the nose in this harbor about three cross-bow shot from the shore there be a rock much frequent by sea wolf as large as great bear very wild and fierce with long great tooth these animal be very dangerous and will attack man and they skin be so hard as not to be pierce with spear unless push with much force and valor these animal resemble lion and they young bleat like kid one day that we man go to this rock for amusement they see at least three thousand of these animal old and young on this rock also there be great number of bird as large as duck which do not fly have no feather in they wing and which bray like so many ass -lrb- 12 -rrb- have thus arrive at the bay of st blaze and lie there at anchor the general cause all the provision to be take out of the store-ship and divide among the other and then burn the store-ship as the king have order in this business and other needful employment for they safety in the remainder of the voyage they be occupy in that bay for ten day on the Friday after they arrival about ninety of the native make they appearance some on the shore and other on the hill on which the general and the captain go to the shore have they boat crew well arm and even take ordinance with they to avoid the same accident which have happen at st elena bay when near the shore the general throw some bell on the land which the negro pickt up and some of they come so near as to take the bell out of he hand he much wonder at this familiarity as diaz have inform he when he be in those part the native all run away and would never approach near enough to be see and converse with find they thus gentle contrary to he expectation he go on land with he man and barter red night - cap with the negro for ivory bracelet which they wear on they arm next Saturday the native come to the shore to the number of more than two hundred include they child and bring with they twelve ox and four sheep when we people go on shore some of the native begin to play on four flute in four several tone make good music on which the general cause the trumpet to be sound and the native dance with we people thus the day pass in

of one of the ox some of we people notice some young negro hide among certain bush who have with they the weapon of the older people from which it be conjecture that some treason be intend upon this the general cause we people to remove to a place of greater security and be follow by the negro to the landing place the negro now gather together as if they mean to fight the portuguese on which the general be unwilling to harm they embark in the boat with all he people and then command two piece of brass ordnance to be fire off on which they be much amaze and scamper off in confusion leave they

fifteen league short of the rio del infante -lrb- 14 -rrb- this country be very pleasant and abound in cattle become more sightly and with higher tree the further we fleet sail towards the east as could be easily see from the ship as they sail along near the shore on Saturday they pass close within sight of the rock _ de la cruz _ and be loath to pass the _ rio del infante _ they stand out to sea till vespers when the wind come round to the east right contrary on this the general stand off and on ply to windward till Tuesday the 20th December at sunset when the wind change to the west which be favourable next day at ten o'clock they come to the before-mentioned rock be sixty league a-stern of the place they wish to have attain -lrb- 15 -rrb- this rock be the cause of the great current on this coast which be so powerful that the fleet have much ado with a brisk favourable wind to stem the current between that place and rio infante in three or four day but at length they joyfully pass these current without damage as diaz have do formerly and the general encourage by he good fortune give thanks to god say he verily believe it be the good pleasure of god that they should attain to the discovery of the indy thus continue the voyage till christmas day they have discover seventy league to the eastward and have arrive in the latitude in which indium be say to be in

farther out to sea and the fleet steer through the channel next morning the ship command by coello as be the smallest go first but endeavor to enter a certain harbor between the mainland and one of these island coello miss the channel and run aground on which the other ship put about and go back they soon perceive seven or eight boat under sail come from the island which be a good league distant from coello at which sight they be much rejoice and coello and he people receive they with much demonstration of friendship and satisfaction coello go along with these people to the general and present they say that here be a quite different kind of people from any they have see hitherto then the general command _ to let they go a seaboard with they boat _ -lrb- 26 -rrb- as he propose to go with they to they island to anchor with he ship that he might see what kind of a country it be and if he could learn any certain intelligence concern indium but the boat continue to follow we ship make signal and call to we people to wait for they wherefore the ship come to anchor and the boat come to we fleet the people on board be of good stature and somewhat black clothe in dress of cotton strip with sundry color some girdle to they knee while other carry they apparel on they shoulder like cloak they head be cover with kerchief somewhat work with silk and gold thread and they be arm with sword and dagger like moor in they boat also they have certain musical instrument name _ sagbut _ they come immediately on board with as much confidence as if they be long acquaint and enter into familiar conversation in the language of algarve and would not be know as moor -lrb- 27 -rrb- the general order these people to be well entertain and they eat and drink willingly of whatever be set before they after which by means of fernan alvarez who could speak they language he learn that the island to which they belong be call monsambicke or mozambique on which be a town full of merchant who trade with the moor of indium who bring they silver linen cloth pepper ginger silver ring many pearl and ruby and that from a country behind they procure gold they offer likewise to conduct we people into the harbor where they would learn the truth of these thing more fully on consult with the other captain the general determine upon go into this harbor to examine more accurately into these report and to procure pilot to carry they on they voyage as they have no one in the fleet who know the way nichola coello be therefore order to make the first essay and to take the sounding of the bar he ship be the smallest but in enter he touch on the point of the island where he break he helm and be in great danger of be lose but by good providence he get off with no farther injury he now find the bar be quite safe and get into the harbor where he anchor two cross-bow shot from the town which be in fifteen degree towards the south -lrb- 28 -rrb- the harbor be very good the town be plentifully supply with such provision as the country produce the house be construct of straw and the inhabitant moor who trade to sofala in large vessel that have neither deck nor nail they plank be sew together with _ cayro _ or twine make from the fiber of the cocoa nut rind and they sail of mat make of the leaf of a species of palm some of these vessel use compass of genoa and regulate they voyage by means of quadrant and sea chart with these moor the moor of indium trade as likewise do those from the red sea because of the gold which be to be have here on see we people the moor of mozambique think the portuguese have be turk whom they know of from the moor who dwell on the red sea and those who be first at we ship carry intelligence to the xeque or sheik which be the title of the governor of this island for the king of quiloa in whose territory it be situate though we shall afterwards have occasion to investigate this eastern coast of africa more fully in editing particular voyage to its shore some notice seem here to be proper -lrb- 29 -rrb- owe to he keep at a distance from the shore for security the present voyage give little knowledge of the eastern coast of africa and it be even difficult to assign the many station at which de gama touch between the cape of good hope and mozambique we have already notice the river of good sign as be probably the northern mouth of the delta of the zambeze now call _ quilimane _ from a fort of that name on its bank the mouth of this branch run into the sea in lat 18  25 ' s in he passage from the _ terra de natal _ or christmas land so name from have be discover on christmas day and name in this account of de gamas voyage _ the land of good people _ de gama miss cape coriente form the sw point of the channel of mozambique or _ inner passage _ as it be now call and overshoot sofalum the southern extremity of covilham discovery at which he be probably direct to touch as covilham chart might have be of some use to direct he farther progress to aden and thence to calicut or cananor on the malabar coast the eastern coast of africa be hitherto very little known to geography its trade be entirely confine to the portuguese who have settlement at sofalum the river zambeze mozambique quiloa and melinda and conceal all the circumstance respect they foreign possession with infinite jealousy it be say to have once be in contemplation by the british government to employ sir home popham to make a survey of this coast but this design be never execute commodore blanket remain on this station for a considerable time and much information may be expect from he journal some drawing of the coast have be already make for chart which be prepare under the order of the admiralty about the year 1782 a great mass of geographical information be collect on the continent of europe and lodge in the british museum from which information may probably be derive respect this coast when that collection shall have be arrange and submit to the public accord to d'apre all the eastern coast of africa for a great way south of the equinoctial be line by a range of island whence shoal extend to the distance of a league these islet form a outer shore with a wind channel within and be in some place a league from the coast of the continent though very apt to be mistake for the real coast within this range the boat or almadia of the country ply backwards and forwards in great safety in the intervene channel ptolemy place the _ prasum promontorium _ or green cape the extreme southern boundary of ancient knowledge of the east coast of africa in lat 15 30 ' s and the portuguese universally assume mozambique as prasum by which classical name it be distinguish in the lusiad of camoen in reference to the voyage of de gama and the near coincidence of situation give great probability to this supposition -lrb- greek : prason -rrb- signify a leek and be also use to denote a sea-weed of a similar green color and the name may either have be derive from the verdure of the point or from the sea-weed find in its neighborhood at all event prasum can not be farther south than cape coriente or farther north than quiloa or the zanguebar island the harbor of mozambique have seldom less than eight or ten fathom water which be so clear that every bank rock or shallow can be easily see the moor so often mention be suppose by bruce to have be merchant expel from spain by ferdinand and isabellum who first fix they residence on the western coast of africa and extend themselves eastward form settlement in arabium and egypt till the oppression of selim and soliman the turkish emperor interrupt they commerce and oblige they to disperse along the coast of abyssinium and eastern africa besides the impossibility chronologically for the assign cause have produce the supposed effect there be no necessity for have recourse to this improbable hypothesis from be best acquaint with they moorish conqueror the spaniard and portuguese have always be accustom to name all the arabian moor wherever they find they and even give at first the name of _ black _ moor to the negro whence we old english term _ black-a-moor _ it be well know that the arab especially after they conversion to mahometanism be great colonizer or conqueror even the now half-christian kingdom of abyssinium be a early colony and conquest of the pagan arab and its inhabitant be consequently _ white _ moor in the most extended portuguese sense the arab or moorish kingdom along the african coast of the indian ocean be branch from the same original stem and the early mahometan missionary be both zealous and successful in propagate islaemism among the most distant pagan colony of they countryman as all zealous mussulman be enjoin the pilgrimage of mecca and commerce mix largely with religion in the holy journey by which the faithful from every distant region often meet at mecca and induce each other to extend they commercial adventure to new region it may possibly have be that some moor originally from spain may even have reach mozambique before the time of de gama but it be ridiculous to suppose that all the moor on the african coast have be spaniard the overthrow of the great moorish kingdom of granada only take place five or six year before the present voyage the island of mozambique which do not exceed a league in circumference be describe as low and swampy and be inhabit by moor who have come from quiloa and sofala it be afterwards much resort to by the portuguese as a winter station and become the key of they indian trade the african coast stretch out on both side of the island into two point that on the north-east call pannonus off which a shoal with three islet extend some way into the sea the southern point be call mangale -lrb- 30 -rrb- when the moorish governor of mozambique -lrb- 31 -rrb- be inform of the arrival of the portuguese and that coello be come to anchor in the harbor he fully suppose that they be turk or moor from some distant place and immediately come to visit he apparel in fine silk with many attendant coello receive he very courteously but as neither he nor any in he ship could speak they language the governor soon retire coello give he however a red cap on which he seem to set little value and present he likewise with some black bead which he carry away in he hand both be give and receive in token of friendship on leave the ship he require coello by sign to let he have the boat to carry he on shore which coello readily agree to and send some of he man to the land along with he these the governor carry to he house and feast they on date and other thing and send back with they a pot of preserved date to coello with which he regale the general and he brother when they have enter the harbor on the arrival of the other two ship the governor again send off some of he people to visit they still take they for turk present many pleasant and delicate viand and ask permission to visit they in person the general in return send the governor a present consist of red hat short gown coral brass bason hawk bell and many other thing which he slight as of no value and ask why the general have not send he scarlet which he chiefly desire soon afterwards the governor come off to visit the general who be apprize of he come order all the ship to be dress out in they flag he likewise make all the sick and infirm man to be keep out of sight and bring a good many of the most alert man from the other ship whom he order to be secretly arm in case of any violence or treachery on the part of the moor the governor come on board accompany with many man all well apparel in silk have many ivory trumpet and other musical instrument on which they play almost without cease the governor be a lean man of good stature dress in a linen shirt down to he heel over which he wear a long gown of mecca velvet have a cap of silk of many color trim with gold on he head at he girdle he wear a sword and dagger and have silk shoe the general receive he on enter the ship and lead he to a awning trim up in the best manner they be able the general then beg he not to be offend that no scarlet have be send have bring none with he and that he ship only contain such merchandize as be fit to be barter for victuals for the people and that he only object at present be to discover the way to the indy for which purpose he have be send by a great and mighty king he master all this be convey through the interpretation of fernan martin -lrb- 32 -rrb- the general then order a entertainment of the best meat and wine which the ship afford to be set before the governor and he principal attendant of all which they partake willingly even drink wine with good will the governor ask whether they come from turkey as he have hear say that the turk be a fair people like they and desire to see we country bow and the book of we law to this the general answer that he and he man be not from turkey but from a kingdom in they neighborhood that he would most willingly shew he bow and other weapon but have not the book of we law as they be not need at sea then some cross-bow be bring which be bent and shoot off in presence of the governor also some of we harness or defensive armor with all of which he be much pleased and greatly astonish during this conference the general learn that the port of calicut in indium be 900 league distant from mozambique and as there be many shoal in the course that it be very necessary to have a pilot from this place he learn also that there be many city along the coast he likewise understand that the kingdom of prester john be far from this place in the inland country -lrb- 33 -rrb- consider the expediency of have a pilot the general request to have two from the governor who agree to the demand on condition that they should be well use the reason of wish to have two be lest one might die during the voyage and we people be much pleased with this promise the governor come a second time to visit the general and bring with he both the pilot whom he have promise to each of whom be give thirty crown and a coat each crown be worth five shilling under this condition that whenever one of they should go on shore the other should remain on board that one might always stay by the ship while in harbor notwithstanding these friendly meeting speech and assurance it soon appear after the departure of the governor that the moor have learn during they intercourse with we people that they be christian on which the former friendship and good will of the moor towards they be change to wrath and fury and they henceforwards use every endeavor to kill we man and to take possession of the ship the governor therefore and he people use every effort for this mischievous purpose and have certainly succeed if the almighty have not move the heart of one of the moorish pilot who have be receive into the portuguese fleet to reveal the same to the general who fear lest the infidel might suddenly execute they purpose as be numerous in comparison to he small company determine to remain no longer in the harbor wherefore on Saturday the 10th march 1498 be seven day after he arrival he quit the harbor of mozambique and cast anchor close to a island at the distance of a league from that place intend on Sunday to hear mass on shore that they might confess and receive the sacrament which have not be do since leave lisbon after the ship be come to anchor in this place of safety from be burn by the moor which the general greatly dread he determine to go back to mozambique in he boat to demand the other pilot who have be promise but who still remain on shore leave he brother with the fleet in readiness to come to he aid if needful the general go towards mozambique with he boat accompany by nichola coello and the moorish pilot on they way they see six _ zambuco _ or boat fill with moor come towards they arm with long bow and arrow and also with shield and spear the moor call to we people to come along with they to the town and the moorish pilot who explain they signal advise the general to do so as the governor would not otherwise deliver the other pilot who still remain on shore the general be much displeased at this advice believe the pilot only wish he to approach the shore that he might be able to run away and therefore order he to be secure as a prisoner he likewise give order to fire at the moorish boat from he ordnance when paulo de la gama hear the shot believe the general to be in more danger than he actually be he immediately come with the ship berrio under sail to he aid on see this the moor flee away in such haste that the general could not overtake they and therefore return with he brother to where the other ship be at anchor next day be Sunday the general and all he man go on shore where they hear mass and receive the sacrament very devoutly have confess the evening before after this they re-embark and set sail the same day have no hope of procure the other pilot the general order to release he whom he have confine and carry he on the voyage but he willing to be revenge for the indignity he have experience determine on carry the portuguese fleet to the island of quiloa which be all people with moor and as it seem intend to inform the king of that place that we ship belong to the christian that he might destroy they and kill the crew for this purpose he craftily persuade the general not to be in trouble for want of the other pilot as he would carry he to a great island on hundred league from thence which be inhabit half by moor and half by christian who be always in war with each other and where he might easily find pilot to conduct he to calicut though the general be much pleased with this information he yet do not give implicit credit to the moor but promise he high reward if he carry he in safety to that country and so go forward on the voyage with a scant wind on the Tuesday the fleet be still in sight of the land from which they take they departure and remain becalmed all that day and the next on Wednesday night a gentle breeze spring up from the eastward on which the fleet stand off to seaward but on Thursday morning on again make the land they be four league to leeward of mozambique whence ply to windward they come back that evening to the island where they have hear mass on the Sunday before where they cast anchor and remain eight day wait for a fair wind while here at anchor a white moor who be a _ molah _ or minister among the moor of mozambique come on board the general ship represent that the governor be much grieve at the breach of peace and friendship between they which he would now gladly renew to this the general make answer that he would make no peace with the governor unless he send he the other pilot whom he have hire and pay with this answer the _ molah _ depart and never come back after this while still wait for a fair wind there come another moor on board accompany with he son a boy and ask the general to give he a passage to the city of melinda which he say be on he way to calicut he say that he be a native of the country near mecca whence he have pilot a ship to mozambique and would gladly go with he that he might return to he own country and farther he counsel the general not to remain in expectation of any answer from the _ zeque _ who he be sure would make no peace with he on account of he hatred to the christian the general be rejoice at the come of this moor expect to acquire information from he concern the strait of the red sea and of the town on the coast between mozambique and melinda by which he have to sail and therefore give order to receive this moor and he son on board as the ship be rather short of water the general and the other captain determine upon enter the harbor of mozambique to take in what they need but order strict watch to be keep lest the moor should set the ship on fire they enter therefore again into the harbor on Thursday and when night come they go in they boat in search of water which the moorish pilot assure they be to be find on the firm land and offer to guide they to the place leave paulo de la gama in charge of the ship and take nicholas coello and the pilot along with he in the boat the general go on shore about midnight to the place where the pilot say that water be to be have but it could not be find whether that the pilot mislead they in hope of escape or find he could not escape do so out of malice have spend the whole night fruitlessly in search of water and day begin to dawn the general return to the ship for more force lest the moor might set upon he and he small company at a disadvantage have furnish he boat with a larger force of armed man he return to the shore still accompany by coello and the moorish pilot who see no means of escape now point out the watering-place close by the shore at this place they observe about twenty moor arm with dart who shew as if they mean to prevent they from take water the general therefore give order to fire three gun to force they from the shore that we man might be able to land unopposed amaze and frighten by the noise and the effect of the shot the moor run away and hide themselves in the bush and we people land quietly and take in fresh water return to the ship a little before sunset on arrive the general find he brother much disquieted because a negro belong to john cambraye the pilot of paulo de la gama have run away to the moor though himself a christian -lrb- 34 -rrb- upon Saturday the 24th of march be the eve of the annunciation of we lady a moor appear early in the morning on the shore abreast of the ship call out in a loud and shrill voice that if we man want any more water they might now come for it when they would find such as be ready to force they return irritated at this bravado and remember the injury do he in withhold the promise pilot and the loss of the negro the general resolve to batter the town with he ordnance in revenge and the other captain readily agree to the measure wherefore they arm all they boat and come up before the town where the moor have construct a barricade of board for they defense on the shore so thick that we man could not see the moor behind upon the shore between that defense and the sea a hundred moor be draw up arm with target dart bow arrow and sling who begin to sling stone at the boat as soon as they come within reach they be immediately answer with shot from we ordnance on which they retire from the shore behind they barricade which be soon beat down when they run into the town leave two of they man slay the general and he man now return to the ship to dinner and the moor be see run from that town to another and so much be they afraid of the portuguese that they abandon the island go by water to another place on the opposite side after dinner we people go with they captain on shore to endeavor to take some of the moor with the hope of procure restitution of the negro belong to cambraye who have run away from the ship and they be likewise desirous of recover two indian who be say by the moorish pilot to be detain as captive in mozambique on this occasion paulo de la gama seize four moor who be in a boat but a great many moor in other boat escape by hasten on shore and leave they boat behind in which we man find much cotton cloth and several book of they mahometan law which the general order to be preserve the general and the other captain range in they boat along side of the town but do not venture on shore not have sufficient force nor could they get any speech of the moor next day they go on shore at the watering-place where they take what be need without any opposition from the moor be now hopeless of recover the negro or of procure the indian captive it be determine to depart but the general resolve to be revenge on the town and people for they enmity for which reason he go against it next day with ordnance and destroy it in such sort that the moor have to abandon it and flee into another island within the country -lrb- 35 -rrb- this be do the fleet weigh anchor on Tuesday the 27th of march and depart from mozambique whence they proceed to two little rock which they call st george and where they come to anchor in wait for a wind which be now contrary soon afterwards the wind come fair and they depart but the wind be so light and the current so strong that they be force in a retrograde course the general be much pleased to find that one of the moor take by he brother at mozambique be a pilot and be acquaint with the navigation to calicut proceeding on they voyage they come on Sunday the first of April to certain island very near the coast to the first of which they give the name of _ ilha da aoutado _ because the moorish pilot of mozambique be here severely whipt by order of the general for have falsely say that these island be part of the continent and likewise for not shew the way to the watering-place at mozambique as before related be cruelly whipt the moor confess that he have bring they to this place expressly that they might perish on the rock and shoal of these island which be so numerous and so close together that they could hardly be distinguish from each other on this the general stand out to sea and on Friday the 4th of April -lrb- 36 -rrb- stand to the north - west he come in sight before noon of a great land with two island near the coast around which be many shoal on near the shore the moorish pilot recognize it and say that the christian island of quiloa be three league astern on which the general be much grieve believe certainly that the native of quiloa have be christian as represent by the pilot and that they have purposely take a wrong course that the ship might not come there the pilot to conceal they treachery allege that the wind and current have carry the ship farther than they reckon but in truth they be more disappointed in this than even the general as they have reckon upon be here revenge upon the portuguese by have they all slay in this god preserve we people from the intended danger most miraculously for if they have go to quiloa they have all surely perish as the general be so fully persuade of the native be christian as report by the pilot that he would doubtless have land immediately on he arrival and have thereby run headlong to a place where he and all he people would have be slay both party be thus sorry for have miss quiloa the general because he hope to have find christian and the moorish pilot because of they intended treachery it be determine to put back with the intention of seek for it but still the wind and current oppose they purpose and they try a whole day in vain this doubtless proceed from the providence of god and he merciful goodness to we man who be thus preserve by miracle from the malicious and devilish intention of the two moorish pilot of mozambique the fleet be thus baffle and toss to and fro it be determine to bear away for the island of mombaza in which the pilot say there be two town people both by moor and christian but they give out this as before to deceive we people and to lead they to destruction for that island be solely inhabit by moor as be the whole of that coast understanding that mombaza be seventy mile distant they bear away for that place and towards evening they come in sight of a great island towards the north in which the moorish pilot pretend there be two town one of christian and the other of moor make this false assertion to make we people believe that there be many christian on this coast while pursue they voyage towards mombaza for some day the ship san raphael chance one morning two hour before day to get aground on certain shoal two league from the shore of the continent paulo de gama immediately make signal to apprize the other ship of he situation and they danger on which they have the good fortune to avoid the shoal and get safely to anchor the boat from the other ship be immediately send off to assist paulo de gama in the st raphael and on see that the tide be then low the general be much rejoice as he well know she would float again with the tide of flood whereas before he be much afraid she might be totally lose he therefore give order to carry all they anchor out to deep water to prevent she from get farther on the shoal by the time this be do day break and soon after at low water the st raphael be quite dry on a sand bank have take no harm in striking while wait for the tide of flood we people name these sand _ os baixos de sam rafael _ or the shoal of st raphael and name certain island and hill of the continent then in sight the island and hill of st raphael while the ship remain thus dry and the people walk about on the sand they see two boat full of moor who come to we ship bring many sweet orange much better than those of portugal these man tell the general not to fear any damage to the ship which be aground as she would float uninjured with the next flood and the general be so much pleased with this good heartening that he give they several present which they accept with many thanks and understand that we fleet intend to put in at mombaza they request to be carry thither the general grant they request and permit they to remain on board the other return from we ship to they own country -lrb- 37 -rrb- when it be full sea the st raphael float and get off the shoal and the fleet proceed on its voyage follow the coast to the north-eastward the fleet come to anchor outside of the bar of the harbor of mombaza about sunset of Saturday the 7th of April mombaza be on a island very near the shore of the continent and have plenty of provision such as millet rice and cattle both large and small all well grow and fat especially the sheep which be uniformly without tail and it abound in poultry it be likewise very pleasant have many orchard abound in pomegranate indian fig orange both sweet and sour lemon and citron with plenty of pot-herb and it have a abundant supply of excellent water on this island there be a city have the same name momabza standing in lat 4  s which be handsomely build on a rocky hill wash by the sea the entrance of the haven have a mark or beacon and on the very bar there be a little low fort almost level with the water -lrb- 38 -rrb- most of the house of this place be build of stone and lime have the ceiling finely construct of plaster and the street be very handsome this city be subject to a king of its own the inhabitant be moor some of whom be white and other brown -lrb- 39 -rrb- the trade of this city be extensive and its inhabitant be well dress especially the woman who be clothe in silk and decorate with gold and precious stone the harbor be good and much frequent by shipping and it receive from the african continent in its neighborhood great quantity of honey wax and ivory the general do not enter the harbor that night because it grow late but command to hoist the flag in compliment which the people do with much mirth and joy in hope that they have come to a island in which there be many christian and that next day they might hear mass on shore they have likewise great hope that the sick who be almost the whole crew might here recover they health though indeed they be much reduce in number many have die during the voyage soon after we ship come to anchor although night approach a large boat contain about a hundred man all arm with sword and target be see come towards the fleet on reach the general ship they would have all come on board with they weapon but the general only permit four of they principal to come aboard and even they unarmed cause they to be tell in they own language that they must excuse he precaution be a stranger and not know therefore whom he might trust to those whom he permit to come on board he give courteous entertainment present they with such conserve as he have of which they readily partake and he request of they not to take ill that he have thus refuse entrance to so many armed man they say that they have merely come to see he as a new and rare thing in they country and that they be arm be merely because such be the custom of the country whether in peace or war they also say that the king of mombaza expect he arrival and would have send to visit he if it have not be so late but certainly would do so next day they king they add be rejoice at he arrival and would not only be glad to see he but would load he ship with spice they also say that there be many christian on the island who live by themselves at which the general be much pleased believe they story which agree with what the two pilot have say yet he entertain some jealous doubt for all they fair speech and wisely suspect the moor have come to see if they could lay a train to take we ship in this he be perfectly right as it afterwards appear that this be they sole intent the king of mombaza have receive perfect intelligence that we be christian and of all that we have do at mozambique and plot to be revenge by take we ship and kill we man next day be palm Sunday still prosecute he wicked purpose the king send some white moor with a message to the general declare he great joy at we arrival invite he into the harbor and engage to supply he with all thing he might be in need of and in token of amity send he a ring a sheep and many sweet orange citron and sugar cane these white moor be likewise instruct to pretend that they be christian and that there be many christian in the island all this be so well counterfeit that we people actually believe they to be christian on which account the general receive they with much courtesy and make they some present send a message to the king that he would certainly come farther into the harbor next day he also send a present to the king of a fine branch of coral and for the greater security he send along with these white moor two of we banish man who have be embark expressly for such hazardous undertaking or for be leave on shore where it might be deem expedient to become acquaint with the circumstance of various place and to be take on board again these man and the moor who have be on board be meet in landing by a number of people curious to see and examine they who accompany they all the way to the king palace where they have to pass through three several door each guard by a armed porter before they come to the place where the king be they find the king in no very great state yet he receive they well and command the moor who have bring they on shore to show they the city in go through the street we man see many prisoner in iron but not know the language they could not ask who or what these be yet believe they might be christian we we general be inform by the moorish pilot and the king two messenger that there be christian on the island and that the christian and the moor have war together we man be likewise carry to the house in which the merchant of indium dwelt who be say to be christian these people learn that we man be christian shew much joy at receive they embrace and banquet they and shew they a piece of paper on which the figure of the holy ghost be paint which they worship on they knee with great shew of devotion as if they have be what they pretend the moor then inform we man by sign that there be many other christian at another place too far for carry they there but that they should be conduct to see they when we ship come into the harbor all this be do craftily to entice we people into the harbor where they be determine to destroy they all after we two man have see the city they be conduct back to the king who order they to be shewn ginger pepper clove and wheat give they sample of they all to be carry to the general with assurance that he have great store of all these commodity and would give he he load if he desire it they be likewise tell that he have great plenty of gold silver amber wax ivory and other riches which he would sell at lower price than they could be buy in any other place this message be bring off on Monday to the general who hear the king offer to furnish he with a loading of these commodity be much rejoice and be much pleased with the information bring by the two convict and they good report of the people city and country and more especially on account of the _ two _ christian whom they have see in the house of the indian merchant after a consultation with the other captain it be determine to enter the port next day and to accept the spice offer by the king of mambaza after which to continue the voyage to calicut and if they could not procure similar article there to return contented with what might be get in this place in the meantime several of the moor visit we ship conduct themselves with much gentleness and humility and evince a appearance of friendship and kindness to we people as if they have be long and familiarly acquaint when the tide of flood be sufficiently advance on the follow morning the general give order to weigh anchor intend to carry the ship into the harbor but the almighty disposer of event not willing that he and he company should fall into the snare which the moor have lay for they destruction interpose to avert the danger and to work they safety for when the general ship have weigh anchor and be about to enter the port she touch on a shoal by the stern upon which he immediately let fall he anchor again which be likewise do by the other captain see this the moor who be on board conclude that he would not enter the harbor that day and instantly take to they boat which be alongside and make for the city : at the same time the pilot of mozambique leap from the stern of the admiral ship into the water and be take into the boat by the moor the admiral call out to they to bring he back but all in vain on which he begin to suspect that the moor and they king have evil intention towards he and he people and be thankful for the accident which have detain he from the harbor and preserve he from the purpose treachery after explain he apprehension to the other captain he command in the evening of this day that two of the moor who have be make prisoner at mozambique should be put to the torture to endeavor to ascertain whether any treachery be intend and to force they to disclose the same this be do by drop melted bacon upon they flesh and they immediately confess that treason be intend and that the pilot have escape by swim from the ship as fear the same have be discover on this confession the general resolve on no account to enter the harbor yet determine to put another moor to the torture to learn if he be in confederacy with the rest but this moor on see preparation make for the purpose although he hand be bind leap into the sea which be likewise do by another moor before day-light have thus discover the secret mischief which have be prepare against he the general give thanks to god by whose good providence he and he people have be deliver from imminent hazard of death among the infidel whereupon he and he company join in the _ salve regina _ with great devotion after this lest the moor might attempt any thing against they safety during the night he order a strong and vigilant armed watch to be keep it be worthy of notice that all the sick among we people who be indeed many begin presently to get well from they first come to mombaza so that in this time of they great necessity and danger they find themselves sound and strong beyond all human hope and far above the ordinary course of nature for which reason it can only be attribute to the marvellous and supernatural power of god miraculously do at this peculiar instant time of need for the preservation of these poor and distressed person whose only hope of safety be in he after the night watch be set those of the berrio feel the cable by which they lay at anchor swagging as if shake by a great tunny of which there be many in this place very large and excellent food : but on give more attention to the circumstance they perceive that this be occasion by they enemy the moor some of whom be swim about the cable and be cut it with knife or falchion that the ship might drift on shore and fall a prey to they on see this we man scare they away by cry out and give notice to the other ship to be on they guard against similar attempt some people from the san raphael go immediately to the assistance of the berrio and find some of the moor about the chain and tackling of the foremast who cast themselves into the sea and swam along with those who have attempt to cut the cable to certain boat that be in wait at a short distance in which as we people afterwards learn there be a great number of the moor who now row away to the city in all haste we fleet still remain off the harbor of mombaza all the Wednesday and Thursday follow during both of which night the moor come off in boat which always lay close by the shore whence some of they swim to the ship endeavor to cut we cable : but we man keep such strict

have in the harbor which in all human probability they have succeed in killing and destroy we all it be conjecture that they be deter from make this attempt from fear of the ordnance in we ship but

construction upon that coast these native be of a brown color and entirely naked except very small apron some of they immediately come on board the general and the guzerat pilot inform he these be poor fisherman yet the general receive they courteously and order he people to purchase the fish which they have bring for sale on converse with they he understand that the town whence they come which be in sight be not calicut which lay farther off and to which they offer to conduct we fleet whereupon the general request they to do this and depart from this first anchorage the fleet be conduct by these fisherman to calicut calicut be a city on the coast of malabar a province of the second indium which begin at the mount of delhus and end at cape comory be sixty - one league in length and fifteen league broad -lrb- 48 -rrb- the whole of this country be very low and apt to be cover with water have many island in its river which flow into the indian sea this country of malabar be divide from the kingdom of narsinga by a very high hill the indian report that this land of malabar be cover by the sea of old which then reach to the foot of the hill and thence to a hill where now the island of the maldive be find which be then firm land and that in after time it destroy that latter country and lay bare the country of malabar in which be many pleasant and rich city dependent upon trade which they carry on principally with calicut which exceed all city of we day in riches and in vice its foundation and rise be as follow : in ancient time this country of malabar be entirely rule by one king who dwell in the city of _ coulan _ in the reign of the last king of this race name _ saranaperimal _ -lrb- 49 -rrb- who die 600 year ago the moor of mecca discover indium and come to the province of malabar then inhabit by idolater and govern by a idolatrous king from the time of the come of these moor they begin to reckon they year as we do from the birth of we savior -lrb- 50 -rrb- after the come of the moor into malabar they insinuate themselves so much into the confidence of the before-mentioned king that he become a convert to they law renounce the religion of he country and embrace mahometism with such zeal that he resolve to go and end he day in the temple of mecca have thus resolve out of love to the mahometan sect to abandon he kingdom he call he kindred together and divide all he territory among they reserve only twelve league of country near the place where he intend to embark not then inhabit which he bestow upon one of he cousin who act as he page to this kinsman he give he sword and turban as ensign of dignity command all the other noble among whom he have distribute the rest of he territory to obey this person as they emperor the king of coulan and cananor only except whom also and all the other he debar from coin money which be only to be do by the king of calicut have thus give away he whole dignity and possession and set every thing in order he embark from the place where calicut now stand and because this king embark from that place on he pilgrimage to mecca the moor have ever since hold calicut in so high devotion that they and all they posterity would never take they lading from any other port from that time forwards they discontinue trade with the port of coulan which they have use formerly and that port therefore fall to ruin especially after the building of calicut and the settlement of many moor in that place -lrb- 51 -rrb- as the moor be merchant of most extensive dealings they have render calicut as the center of they trade the richest mart of all the indy in which be to be find all the spice drug nutmeg and other thing that can be desire all kind of precious stone pearl and seed-pearl musk sander aguila fine dish of earthen ware lacker -lrb- 52 -rrb- gilded coffer and all the fine thing of china gold amber wax ivory fine and coarse cotton goods both white and dye of many color much raw and twisted silk stuff of silk and gold cloth of gold cloth of tissue grain scarlet silk carpet copper quicksilver vermilion alum coral rose-water and all kind of conserve thus every kind of merchandize from all part of the world be to be find in this place which moreover be very quiet be situate along the coast which be almost open and very dangerous calicut be surround by many garden and orchard produce all the herb and fruit of this country in great abundance have also many palm and other sort of tree and abound in excellent water this part of indium produce but little rice which be a principal article of food in these part as wheat be with we but it procure abundance of that and all other kind of provision from other country the city be large but the dwelling consist only of straw hut they idol temple and chapel and the king palace except which be : build of stone and lime and cover with tile for by they law no other be permit to build they house of any other material than straw at this time calicut be inhabit by idolater of many sect and by many moorish merchant some of whom be so rich as to be owner of fifty ship these ship be make without nail they plank be sew together with rope of _ cayro _ make of the fiber of the cocoa-nut husk pitch all over and be flat-bottomed without keel every winter there be at least six hundred ship in this harbor and the shore be such that they ship can be easily draw up for repair the subject of the follow digression be so intimately connect with the first establishment of the portuguese in indium as to justify its introduction in this place which will greatly elucidate the narrative of castaneda and its length do not admit of be insert in the form of note it be chiefly due to the ingenious and reverend jame stanier clarke in he origin and progress of maritime discovery extract by he from various source the name of this country malabar be say to be derive from _ ulyam _ which signify in the original language of that part of indium _ skirt the bottom of the hill _ corrupt into maleyam or maleam whence probably come mulievar and mala-bar in a m account of malabar it be say that little more than 2300 year ago the sea come up to the foot of the _ sukien _ mountain or the western _ gaut _ the emerge of the country from the water be fabulously related to have be occasion by the piety or penitence of puresram rama who pray to _ varauna _ the god of the ocean to give he a track of land to bestow on the bramin varauna accordingly command the sea to withdraw from the _ gowkern _ a hill near mangalore all the way to cape comorin which new land long remain marshy and scarcely habitable and the original settler be force to abandon it on account of the numerous serpent by which it be infested : but they afterwards return be instruct to propitiate the serpent by worship they at first this country be divide into four _ tookree _ or province these into _ naadh _ or district and these again into _ khund _ or small precinct the bramin establish a kind of republican or aristocratical government under a few principal chief but jealousy and disturbance take place they procure a _ permaul _ or chief governor from the prince of chaldesh a sovereignty in the southern carnatic : yet it be more likely that this sovereign take advantage of the division among the chief of malabar to reduce they under he authority these permaul or viceroy be for a long while change every twelve year till at length one of they name sheo-ram cheruma perumal or shermanoo permaloo the sarana-perimal of castaneda become so popular that he set he master _ kishen rao _ the rajah of chaldesh at defiance and establish he own authority in malabar a army be send into malabar to reduce the country again to obedience but it be defeat and from this event which be say to have happen 1000 year ago all the raja chief _ nayre _ and other lord of malabar date the sovereignty and independence of they ancestor in that country after some time shermanoo-permaloo either become weary of he situation or from attachment to the mahometan religion resolve to make a division of malabar among he dependent from whom the present chieftain be descend such be the current story among the inhabitant of malabar yet it be more probable that he dependent chieftain disgust with he conversion to the religion of mahomet revolt from he authority and contrived this story of he voluntary surrender and division of he dominion to justify they own assumption after this division of he kingdom it be say that a _ erary _ or person of the cast of cow-herd originally from the bank of the cavery near errode in the carnatic who have be a chief instrument of the success of shermanoo-permaloo in the war against rajah kishen rao make application to shermanoo for some support have very little leave to give away shermanoo make he a grant of he own place of abode at calicut and give he he sword ankle-ring and other insignia of command and present he with water and flower the ancient symbol of a transfer of property it be say that this cowherd rajah be ordain principal sovereign over the other petty prince among whom malabar be divide with the title of zamorin and be authorize by shermanoo to extend he dominion over all the other chieftain by force of arm he descendant have ever since endeavor on all occasion to enforce this pretend grant which they pretend to hold by the tenure of possess the sword of shermanoo permaloo and which they carefully preserve as a precious relic from the period of the abdication of shermanoo to that of the arrival of the portuguese at calicut the mahomedan religion have make considerable progress in malabar and the arabian merchant receive every encouragement from the samoory or zamorin as they make calicut the staple of they indian trade and bring large sum of money yearly to that place for the purchase of spicery and other commodity as the raja of cochin and other petty sovereignty on the coast be exceedingly jealous of the superior riches and power of the zamorin and of the monopoly of trade enjoy by calicut they give every encouragement to the portuguese to frequent they port from whence arise a series of warfare by sea and land which have finally reduce they all under subjection to the european accord to a arabian author _ zeirreddien mukhdom _ who be suppose to have be send to assist the zamorin and the mahomedan in indium in they war with the portuguese malabar be then say to have be divide among a multiplicity of independent prince or raja whom he call _ hakim _ some of whom command over one or two hundred man and other one ten fifteen or even as high as thirty thousand or upward the three greatest power at that time be the _ colastrian _ -lrb- 53 -rrb- rajah to the north the zamorin of calicut in the center and a rajah in the south who rule from coulan kalum or coulim to cape comorin comprehend the country now belong to the rajah of travancore we now return from this digression to follow the narrative of the portuguese discovery and conquest of indium as relate by castaneda so great be the trade and population of calicut and the surrounding country and the revenue of its sovereign through these circumstance that he be able to raise a force of thirty thousand man in a single day and could even bring a hundred thousand man into the field completely equipt for war in three day this prince in the language of the country be style the zamorin or samoryn which signify emperor as he be supreme over the other two king of malabar the king of coulan and the king of cananor there be indeed other prince in this country who be call king but be not so this zamorin or king of calicut be a bramin as he predecessor have be the bramin be priest among the malabar it be a ancient rule and custom among these people that all they king must die in a pagoda -lrb- 54 -rrb- or temple of they idol and that there must always be a king resident in the principal pagoda to serve those idol : wherefore when the king that serve in the temple come to die he who then reign must leave he government of temporal affair to take he place in the temple upon which another be elect to take he place and to succeed in rule the kingdom if the king who be in possession of the temporal authority should refuse to retire to the pagoda on the death of the king who officiate in spiritual he be constrain to do so however unwilling the king and noble of malabar be of a brown complexion and go naked from the waist upward all the under part of they body be clothe in silk or cotton vestment yet they sometimes wear short gown on they upper part call _ basus _ of rich silk or cloth of gold or of scarlet splendidly ornament with precious stone of all which the zamorin have great store they shave they beard leave only the hair on they upper lip and do not shave the head like the turk in general the native of this country even of the higher rank use little state in they household and be very spare in they diet but the zamorin be serve with considerable splendor these king or noble never marry but every one have a mistress of the nayre cast which among the malabar be consider as the gentry even the zamorin have only a mistress who have a house of she own near the palace and a liberal allowance for the charge of she household and maintenance at she own disposal upon any dislike or difference he may always leave she for another the child be only consider as the offspring of the mother and have no right or title to inherit the kingdom or any thing else belong to the father and when grow up be only hold in that rank or estimation which belong to the blood or parentage of they mother brother succeed to brother and in lack of these the son of they sister who do not marry and

answer they at which they be much astonished yet believe he to be a moor they conduct he to a house where two moor dwell who come originally from tuni and have establish themselves in calicut on he appearance one of these moor whose name be bontaybo -lrb- 56 -rrb- who could speak spanish immediately recognize he for a portuguese have often see people of we nation at tunis in the reign of king john in a ship name la reyna which often trade to that port as soon as bontaybo see the portuguese he exclaim in spanish _ devil take you what bring you here _ he farther inquire which way he have travel so as to arrive at calicut to this the banish man answer tell how many ship we general have bring with he at which bontaybo be much amaze wonder how they could possibly come by sea from portugal to indium he then ask what they seek at so great a distance from home and be answer that they come in search of christian and spice bontaybo then ask why the king of france and spain and the doge of venice have not send they ship likewise because say we man the king of portugal would not allow they to this bontaybo say he be much in the right after some farther conversation in this way bontaybo give he good entertainment command certain cake of wheat flour and honey call _ ape _ by the malabar to be set before he and then say that he would accompany he to the ship to wait upon the

assistance alone this great happiness and good fortune have be accord to they the general embrace bontaybo whom he make to sit beside he and question he if he be a christian and how he come to calicut bontaybo tell he frankly that he be a moor from tuni in barbary and have come to calicut by way of cairo and the red sea and explain how he come to know the portuguese as have be already mention he farther declare that he have always be well disposed towards the portuguese nation have always find they worthy of confidence and friendship in all they dealings and have be a friend to they in time past he would not discontinue he good will and be ready and willing to do every thing in he power to serve they and to assist they in the object for which they have now come to calicut the general give he many thanks for he good will and promise to reward he liberally for the friendly aid he might give to he and he expedition express he extreme satisfaction at be so fortunate as to meet such a person in this place believe that god have send he here to promote the great object of this voyage for which he pass through so many and long continued danger be quite sensible that he must have reap little profit from all he labor without such friendly assistance the general then request information from bontaybo as to the character of the king or zamorin of calicut and whether in he opinion he would willingly receive he as ambassador from the king of portugal bontaybo represent the zamorin as a prince of good and honorable disposition who he be convince would gladly receive the general as ambassador from a foreign king more especially if the object of he voyage be to establish a trade with calicut and if the general have bring with he any merchandize proper for that purpose since the advantage which the zamorin derive from the custom upon trade form the chief source of he revenue he farther inform the general that the zamorin reside at this time at panane a village on the coast about five league from calicut and advise that the general should send a message there to notify he arrival and the reason of he come the general be well please with this advice and present certain gift to bontaybo along with whom he send two of he man to calicut request bontaybo to direct they on they way to panane which he do accordingly when these messenger come into the presence of the zamorin one of they name _ fernan martyn _ declare to he by means of a interpreter that he wait upon he highness on the part of he general who have arrive in the port of calicut with three ship have be send there by the king of portugal with letter to he highness which the general begged permission to present to he on hear this message and before give any answer the zamorin command each of the two messenger to be present with a piece cotton cloth and two piece of silk such as he use in he own apparel after which he inquire of fernan martyn what king it be who have send he these letter and how far he dominion be from thence fernan fully answer these inquiry add that he be a christian prince and that those whom he have send in the ship now at calicut be christian and related what great and numerous danger they have pass through during they voyage the zamorin be much amaze at the incident of the voyage which fernan related at some length and express he satisfaction that so powerful a prince of the christian should think of send a ambassador to he from so great a distance he then desire fernan to inform the general that he heartily welcome he and he people into he dominion advise he to bring he ship to anchor near a village call _ pandarane _ some way below where the ship then lay as a far better harbor than calicut which be a open and very dangerous road for ship the zamorin desire likewise that the general might come by land from that place to calicut where he would be ready to receive he after this the zamorin send a pilot to navigate the ship to the harbor of pandarane but on come to the bar of that port the general do not think it advisable to enter so far within the harbor as the pilot propose fear lest he might expose himself to danger by repose too great confidence in these people and place himself too much within they power in this he act with much prudent foresight by which he wisely avoid the injury which be afterwards attempt against he at this place on he arrival at pandarane the general receive a message from the kutwal -lrb- 57 -rrb- of calicut intimate that he and other noble await he on shore by order of the zamorin to conduct he to the city and that he have permission to land whenever he pleased -lrb- 58 -rrb- but as the day draw near a close the general return a answer excuse himself from land that night he immediately call a council of the other captain and principal officer of the fleet to take they advice on the present emergency to whom he intimate he intention of go to visit the king of calicut on purpose to settle a treaty of trade and amity paulo de gama he brother strongly object to he venture on shore allege that although the native of the place be christian as they still believe they yet there be many moor among they who be much to be fear as he mortal enemy since these people at mozambique and mombaza where they have only pass by they port endeavor to destroy they all they be much more to be fear at calicut where we have come on purpose to enter into competition with they in trade by which they profit would be diminish it be therefore the more probable that they would use every effort to destroy the general on whom we whole hope of safety and success depend and however much the zamorin might regret the commission of such a deed he could not restore he to life : besides which the moor be inhabitant of the place where they have much interest whereas the general be a utter stranger likewise it be quite impossible for they to be assure that the king of calicut might not have league with the moor for he death or captivity either of which would ruin they voyage and prove the destruction of they all and all the toil and danger they have pass through would prove in vain to prevent all this danger he strongly urge that the general should on no account go on shore but should depute one of the captain or some other person in the fleet in he stead allege that commander in chief ought never to subject themselves to personal danger unless in case of the most urgent necessity all the officer be of the same opinion but the general answer that even if he be perfectly assure that he landing be to occasion he instant death he would not refrain from go to visit the king of calicut to endeavor to settle amity and trade and that he might procure some spice and other commodity from the place by means of which they discovery of calicut might be prove on they return into portugal : as otherwise if we return without any of the production of the indy they discovery would be discredit and they honor and veracity call in question think not therefore say he but i will rather die than leave it in hazard that the long time we have already spend and may yet employ shall be lose and other send to ascertain the truth of we discovery while envious person may have it in they power to discredit we service neither do i run into such hazard of death nor expose you to such danger as you suppose see that i be go to a city inhabit by christian and to a king who wish the concourse of many merchant in he dominion as the more of these that frequent he port so much the greater must be he revenue from the custom upon trade it be not my intention to stay long on shore so as to give opportunity to the moor to complot against I as i propose only to talk with the king and to return in three day by which time you may have every thing in readiness for we departure if i should have the good fortune by the will of god to establish trade and amity with the king of calicut i would not exchange the honor and credit of that transaction for any treasure that could be give I neither can the king of calicut settle this affair so well with any other person as he will honor I the more for be the captain-general of this fleet and the ambassador of we king should any other go in my stead the king might look upon himself as slight and insult under a idea that i do not esteem he worthy to be visit by myself or that i do not trust he on he word and assurance besides it be not possible for I to give sufficiently ample instruction to any one i might send to enable he to do what may be necessary under every circumstance that may arise as i myself might do even if it should chance that they kill I it be better this should happen in the discharge of my duty than that i should preserve my life by neglect to perform it you my friend remain at sea in good ship : and if you hear of any mischance befall I my desire be that you shall immediately depart and carry home news of we discovery as for we present subject there need be no farther argument as i be determine with the blessing of god to proceed to visit the king at calicut when this determination be make know the captain make no farther objection and choose out twelve person to accompany he among whom be diego diaz he secretary fernan martinez the interpreter john de sala who be afterwards treasurer of the indy and nine other and paulo de gama he brother be appoint to act as captain-general during he absence the general before go on shore give pointed order that no person should on any account be permit to come on board the ship but that all who be desirous of any intercourse with they should remain in they boat or almadia he likewise direct that nichola coello should come every day with he boat well arm as near the shore as he could with safety on purpose to keep up a intercourse between the ship and himself all these thing be settle the general go on shore with he twelve attendant all in they best attire they boat furnish with much ordnance dress out with flag and streamer and sound trumpet all the way from the ship to the shore on landing the general be receive with every demonstration of respect by the kutwal attend by 200 nayre and a great concourse of native both of the country and from the city of calicut after compliment be pass the general be place in a _ andor _ or litter which the king of calicut have send for he use in this country it be not customary to travel on horseback but in these andor this vehicle be like a horse-litter except that they be very plain with low side and be carry by four man on they shoulder who run post in this manner carry the king or any noble person when on a journey and go at a great rate the person in the andor may either sit or lie as he please and certain servant carry umbrella which they call _ buey _ to shelter the person in the andor from the sun and rain there be other andor which have a curved cane over they like a bow and be so light that they can be carry by two man the general be mount in one andor and the kutwal in another they set out for a town call capocate -lrb- 59 -rrb- all the rest be on foot but the kutwal appoint certain people of the country to carry the baggage of we man which be restore to they at capocate where the party stop for refreshment the general and he people be in one house and the kutwal in another we people be here provide with boil fish with rice and butter and some of the country fruit which be very good though quite different from ours one of these fruit be call _ laca _ and another

consist of two almadia lash side by side the kutwal and he train embark in many other boat and the whole go up a river which discharge itself into the sea at this place the number of people that come to the river side to view we man as they pass be quite countless by which it appear that the country be well inhabit after go about a league up this river we people come to a place where many large ship be draw up on the shore the whole party here disembark and proceed by land the general and kutwal in andor as before be surround by thousand who be curious to see the stranger even many woman press into the crowd with they child sling at they back from this place the kutwal carry the general to one of they pagoda or idol temple into which they enter and which the kutwal say be a church of great holiness this the general believe to be the case fancy it to be a church of the christian which he the more readily believe as he see seven little bell hang over the principal door in front of this entry there stand a pillar make of wire as tall as the mast of a ship on the top of which be a weathercock likewise make of wire this church be as large as a moderate convent all build of freestone and cover or vault over with brick have a fine outward appearance as if its inside be of splendid workmanship we general be much pleased with this church as he actually believe himself in a christian country and gladly enter along with the kutwal they be receive by the priest who be naked from the waist upward have a kind of petticoat of cotton hang down from the girdle to they knee and piece of calico cover they arm-pit they head leg and foot bare they be distinguish by wear certain thread over they right shoulder which cross over they breast under they left arm much in the way in which we priest use formerly to wear they stole when they say mass these man be call kafr -lrb- 60 -rrb- and be idolater serve as priest in the pagoda of malabar and on the general go into the pagoda they take holy water with a _ sprinkle _ from a font and throw it over the kutwal and he and they attendant after this they give they powdered sandalwood to throw upon they head as use to be do amongst we with ash and they be direct to do the same on they arm but we people as be clothe omit this latter part of the ceremony comply with the other in this pagoda they see many image paint on the wall some of which have monstrous tooth project a inch from they mouth and some have four arm all of they so ugly that they seem like devil which raise doubt among we people whether they be actually in a christian church in the middle of the pagoda stand a chapel have a roof or dome of freestone like a tower in one part of which be a door of wire to which there lead a flight of stone step on the inside of this tower a image be observe in a recess of the wall which we man could not see distinctly as the place be somewhat dark and they be not permit to go near as none be allow to approach except the priest but from certain word and sign we people understand this to be a image of the virgin on which the general and he attendant go upon they knee to say they prayer -lrb- 61 -rrb- john de sala however be very doubtful that this be not a christian church owe to the monstrous image on the wall say as he fall on he knee _ if this be the devil i worship god _ on which the general look at he with a smile the kutwal and he people as they approach the chapel prostrated themselves three time on they face with they hand extend before they after which they arise and say they prayer stand from this place they go forwards to the city of calicut and be take at they arrival into another pagoda similar to the former after this on enter the city the crowd be so great that they could hardly make they way through the street the general be astonish to see such multitude and praise god for have bring he in safety to this city humbly beseech he divine mercy so to guide he on he way that he

window and on the roof be quite innumerable the general be well pleased at he honorable reception and say pleasantly to those of he company _ they little think in portugal how honourably we be receive here _ the procession arrive at the palace a hour before sunset though only construct of earth the palace be very extensive and seem a handsome structure have great number of tree intersperse among the different building with pleasant garden full of fine flower and odoriferous plant and many fountain as the zamorin never go out of the palace while resident in calicut on arrive at the palace several caymal and other nobleman come out to receive the general who lead he to a large square immediately in front of the gate whence they pass through four several court at the gate of each of

people have previously bring all he baggage next day be Tuesday the general be greatly rejoice to see so promise a commencement of he business and resolve upon send a present to the zamorin upon which he send for the kutwal and the king factor to whom he shew the present which he propose send this consist of four _ capota _ or cloak of scarlet cloth six hat four branch of coral twelve _ almasare _ a box contain seven brass vessel a chest of sugar two barrel of oil and a cask of honey the kutwal and factor laugh in derision at this present say that this be no fit present for they king the poorest merchant present one more valuable they desire he rather to send gold as the king would accept of nothing else the general be offend at this say if he have be a merchant he would have bring gold but be a ambassador he have bring none that what he now offer be he own goods and not belong to the king he master who be uncertain if he should ever reach calicut have give he nothing to offer as a present to the zamorin but at he next come know now certainly the route the king he master would send gold and silver and otter rich article to this they answer that these thing might be but it be the custom of this country for every stranger who have speech of the king to make he a present in proportion to the greatness of he rank the general reply it be very proper they custom should be observe and therefore he desire to send this present which he could not make more valuable for the reason already assign and if they would not suffer it to be carry to the king he should send it back to he ship they answer he might do so for they would not consent to have such a present send to the king the general much displeased say he would go speak with the king himself and would then return to the ship mean to have inform the king of all that have pass in regard to the intended present this they say be very proper but as they would be detain long at court in attend he they be oblige in the mean time to go upon other business and would return to escort he to court as the king would be angry if he go without they he be a entire stranger and besides he could not go in safety unaccompanied because of the great number of moor who reside in that city give credit to they word the general consent to this arrangement and say he would wait for they return which he expect would be without delay : but they do not return all that day as they have be gain over by the moor to thwart the purpose of the general the moor in calicut have receive information of the transaction of the portuguese at quiloa and of the taking of the _ sambuco _ off melinda and know that we be christian be very jealous of we arrival at calicut bontaybo have tell the moor that we purpose be not merely to discover calicut from curiosity but that spice be in great estimation in portugal which abound in gold and silver and to which all kind of merchandize be at present transport that go from calicut by way of the red sea and finally that the settlement of a direct trade by the portuguese with calicut would tend greatly to the profit of the zamorin all this the moor very well understand : but consider that we be christian they believe if we should establish trade with calicut that they own commodity would fall in price and most of they profit be destroy wherefore they consult together how to induce the zamorin to take the general prisoner to seize we ship and to kill all we man that they might not return into portugal with any intelligence concern calicut upon this they associate themselves with some of those who be in greatest credit with the zamorin to whom they procure access and represent to he that he ought not to be deceive by the christian for the general be no ambassador as he pretend but a pirate who go about to rob and plunder whereever he come they assert have receive undoubted intelligence of this from they factor in africa where after enter into a friendly correspondence with the _ xeque _ who even visit the general in he ship give he many present and provide he with a pilot to bring he to calicut he have batter the town with he ordnance and kill several of he subject that he have afterwards take some _ sambuco _ laden with merchandize treat the xeque and he subject like enemy in like manner they misrepresent the conduct of the general at mombaza and melinda turn every thing that have occur to he dishonor they reason from these misrepresentation that he could not be a ambassador send to maintain peace and amity as he would not in that case have be guilty of these base hostility and would assuredly have bring the king a present worthy of the sovereign he pretend to come from the king be much amaze at this discourse and tell the moor that he would consider and determine what be proper for he to do the moor also tell the kutwal of all that they have say to the king with whom he be in great credit and request of he to persuade the king not to listen to this embassage the kutwal then go to the king who tell he all that the moor have say and the kutwal advise he to do as the moor have request on this the king change he good intention towards the general yet endeavor to conceal he purpose the moor then wait on the general under pretence of friendship offering to instruct he how best to conduct himself say that it be customary for all person who come from other place to calicut on business with the king to bring he a present on this the general shew they the present he have propose make which the kutwal and the factor have make so light of and with whom they agree say it be by no mean a fit present and would rather seem a mockery and give offence even bontaybo agree in this opinion and ask the general why he have not bring better thing as he know that portugal abound in all manner of rich commodity but the general excuse himself as formerly by say that it be quite uncertain whether he might ever have come to calicut the general remain the whole of this day in he lodgings much displeased that the kutwal and factor have not return accord to promise and be at one time resolve to have go to court without they yet think it better to wait till next day in the afternoon of the Wednesday the kutwal and factor make they appearance when he mention he dissatisfaction at they long absence but they talk of other thing and give he no answer on that subject at length they accompany he to the palace but the king have greatly change he mind towards he make he wait three hour for admission and then order that only two of he people should be admit into the presence along with himself though the general consider this separation of he people as not look well he go into the presence attend by fernan martinez and diego diaz he interpreter and secretary the king do not receive he so well as formerly and say with a severe countenance that he have expect he all the precede day not willing to give he the true cause of he absence lest it might lead to a conversation respect the present the general say he have tarry at home to recover from the fatigue of he long voyage on this the king observe that he pretend to have be send on a embassy of friendship from a rich and powerful king and that he do not well understand what kind of friendship be intend since he have send he no present to this the general answer that it be not to be wonder that the king he master have send no present to he highness consider the extreme uncertainty of he be able to come to this place by a way never before attempt and unknown till now but now that the way be discover and god spare he to return to portugal he master would assuredly send he princely gift worthy of they both : and if he highness would have the goodness to give credit to the letter which he have bring from the king he master he would there learn the intention of the king of portugal in send he to calicut instead of desire to see the letter the king ask he whether he be send in search of stone or of man and if send to discover man how come it that the king he master have send no present and since it be manifest that he have bring he nothing he demand of he to send he the golden image of the virgin which he understand be in he ship the general much concerned to find the king so much change towards he on account of not bring he a present and amaze at this strange demand say that the image of the virgin mary of which he highness have be tell be only of wood gilt and not of gold and besides as this holy image have protect he during he long peril on the sea and have bring he so far in safety he be unwilling to part with it the zamorin make no reply to this but immediately demand that he should produce the letter from the king of portugal one of these be write in the portuguese language and the other in arabic and the general explain that this have be do because the king he master do not know which of these might be understand in the dominion of he highness : and since he now know that portuguese be not understand in indium whereas arabic be he request that some christian of the indy who understand arabic might be employ to interpret the letter because the moor be know to be enemy to the christian and he be afraid lest they might purposely give it a wrong interpretation the king give order to this purpose but no indian could be find who be able to read the letter or at least who would acknowledge that he could read they see that it be now necessary that it should be read by the moor the general request that bontaybo should be one of those appoint for the purpose place more reliance on he than the other as he be a acquaintance the king accordingly command the letter to be read by he and other three moor who have first read it over to themselves interpret it aloud to the king to the following effect : as soon as it become know to the king of portugal that the king of calicut be one of the mightiest king of all the indy and a christian he be anxious to establish a treaty of amity and commerce with he that he might procure spice which be in great abundance in he country and to procure which the merchant of many part of the world trade thither : and if he highness would give a licence to send for spice he would send many thing from he kingdom which be not to be have in the dominion of he highness or if these thing be not satisfactory of which the general could shew he some sample he be willing to send money both gold and silver to purchase the spice and finally refer he highness to the general for farther information on hearing this letter interpret and be desirous that he revenue might increase by the resort of many merchant to he dominion the zamorin evince he satisfaction at what he have hear and assume a more friendly deportment towards the general ask he what be the article of merchandize that could be have from portugal de gama name many different kind particularly mention such as he have sample of along with he and likewise they money and request permission to go on board he ship that he might bring these thing to he highness offer to leave four or five of he man in he lodgings during he absence give now more credit to the general than to what have be say by the moor to he prejudice the king tell de gama he might go on board when he please take all he man with he as there be no call for any of they remain on shore he likewise say the general might freely bring he goods on shore and sell they to the best advantage the general be greatly satisfy with this permission of which he have no hope at the first on see the unfriendly reception he have meet with at the commencement of he audience he go back therefore to he lodging accompany by the kutwal and the day be near a close he defer return on board that night de farium give a somewhat different account of what pass at this second audience -lrb- 62 -rrb- it be wonderful that the zamorin not know how to be properly assure of the truth should rely on the faith of he who be accuse by he minister for as if he have really know in what detestation the portuguese hold a lie although to they own advantage he send for de gama and tell he plainly that he have be inform he embassy be all a counterfeit and that he be some banish man or a fugitive : yet at the same time offer even if it be so to give he a kind reception and to make he handsome appointment in he service and promise to rely entirely on he word for information respect the truth of the whole story de gama hear the king to a end with a firm countenance and declare himself highly sensible of the confidence repose in he he then proceed to answer all that have be allege against he which he completely overturn by irrefragable argument in a long and eloquent speech preserve the utmost gravity and composure throughout the whole the zamorin eye he steadfastly the whole time hope to be enable to judge of the truth or falsehood of he assertion by he countenance and conclude from the unconcernedness of he look the eloquence of he word and the firm gravity of he whole demeanor that no deceit could lurk under such appearance of sincerity that the moor have accuse he maliciously and have impose on he minister he therefore frankly allow de gama permission to return to he ship and to land he merchandize if he have any : say that while that be do he would prepare a satisfactory answer to the letter of the king of portugal on the next day be the last of may the kutwal send a horse to the general to carry he to pandarane but have no furniture he request to be supply with a _ andor _ which be send accordingly when de gama immediately set out for pandarane all he people accompany he on foot the kutwal remain at calicut but a considerable number of nayre escort the general on he way when the moor learn that the general be go to the ship they go together to the kutwal make large offer of money to he if he would pursue the general and detain he a prisoner under some feigned pretence when they would take some opportunity of have he slay in such way that the blame should not attach to the kutwal and when he object that the zamorin might punish he for detain the general contrary to he order they engage so to deal with the zamorin as to obtain he pardon for that offence induce by a large bribe and encourage by this promise the kutwal follow de gama in such haste that he soon pass we man who lag behind on account of the great heat on overtake de gama he ask by sign why he be in such haste and where he be run to the general answer in the same manner that he be run to avoid the heat on come to pandarane as he man be not come up the general decline go into the town till they should arrive and go into a house to get shelter from the rain the people do not get to the town till near sunset have lose they way on which the general say if it have not be for they absence he would have be by this time on board the general immediately desire the kutwal to order he to be furnish with a almadium or pinnace to carry he and he people on board but the kutwal say it be now late and the ship so far away that he might miss they in the dark for which reason he have better stay till next day the general then say if he be not immediately furnish with a almadium he would return to the king and complain that he be detain contrary to he license and even mention as if he mean to return immediately to calicut to dissemble the more the kutwal say he might have thirty instead of one if he need they and pretend to send out to procure almadia while at the same time he command the owner to hide themselves that they might not be find in the mean time while messenger be dispatch on pretence to seek almadia the general have a strong suspicion that evil be intend towards he walk leisurely along the water side and send off gonzale perez and two other mariner to go on before and endeavor to find nicholas coello with he boat and to caution he to keep out of the way lest the kutwal might send off to seize he boat and man while perez and the other be absent on this errand it draw far into the night and not choose to go off till he learn what success perez have meet with he at length agree to stay all night have place de gama in the house of a moor for the night the kutwal pretend that he would go in search of the three mariner who be absent but he do not return till next morning the general then require to have a almadium to carry he and he people on board before answer the kutwal speak some word to he nayre in they own language and then desire the general to give order to have the ship bring near the shore oh which he should have leave to depart on this the general become still more afraid that some treachery be intend yet answer boldly that he would give no such order while he remain on shore as that would make he brother believe he be a prisoner and have issue this order under restraint on which he would immediately depart for portugal without he the kutwal then threaten stoutly that he should never be allow to go off unless he comply with this demand the general in return declare he should immediately return to calicut if not allow to go on board and make a complaint of he conduct to the king the kutwal even dare he to do this yet take care it should not be in he power as he have order the door to be keep shut and guard by armed nayre to prevent any of the portuguese from go out yet it be the will of god that the kutwal dare not to kill the general or any of he man although the moor have bribe he with a great sum of money and notwithstanding he great credit with the zamorin he anxiety to have the ship bring near the shore be that the moor might be able to board they and kill all they people and see it in this light the general be equally determine to prevent they nearer approach finding he could not prevail on the general to command the ship to be bring near the shore and have no pretence to justify either keep he prisoner or offer he any wrong the kutwal next endeavor to persuade he to order the sail and rudder on shore at which the general only laugh say the king have give full permission to go on board without any such condition and assure he the king should be fully inform of all he unjust proceedings the general and he people now pretend to be in want of necessaries from the ship and request leave to send some of he people on board while he should remain on shore but this the kutwal refuse and we people begin to be seriously alarmed at this time gonzalo perez return suppose the general at liberty and that he wait for he and he companion perez inform de gama that he have see coello who wait for he with the boat near the shore the admiral be exceedingly anxious that the kutwal should not know of this circumstance lest he might send out a number of armed almadia to capture they and therefore urge perez to return secretly to give coello warn to return to the ship and keep constantly on the alert for fear of a attack when coello get this intelligence he immediately set off and the kutwal cause he to be pursue by several almadia full of armed man but he make he escape the kutwal make another attempt to induce the general to order he brother to bring the ship near the shore but in vain for the general tell he he brother even if he be to write such a order would not obey or be he dispose to do so the other officer in the ship would prevent he the kutwal observe that he could not give credit to this as he be sure any thing he command would be obey but no argument could prevail on the general to this measure which he be satisfy be mean for facilitate the destruction of the fleet to gratify the moor the whole of this day be spend in this manner and in the night we people be confine in a large paved yard surround with wall and under even a stronger guard than attend they during the day and even the general begin to fear as well as the man that they would be separate from one another yet he trust when the zamorin should come to know the usage they have receive he would give order for they release that night the kutwal come to sup with the general and send a supply of fowl and rice finding that he could not prevail over the constancy of de gama he determine at last to set he at liberty next day therefore be Saturday the second of June he desire the general since he have promise to the king to bring he merchandize on shore that he ought to do so as it be the usage of all merchant who come to calicut to land they goods and crew and not to return to they ship till all be sell and he promise when this be do to give he free liberty to depart although the general give very little credit to he fair word he yet say if the kutwal would provide almadia for the purpose he would order he goods on shore but be certain he brother would not allow the boat to leave the ship while he be detain on shore the kutwal be now content to get the goods into he power as he understand from the general they be of great value and allow the general to send off a message to he brother he therefore send off a letter by two of he man in which he give he brother a account of he situation confine to he lodging but otherwise well use and desire he to send some of the merchandize on shore to satisfy the kutwal but direct he in case he be much longer detain to believe that he be keep prisoner by order of the zamorin whose only object be to get the portuguese ship into he power not have time to arm he own ship for that purpose for this reason if not set at liberty immediately after the goods be land he require he brother to return without delay to portugal and inform the king of all that have happen that the trade of so fine a country might not be lose to he country and farther to inform the king in what state he remain trust that he royal master would send such a armament as would enforce he restoration to liberty on receive this letter and a circumstantial relation from the messenger of all that have happen on shore paulo de gama immediately send the goods but say in answer to the general that he could not answer to he honor to return to portugal without he and he trust god would enable the small force he have still in the fleet with the aid of he ordnance to compel the kutwal to liberate he on the merchandize be land the general deliver it over into the custody of diego diaz as factor with alvora de braga as he clerk whom he leave in a house provide for they by the kutwal after which he go on board the ship he then refuse to send any more goods on shore till those already there be sell and pay for and determine not to run himself again into danger by venture on shore after what have already past at this the moor be grievously vex as they think it more easy for they to have destroy he on land than on board the ship on purpose to entice he to land once more the moor make a mock of he goods pretend they be good for nothing and do all in they power to prevent they from sell think that the zamorin know nothing of all these transaction he send he a account of the whole five day afterwards by he factor of all that have happen and of the injurious conduct of the moor respect the sale of the goods the king seem much offend by these proceedings send the general word that he would punish all those who have use he ill yet the kutwal remain unpunished the king likewise send seven or eight merchant of guzerate who be idolater to buy the goods accompany by a honest nayre to remain with diaz at the factory to defend he against the moor yet all this be only do colourably that the moor might not appear to suborn the merchant for these man buy nothing and even beat down the price of the commodity to the great satisfaction of the moor who now boast that no person would buy we goods any more than they yet none of the moor dare venture to we factory after they hear a nayre be station there by the king order if they do not love we before they hate we ten time worse now and when any of we man land they use to spit on the ground in contempt call out portugal portugal but by the especial order of the general we people take no other notice than merely laugh at they insolence as none of the merchant would buy we goods the general suppose that this be occasion by they be lodge at pandarane where none of the merchant of calicut reside and request leave by a messenger from the zamorin to have the goods remove to the city this permission be immediately grant and the king issue order to the kutwal to see they remove and even to pay the person who carry they that nothing belong to the king of portugal might be subject to any charge in he country the general would not trust himself any more on shore although bontaybo who frequently come off to visit he advise he to wait on the king lest the great credit of the moor might again prevail over he mind but consider this man as a moor the general never put much trust in he nor informed he of he intention yet always receive he kindly and give he money and other gift that he might bring he intelligence of what be pass on shore after the portuguese merchandize be remove to calicut the general permit one man daily from each of the ship to go on shore to see the city and to purchase any thing they have a mind for always take especial care that one party return on board before another land we people be courteously receive and entertain by the native and be even lodge in they house occasionally they barter several thing on shore such as bracelet of brass and copper pewter and other european article for the production of the country as freely and quietly as if they have be in lisbon fisherman and other of the idolater come off to the ship sell fish cocoa-nut and poultry for biscuit or money while other come off with they child merely to have a sight of we ship on all these occasion the general command they to be well treat and to have food give they to conciliate the people and to secure the friendship of the zamorin this continue till the tenth of August during which time the ship have always some of the native on board see the quietness of the people and they familiarity with he man who never meet with any injury from the moor or nayre the general believe the zamorin be willing to preserve friendship and peace with the subject of portugal and determine upon establish a factory in calicut for the sale of he commodity although very little of what be land have as yet be sell by this mean he hope to lay a sure foundation for the establishment of trade against the next expedition which the king he master might send if god pleased to send he home with the intelligence of the discovery accordingly with the advice and concurrence of the captain and other principal officer of the fleet he send a present by diego diaz to the zamorin consist of scarf of different color silk coral and various other article diaz be desire to say to the king that the general beg he highness to excuse he presumption in send such a present in token of he entire devotion to he service have nothing worthy of the acceptance of so great a prince that the time now draw near when it would be necessary to depart on he return to portugal and therefore if he highness mean to send a ambassador to the king of portugal he have better give order that he might soon be ready to embark presume upon what he highness have already agree to and on the kindness hitherto shewn to he and he people by he highness he request permission to leave a factor and clerk in calicut along with he merchandize as a memorial of peace and amity between he highness and the king of portugal as a testimony of the truth of the embassy with which he have be entrust and in pledge of farther embassy from the king he master as soon as the discovery be make know he likewise pray he highness to send on board as a full confirmation of he have actually make the voyage to india a _ bahar _ of cinnamon another of clove and a third of some other spice which should be pay for by the factor out of the first sale of the goods in he possession it be four day after diaz receive this order before he could get access to the zamorin though he go every day to the palace for this purpose at length he be admit to audience and on see diaz with he present the king ask he what he want in so stern a manner that he be afraid of be kill after deliver the message from the general and wish to deliver the present the king refuse to see it and command that it should be deliver to he factor the answer he give to the message be that since the general wish to depart he might do so but must first pay he 600 _ serasyne _ -lrb- 63 -rrb- accord to the custom of the country diaz on he return to the factory with the present intend for the king be accompany by many of the nayre which he think be from respect : but immediately on enter the house the nayre remain at the door forbid he or any other person to go out after this a proclamation be make through the city forbid any boat or almadium to go on board we fleet on pain of death yet bontaybo go off secretly and give warn to the general not to venture on shore or to permit any of the people to land as he have learn from the moor that any who might do so would surely lose they life bontaybo say farther that all the fair word of the king proceed from dissimulation that he might entice the general and he people on shore to kill they all all which evil intention be occasion by the moor who make the king believe that the portuguese be thief and pirate who have come to calicut to steal such merchandize as should be bring there and who have come to spy out the land that they might return with a great armament to invade he dominion all this be confirm by two malabar idolater and the general be in great uncertainty how best to proceed on the present emergency that same night after dark a negro slave belong to diaz come off with the information that diaz and braga be make prisoner and with a account of the answer which the king have give to he message what he have order to be do with the present and of the proclamation which be make through the city diego diaz be anxious to have these thing communicate to the general have bribe a fisherman to carry this man on board as he could not well be recognize in the night owe to he color the general though much offend at these injurious proceedings be unwilling to depart till he might see the end of these thing and therefore wait to see whether anyone might come off to the ship next day be Wednesday the 15th of August only one almadium come off in which there be four boy who bring fine precious stone for sale although the general believe they be spy he receive they kindly and give no hint of have hear that diaz be make a prisoner expect that other of more importance might come on board through whom he might procure the enlargement of diaz and braga by these boy he write to diaz but couch in such a manner that it might not be understand if it fall into any other hand the letter be deliver accord to its direction and the boy tell the king of they reception on board by which he believe that the general know not of the imprisonment of he people on this he send off other person to the ship who be strictly enjoin not to disclose the treatment which the factor have experience this be do out of policy to deceive the general and to detain we ship till the king might be able to send he own fleet to set upon he or till the ship might arrive from mecca to take he prisoner some of the malabar continue to come off daily all of whom the general command to be well entertain as he see none of sufficient importance to be detain but on the Sunday six principal malabar come on board attend by fifteen man in another pinnace believe that the king would liberate diaz and braga in return for these man he make they all prisoner and send a letter in the malabar language by two of the native boatman to the king factor demand he factor and clerk in return for those man he have

weigh anchor on Wednesday the 23d of August and set sail mean to try if this shew of go away would have the effect of recover diaz and braga in return for these malabar whom he have detain the wind be contrary he come to anchor in a open road four league from calicut where the ship remain till the Saturday as there be no appearance of get back he people de gama again set sail but for want of wind have to come again to anchor almost out of the sight of land a almadium now come to the ship with certain malabar who say that diaz and the other be in the king palace and would be assuredly send on board next day not see the detain malabar these people believe they have be all put to death this affect delay proceed entirely from craft that they might gain time to fit out the calicut fleet and for the arrival of the ship from mecca when they combine force might environ and destroy the portuguese the general order these messenger to go back to calicut and not to return without he man or letter from they as otherwise he should sink they and that if a satisfactory answer be not send he without delay he would cut off the head of all the malabar whom he have detain the malabar return to calicut with this message and a wind spring up the general make sail and come to anchor off calicut about sunset next day seven almadia come off to the fleet in one of which be diego diaz and alvora braga the other be fill with many of the native these people however be afraid to come on board and put diaz and braga into the boat which be astern of the general ship and then put off to a little distance wait for the general answer diego tell the general that when the king learn of he have sail he send for he to the palace assume a pleasant countenance as pretend to be ignorant of he

calicut as a spy from the king of portugal bontaybo say he be sure this bad treatment have proceed from the suggestion of the moor and as they have seize he goods he be sure they mean personal violence on which account he have make he escape the general give he a kind reception offer to carry he to portugal promising that he should recover double the value of he goods besides that he might expect to be well reward by the king of portugal to this arrangement bontaybo gladly consent and have a good cabin assign he by order of the general about ten o'clock the same day three almadia full of man come off to the ship have some scarf lay on they bench as be part of we goods and these be follow by four other almadia one after the other the malabar pretend that they have bring off all the goods which they offer to put into he boat and require he in return to deliver up the rest of the prisoner but convinced this be a mere deception the general desire they to go away as he would have none of they merchandize and be resolve to carry the malabar to portugal as witness of he discovery he add if god spare he life he should convince they whether the christian be thief as the moor have make the king of calicut believe who have therefore treat he with so much injustice he now command several cannon to be fire on which they be afraid and make off it be certain if the king ship have be afloat that they would have be send to attack we ship but they be all haul upon shore on account of the winter season wherefore we may attribute it to providence that we ship happen to arrive here at this season that thereby they might escape and carry home news of have discover the indy to the great advancement of the catholic faith although greatly rejoice at have make the discovery of the route to calicut and the indy he be much distressed at the behavior of the zamorin believe that the next expedition that might be send out would be subject to great danger but as he be unable to do any

of rain attend with some wind by which the fleet be enable to make sail and the enemy return to the land he now propose to direct he course for melinda but make little way along the coast by reason of calm at this time have in mind the good of the next ship which might come to calicut he think fit to send a soothing letter to the zamorin which be write in arabic by bontaybo in which he apologize for have carry off the malabar as evidence of he have be at calicut he say he be sorry that he have leave no factor lest the moor might put he to death and that he have be deter by the some cause from

gourd and cucumber for sale these people say that they country produce cinnamon and two of we people be send onshore to see whether this be true who bring with they two green bough which be say to be cinnamon of which they have see a large grove but it turn out only to be the wild kind at they return these man be accompany by more than twenty native who bring hen gourd and cow milk for sale and who say if the general would send some of he man on shore he might have abundance of dry cinnamon hog and poultry : but he dread treachery and would not allow any of he people to go on shore next forenoon when some of we man go to a part of the shore at some distance from the ship to cut wood they suddenly come in sight of two boat lie close to the land and return with intelligence of what they have see but the general would not send to inquire what these might be until after dinner in the mean time one of the man in the top give notice that he see eight large ship out at sea which be then becalm the general give immediate order to have every thing in readiness in case of a attack and as the wind serve both fleet they soon come within two league of each other the enemy perceive we fleet approach flee towards the shore but one of they rudder break the man belong to that ship escape in they boat and coello immediately take possession expect to find it laden with rich commodity nothing be find however except cocoa-nut and a kind of sugar call _ melasus _ which be prepare from palm or date tree he also find on board many bow and arrow sword spear and target the other seven ship be run aground so that we ship could not get near they as draw too much water but we people follow in they boat and drive they out of they vessel by firing upon they with they ordnance next day while we fleet be at anchor seven man come off from the land in a almadium who report that these eight ship have be send by the zamorin from calicut to capture we fleet as they have be inform by some of the fugitive -lrb- 64 -rrb- from this place the general remove to the island of _ ansandina _ at a short distance where he be tell he might procure good water this island be very small and only a league from the continent it contain several wood and two cistern or conduit build of freestone one of which be six foot deep supply with excellent water from certain spring and the sea around have great quantity of fish before the moor trade with indium this island be well inhabit by the native idolater have many goodly building and especially some fine pagoda but when the moor resort to this coast from the red sea they use to take in they wood and water at this place and abuse the inhabitant so intolerably that they abandon the place and pull down most of they pagoda and all they other building these gentile be native of that part of the continent which belong to the king of _ narsinga _ and use often to repair thither to perform they devotions to three black stone which be in a chapel of one of the pagoda which still remain this island be call _ ansandina _ -lrb- 65 -rrb- in the malabar language which signify the five island and be so name because there be other four island round about come to anchor here the general send coello on shore with a armed escort to examine the country and to see if there be any convenient place for new-grave they ship bottom as they have be long at sea and have a long run before they every thing be find convenient and the measure approve of by all the captain it be determine to lay they ship successively aground for this purpose the ship call the berrio be first lay on shore and while occupy in repair and clean she bottom many of the native come off from the continent to sell victuals to we people while this be go forwards two small brigandine be see rowing towards we ship ornament with flag and streamer on they mast beat drum and sound trumpet and fill with man who ply they oar at the same time five similar vessel be see creep along shore as if lie by to help the other if needful the malabar who supply we people with provision warn the general to beware of these vessel which belong to pirate who roam about in these sea rob all they meet under pretence of peace -lrb- 66 -rrb- the general believe he might have take these two vessel if he have allow they to come close up with he ship but do not choose to run any risk wherefore as soon as they come within gun-shot he order all the cannon belong to the two ship which remain afloat to be fire at they on which call out in a loud voice _ tambarane tambarane _ which be they name for god they flee away nicholas coello who be in he boat follow after they firing off he ordnance but the general fearful of any mischance call he back by signal next day when the general and all he man be on shore at work upon the berrio twelve native who appear to be man of some consequence come to the island in two small _ parao _ and present a bundle of sugar cane these people ask permission to go on board the ship as they have never see any such before but the general be much offend with this fear they might be spy while engage in conversation with these man other two _ parao _ make they appearance have as many man but those who come first see the general displeased advise these new comer not to land when the berrio be repair the general ship be bring aground to receive the same attention while the general and the other captain be on shore busy in the repair of the san michael there come one day a man in a little _ parao _ seemingly about forty year old and not of that country as he be dress in a _ sabaco _ or gown of fine cotton reach to he heel he head cover with a kerchief or towel which partly cover he face and wear a faulchion or crooked cymeter at he girdle immediately on landing he go up and embrace the general as if he have see or know he before and treat the other captain with the same politeness he tell they he be a christian bear in italy and have be bring when a child into the indy that he now dwell with a moorish lord name _ sabayo _ who rule a certain island call goa about twelve league from thence and who have 40000 horseman on that island that as he dwelling be now among the moor he conform externally to they worship though in he heart a christian that learn certain man have come in ship to calicut such as have never be see before in the indy and that no one understand they language he immediately understand that they must be _ frangne _ -lrb- 67 -rrb- for so the christian be name in the indy that he be desirous of see they and have ask leave of _ sabayo _ to come and visit they which if he have not obtain he would have die of vexation that sabayo have not only grant he leave for this purpose but desire if he find the stranger to be from he country to offer they any thing they might stand in need of which he country produce particularly spice and provision and besides if they would come and live with he sabayo would entertain they honourably and give they sufficient to live on the general ask many question concern the country of sabayo and other thing to which he make answer after which he request to have a cheese from the general to send on shore to a companion as a token of have be well receive the general suspect some mystery in this man yet order a cheese and two new loaf to be give he which he send away to he companion he continue talk with great volubility and sometimes so unguardedly as to raise suspicion of he be a spy on this paulo de la gama who particularly suspect he inquire of some of the native if they know who this man be they immediately tell he he be a pirate who have board many other ship while lay aground on receive this information the general order he to be carry on board he ship then aground and to be whip well till he should confess whether all that he have say be true or false also what be he purpose in come thither and whether he be actually a moor or a christian he still insist that he be a christian and that all he say be true declare the information give by the native to be entirely groundless the general now order a more cruel torment to be inflict to extort confession cause he to be hoist up and down by the member : when at length he declare he would tell the truth he then acknowledge himself a spy send to discover how many man the general have and what be they weapon as he be much hate on all that coast for be a christian and that many _ atalaya _ or foist be place in all the bay and creek of the coast to assail he but dare not till they be join by forty large armed vessel that be get ready to fall upon he but he say he know not certainly when these vessel might be ready the general now order he to be confine under hatch intend to carry he into portugal as a fit person to give the king he master intelligence respect the indy and order he to get refreshing victuals and that he cure should be look well after on receive this information of the design of he enemy the general would stay no longer than be necessary for complete the repair of he own ship which be get ready in ten day about this time the general be offer 1000 _ fanon _ for the ship which have be take by coello but he refuse to sell any thing to he enemy and order she to be burn when the general ship be ready and the fleet have take in a supply of water they depart from the island of _ ansandina _ or anchediva on the 5th of October 1498 steer directly out to sea on they course for melinda after sail about 200 league from that island the moor -lrb- 68 -rrb- whom they have take prisoner see no prospect of escape now make a full and true confession he acknowledge that he live with sabayo the lord of goa to whom word be bring that the general be wander about in those sea like one who know not where he be upon which order be give to fit out a powerful fleet to make he prisoner in the mean time learn that the general be at the isle of anchediva sabayo command he to go thither to visit he to get intelligence of he strength and intention and to endeavor to entice he to goa where it be sabayos intention to make he and all he people prisoner and to employ they in he war against the neighbouring prince as they be report to be valiant man after this confession the general give this man better treatment allow he both clothes and money some time afterwards he become a christian by the name of gaspar de la gama take he name of gaspar from one of the three king of the magus -lrb- 69 -rrb- and he surname from the general who stand god-father at he baptism the general pursued he course for melinda where he propose to take on board a ambassador from the xeque of that place in the early part of this voyage he endure severe storm and contrary wind which be succeed by calm during which the heat of the sun be quite insufferable and the voyage much delay insomuch that water begin to grow scarce and the people have to be put on short allowance owe to these circumstance the people be afflict with the same disease in they gum from which they have formerly suffer such great distress in the river of good sign -lrb- 70 -rrb- on the outward voyage they arm and leg also swell and many tumor break out over they body proceed from a pestilent stink humor which throw they into a flux of which thirty person die from the continuance of calm and contrary wind and the mortality among the people the whole company become amaze and believe they should never be able to get out from they present distressing situation insomuch that they solicit the general to return to calicut or some other part of indium and submit to what god might appoint rather than to die on the sea of these terrible disease for which there be no remedy especially as both provision and water begin to fail de gama reason with they to little purpose as they have be now four month at sea and there hardly remain sixteen person in each ship able to do duty some of whom even be afflict with the disease of which the other have die it be even say that paulo de la gama and nicholas coello have agree to return to india if any wind should spring up that would have serve for the voyage at length a favourable wind spring up unexpectedly and in sixteen day they come in sight of land on Wednesday the 2d of February 1499 at which the mariner be much rejoice and soon forget all they past trouble and danger as they come near the land towards evening the general give order to keep they head out to sea during the night to avoid rock or shoal as there be no person on board who know where they be a moor allege they have steer direct for mozambique say there be certain island 300 league from the shore and directly over against that place where the native be continually subject to the disease which have be so fatal to we man when morning come they stand towards the land when they come before a large and goodly city surround with wall have fair and lofty house and a large palace on a height in the middle of the city seem to be a magnificent building this city be call magadoxo and stand on one side of the gulf of indium on the coast of ethiopium -lrb- 71 -rrb- a hundred and thirteen league from melinda the situation of which i shall explain hereafter know this to be a city of the moor he would not stop at this place but command many shot of ordnance to be fire as he sail past not be sure how far it be to melinda and fear to overshoot that port he lay too every night and on Saturday the 5th of February lie over against a village of the moor name pate -lrb- 72 -rrb- 103 league from magadoxo there come off eight _ terrada _ or boat of that country fill with soldier and make direct for we fleet from whence we shoot off so many piece of ordnance that they soon flee back to the shore and we people could not follow for want of wind next Monday be the 7th of February the fleet arrive at melinda the king immediately send off he congratulation to the general on he arrival with a present of fresh provision de gama send fernan martinez on shore to return the compliment of the king to whom he send a present on account of the great number of sick on

this place he depart on the morning of Wednesday the 17th of February take with he a ambassador from the king of melinda to negotiate a treaty of perpetual peace and friendship with the king of portugal consider that there be not sufficient man remain for navigate all the ship the general and the other captain agree to burn one of they and the san rafael be choose to be sacrifice because she be all open and have not be bring aground at anchediva when the other two be repair accordingly after take out all she store and merchandize which employ they during five day she be burn at certain shoal call the shoal of st raphael -lrb- 73 -rrb- during these five day the fleet procure a considerable quantity of hen from a village on the coast call _ tangata _ leave this place the two remain ship come on the 20th February to the island of zenziber which be in six degree of s latitude at ten league distance from the continent this be a considerable island have other two in its neighborhood one call _ pemba _ and the other _ moyfa _ these island be very fertile have abundance of provision and great quantity of orange the inhabitant be moor who be by no means warlike and have few weapon but be well clothe in silk and cotton vestment which they purchase at mombaza from the merchant of cambaya the woman be ornament with jewel of gold and silver the former be procure at sofalum and the latter from the island of st lawrence or madagascar each of these three island have a separate king who with all they subject be of the mahometan religion when the king of the island of zenziber be inform of the arrival of we ship he send immediately to compliment the general accompany with great present of the fruit and other production of the country and request he friendship to which the general gladly agree and send suitable answer after remain here eight day for refreshment the general depart on the 1st of march and come to anchor beside the isle of st george in the bay of mozambique next day he cause a mark to be erect on this island where he go on shore and hear mass and depart thence without any intercourse with the inhabitant of mozambique on the 3d of march he come to the island of st bla where the ship remain for some time to take in water and to provide a stock of sea wolf and _ solitario _ which be salt to serve as provision for the remainder of the voyage and for which they be most thankful to god depart from thence they be drive back by a westerly wind right contrary but providence send they a fair wind by means of which they double the cape of good hope with infinite pleasure on the 20th of march all the remainder of the crew be now strong and in good health with the cheer prospect of speedily return to lisbon they now have a fair wind which last they twenty day and speed they on towards st jago the fair wind now fail they and delay they voyage try the lead on Thursday the 25th of April they find twenty-five fathom and the least water they have all that day be twenty fathom on which account the pilot conclude they be on the shoal of the rio grande of the rest of this voyage till the arrival of the general at the island of st jago i have find no account except that when approach that place nichola coello part company one night with the general and make direct for portugal that he might carry the first intelligence to the king of the discovery of indium and arrive at _ cascai _ on the 10th of July 1499 -lrb- 74 -rrb- he go immediately to the king whom he inform of all that have befall the general in he discovery of the indy and of the commodity which have be bring from thence of which discovery and of the prospect which it hold out of a direct trade with indium by sea the king be as glad as when he have be proclaimed king of portugal after the separation of coello de gama pursue he voyage for the island of st jago both because he brother paulo be sick with consumptive complaint and because he ship be in very bad condition all she seam be open at that island he freight a caravel in hope of be able to get he brother home to portugal and leave john de sala in charge of he own ship to have she repair and new rig before proceed for lisbon the general and he brother leave st jago in the hire caravel for lisbon but the disease of paulo de gama increase so rapidly that he be force to put in at the island of tercera where paulo de gama depart this life like a good christian and a worthy gentleman when he have bury he brother vasco de gama set sail for portugal and arrive at belem in September 1499 have be two year and two month absent on this voyage of 108 man whom he have take with he only fifty -lrb- 75 -rrb- come home alive which be a large proportion consider the great and numerous danger they have go through when the general have return thanks to god for he preservation and success he send notice of he arrival to the king who send diego de sylva y menesis lord of portugalete and many other gentleman to conduct he honourably to court which they do through a prodigious concourse of people eager to see the man who have make so wonderful a voyage and whom they have long think dead be come into the presence the king honor he as one who by the discovery of the indy have do so much for the glory of god for the honor and profit of the king of portugal and for the perpetual fame of the portuguese name in the world the king make he afterwards a knight and give he and he heir permission to bear the royal arm of portugal as also to set at the foot of the escutcheon two do which be call gama in the portuguese language he also give he a perpetual pension or rent-charge of 300000 ree -lrb- 76 -rrb- yearly out of the tythe fish in the village of _ sini _ in which he be bear and a promise of be make lord of that village and till these grant be execute in form he allow he 1000 crown a-year which after the royal grant be make revert to the house of the _ contratation _ of the indy it be also grant that when the trade with indium should be establish he might bring home spice to the value of 200 ducat yearly without pay any duty he also give he other possession and rent and a note of remembrance or promise to make he a lord -lrb- 77 -rrb- nichola coello be promote to be a gentleman of the royal household and receive possession and rent to bear he charge -lrb- 78 -rrb- the king himself in consequence of these discovery assume the new title of _ lord of the conquest and navigation of ethiopium arabium persium and the indy _ -lrb- 1 -rrb- by mr clarke this person be name gonalo nunez -lrb- 2 -rrb- mr clarke allege that lichefield we original translator have fall into a error in this date which ought to have be the 28th July -- e -lrb- 3 -rrb- if Saturday be the 5th July on which the fleet sail from lisbon the 3d of August must have be on Thursday but it do not seem necessary to insist upon such minute critical accuracy which besides be unattainable -- e -lrb- 4 -rrb- this strange expression probably mean that gama stretch directly across the gulf of guinea not creep as usual along the coast and endeavor to make a direct course for the cape of good hope -- e -lrb- 5 -rrb- we old english translator lichefield strangely mistake in call this place the _ island _ of sanctum haelena which be assuredly st elena bay in lat 32  40 ' s it have since be sometimes name st martin 's bay but the proper and general name be the bay of st elena the s w point of entry be call st martin 's point -- e -lrb- 6 -rrb- perhaps the berg river at the bottom of st elena bay -- e -lrb- 7 -rrb- this paragraph be add to relation of castenada from the work of farium and osorius -- clarke -lrb- 8 -rrb- if the Thursday on which they come in sight of the cape be the 16th the Wednesday follow must have be the 22nd of the month -- e -lrb- 9 -rrb- this paragraph be a addition to the text of castaneda from osorius -- clarke i 342 -lrb- 10 -rrb- from the circumstance in the text this watering-place of st blaze be probably what be now call st katherine or st sebastian bay yet that place hardly exceed forty-seven portuguese league east from the cape the sixty league of the text would carry we almost a degree farther east to what be now call kaffercroyt river clarke remove this place still farther to flesh bay otherwise call angra de st braz or aguada de st braz by de barros this latter place be seventy portuguese league or above eighty marine league east from the cape -- e -lrb- 11 -rrb- this account seem erroneous whether st katherine or flesh bay be the one in question as both ought to be safe in north wind and the wind between the s and e point give both a lee shore -- e -lrb- 12 -rrb- probably a species of penguin : lichefield call they _ stare _ as large as duck osorius say the native call they _ satiliario _ and that they be as big as goose -- e -lrb- 13 -rrb- probably rock point form the western boundary of algoa or zwartkop bay in long 27  e bring the rocky extreme promontory of the krakakamma ridge -- e -lrb- 14 -rrb- it be infinitely difficult to guess the course of these early voyage without latitudes or longitude and only estimate distance by dead reckoning in uncertain league but the rio del infante of this voyage and that of diaz be probably that now call great-fish river in the zuureveld of graaff reynet in long 28  20 ' e which however be twenty-six portuguese league or thirty geographical league from rocky point instead of the fifteen league of the text -- e -lrb- 15 -rrb- the sixty league in the text be inexplicable on any rational supposition as they seem to have again make the rock de la cruz or rather rocky point say just before to be only fifteen league from infante river to which they be then bind -- e -lrb- 16 -rrb- the portuguese ship appear to have be now on the coast of natal or the land of the caffre certainly a more civilized people than the hottentot of the cape but the circumstance of alonzo understand they language be quite inexplicable : as he could hardly have be lower on the western coast than minz or perhaps congo yet as a belt of caffre be say to cross the continent of africa to the north of the hottentot it be barely possible that some caffre slave may have reach the western coast -- e -lrb- 17 -rrb- this grain be probably what be now well know under the name of millet -- e -lrb- 18 -rrb- accord to barro _ aguada da boa paz _ -- clarke -lrb- 19 -rrb- gibb 's orosius i 50 -lrb- 20 -rrb- the text here ought probably to be thus amend he and he brother _ with _ nichola coelle & c -- e -lrb- 21 -rrb- these probably swim off to the ship -- e -lrb- 22 -rrb- de faria allege that the people of this river be not so black as the other african and wear habit of different kind of stuff both cotton and silk of various color and that they understand arabic and add that they inform de gama there be white people to the eastward who sail in ship like those of the portuguese osorius likewise say that one of the native speak arabic very imperfectly and that de gama leave two of he convict at this place which he call san rafael -- clarke -lrb- 23 -rrb- there be no circumstance in the text from which the situation of this river can even be conjecture clarke p440 allege that it be soffala and yet in a note in he precede page say that de gama seem to have pass cape coriente during the night and to have keep so far from land on account of a strong current setting on shore as not to have notice sofalum in the note on the lusiad this river of good sign be ascertain to have be one of the mouth of the zambeze or cuama river which divide mocaranga from the coast of mozambique the different mouth of which run into the sea between the latitudes of 19  and 18  s -- e -lrb- 24 -rrb- they be evidently afflict with the scurvy and accordingly de barros refer the disease to its proper cause have be for so long a time confine to the use of salt fish and corrupted biscuit -- clarke -lrb- 25 -rrb- addition to the narrative of castaneda from de barros -- clarke -lrb- 26 -rrb- this obscure expression seem to mean that de gama wish they to precede the ship and point out the way into the harbor -- e -lrb- 27 -rrb- this expression have probably be misunderstand by the original translator it appear that these moor of mozambique speak arabic here call the language of algarve and finding themselves understand and answer by the stranger mistake the portuguese for moor -- e -lrb- 28 -rrb- mozambique be in lat 15  35 ' s and in 41  of e long -- e -lrb- 29 -rrb- the observation here insert and mark with inverted comma be make by the editor of the present collection they be much too long for insertion in the form of a note and appear of too much importance to be omit be chiefly from clarke i 447 -- e -lrb- 30 -rrb- for the material of this addition to the text of castaneda we be chiefly indebted to the progress of maritime discovery p 447 458 -- e -lrb- 31 -rrb- he name as give by osorius be _ zacocium _ and de barro add that he wear richly embroidered clothes and have he sword ornament with diamond -- clarke -lrb- 32 -rrb- this be probably the same person name fernan alvare on a former occasion -- e -lrb- 33 -rrb- it be add by de barros that three _ abexij _ or abyssinian from the territory of _ preste joano _ come on board the fleet along with the moor who bring provision and see the image of the angel gabriel paint on the ship of that name and be accustom to such representation of angel in they own country they make they adoration to this holy picture -- clarke -lrb- 34 -rrb- mr clarke progr of marit disc i 464 strangely misrepresent this story say that _ the pilot _ of paulo de la gama have desert to the moor though a christian -- e -lrb- 35 -rrb- accord to de burros after the inhabitant abandon the town the zeque send de gama a pilot to navigate coello 's ship from whom de gama learn that calicut be a month voyage from mozambique -- clarke i 464 -lrb- 36 -rrb- if Sunday as above be the first of April the Friday follow must have be the 6th -- e -lrb- 37 -rrb- the text be here obscure but it would appear that only some of the man belong to these two boat remain on board and the rest return to the coast not that the moorish pilot from mozambique be here dismiss as the text of lichefild 's translation seem to insinuate -- e -lrb- 38 -rrb- motta in the portuguese east indian pilot place this town in lat 3 50 's he say the entrance be much incommode with shoal and so narrow in some place as not to exceed the length of a ship this city be say to have once stand on a peninsula convert into a island by cut a canal across the isthmus -- clarke i 469 -lrb- 39 -rrb- this may be understand that part of the inhabitant be unmixed arab comparatively whites while other be of a mixed race between these and the original native perhaps likewise partly east indian mahometan of a similar origin -- e -lrb- 40 -rrb- this be surely a oversight in castaneda or he translator for _ one _ year -- e -lrb- 41 -rrb- it be difficult to ascertain what place in indium be here mean cranganore come nearer in sound but be rather nearer melinda than calicut mangalore be rather more distant the former a degree to the south of calicut the latter not quite two to the north all three on the malabar coast on a former occasion castaneda say these merchant be of cambaya or guzerat above eleven degree north of calicut -- e -lrb- 42 -rrb- this seem to be the same office with that name kadhus or khazus by the turk and persian which be rather the title of a judge than of a priest which be name moulah -- e -lrb- 43 -rrb- it be probable that this passage should be thus understand the king send he a pilot who be a idolater from guzerate & c -- e -lrb- 44 -rrb- the addition to or observation on the text insert in this place within inverted comma be from clarke i 486 487 -- e -lrb- 45 -rrb- in lichefild 's translation this date be make the 22d but the Friday after Sunday the 21st must have be the 26th of the month -- e -lrb- 46 -rrb- the difference of longitude between melinda and calicut be thirty - four degree which at 17-1\/2 league to the degree give only 575 portuguese league or 680 geographical league of twenty to the degree thus miserably erroneous be the estimate distance in old navigator who could only compute by the dead reckoning or the log -- e -lrb- 47 -rrb- the course from melinda to calicut be about e n e the former be about three degree to the s and the latter almost eleven degree to the n of the line -- e -lrb- 48 -rrb- this vague account of the extent of malabar be erroneous or corrupt as sixty-one portuguese league would barely reach from cape comorin to calicut the extreme length of the western maritime vale of indium from cambay to cape comorin exceed 250 portuguese league -- e -lrb- 49 -rrb- the proper name of this prince who be say to have thus divide the

during all this period he refuse all sustenance cabral take compassion on he and send he to the zamorin request that two of we man who remain on shore might be send on board which be comply with after wait three day without any message from the zamorin the general send one francisco correa to inquire if he incline to confirm the agreement between they in which case he would send aries correa on shore to treat with he highness for whose safety he require hostage the zamorin answer that he be perfectly willing to have the trade establish and that the general might send aries correa or any other person on shore for that purpose and transmit two grandson of a rich merchant of guzerate as hostage aries correa go accordingly on shore and be accommodate by the order of the zamorin with a convenient house for himself and he goods which belong to the guzerate merchant who be likewise command to assist correa in regard to the price of he merchandize and all other thing relate to the trade and custom of the place but this man be a friend to the moor of mecca thwart he in all thing instead of give he assistance the moor be determine enemy to we people both for be christian and lest they credit and advantageous traffic in calicut might suffer by the establishment of we trade in that port wherefore by means of they confederacy with the guzerate merchant they take we goods at any price they please and intimidate the malabar from trading with we the moor conclude that the establishment of we factory would lower the price of such commodity as they have to sell and would inhance the value of the spicery drug and jewel which they take in exchange on this account they thwart correa in all he transaction offer higher price than ordinary for every article by which he be constrain to buy every thing at a very dear rate if at any time he wish a audience of the zamorin the moor always contrived to be present that some of they might speak against he in this conduct they be assist by _ samicide _ -lrb- 20 -rrb- a moor who be admiral of calicut who likewise hinder any of we people of the factory from go on board the fleet and detain any of we boat that approach the shore pretend to do this by command of the zamorin on learn this sinister conduct of the moorish admiral of calicut and suspect some intended treachery the general give order to the fleet to weigh they anchor and to remove out of the harbor lest they might be attack by the zamorin fleet and that he might take counsel with the other captain for the safety of the expedition on learn this the zamorin inquire the reason from correa who urge the injurious behavior of the moor and tell he all that they have do the zamorin immediately give order that the moor should discontinue they villanous conduct towards we and even remove the guzerate merchant from we factory appoint one _ cosebequin _ -lrb- 21 -rrb- in he place who though a moor be a very honest man and behave to we in a friendly manner this man be of great credit in calicut be the head of all the native moor of that country who be always at variance with the moor of cairo and of the red sea of whom the admiral samicide be the chief the zamorin give farther order that we factory should be remove to a house close to the shore which belong to cosebequin that we merchant might have greater freedom to buy and sell without any interruption from the moor for the greater security a deed of gift be make of this house by the zamorin to the king of portugal and he successor for ever a copy of which sign and seal by the zamorin be enclose in a casket of gold that it might be convey to portugal and permission be give to display a flag of the royal arm of portugal from the top of the factory -lrb- 22 -rrb- on receive intelligence of these favourable measure cabral bring back the fleet into the harbor of calicut and send he compliment of thanks to the zamorin for he gracious and favourable disposition after this we factory have tolerably good fortune in conduct its trade by the assistance of cosebequin : and the native find we factory favor by the zamorin behave so very civilly to we people that they could go about wherever they please with as much freedom and safety as in lisbon during the subsistence of this friendly intercourse a large moorish ship be descry from calicut on its voyage from cochin for cambaya and the zamorin request we general to make prize of the ship allege that it contain a peculiarly fine elephant which he wish to possess and which have be refuse to he although he have offer more than its value the general answer that he would do this willingly to gratify he highness but as he be inform the ship be large and well man both with mariner and soldier it could not be expect to surrender without resistance in which some man might be slay on both side and it be therefore necessary he should have the sanction of he highness to kill these people in case of resistance which be accordingly grant upon which the general send pedro de tayde in he caravel accompany by a valiant young gentleman name duarte or edward pacheco and by sixty fight man with order to take this ship along with they the zamorin send certain moor that they might witness the manner of fight use by the portuguese the caravel give chase to the moorish ship till night and then lose sight of she but in sailing along shore by moon-light they see she ride at anchor ready for defense judge she to be about 600 ton burthen and to contain 300 fight man pacheco accord to he order do not think proper to lay the moorish ship on board but command he ship to be bring to intend to sink the moorish ship by means of he ordnance in case of necessity the moor make light of we small force which they greet with loud cry and the sound of musical instrument after which they play they ordnance against we caravel they be bravely answer by we man and one of we ball strike they between wind and water so that the moorish ship take in much water and many of they man be kill and wound by we shot they bear away for the bay of cananor which be very near and come there to anchor beside other four moorish ship pacheco follow they and continue to batter they with he gun and have assuredly take they have not certain _ paroa _ belong to the moor come from the port of cananor to they assistance the night grow very dark pacheco quit the bay lest he caravel might be set on fire by the moor and come to anchor close to a island at a short distance have have nine of he man wound by arrow during the engagement next morning pacheco again attack the moorish ship which at last yield to the great displeasure of the native of cananor who have flock to the seaside intend to have succour the moor but on pacheco send a few shot among they they all disperse pacheco come next day to calicut with he prize where the zamorin come down to the water side to see the moorish ship give great praise to we people for they prowess be much astonished that so great a ship should be take by one so much inferior in size and number of man the general command this ship to be deliver to the zamorin together with the seven elephant that be on board which be worth in calicut 30000 crown he also send a message to the zamorin say that he need not be astonish at this action as he would perform much greater action to serve he highness the zamorin return thanks for what have be do and desire the brave man who have perform this gallant action to be send he that he might do they honor and reward they as they deserve and he bestow large present upon pacheco in particular some affirm that the performance of this gallant feat by so small a number of we man against such great odds raise fear and jealousy of the portuguese in the mind of the zamorin and make he anxious to get they away from he country for which cause he give he consent to the treachery which be use against they as i mean to shew in the sequel -lrb- 23 -rrb- the moor of calicut be more terrify than ever at the portuguese in consequence of the capture of this ship and be much offend by the favor bestow by the zamorin upon we man for they gallantry on this occasion they believe that all this be do out of revenge against themselves for the injury they have do we and be intend to induce they to retire from calicut especially as we people bring there as great store of merchandize as they do and buy as many spice take all this into consideration they procure a audience of the zamorin to whom one of they number make the follow oration in the name of all the moor _ emparather -lrb- 24 -rrb- _ of all the malabar as great as the mightiest sovereign of the indy and most powerful among the prince of the earth we be astonish that you should debase yourself by receive into you country these enemy of you law and stranger to the custom of you kingdom who seem pirate rather than merchant we should not wonder at you so do be you city in want of the commodity they bring or could not otherwise dispose of the spicery they purchase : but we whom you have long know and whose fidelity you be well assure of by experience have always do both to the great increase of you revenue you appear to forget all this by receive those whom you do not know into you favor and employ they to revenge you injury as if you own numerous and faithful subject be incompetent for the purpose in this you dishonor yourself and embolden these stranger to hold you power in contempt and to act as we know they will hereafter by rob and plunder all merchant ship that frequent you port to the ruin of you country and who will at length take possession of you city this be the true intent of they come into these sea and not to trade for spice as they pretend they country be almost 5000 league from hence and the voyage out and home be attend by many danger through unknown and stormy sea besides the great cost of they large ship with so many man and gun hence at whatever price they may dispose of they spice in portugal it be obvious such a trade must be carry on with great loss which be a manifest proof that they be pirate and not merchant who come here to rob and to take you city the house you have give they for a factory they will convert into a fort from whence they will make war on you when you least expect it all this we say more from the good will we owe you than for any profit for if you do not listen to we advice there be other city in malabar to which we will remove and to which the spice will be convey for we to this harangue the zamorin give a favourable answer say that he would give attention to all they have say of which indeed he already have some suspicion that he have employ the portuguese to seize the ship to try they courage and have allow they to load they ship that the money they have bring to purchase goods might remain in the country and finally that he would not forsake they in favor of the stranger the moor be by no means satisfy with all this because the zamorin do not order we to depart from calicut and do not stop we trade which be they chief purpose though disappoint in these view they continue to intermiddle in we affair particularly by buy up the spice and send they elsewhere in hope of irritating we people and bring on a quarrel that they might have a pretext to attack we this they be much inclined to bring about as be greatly more numerous than we man they hope the zamorin would take part with they against we they likewise use all possible means to draw over the common people of calicut to they side and to excite they to enmity against we by make they believe that we people have injure they through those device we factor be unable to procure more spice than suffice to load two ship in the course of three month from which the general be convince that the friendly assurance of the zamorin be little to be depend on and if he have not be afraid of not be able to procure a sufficient supply elsewhere he would have go to another port : but have already consume a long time and be at heavy charge he determine to remain at calicut and send a message to the zamorin complain of the delay which ill accord with the promise of he highness that the whole fleet should be load in twenty day whereas three month be now elapse and the loading of two ship only be procure he urge the zamorin promise that the portuguese ship be to be first loaded whereas he have assure information that the moor have buy up great quantity of spice at lower price and send they to other place and beg the zamorin to consider that it be now time for the ship to begin they voyage to portugal and that he anxiously wish for dispatch on receive this message the zamorin pretend to be much surprised that we ship be still unprovided with a loading and could not believe that the moor have secretly buy up and remove the spice contrary to he order and even give permission to the general to take those ship belong to the moor which be laden with spice pay the same price for the spice which have be give by the moor this intelligence give much satisfaction to the moor as a favourable opportunity for draw on hostility with the portuguese and accordingly one of the principal moorish merchant begin immediately to load he ship : openly with all kind of drug and spice and suborn several moor and indian who pretend to be the friend of we factor to insinuate that he would never be able to find a sufficient load for we fleet if he do not seize that ship correa listen to this insidious advice which he communicate to the general urge he to take that moorish ship as he have license from the zamorin to that effect the general be exceedingly unwilling to proceed to this extremity afraid of the influence of the moor with the zamorin and of produce hostility with the native but correa remonstrate against delay protest that the general should be responsible for all loss that might accrue to the king of portugal through he neglect over-persuaded by this urgency of the factor the general send all the boat of the squadron on the 17th of December to take possession of the moorish ship when this intelligence be receive on shore the moor think this a favourable opportunity of destroy we people and immediately raise a great outcry against the portuguese incense the people of the city to join with they in complain to the zamorin to whom they go in a tumultuous manner represent that we have buy and ship a much larger quantity of drug and spice than the value of all we merchandize and not contented with this be for take all like thief and pirate they blame the zamorin for permit we to trade in the city and request he license to revenge themselves upon we for the loss of they vessel the faithless and inconstant king save they the license they require on which they immediately arm themselves and run furiously to we factory which be surround by a wall eight or ten foot high and contain at that time seventy portuguese among whom be fra henrique and he friar of we people in the factory only eight be arm with crossbow all the rest be only arm with sword with nothing to defend they but they cloak on hear the tumult we people go to the gate of the factory and see only a few assailant they think to defend themselves with they sword against a mischievous rabble but the number of the moor soon increase and gall we people so severely with they spear and arrow that they be force to shut the gate after kill seven of the enemy hope to be able to defend themselves by means of the wall in this conflict four of we man be slay and several wound and all the remainder mount the wall to defend it by means of the crossbow judge that the assailant be at least four thousand man among whom be several nayre core now find himself unable to defend the factory against so great a force and therefore hoist a flag as signal to the fleet the general be at this time sick in bed have be just blood and be not therefore able to go in person to relieve the people in the factory but immediately send all the boat of the fleet well man under the command of sancho de toar but he be afraid to venture on land with so small a force against so great a multitude or even to approach too near the shore lest the enemy might assail he in they almadia and toni he lay off therefore at a considerable distance where he remain a spectator of the valiant defense make by we people at the factory whence they kill great number of the assailant but they enemy always increase in number and they at length bring up certain engine to beat down part of the wall in which they at length succeed on this we man issue out by a door which lead towards the sea side in hope of be able to fight they way to the boat in which attempt corea be slay and fifty more of we man be either kill or make prisoner twenty only escape who swim to the boat most of whom be much wound among these be fra henrique and antonio the son of aries corea then only eleven year old who have since do many noble feat of arm in the indy and other place as i shall afterwards declare in the _ fourth _ book of this history the general be much concern at this event not only for the loss of he man but on see how little confidence could be repose on the promise of the zamorin after all the present he have receive and the service which have be perform for he he have now spend three month at calicut during which he have only loaded two of he ship and know not how to procure load for the rest especially as he could not expect a favourable reception at cochin on account of have capture the ship with the elephant as before related consider the treason which have be practice on we man the general determine upon take a signal revenge if the zamorin do not make a ample excuse for what have take place and make a full reparation by immediately provide the rest of the ship with lade the zamorin however have no such intention be much pleased with what the moor have do and even order all the goods in we factory to be seize to the value of 4000 ducat he likewise order all of we people who have be take on shore to be make captive four of whom die of they wound see that no message or excuse be send by the zamorin all that day the general hold a council with he officer as to the proper step to be take on the present emergency when it be determine to take immediate and ample revenge without give time to the zamorin to arm he fleet on this order be issue to take possession of ten large ship which lay in the road or harbor of calicut which be do after some resistance many of they crew be kill or drown and other make prisoner who be reserve to serve as mariner on board we fleet some spice and other merchandize be take in these ship and three elephant which be kill and salt as provision for the voyage and it appear that 600 moor be slay in defend these ship after every thing of value be take from the moorish ship they be all burnt in sight of the city many of the moor embark in they almadia to attempt succour they ship but we man soon put they to flight by means of they ordnance the zamorin and the whole city of calicut be much mortified to see so many ship destroy and they unable to help but they astonishment and terror be much increase by the event of the ensue day during the night the general order all the ship of the fleet to be tow as near as possible to the shore by means of the boat and spread out at some distance from each other that they might be able to reach the city with they ordnance which as soon as day break be direct to play upon the city in every direction do vast damage among the house the native bring down to the shore such small piece of ordnance as they possess which they fire off against we but without be able to do we any injury whereas not a shot of ours miss take effect either among the multitude of we enemy which flock to the shore or on the building of the city both the house of the inhabitant and the temple of they deity receive incredible damage so great be the consternation that the zamorin flee from he palace and one of he chief nayre be kill by a ball close beside he part even of the palace be destroy by the cannonade towards afternoon two ship be see approach the harbor which immediately change they course on see how we

each fifty ship employ this country do not abound in provision but produce large store of pepper even calicut be mostly supply from hence : but as calicut be greatly more resort to by merchant it be therefore much richer than cochin the king be a idolater of the same manners and custom with he of calicut but he country be small he be very poor and have not even the right to coin money be in many respects subordinate to the zamorin who on he accession to the throne always go to cochin and take possession of that kingdom either retain it in he own hand or restore the rajah as he may think proper the rajah of cochin consequently be bind to assist the zamorin in all he war and must always be of the same religion with he paramount have come to anchor in the harbor of cochin the general

as they think proper he add that the general might freely send any agent he please on shore to make purchase and sale and send two principal nayre as hostage for they safety conditioning only that

collection as a ancient and original document : but on a attentive perusal it be so jejune contuse and uninstructive as not to merit attention it evidently appear to have be pen by some person in cabral 's ship during the voyage home from repeat conference with joseph : but as the writer of this article inform we himself many particulars be unknown to joseph because he have little intercourse

he own ship -lrb- 15 -rrb- leave stephen de gama in the command at cochin in he absence the captain of the fleet be much averse to this rashness yet could not persuade he to take a larger force as he say he would be sufficiently protect by the squadron of vincente sodre which be cruize on the coast whom he could join on any emergency on he arrival at calicut the zamorin immediately send notice that he would satisfy he next day for all the goods which have be take from cabral and would afterwards renew the trade and settle the factory on a proper footing but as soon as he understand that the admiral have come with so small a force he command thirty-four paraw to be get in readiness with all expedition for the purpose of take he ship and so unexpectedly do these assail he that the admiral be force to cut one of he cable and make out to seaward which he be fortunately enable to do as the wind come off from the land yet the paraw pursue he so closely that he must infallibly have be take if it have not be for the squadron of sodre make its appearance on sight of which the paraw give over the chase and retire to calicut on he return to cochin die admiral immediately order the messenger of the zamorin to be hang -lrb- 16 -rrb- the failure of this treacherous attempt against de gama give much concern to the zamorin who now resolve to try if he could induce the rajah of cochin to refuse a load to the portuguese and to send away they factory from he port with this view he transmit a letter to that prince in the follow term : i be inform that you favor the christian whom you

be much offend by this answer of the rajah of cochin to whom he write a second time advise he earnestly to abandon the portuguese if he have any respect for he own welfare the rajah of cochin be not to be move either by the persuasion or threaten of the zamorin and send a reply to he second letter in which he declare he should never be induce to commit a base or treacherous action by fear of the consequence and be resolve to persist in maintain he treaty of trade and amity with the portuguese finding that he could not prevail on the rajah of cochin to concur with he he command twenty-nine large ship to be fit out in order to assail the portuguese fleet when on its return homewards expect that he should be able to destroy they with more ease when fully laden the rajah of cochin give no intimation to the admiral of the letter and message which have be interchange between he and the zamorin until he go to take leave at which time he declare he would hazard the loss of he dominion to serve the king of portugal the admiral after many expression of gratitude for he friendly disposition and honorable regard for he engagement assure he that the king he master would never forget the numerous demonstration he have give of friendship and would give he such assistance as should not only enable he to defend he own dominion but to reduce other country under he authority he desire he not to be in fear of the zamorin against whom there should henceforwards be carry on so fierce war that he would have enough of employment in defend himself instead of be able to attack other in this the general allude to the aid which the rajah might expect from the ship that be to remain in indium under the command of vincent sodre all this conversation take place in presence of many of the principal nayre of which circumstance the rajah be much pleased as he know these people be in friendship with the moor and have oppose the grant of a factory to we at cochin -lrb- 17 -rrb- have

onset great number of the enemy be so dismayed that they leap into the sea to escape by swim on the come up of de gama with the rest of the fleet all the enemy ship make off as fast as they could towards the shore except those two which be beset at the first and be unable to escape which be accordingly take possession of de gama consider that all he ship be richly laden would not pursue the fly enemy be afraid he might lose some of he ship on the shoal but we man go in they boat and slew about 300 of the moor who have endeavor to save themselves by swim from the two capture ship these vessel be accordingly discharge of they cargo which consist of great quantity of rich merchandize among which be six great jar of fine earthen ware call porcelain which be very rare and costly and

and all that might be leave in the factory and bind himself to supply lading in spice to all the ship of the king of portugal at certain fixed price -lrb- 18 -rrb- in return for these favourable condition the admiral engage on behalf of the king of portugal to defend the rajah in all war that might arise from this agreement conditioning for peace and friendship between the raja of cochin and cananor and that the latter should give no aid to any one who might make war upon the former under the pain of forfeit the friendship of the portuguese after this the admiral give order to vincente sodre to protect the coast with he squadron till the month of February and if any war should break out or seem probable between the zamorin and trimumpara he be to winter in cochin for the protection of that city otherwise he be to sail for the strait of the red sea to make prize of all the ship belong to mecca that trade to the indy all these matter be properly arrange de gama depart from cananor for portugal on the 20th December 1502 -lrb- 19 -rrb- with thirteen ship richly laden three of which have take in they cargo at cananor and the other ten at cochin the whole fleet arrive in safety at

conquest if he be so inclined in reward for these brilliant service the king make he admiral of the indy and likewise give he the title of lord of videgueyra which be he own \* \* \* \* \* note -- as de gama do not return again to indium till the year 1524 which be beyond the period contain in that part of castaneda which have be translate by lichefild we shall have no occasion to notice he again in this part of we work for this reason it have be think proper to give the follow short supplementary account of he farther service in indium in 1524 don vasco de gama now count of videgueyra be appoint viceroy of indium by john iii king of portugal and sail from lisbon with fourteen ship carry 3000 fight man three be lose during the voyage with all the man belong to two of they while in the

he doublet be of crimson satin over which he armor be see inlay with gold he be the sixth successive governor of indium and the second who have the rank of viceroy -- astl i 54 b -lrb- 1 -rrb- accord to astley much difference of opinion take place in the council of portugal whether to continue the trade to indium for which it be requisite to employ force or to desist entirely from the attempt but the profit expect from the trade and the expectation of propagate the romish religion and enlarge the royal title outweigh all consideration of danger and it be resolve to persist in the enterprize -- astl i 50 -lrb- 2 -rrb- the distribution of this force be somewhat differently relate by astley ten ship only be say to have be place under the immediate command of vasco de gama five ship under vincente sodre who have order to scour the coast of cochin and cananor and to watch the mouth of the red sea on purpose to prevent the moor or turk and arab from trade to india the third as in the text be under stephen de gama but with no particular destination mention and the whole be under the supreme command of vasco de gama as captain - general -- astl i 50 -lrb- 3 -rrb- such be the expression in the translation by lichefild but which i suspect ought to have be and have pass cape coriente -- e in astley the follow incident be mention : when off cape verd vasco de gama meet a caravel bind from la mina on the western coast of africa carry much gold to lisbon he shew some of this to the ambassador whom cabral have bring from cananor and who be now on they return to indium they express much surprize at this circumstance as they have be tell by the venetian ambassador at lisbon that the portuguese could not send they ship to sea without assistance from venice this insinuation proceed from envy as the venetian be afraid of lose the lucrative trade with indium which they have long enjoy through egypt -- astl i 51 -lrb- 4 -rrb- accord to de faria de gama begin by cannonade the city of quiloa but on the king consent to become tributary all be change to peace and joy -- astl i 51 a -lrb- 5 -rrb- accord to astley de gama be force beyond melinda and take in water at a bay eight league farther on and go thence towards indium he spread out he fleet that no ship might escape he in consequence of which he take several but be most severe on those belong to calicut -- astl i 51 -lrb- 6 -rrb- in astley this ship be say to have belong to the soldan of egypt and be very richly laden besides be full of moor of quality who be go on pilgrimage to mecca -- astl i 51 -lrb- 7 -rrb- defarium say there be twenty of these child whom de gama cause to be make christian friar to make amends for one portuguese who turn mahometan -- astl i 51 c -lrb- 8 -rrb- castaneda or rather he translator lichefild get somewhat confuse here as if this factory be settle at cochin though the whole previous scene be describe as at cananor -- e -lrb- 9 -rrb- de faria say the body of these unfortunate malabar be throw into the sea to be carry on shore by the tide -- astl i 52 a -lrb- 10 -rrb- by the strait of mecca be here mean the strait of bab-el-mandeb or the entrance from the indian ocean into the red sea and by the coast of cambaya what be now call guzerat -- e -lrb- 11 -rrb- the rajah or king of cochin have already be name triumpara or trimumpara on the authority of de barros de faria and other ancient author yet de farium in other instance call he uniramacoul -- astl i 52 b -lrb- 12 -rrb- it be difficult to say what may have be mean by this last article in old french writings _ rouge comme sendal _ mean very high red or scarlet from which circumstance this may have be a piece of scarlet satin or velvet -- e -lrb- 13 -rrb- of the animal call bulgoldolf in the text we have no knowledge nor of this stone of wonderful virtue but it may possibly refer to the long famed bezoar anciently much prize but now deservedly neglect -- e -lrb- 14 -rrb- accord to de faria this messenger be a bramin who leave he son and nephew at cochin as hostage and accompany de gama to calicut where he carry various message between the zamorin and the admiral -- astl i 53 b

of castaneda de barros maffi and de faria relate that ambassador come to de gama while at cochin from the christian inhabitant in cranganore and that neighborhood who they say amount to 30000 they represent that they know he be a officer of the most catholic king in europe to whom they submit themselves in testimony of which they deliver into he hand the rod of justice of a red color tip with silver at both end and about the length of a sceptre have three bell at the top they complain of be much oppress by the idolater and be dismiss by de gama with promise of a powerful and speedy assistance -- astl i 53 d -lrb- 18 -rrb- de faria allege that the person who be appoint to settle matter relative to trade at this port differ much upon the price of spice : on which occasion many threatening message be send to the rajah who at length through fear comply with all the demand of the portuguese he say that the raja of cochin and cananor be as refractory and adverse at first as the zamorin and that when de gama arrive at cochin the three prince combine to make he winter there by fraud and join they fleet to destroy he that on the failure of this combination a durable peace be make with trimumpara and the rajah of cananor fear the portuguese might not return to he port send word to de gama that he be ready to comply with all he demand -- astl i 54 a -lrb- 19 -rrb- in castaneda this date be make 1503 but from a attentive consideration of other date and circumstance in that author this must have be a typographical error -- e section vi _ transaction of the portuguese in indium from the departure of de gama in December 1502 to the arrival of alonzo de albuquerque in 1503 _ as soon as the zamorin be assure of the departure of de gama for europe he determine on put he threat in execution against the rajah of cochin for which purpose he gather a army at the village of pananus not far from cochin -lrb- 1 -rrb- this be soon know to the inhabitant of cochin who be exceedingly afraid of the great power of the zamorin and be much dissatisfied with they sovereign for incur the displeasure of that prince out of respect to the christian whom they inveigh against with much bitterness on all occasion and openly insult wherever they be see some that be in high credit with the rajah say openly that as the zamorin be much more powerful than they state we man ought to be deliver up to he as the war be entirely on we account for whom the kingdom ought not to be put in hazard but the rajah much offend at these people declare that he be resolve to defend the portuguese against the zamorin trust that god would favor he in so just a cause yet many of he subject be much inclined to have seize the portuguese belong to the factory but dare not as the rajah give they a place of considerable strength to dwell in and appoint a guard for they security at this time vincente sodre arrive with he squadron in the bay of cochin after have do much damage on the coast of calicut both by land and sea the portuguese head factor send laurenzo moreno to inform sodre of the preparation which be make by the zamorin for the attack of cochin and require he in the name of the king of portugal to land with he man for its defense but sodre answer that he order be to defend the sea and not the land for which reason if the zamorin have prepare to attack cochin by sea he would certainly have defend it but as the war be to be carry on by land he could not interfere and the rajah must defend himself the factor send a second message entreat he in the name of god and on he allegiance to the king of portugal not to abandon the factory in this state of danger as the power of the rajah be inadequate to defend cochin against the zamorin and as the sole object of the war be for the destruction of the factory and the ruin of the portuguese trade it certainly be he duty as captain-general for the king of portugal in these sea both to defend the factory and to give every assistance in he power to the rajah but sodre be immoveable pretend that he have be order to discover the red sea where he expect to make many rich prize and set sail from cochin for cape guardafuus prefer the hope of riches to he duty in defend the factory of cochin the zamorin collect he army as already mention at the village of pananus where besides he own subject and ally several of the principal subject of the rajah of cochin join he standard desert they own sovereign and carry along with they all the power they be able to muster : among these be the caimall or governor of chirapipil and cambalane and of the large island which be opposite to the city of cochin at this place the zamorin make a long speech to he assemble chief in which he endeavor to justify he enmity to the portuguese whom he represent as thief robber and pirate and as have first commence hostility against he without cause he contrast the quiet and friendly conduct of the moor who have trade for 600 year with malabar have never do injury to any in all that time and have greatly enriched the country and have raise he city of calicut to be the greatest emporium in all the indy : whereas the portuguese have take and destroy he ship make he ambassador prisoner insist on have they ship laden before those belong to the moor have take a ship of the moor burnt ten of he ship in he own harbor have destroy he city and force he to escape for safety from he palace take law and vengeance for pretended grievance into they own hand instead of apply regularly to he for redress and since the rajah of cochin be fully inform of all these thing yet persist in favor the portuguese in despite of all remonstrance he have resolve to make war upon he to deprive he of he dominion and to drive these christian intruder out of indium this address give much satisfaction to all the assemble chief and most especially to the lord of repelim who entertain a rooted enmity against the rajah of cochin who have dispossess he of a island call arrnuul the only person who oppose the zamorin on this occasion be nambeadarin -lrb- 2 -rrb- who be brother and next heir to the zamorin he strongly urge the impolicy of drive the christian from malabar to which merchant resort from all place of the world see that the portuguese have make richer present to the zamorin than he have ever receive before and have bring much gold and silver into the country for the purchase of commodity which be not usually do by such as come to make war he represent the attempt of the hostage to escape who have be give for the safety of the portuguese chief and whom the zamorin be please to call ambassador as the first cause of jealousy and distrust yet they be afterwards reconcile and take the large moorish ship at the desire of the zamorin to whom they present the great elephant he say they conduct in trade and otherwise while in calicut be quite satisfactory to all except the moor who be envious against they for interfere in they trade and accuse they falsely of take pepper against the will of the owner which in fact they have do themselves to prevent the christian from load they ship nay that this be so evident that even the zamorin have license the portuguese to take the pepper from the moorish vessel after which the moor have rise against they slaying they man and seize all they goods yet after all these outrage they have give the zamorin a whole day in which to offer reparation and have not seek revenge of they injury treacherously like the moor that he see no cause of go to war against the rajah of cochin for receive the portuguese into he city like any other merchant who might frequent he harbor as have likewise be do by the raja of cananor and koulan who would not have do so if they have be robber and pirate and if the zamorin mean to drive the portuguese from the indy besides make war on cochin it would be necessary for he to do the same against canauor and all the other prince on the coast the zamorin be a good deal stagger by the discourse of nambendarin who have much credit and authority with he insomuch that it be think he would have desist from prosecute the war if it have not be for the moor and the caymal who represent that it would be a great disgrace to he character to recede after the assemblage of so great a army and that it be to be expect the rajah of cochin might now agree from fear to do what the zamorin have desire he the zamorin then desire he sorcerer to point out a fortunate day for march forward with he army which they do accordingly and promise he a assure victory with this assurance on which he place great reliance the zamorin depart from pananus and take possession of repelim which be four league from cochin the rajah of cochin have regular intelligence of all that pass in the camp of the zamorin by means of spy and be in great trouble respect the event not have sufficient force for he defense as many on whom he most rely have go over to the enemy even those who remain serve against they inclination more especially the inhabitant of cochin who abhor we people and say openly that it be proper the rajah should either deliver they up to the zamorin or send they away from cochin to avoid the impending war many of the inhabitant of cochin desert the place for fear of the consequence the member of the portuguese factory be much alarm by all these circumstance and request permission from the rajah to withdraw to cananor where they might remain in safety till the arrival of the next fleet from portugal hope by this mean to remove the cause of war and to satisfy the subject of the rajah trimumpara be displeased at this request as not repose sufficient confidence in he word and declare he would rather forfeit he kingdom and even he life than deliver they up to the zamorin or any other who seek to injure they and that although he might lose cochin in the war there still be place of sufficient strength in which to keep they safe till reinforcement should arrive from portugal that although the zamorin have a great army yet victory do not always follow number as a few valiant man be often victorious over great odds especially have justice on they side he therefore desire the factory to remain and to pray god to give he the victory the portuguese now offer to give he such aid as they small number would allow but he decline allow they to expose themselves to any danger on the present occasion as he credit depend upon the preservation of they life that they might witness for he faithful adherence to the treaty of amity which he have form with they nation upon this he place they under the safeguard of certain naire in whom he have confidence after this the rajah call all he noble into he presence together with the chief naire who be the cause of all the murmur against the portuguese and address the assemblage to the following effect : i be much concern to find that truth and loyalty should be want among man of you quality i do not wonder at the present misconduct of the lower order who be often constrain by they poverty and wretchedness to commit all manner of wickedness but that naire who have always be note for fidelity should desire I to forfeit the promise which i have make to the captain-general in behalf of the portuguese to defend they to the utmost of my power against all violence as my own subject astonish and distress I beyond measure under these assurance of protection which be give with you consent these man be leave in my city and yet because you see the zamorin come against I with more man than i have you would have I to break my promise be i so unjust you of all man ought to abhor I if you dwell with any sovereign on the assurance of he word how would you conceive of he if he be to treat you as you would now have I to act by these christian be it because you be afraid of the great power of the zamorin be assure it be better for we all to die in the discharge of we duty and the preservation of we promise than to live dishonoured to I no evil can be greater than to break my word nor can there be a greater dishonor to yourselve than to be the subject of a false and treacherous king these christian have bring much profit to I and my country and the zamorin might have keep they in he own city if he have permit they factory to settle there in peace be it he intention to drive the christian out of indium and to make war on all who receive they into they dominion he ought to have begin this war with the rajah of cananor : but he cause of war be the envy he have conceive at see I benefit by the trade which he have lose through he own misconduct and because he believe in he pride that i be unable to withstand but i trust in god and the justness of my cause that with you assistance i shall obtain the victory and shall be able to protect the christian and preserve my honor inviolate this speech have great effect upon the assemble naire who be astonish at the constancy and resolution of the rajah they all therefore crave pardon for the fear they have entertain and promise to live and die in he service the rajah immediately call the factor and the rest of the portuguese into he presence to whom he give a account of all that have take place between he and the naire and name before they the prince _ naramuhin _ -lrb- 3 -rrb- he brother and next heir as general of the army which be destine to act against the force of the zamorin command every one to obey he in every respect as if he be himself present naramuhin accordingly march with 5500 naire and entrenched himself at the ford which form the only entry by land into the island of cochin and which be only knee - deep at low water when the zamorin receive notice of the army of cochin have take post at this ford he be somewhat afraid more especially as he know naramuhin be consider to be the bravest and most fortunate warrior in malabar he therefore make a fresh attempt to induce the rajah of cochin to accede to he demand of deliver up the portuguese and they goods otherwise threaten to conquer he dominion and to put all the inhabitant to the sword although the rajah of cochin be quite sensible of the inferiority of he military force and be convince what the zamorin threaten might readily happen he yet determine to remain firm to he engagement and send the follow answer : if you have require with civility what you have proudly command I i should not have esteem you valor lessen by you courtesy : for with man of wisdom and power there be no need for insolent vaunt i have not as yet so sin against god that i should humble myself to vain boasting or think that he should grant you the victory over I and those brave man who fight on my side in spite of all you pride i trust even with the small number i have to defend I in my just quarrel that i shall be enable to overcome you and all my enemy however much you may have practice deceit and injustice it have ever be my rule to avoid shame and dishonor and i will never consent to deliver up the christian or they goods which i have engage to defend the zamorin be much offend by this answer from the rajah of cochin and vow to destroy he whole country in revenge : leave therefore the isle of repelim on the last day of march he enter on the territory of cochin yet refrain from do any injury as he now occupy those part which belong to the chieftain who have join he against they own sovereign on the 2d of march the army of the zamorin make a attempt to force a passage by the ford which be defend by prince naramuhin yet in spite of all he prodigious superiority of number he be force to retire with considerable loss disappoint in this first essay the zamorin encamp close by the ford and send the lord of repelim next day with a still stronger force than have be employ in the first assault to attempt force the passage he even join several armed paraw in this attack but naramuhin make a resolute defense in which he be bravely second by laurenzo moreno and several other portuguese and effectually resist every effort of the zamorin troops who be oblige to retreat with much loss several such assault be make on the ford in all of which the zamorin lose many man and be constantly repulse insomuch that he become fearful of a sinister end to he unjust enterprise and even repent of have begin the war he send however a fresh message to the rajah require he to deliver up the christian as a preliminary of peace but the rajah reply that as he have refuse to do so unjust a action when he have some reason to dread the superior power of the zamorin it be absurd to expect any such thing now when the advantage in the war be evidently of he side he then advise the zamorin to beware of continue the war as he would not now satisfy himself with defense but even hope to give he a signal overthrow and this certainly have be the case if the subject of the rajah have not shamefully desert he in this war and give assistance to the enemy the zamorin almost despaired of success and would have give over the enterprize if he have not be advise by some of he chief to assail several other town belong to the dominion of cochin so as to distract the attention of naramuhin and to weaken he force by oblige he to send detachment for they defense but that brave prince provide against every emergency and make so judicious a disposition of he force that he repulse every effort of the enemy and slew many of they man foiled in every attempt with severe loss by the bravery and excellent disposition of prince naramuhin the zamorin corrupt the paymaster of the troops of cochin who change the usual order of payment which have be daily make in the camp and oblige the soldier to come up to cochin for that purpose naramuhin be oblige to submit to this arrangement by give leave to the naire to go for they wages yet charge they punctually to return to the camp before day but the treacherous paymaster keep they wait till after day-light by which mean the prince be leave with very few troops to defend the ford take advantage of this concerted stratagem the zamorin make a assault upon the ford with he whole force by sea and land and constrain naramuhin to retire with he small band into a grove of palm tree where he be surround by the whole army of calicut yet fight the whole day against such terrible odds with the utmost resolution several time throw he enemy into disorder of whom many be slay but at length overpower by number he and two of he cousin who fight along with he be slay together with most of he faithful follower when this melancholy event be announce to the rajah of cochin he faint from extreme grief and be for some time think to have actually expire at this time the naire be much exasperate against we man to whom they attribute the overthrow and death of prince naramuhin and the desperate situation of they country and seem much inclined to have put the portuguese to death or to have deliver they up to the zamorin on the recovery of the rajah and learn the design of he people against we man he call the portuguese into he presence he give they assurance that even this reverse of he affair should not alter he resolution of protect they both against the zamorin and he own subject he then address he

portuguese in the factory at cochin to cananor and coulan and not to defend he against the power of the zamorin which he be even dispose to think be true in consideration of the smallness of the fleet

would faithfully exert himself in he defense he point out to he the strength of the natural defence of cochin which be all narrow and defensible therefore by a few valiant man against any number of

occasion a mutiny among the moor by whom the city be furnish with provision in exchange for goods and be think it be better to dissemble with they all pacheco then say that he would have a conference with the moor mean to use policy with they since the rajah do not approve of violent measure and to this the rajah consent give order to he naire to obey the order of pacheco in pursuance of this plan

sole purpose be to defend cochin against the zamorin and even if necessary i will die in you defense i be resolve to meet he in cambalan by which way it be say he mean to invade you and if he have the boldness to meet I i hope to make he prisoner and to carry he with I into portugal i be inform that you intend to go away from cochin and to induce the rest of the inhabitant among whom you be the chief to do the same but i be astonished man of you wisdom should leave the country in which you be bear and where you have dwell so many year from fear of vain report such conduct be even disgraceful for woman and be therefore much more so for you who be man of wisdom and experience if you should be dispose to remove from hence when you shall actually be in danger i should hardly blame you : but to do so before that danger be apparent and even before a single battle have be fight must proceed either from cowardice or treachery you all well know that only a very short while ago a very small number of we portuguese defeat thousand of those same enemy who now threaten to invade we you may allege that we be then more in number than now which be assuredly the case but we then fight in the open field where number be necessary and we now propose only to fight in narrow pass in which a small number will suffice as well as a multitude you already know that i can fight as it be i who have do the greatest injury to the enemy in the late war which the rajah can well vouch as for I i shall never yield and i have more to lose be overcome than any of you put you trust therefore in I and my troops and remain where you be till you see the event of we defense you sovereign remains in he port and wherefore should you go away i and the portuguese who be with I remain in this far distant country to defend you king and you who be he natural bear subject : should you then desert he and you country you would disgrace yourselve and dishonor I by refuse to repose confidence in my promise to defend you against the zamorin and all he power be it even greater than it be wherefore i strictly enjoin that none of you shall remove from cochin and i swear by all that be holy in we faith that whoever be detect in the attempt shall be instantly hang it be my determine purpose to remain here and to have the port strictly watch day and night that none of you may escape let every one of you

or raft of defense formerly mention by these likewise the paraw and other vessel of the enemy be prevent from close with we caravel and boat which they seem to have intend in this part of the battle many of the paraw and other vessel of the enemy be tear to piece and sink and a great number of they man be kill and wound on the turn of the tide the float castle put off from the point and be tow by boat towards the caravel in the largest of these castle there be forty man in other thirty-five and the smallest have thirty all arm with bow or matchlock besides ordnance and they seem quite a irresistible force in comparison of ours which consist only of two caravel and two armed boat when the largest castle come up to we float defense it immediately commence a tremendous fire of all its ordnance upon we caravel and at this time pacheco order a _ saker _ to be shoot off which seem to do very little harm even at a second discharge the remainder of the castle now come into they station and the battle rage with the utmost fury what with incessant flight of arrow and the smoke of so many gun we people could seldom see the vessel of the enemy in this extremity the saker be discharge a third time against the largest castle which have be somewhat shake by the two former discharge by this shot its iron work be break some of its beam be force from they place and several of the man on board be slay by two other discharge of the saker this castle be all tear in piece and be force to retire out of the battle still however the rest of the castle and the numerous fleet of small craft keep up the fight towards evening all the castle be much injure many of the paraw be sink and tear in piece and great number of the enemy slay so that at length they be constrain to retire on we side not one man be even wound : one only ball go through the caravel in which pacheco command and pass among many of he man without do any hurt on the enemy retire pacheco give chase in the two boat and some paraw and the caravel keep up a constant fire upon point _ arraul _ whence they force the zamorin and the land army to retire after have 330 of he man slay after this great victory the inhabitant of cochin become quite reassure and be no longer in dread of the power of the zamorin trimumpara come to visit pacheco whom he embrace and congratulate on he great prowess : many of the principal naire of cochin go to compliment he and even number of the moorish merchant bring he rich present hope to secure he favor the zamorin be greatly dishearten by the overthrow of all he mighty preparation and lose all hope of victory wish seriously to end the war in a council of he ally and great man they represent the great loss they have already endure in the war with the portuguese and propose to treat with they for peace he brother naubea daring who have always be averse to the war seem to believe that pacheco would refuse any treaty and advise rather to defer make a offer of peace till the arrival of the next captain-general from portugal this prince be likewise of opinion that the calicut army should still keep the field till the come on of the rainy season make it advisable to retire as it would look like flight to retreat at this time yet he recommend that no more attack should be make on the pass in which attempt they have already meet with so much loss elankol the lord of repelim urge the continuance of the war and to make reiterate assault on the christian which must be at last successful by which mean all the portuguese that be in cochin cananor and coulan would be destroy he advise likewise to send false intelligence to these place say that they have take we caravel and slay all we man on which news the people of cananor and coulan would put the people in we factory to death this be accordingly do but as the inhabitant of these place have already receive notice of the real state of affair they give no credit to this false story yet owe to the malice of the moor who dwell in these place we man be in great danger and durst not come out of they factory and one of we man be slay in coulan by the persuasion of elankol and the moor the zamorin reluctantly consent to try the event of another battle : and the castle be repair a fresh assault be make both by land and water with many more man and vessel than before this battle continue longer than the other and the enemy be overthrow with far greater loss than they have ever receive before in consequence of this new victory the inhabitant of cochin become quite confident in they security from the power of they enemy and the rajah who have hitherto be in much dread of the event become quite elated he now come to visit pacheco in a chair of state with far more splendor than he have ever assume since the commencement of the war when this be tell in the enemy camp the chief urge the zamorin to a fresh attack lest the rajah of cochin might hold he in contempt he desire they to cease they evil counsel from which he have already sustained great loss and which would still lead he into greater danger but to leave he to consider what be best to be do for revenge against he enemy the zamorin give order to some of he naire in whom he repose great confidence that they should go to cochin on some false pretence and endeavor to assassinate the general of the portuguese and such of he man as they could meet with but the naire be a inconsiderate people unable to keep any of they affair secret so that this shameful device become immediately know to pacheco who appoint two company of the cochin naire to keep strict watch for these _ spy _ one company at the ford and the other along the river wait by turn day and night by this mean these _ spy _ be detect and make prisoner the chief _ spy _ be a naire of cochin of the family or stock of the _ lecro _ who have certain other naire attend upon he who be stranger on be bring before he he order they to be all cruelly whipt and then to be hang the cochin naire remonstrate against this punishment because they be naire whose custom do not allow of this mode of execution but he would not listen to they argument say that they treachery richly merit to be so punish the portuguese officer represent to he the great trouble which the _ rajah _ of cochin have endure for give protection to they nation and how much this action might displease he when he be inform of naire have be put to death in he dominion without he authority besides that this might give occasion to some of those about the rajah who be know to be already unfriendly to the portuguese to insinuate that the captain - general have usurp the authority from the rajah and might in that way wean he affection from they pacheco be convince by these argument that he have act wrong and immediately send to countermand the execution two of they be already _ half-dead _ but _ those who be still live _ he send to the rajah inform he that they have deserve death but that from respect to he he have spare they life the rajah be singularly gratify by this mark of respect and the more so because there happen to be then present several of he principal noble and some chief from other place besides sundry of the chief of the moor of cochin who have endeavor to impress on he mind that the portuguese be willing to assume the command in he dominion -lrb- 8 -rrb- henceforward pacheco have such good intelligence that all the subtle device of the zamorin be counteract the month of June be now end and the rainy season or winter begin to come on from which pacheco naturally conclude that the zomorin would soon break up he encampment on which occasion he be fully resolve to give they a assault have sufficient experience of the pusillanimity of the enemy but the zamorin be afraid that pacheco might attack he at he departure give out that he intend to make another assault on the ford with a greater fleet than ever and even direct the float castle to be repair he even give out that he mean to assail the passage of _ palurte _ and the ford both at once that pacheco might occupy himself in prepare to defend both place and he might have the better opportunity to steal away unperceived accordingly on the evening of Saturday which be the eve of st john -lrb- 9 -rrb- the whole army of the enemy appear as usual and pacheco fully expect to have be attack that night next morning however he learn from two bramin that the zamorin have withdraw with all he army into the island of repelim pacheco be much disappointed at this news yet he make a descent that very day into repelim where he fight with many of the enemy killing and wound a great number of they and then return to the ford where he remain several day because the rajah be still afraid lest the zamorin might return and get across the ford into the island of cochin the zamorin be so crest-fallen by the great and repeated loss he have sustain in this war from a mere handful of man that he resolve to retire into religion seclusion that he might conciliate the favor of he god and dismiss he ally and chief to act as they think best he prince and noble endeavor to dissuade he from this resolution but he continue firm to he purpose and go into the _ torcul _ or religious state of seclusion accompany by some of he chief bramin or chaplain soon afterwards he mother send he word that great change have take place in calicut since he seclusion that many of the merchant have already desert the place and other be prepare to follow that the city be become ill provide with victuals as those who use to import they be afraid of the christian yet she advise he never to return to calicut unless he could do so with honor and that he should therefore continue in seclusion for a time and afterwards endeavor to recover he credit and reputation by victory or lose all in the attempt on this message which greatly increase he discontent the zamorin send for he brother to whom he confide the government of he dominion till such time as he should have complete he religious austerity in seclusion on this strange resolution of the zamorin the raja and noble who have join he in the war depart to they own country most of which lay on the coast and be under great apprehension that pacheco might reduce they dominion they endeavor to enter into treaty with he for peace and concord for which purpose they send message to trimumpara request that he would act as mediator between they and pacheco the rajah of cochin be a prince of a mild and forgiving disposition and forget all the past injury they have do he in these war he undertake the office of mediation and send they safe conduct to come to cochin to make they peace on they arrival he accompany they to wait upon pacheco and even become they advocate with he to accept of they profer friendship which he readily consent to at the desire of the rajah some of these prince be unable to come personally but send they ambassador to solicit peace which be accord to all who ask it several even of the great moorish merchant of calicut that they might quietly enjoy they trade forsake that place and come to dwell in cochin have previously secure the consent of pacheco other of they go to cananor and coulan by which mean the great trade which use to be carry on at calicut suddenly fall off owe to the great resort of moor to cochin in whom pacheco could not repose much confidence and because by the order of naubea daring the paraw of calicut frequently make excursion into the river the captain - general continue for a long while to defend the passage of the ford where he often fight with and do much injury to he enemy he make frequent incursion likewise into the island of repelim whence he carry off cattle and other provision and often fight with he enemy always defeat they with much slaughter -lrb- 10 -rrb- at length elankol the lord of that island wish to put a end to the misery of he country wait on pacheco and enter into a treaty of friendship with he make he a present of a great quantity of pepper which be abundant in he country -lrb- 11 -rrb- -lrb- 1 -rrb- this paragraph enumerate the force of the zamorin be add to the text of castaneda from astley vol i p 56 -lrb- 2 -rrb- the particular distribution of the force under pacheco at this time be thus enumerate in astley collection : in the fort thirty-nine man in the ship leave to defend cochin twenty-five in the caravel which accompany he in the expedition to cambalan twenty-six into one boat twenty-three and in the boat along with himself twenty-two make he whole effective force 135 man seventy-one only of which go along with he to defend the pass -- astl i 56 -lrb- 3 -rrb- a very short space before these be only state as twenty but the number and name in the text seem much corrupt -- e -lrb- 4 -rrb- in a former note we have give a list of the name and circumstance of the english ordnance near this period in that list the saker be describe as a light cannon of only 5-1\/2 pound ball now look upon as one of very small importance we may therefore conclude that the other cannon use on the present occasion could hardly exceed _ falcoun _ or two-pounder -- e -lrb- 5 -rrb- such be the unintelligible expression in lichefild translation in the account of this war compile by the editor of astley collection from the portuguese historian the enemy be say to have lose in the former part of this battle twenty paraw sink 180 person of note and above 1000 common man while in the second attack nineteen paraw be sink sixty-two flee and 360 man be slay in this account a third naval engagement be mention in which sixty-two paraw be sink and sixty flee after which 15000 man be defeat by land and four town be burn by pacheco -- astl i 56 -lrb- 6 -rrb- castaneda tell a long ridiculous story at this place of a ceremonial defiance of the zamorin not worth insert in astley i 56 we be tell that the moor of cochin be detect about this time communicate intelligence to the enemy and that trimumpara allow pacheco to punish they on which he put five of they chief man into strict confinement give out that they be hang which give much offence to the rajah and he people -- e -lrb- 7 -rrb- such be the word of lichefild which perhaps may have be intend to imply that there be not yet sufficient depth of water to allow of they approach to the caravel or it may mean that they wait for the tide of ebb to carry they towards the portuguese caravel be too cumbrous for management by means of oar -- e -lrb- 8 -rrb- this seem the same story which have be already mention in a former note from astley collection but which be there relate as have take place with _ moor _ -- e -lrb- 9 -rrb- the nativity of st john the baptist be the 24th June the eve therefore be the 23d yet castaneda have already say that June be end -- e -lrb- 10 -rrb- about this time in consequence of a message from the portuguese factor at coulan state that the moor obstruct the market for pepper pacheco go to that place where he make five moorish ship submit and settle the pepper market on fair term yet without do they any harm -- astl i 57 -lrb- 11 -rrb- accord to astley the zamorin lose 18000 man in this war in five month and desire peace which be grant by the rajah of cochin -- astl i 57 yet this could hardly be the case as the first operation of the new commander-in-chief in indium be to cannonade calicut -- e section ix _ the voyage of lope suarez de menesis to indium in 1504 be the sixth of the portuguese expedition to the east indy _ learn the necessity of send powerful succor to protect the portuguese trade from the hostility of the zamorin the king of portugal fit out a fleet of twelve -lrb- 1 -rrb- large ship in

moorish merchant have go from calicut to other place as they could carry on no trade there owe to the war and that even provision have become extremely scarce that the zamorin and the prince of calicut and the magistrate of that place be exceedingly desirous of peace with the portuguese for which reason they have send he to the admiral and have allow the portuguese prisoner there to write he

cochin with the interior and have likewise set on foot a considerable land army under the prince naubea daring it be the intention of the zamorin to stand on the defensive only while the portuguese fleet remain in indium and to renew the war against cochin after they departure but the admiral suarez by the advice of all he captain resolve to make a attack on cranganor a town belong to the zamorin about four league from cochin whence the enemy have often do much injury to the dominion of trimumpara during the late war for this purpose suarez take fifteen armed boat with raise defence on they gunwale and twenty-five paraw belong to cochin all arm with cannon and accompany by a caravel the whole man with about 1000 portuguese soldier and a equal number of nayre from cochin the armament arrive before day at _ palypuerto _ where it have to wait for daylight not daring to attempt the passage of certain shoal as the boat be heavily laden on arrive at cranganor the fleet of calicut be find draw up ready to repel the portuguese attack the calicut commander be post in the front in two new ship chained together which be full of ordnance and well manned chiefly by archer in the rear of these ship and on both flank the paraw of calicut be arrange all full of armed man on the arrival of the portuguese flotilla the battle immediately commence by the discharge of ordnance on both side five portuguese captain who lead the van push on to attack the calicut admiral in he two chained ship which they carry by board after a brave resistance in which that officer and two of he son with many other of the malabar be slay after the capture of these ship the paraw make little resistance and soon take to flight suarez immediately disembark he troops which soon put naubea daring to flight who command the land army of calicut the moor and malabar in they flight plunder the house of cranganor which be immediately afterwards set on fire by the portuguese certain christian inhabitant of the place come to suarez and pray he not to burn they city represent that it contain several church dedicate to the virgin and the apostle besides many christian house which be intersperse among these belong to the moor and gentile for they sake suarez order the conflagration to be stop yet many of the house be destroy before that could be effect as they be all of wood after the fire be quench we man plunder the house belong to the moor many of whom have formerly dwell in cochin the two ship and several paraw which have be take in the before mention engagement be set on fire and other three ship that be find draw on shore at this time suarez be join by the prince of cochin who inform he that naubea daring remain with he army at no great distance and intend to return to cranganor after he departure a considerable force be therefore send against naubea daring but immediately on see they approach the troops of calicut flee on the return of the portuguese flotilla towards cochin suarez be dispose to have destroy another town which lay near they passage but the prince of cochin represent that half of it belong to he and prevail on the admiral to spare it as he could not destroy one part without the other suarez therefore return to cochin where he knight some of he officer for they bravery during the last engagement a few day after he return there come a ambassador from the rajah of _ tanor _ whose dominion be next adjoining to those of cochin this ambassador represent that he master have hitherto adhere to the zamorin and have assist he in all he war against pacheco but that the zamorin since he have come out from he religious seclusion have redouble he arrogant idea of he irresistible power and in reward of the service of the rajah of tanor now threaten he with war and conquest he farther represent that on the late occasion when the general of the calicut force be in full march for the relief of cranganor the rajah of tanor have place 4000 of he nayre in ambush in a defile in they line of march who have defeat the troops of calicut and hod slay 2000 of they on this account the rajah of tanor be in great fear of the zamorin and humbly request assistance from the admiral promising in return to become subject to the king of portugal for this purpose the admiral send pedro raphael in a caravel to tanor with 100 soldier most of whom be crossbow man it chance that on the very day of he arrival at tanor the zamorin arrive before that city with he army and give battle to the rajah but chiefly owe to the valor of raphael and he company the army of the zamorin be defeat with great slaughter in reward for this well-timed succor the rajah of tanor become subject to the king of portugal in consequence of this defeat the zamorin be much humble and lose more credit

likelihood of ever be able to recover they trade all the moor who dwell in calicut and cranganor determine upon remove to they own country with they remain wealth for this purpose they fit up seventeen large ship at _ pandarane _ which they arm on purpose to defend themselves against any attack from we man and load they with all expedition for mecca besides these they load a great number of paraw and tony with such goods as the ship be unable to contain the season now approach for the return of the fleet to portugal and suarez appoint manuel telez de vasconcelle -lrb- 5 -rrb- as captain-general of the indy with whom he leave a ship and two caravel of which last pedro raphael and diego perez be captain the admiral present these officer to the rajah of cochin who would much rather have procure duarte pacheco to remain have great confidence in he valor and attachment to he service but dare not to request this of the admiral as he be of a haughty disposition in a conference between pacheco and the rajah the latter entreated he to remain in indium if possible as he do not think himself quite secure from the enmity of the zamorin and even urge he to remember that he have promise not to leave he till he have make he king of calicut pacheco answer that he leave he in a good situation he country be restore to quiet and the zamorin so much humble that he be no longer to be dread as a proof of which the moor be about to depart from calicut see they trade entirely ruin and that he hope to return from portugal and to serve he longer and to greater purpose than he have do hitherto the rajah be somewhat satisfy with this answer and crave pardon of pacheco that he have not reward he service as they deserve because he be extremely poor yet request he would take as much pepper as he please pacheco refuse to accept of any thing say he hope to find the rajah rich and prosperous on he return to cochin and then he would accept a reward the rajah give pacheco a letter for the king of portugal in which he set forth all he gallant action during the war strongly recommend he to he majesty favor the admiral suarez depart from cochin on the 27th December -lrb- 6 -rrb- take with he the whole of he fleet even those captain who be to remain in indium he intention be to have come to anchor in the harbor of panianus on purpose to visit the rajah of tanor but from foul weather and bad pilot the fleet could not make that port and be drive to calicut and pandarane be off these port and with a scanty wind the admiral detach raphael and perez with they caravel to examine if there be any ship of the moor at anchor while on this service ten paraw come off to attack they and a engagement ensue on the rest of the fleet hear the sound of the ordnance they bear up as close to the wind as possible and come to anchor -lrb- 7 -rrb- in a council of war it be resolve to attack the seventeen ship of the moor which lay all aground and as the ship be unable to get near they because they lay within the bar the attack be determine to be make by the boat of the fleet with order to set the moorish ship on fire this be resolve upon the admiral and all the captain of the fleet embark in the boat take with they all the soldier belong to the expedition the moorish ship be all draw on the beach in a close line have they stern to the shore and be well arm with ordnance and have many soldier on board arm with bow and arrow a considerable number of they be man of a fair complexion -lrb- 8 -rrb- besides all these the moor have two piece of ordnance on a small bulwark or redoubt which flank the passage of the bar we boat see all these formidable preparation return towards the fleet -lrb- 9 -rrb- whence they tow several caravel within the bar to assist the boat in the attack after a severe conflict in which the portuguese have twenty-five man kill and 127 wound the whole seventeen ship of the moor be board and take with the loss of 2000 man but as the moorish ship be all aground the victor be under the necessity to burn they with all the rich merchandize they contain owe to this severe loss the moor desert the city of calicut which by the cessation of trade become much distressed for provision insomuch that most of its inhabitant withdraw to other place the zamorin be so much humble by this succession of disastrous event that he remain quiet for a long time afterwards -lrb- 10 -rrb- the particular incident of this engagement be so confusedly relate in lichefild translation of castaneda as to baffle every attempt to reduce they into intelligible order among these the two follow be more distinctly tell tristan de la silva endeavor to board a ship which appear to be the admiral of which the captain and a numerous crew be turk a little before de silva get up to this ship the crew have fire off a piece of ordnance which lay on the upper deck and which by its recoil break a large hole in the side of the ship the turk be so intent on defend themselves against the portuguese boat that they neglect to barricade this hole of which the people in de silvas boat take advantage to get on board alonzo lopez the master and alvaro lopez one of the king servant now town-clerk of santarem be the first who enter by the hole a desperate conflict ensue on deck in which many of the turk be slay other hide themselves below the hatch and other leap into the water most of whom be drown as they be cover with shirt of mail the caravel command by pedro raphael one of these bring within the bar to co-operate with the boat be strike by a ball from the battery on shore which kill three man and dangerously wound other ten in the confusion occasion by this accident another shot kill the master at the helm and the caravel drive with the tide of flood right under the bow of a large moorish ship full of man which have not yet be attack by the boat in this situation a great number of the enemy board the caravel _ and use we man very ill _ the caravel afterwards drift on certain rock where she remain till the end of the battle the situation of the caravel be now perceive by the admiral who order effectual succor to be send to raphael the succor board the caravel which be quite full of moor whom they drive out with great slaughter but all of we man belong to that caravel be sore hurt on the next day be the first of January 1505 the admiral go with the fleet to cananor to take in the rest of he lading he be here inform by the factor of the humble situation of the moor from whom in he opinion the portuguese have no longer any thing to fear in indium be ready to depart for europe the admiral make a oration to manual telez and those who be to remain with he in indium give they instruction for they conduct after he departure and as the enemy be so greatly humble he consider that such a fleet as have formerly be leave by albuquerque be quite sufficient in which he leave a hundred soldier indeed the zamorin as have be already say be sick of the war and remain quiet after the departure of the admiral depart from cananor suarez arrive off melinda on the 1st of February where without landing himself he send antonio de saldanna to bring away the rich prize he have formerly make at cape guardafuus from melinda the fleet go to quiloa on purpose to enforce the payment of the tribute from the king of that place depart from thence on the 10th of February he arrive safe at lisbon on the 22d of June 1505 -lrb- 11 -rrb- without any incident worth relate -lrb- 12 -rrb- carry with he two ship more than have accompany he

the indy -lrb- 13 -rrb- -lrb- 1 -rrb- these be say to have be the largest ship hitherto build in portugal and to have carry 1200 man perhaps soldier besides they ordinary crew -- astl i 57 -lrb- 2 -rrb- the turkish empire as succeed that of the roman or greek of constantinople be still call _ rumus _ in the east it will be afterwards see that these _ rume _ roman or turk make some powerful effort to drive the portuguese from indium as greatly injurious to the indian trade with europe through the red sea and egypt -- e -lrb- 3 -rrb- this expression be quite inexplicable unless we may pick out very darkly that it belong to the calicut confederacy against the portuguese yet castaneda or he imperfect translator lichefild do not inform we whether this vessel be make a prize lichefild seem almost always to have have a very imperfect knowledge of the language of the author often to have mistake he meaning or express it with great obscurity and sometimes write even a kind of jargon by endeavor to translate verbally without be able to catch a idea from the original -- e -lrb- 4 -rrb- accord to astley from de fariz only _ five _ ship and indeed in the sequel castaneda only mention

blunder lichefild say they come to _ cananor _ but from all the circumstance in the context it be obvious that the fleet come to anchor on the outside of the bar at pandarane -- e -lrb- 8 -rrb- arab probably whites in the estimation of the portuguese as compare with the native black of malabar -- e -lrb- 9 -rrb- this part of the story be very confusedly translate by lichefild accord to he

astley a peace be conclude between the portuguese and the zamorin immediately after the victory obtain by the rajah of tanore but this do not agree with the circumstance just related respect the destruction of the moorish fleet in the harbor of pandarane which would hardly have be do during a time of peace -- e -lrb- 11 -rrb- by some strange typographical mistake lichefild make this date 1525 both in the text and in a marginal note thus add no less than twenty year to the true chronology in astley collection the conclusion of this voyage be date 22d July 1506 but we have choose to retain the regular series of date as give by castaneda owe to the mistake in lichefild translation not be detect till a part of this chapter be print off it have be repeat in we introduction to this article which we reader be request to correct -- e -lrb- 12 -rrb- in astley the ship command by pedro mendoza be say to have be strand during the homeward voyage fourteen league from the _ aguada _ or watering-place of st bla and never more hear of -- astl i 58 -lrb- 13 -rrb- astley conclude the account of the honor confer on pacheco in the follow word : but soon after imprison and allow he to die

edition use on the present occasion be print at basil in 1555 by jo hervag its principal contents besides those translate for the present chapter be the voyage of cada mosto already give the discovery of america by christopher columbus which will form the first article in we subsequent volume the voyage of vincent alonzo pinzon and of americus vespucius which will be attend to hereafter and the travels of marco polo which have be already give at full length from a better source the language of the _ novus orbi _ be perhaps the most barbarous latin ever compose for the press and its punctuation be so enormously incorrect that it would have be easier understand without any point whatever as already mention the edition here use be date in the year 1555 little more than fifty year after the discovery they commemorate and the letter themselves be date in 1501 1502 and 1503 immediately after the return of the earliest of the portuguese voyage from indium indeed the first letter seem to have be write only a day or two after the arrival of the first ship belong to cabral fleet this work be accompany by a very curious map of the world on one planisphere much elongate to the east and west which may be consider as a complete picture of the knowledge then acquire of the cosmography of we globe the first meridian be place at the island of ferro and the degree of longitude be count from thence eastward all round the world so that ferro be in long 0  and 360  e in every part of the world the outline be grossly incorrect and it would serve no purpose to give a extended critical view of this map yet a few notice respect it may gratify curiosity europe be singularly incorrect especially in the north and east america call likewise _ terra nova _ have a approximate delineation of its southern division stretch far to the south as if the cosmographer have receive some tolerable notice of brazil cape horn and the coast of peru and chili but instead of the continent of north america the island of cuba be delineate in a north and south direction reach between the latitudes of 10  and 50  north leave a small strait or passage between its southern extremity and the isthmus of darien into the south sea about twelve degree west from cuba the island of zipangrus be place and at least twenty degree east from cathay or china at sixteen degree east from the northern end of cuba a large island be place in the _ oceanus magnus _ or atlantic call _ terra cortesium _ which the cosmographer seem to have intend to represent the kingdom of mexico recently discover by cortez though place almost in lat 50  n perhaps this may be a error for _ cortereali _ a early navigator who be say to have make discovery on the eastern coast of north america in africa there be a approximation towards its true shape yet the _ caput viride _ or cape verd be place to the north of the river senegal instead of between that river and the gambium and the source of the nile be bring down to lat 15  s at least twenty-two degree too far to the southward asia with indium and china be too much distorted for criticism calicut be place in the peninsula of cambaya or guzerate the _ aurea chersonesus _ and _ regnum malacha _ or malacca be separate by a great gulf while the latter be place so low as 30  s latitude this much may suffice for a account of the incorrect yet curious specimen of cosmographical knowledge which have be acquire by the learn in europe about 300 year ago to these four letter we have add a short account of several curious circumstance relative to the trade of the european with indium at the commencement of the sixteenth century or three hundred year ago which though not very accurately express contain some curious information -lrb- 1 -rrb- novus

portugal which by the blessing of god have now return with the loss of seven ship as it originally consist of fourteen sail seven of which only have come home the other seven have be wreck in the voyage they voyage be along the coast of mauritanium and getulium to cape verd anciently call _ experia _ off which the island call the _ hesperide _ be situate from thence they explore lower _

direct line be greatly shorter before pass the cape of good hope in consequence of be force out of they course by a sw wind they discover a new country to which they give the name of the _ land of parrot _ because they find there a incredible number of these bird of many beautiful color some of they a cubit and a half in length and more we have see two of these bird and can vouch for the truth of the description on explore this extensive coast the navigator believe that it must necessarily belong to a continent as they sail along it for the space of 2000 mile without have see either

moor and other neighbouring people and some frigate belong to the great sultan all the people belong to which conspire together against the christian be exceedingly adverse to the come of the christian into these part lest they should diminish they profit they insist therefore to have they ship first load to the great dissatisfaction of the christian who immediately complain to the king of the insolence of the moor but soon discover that he favor they the king of calicut be a person of very doubtful faith and make the follow answer : that it do not seem equitable for the moor to be permit to finish they traffic before the christian and give order accordingly that the christian might carry on they trade the moor trangress this decree and take away the goods of the christian at pleasure upon which dispute arise between the christian and the moor in which the whole inhabitant of the city take part with the moor whereupon a great slaughter be make of the christian above forty of they be slay among whom be they principal factor when endeavor to escape by swim in revenge for this cruelty the christian make severe reprisal as they burn ten ship belong to the prefect of syrium that be the sultan and destroy a considerable portion of the city by means of they _ catapult _ and _ bombard _ -lrb- 6 -rrb- many house be burn to the ground as they be cover with thatch like cottage and exceedingly combustible after this the fleet leave calicut and go to another kingdom name cochin about forty mile distant be conduct thither by a jew who assume the christian faith the king of cochin hate the king of calicut exceedingly and on that account receive the christian with much kindness spice be in greater abundance at cochin than at calicut and the christian carry off such riches from cochin as i dare scarcely venture to report for they allege to have purchase a _ cantarus _ of cinnamon which be a considerable measure for one gold ducat the king of cochin give two hostage to the portuguese in assurance of they safety and send even ambassador to the king of portugal in the mean time the king of calicut fit out a immense fleet against the christian in revenge for have burn the ship in he harbor this fleet exceed 150 ship and carry 15000 man yet on account of a north wind which they be unable to contend with they dare not to attack the portuguese ship and withdraw from cochin as they great number be considerably formidable the portuguese ship go to a certain island in which the body of st thoma be inter the lord of which receive they kindly and give they some relic of that holy person in token of friendship : he even offer they greater quantity of spice than they have ever see before without money trust that they would pay for they on they return from europe : but be already laden the portuguese decline this friendly offer the portuguese fleet employ fourteen month in this voyage and return to lisbon in spring but they say that it may be make much sooner now that the course be well know and may even be accomplish in ten month all the ship that reach calicut return except one which be lose on certain rock but the crew save which ship be of six hundred ton burden as yet only one caravel have come into port but the rest be say to be not far off this lately arrive ship come into port on st john day 6th may at which time i happen to be with the king who address I in these word _ hah _ congratulate I good sir as my fleet be already in the river load with all kind of spice i receive the news joyfully as become I and make my compliment of congratulation to the king the tiding be welcome with exceed joy and all kind of festivity with the sound of trumpet cymbal and flute and the continual firing of cannon on the day follow there be a solemn thanksgiving at which all the people assist when i again wait on the king he desire I to apprize you serenity of he good fortune say that you may send you ship hither in safety to purchase he spice add that he should take such measure as to prevent the prefect of syrium that be the sultan -lrb- 7 -rrb- from procure spice in indium he found this hope assuredly on the success which he fleet have lately in contend with the numerous vessel of the moor and have no doubt of be able to reduce indium under he own authority the ship already arrive be command by a tuscan name bartholomew a native of florence she cargo consist of 300 _ cantarus _ or quintal of pepper 120 cantarus of cinnamon 60 cantarus of lac and 15 cantarus of castor and other perfume of that kind -lrb- 8 -rrb- they have no clove or ginger have be prevent by the moor as these could only be procure at calicut neither have they any of the lesser spice they have purchase many pearl of different sort which be all lose in the disturbance at calicut in which many of they man and much riches be destroy i must not omit to mention that there have lately arrive messenger from _ ubenus _ -lrb- 9 -rrb- king of ethiopium to the king of portugal bring gift of ivory and many other thing these be soon to return in two ship which be to go to indium after stop at the new gold mine while this ship which have first arrive be on its voyage home it meet two ship steer they course from the _ new gold mine _ -lrb- 10 -rrb- for indium these think themselves lose or that they would be plunder by the christian offer to pay they a ransom of 15000 ducat for leave to continue they voyage : but the christian though tempt by so much gold give these people many gift and permit they to continue they course that they might hereafter be allow a free trade with they country -lrb- 1 -rrb- this letter be date on the 20th of June 1501 and obviously refer to the voyage of cabral who have return from indium not long before the writer be describe as a native of crete and envoy from the lord of venice to the king of portugal -- e -lrb- 2 -rrb- the strange geographical language here use be inexplicable probably because the idea of the writer be confuse he seem to mean the _ mina _ in guinea which be _ five or six _ degree _ within _ the equator or to the north but be at least 18 west from the meridian of sicily -- e -lrb- 3 -rrb- mean the tropic of capricorn on which the sun be during we winter solstice -- e -lrb- 4 -rrb- the recession of the coast inwards from cape delgado to melinda which may be call the bay of zanzibar -- e -lrb- 5 -rrb- in the map of grynaeus already mention this _ terra psittacorum _ or land of parrot be place on the _ south-west _ coast of africa between the cape of good hope and congo yet there can be no doubt that the recent discovery of brazil on the _ eastern _ coast of south america be here allude to : consequently instead of the _ lebeccio vento _ or sw wind of the text it would naturally have require a s e wind to force the portuguese fleet so far to the westward of its intended course -- e -lrb- 6 -rrb- the author assuredly use these word to denominate two kind of ordnance or cannon then use in the portuguese ship of war -- e -lrb- 7 -rrb- by the sultan or prefect of syrium twice so design in this dispatch be evidently mean the mameluk sultan of egypt but who be soon afterwards defeat and slay by the turkish emperor the ineffectual exertion of the mameluk and turk instigate by venice to obstruct the portuguese trade in indium will be afterwards mention -- e -lrb- 8 -rrb- it be difficult to say what be mean by a _ cantarus _ in the text perhaps a quintal or 100 pound the castor of the text and other perfume may mean musk civet and ambergris -- e -lrb- 9 -rrb- perhaps the king of congo or some other prince of the west coast of africa be here allude to or perhaps the xeque or prince of the moor at sofalum -- e -lrb- 10 -rrb- by the new gold mine sofala seem indicate as contradistinguish from the _ old _ gold mine of guinea the story of the two ship on they voyage to indium from sofalum obviously allude to the guzerate vessel more particularly mention already in the voyage of cabral -- e section ii _ letter from certain merchant and banker of spain -lrb- 1 -rrb- to they correspondent in the city of florence and venice respect a treaty of peace and league between the king of portugal and calicut _ we have be inform by those who be on board of the fleet which sail from lisbon to indium in may 1502 and return on the 15th December 1503 that the king of calicut have conclude a peace with we sovereign on the following condition as a compensation for the slaughter of we man he be to pay 4000 _ bahar _ of pepper equal to 12 000 quintal that the moor shall not be allow to trade there from any place whatever except only those who be native of calicut and that these even shall not be permit to trade with mecca that we king if so inclined may build a fort at calicut and shall be supply with a sufficient quantity of stone lime and timber for that purpose by the zamorin pay for these on delivery that the king of calicut shall aid and favor the portuguese in all thing and that it shall be competent for we king to appoint one of he own subject to administer justice among the portuguese resident in that city even with the power of life and death and without appeal to the zamorin that when any of we people shall revolt from or be disobedient to we commercial agent they shall immediately be deliver up to be judge by the aforesaid portuguese consul if any captive moor be detain they shall all be deliver up to we agent that the two milanese lapidary who have go from rome to indium and who there act as military engineer and shipbuilder in the european fashion to the disgrace of the christian profession and the vast injury of the christian should be deliver up in chain to the admiral of we fleet that the king or raja of cochin and cananore shall be include in this treaty as co-ally mutually share all danger and advantage with the other contracting party : so that if any one shall take arm against any of the party to this treaty he shall be declare a enemy to all the party hereby confederate if any of the party to this league shall act contrary to its stipulation the power of all the rest shall act against he as a perfidious person a traitor and a enemy to good faith all the contracting party use they utmost to preserve the present peace and alliance inviolate while the portuguese fleet might remain in the harbor of calicut all other ship whatever be to be refuse access at least until after ours be laden : but when there be sufficient goods for all who want they then all ship be to be at liberty to load provide always that the accustomed price should not be augmented and expressly that the profit to the vender should never exceed 8 per cent which be usual in that port these be the condition of peace and alliance which have be stipulate to the great honor and renown of we sovereign as must be evident to every one as henceforward he may not only be account sovereign of indium but have impose law on turkey and the prefect of syrium -lrb- 2 -rrb- since by this treaty all access to the city of calicut be debar to they trader we do not even doubt that in four year from hence through the vigorous measure of we king we sailor may safely navigate to constantinople and alexandrium the present most celebrated mart of eastern commerce and shall take signal vengeance on the moor by whom they have be infamously and frequently abuse for this purpose a fleet of twelve sail be fit out this year which find the rajah of cochin expel from he dominion have flee for refuge from the hostility of the king of calicut to a strong place in a certain island the only reason he could assign for the hostility of the zamorin be that faithful to he engagement he refuse to deliver we people to the king of calicut and choose rather to live in exile than to betray he trust in this extremity we fleet bring opportune aid to the friendly rajah and have land troops for he assistance they march boldly against the perfidious zamorin route he force with great slaughter and triumphantly restore the rajah of cochin to he dominion this kingdom be not far distant from the strait of the red sea where they have erect a very strong fortress -lrb- 3 -rrb- and be build another in the mouth of the bay of cochin provide with all kind of warlike artillery by which to repel the enemy and to provide a safe station for we fleet nor shall we recede from thence however adverse the native may be to we remain and when the same shall be do in the bay of calicut it will not then be difficult to defend these station and the adjoining coast against all aggressor we ship which remain in these sea last year make no small booty as they take one morning five ship bind from the kingdom of cambaya for mecca the shrine of mahomet in which they find 1000 _ cantarus _ or quintal of clean clove besides a large quantity of the same spice not free from the husk as be usual with we these ship have likewise castor and other perfume of that kind -lrb- 4 -rrb- sander wood amber purify lac and excessively fine linen and a large sum in gold and silver coin insomuch that the value of this prize exceed 200000 ducat have thus inform you of the wealth of that country which abound in almost every thing we now proceed to relate that two of we ship above mention have be cast away in a storm near the mouth of the red sea they commander vincentius and above six hundred man have perish but the other two be save -lrb- 5 -rrb- another vessel which escape that dreadful tempest be soon afterwards dash to piece against a rock so that the sea be cover with dead body and with rich merchandize of all kind : thus as the proverb say wealth ill acquire be ill lose of all these ship one small caravel only ride out the storm and bring intelligence of the destruction of the other we have now to inform you that we king have give permission to all who choose to proceed to indium and to carry on trade provide that he be pay a quarter part -lrb- 6 -rrb- of all return and that they purchase from he for the purpose such ship as he think proper and the price of these ship must be pay before set out on the voyage because consider the loss of ship which he have already sustain he be desirous that other should now bear the risk : it will therefore require large fund to embark in this trade so that we hardly believe the king will find any to engage on these condition but of this we shall inform you from time to time as it may occur it must not however be conceal that the circumstance of this trade be by no means establish on certain principle which can only be determine by future event a portuguese of the former fleet touch at a certain port in the kingdom of sofalum and visit a gold mine of which he relate wonderful thing he assure we that a ship of the christian have be there and speak of incredible quantity of gold to be find there on this account we king be resolve to erect a strong fort at that place to keep the barbarian under subjection and to keep away the indian and the inhabitant of cambaya lest they should make themselves master of the mine he will therefore immediately seize upon this mine for he own use which we certainly believe to have be the mine whence solomon derive such vast riches and where the queen of sheba dwelt who go to visit solomon as related in holy writ these thing be of such importance that they ought not to be conceal from you and we king be to be deem happy and fortunate because he have make the discovery of such vast riches it be believe by many that they will soon obtain permission from the king to go to indium pay he at the rate of 25 per cent and take he ship as before mention it appear to be he wish that the merchant should send out they own factor or supercargo with the care of they goods but without any authority as he wish to rule in all thing and that every thing may be direct by he officer even the expence of the merchant the trade in spicery be to remain exclusively in the viceroy and be not to be permit to the merchant for which reason it be not believe that this indian trade will be very profitable : but we shall give you due information of all these thing as they occur we have formerly write you that cairo fail in its commercial prosperity from the very same cause and if this great eastern trade shall be appropriate by the king it will certainly occasion a babylonian confusion in the state and very deservedly : for at cairo the moor be in use to maltreat the christian exceedingly and they be now perhaps suffer for that error as they will not any longer be allow to carry away any kind of spice or jewel of all kind or pearl and other valuable commodity as by means of the portuguese fort they will in future be debar from trade to calicut and sofalum for all which you will be thankful to god concern the gold mine of sofalum which we mention before and of which such wonderful thing be tell it be say we king will be the sole proprietor in two year which must prove of vast importance as from that place which be now possess by the idolater all indium and persium use to procure the whole of they gold although the mouth of the bay be under the dominion of a king of the chaldean -lrb- 7 -rrb- at which place the trade be carry on with the idolater by the moor who bring yearly they ship from cambaya laden with low-priced article which they barter for gold these goods be coarse cotton cloth silk of various fashion and many color but chiefly of the turkish fabric the king of quiloa a island about sixty league from sofala it be say will have to quit that place from fear of the idolater at quiloa all ship go to sofalum have to stop and pay tribute before go to the mine of sofalum when they get to sofala they have to remain there six or eight month before complete they affair carry from thence gold ivory and wax all of the best kind after this they have again to touch at quiloa and to pay a tax for they gold thence they go to cambaya or mecca in we ship there be twelve or fifteen agent of the king of quiloa who pay a tribute yearly to we king of 1500 _ metigal _ each of which metigal be worth 150 ducat or in all 225000 ducat that king depend so entirely on the king of portugal that we king may dethrone he whenever be please to send there a force of 1000 man which would oblige the king of quiloa to run away and it be believe this will be do shortly the thing be so easy and by this mean a yearly revenue of 500000 ducat would be secure if you have properly consider what those ship may bring which be daily expect you will find that they will at least import about 222 quintal of all kind of spice : and we shall ship for you of all these use we endeavor that you may never be in want of they even after the before mention treaty with the king of calicut no small risk still remain to those who navigate to the indy on account of a certain archipelago contain about 14000 island -lrb- 8 -rrb- and owe to the narrowness of a certain strait which be scarcely navigable we shall persist notwithstanding as by custom and experience these danger will become of no consequence at length we expect to have the glory of have discover almost the whole of the world and those part of it especially to which the ancient never penetrate it only remain for we to go to the island of taprobana or ceylon which accord to pliny be exceedingly rich in gold gem and ivory thus by we anxious endeavor we shall lay open the whole of indium to we trade by letter from thence it appear that we merchandize be not much value in these part and that _ crusado _ ought to be send out if we wish to have we affair speedily conduct as other goods remain long in hand : for the indian purposely procrastinate that they may beat down the value of we commodity the indian give a high price for brass and alum but this last must be white not red and in large piece as they despise the small they do not care for coral unless large and finely work which otherwise bear no value lead be value if in large bar quicksilver and amber be in no request work brass bear a low price as it be always manufacture over again in they own fashion so that the cost of manufacturing in europe would be throw away all other goods besides these mention be in no demand and will therefore bring small profit -lrb- 1 -rrb- this letter have no date but must have be very early in the sixteenth century probably in 1504 from the circumstance to which it allude at its commencement although say to be from _ spain _ there be every reason to suppose it be write from lisbon as we find portugal frequently consider as _ in _ spain which it actually be in the most extensive geographical sense -- e -lrb- 2 -rrb- this as formerly observe allude to the mameluk sultan of egypt through whose dominion the trade between indium and europe be entirely carry on before this era this treaty of peace and alliance between portugal and calicut may possibly have be propose at this period but certainly be not then agree to as there be long war with the zamorin before he power be reduce under the influence and dominion of the portuguese -- e -lrb- 3 -rrb- this be rather a anachronism as at this period the portuguese have no fortress on the red sea -lrb- 4 -rrb- the _ castor _ of the text be probably musk and its _ amber _ ambergris -- e -lrb- 5 -rrb- this allude to the misfortune of vincente sodre and he squadron already more distinctly relate in the precede chapter -- e -lrb- 6 -rrb- the expression of the original _ ex centenario lucro quadrugenarium _ be not easily understand : it be here translate a quarter part of the return cargo conformably with the regulation of don henry for the trade of guinea as already state in vol i p 204 from which the present be probably copy -- e -lrb- 7 -rrb- it be difficult to guess what bay and who may be the king of the chaldean here allude to perhaps the town of sofalum the emporium of the gold trade of eastern africa which be rule by a arabian prince or sheik by the idolater in the text be apparently mean the negro of the interior where the gold come from by way of sofalum -- e -lrb- 8 -rrb- this allude to the maldive and lakedive -- e section iii _ letter from peter pasqualus orator of the venetian republic at the court of the king of portugal to he brother dwelling in lisbon _ -lrb- 1 -rrb- beloved brother i formerly write you by peter verzo the carrier inform you of all the news of this place and now write again by bartholomew marquesus the uncle of dominic benedicto of florence that you may be inform of we affair and may be assure of we desire to write whenever a opportunity offer know therefore that the vessel which be send out last year towards the north by the king of portugal under the command of caspar corterato have now return he report have discover a continent about 2000 mile from hence in a direction between the north-west and the west hitherto utterly unknown he be likewise say to have sail almost 800 mile along its coast without find any end on which account it be consider to be a continent and not a island : and its coast appear to join with another land formerly discover almost under the very north -lrb- 2 -rrb- but the vessel be unable to proceed so far on account of the sea be freeze and from excessive fall of snow it be conclude from the number of river which descend from the snowy mountain that this land must be a continent as no island could possibly supply so many river the land be say to be well cultivate the house of the inhabitant be construct of wood cover with hide or the skin of fish the vessel now arrive have bring over seven of the native of both sex and the other ship which be hourly expect be say to have fifty in stature color appearance and dress these people be very like the _ cinganus _ they be clothe in the skin of fish and otter and other hairy skin like those of wolf wear the fur side inwards in winter as we do and outwards in summer but these be not fashion or sew together be use in they natural form these be principally worn on they arm and shoulder and they loin be gird with many cord make of sinew they appear a savage people yet not impudent and be well make in all they limb they face be puncture with many mark like the indian have six or eight punctured line more or less accord to they fancy in which they seem to take great delight they have a language which be not understand by any one although interpreter of almost every tongue have be try they country be destitute of iron yet they have sword edge with sharp stone and they arrow be point by the same means and be sharper even than ours we people bring from thence part of a broken sword with gilded ornament which seem of italian manufacture a certain boy be say to have be see in that country have two silver ball bang from he ear which certainly appear to be engrave after we manner on the whole it may be conclude that this country be a continent not a island and that be a new discovery for if any ship have ever be here before we should assuredly have hear something respect it the coast abound in fish particularly salmon herring and many other of that kind there be forest which abound in all kind of tree so that _ they build _ -lrb- 3 -rrb- ship with mast yard bench and all thing conformable on this account the king of portugal have resolve to convert this discovery to profit both on account of the abundance of wood which be fit for many purpose and because the native be accustom to labor may become very useful and indeed i have never see better slave i have deem it consistent with we friendship to acquaint you with these thing and when the other vessel arrive which be daily expect i shall communicate other particulars the fleet have sail for calicut and the king have order that it shall seize the fleet of mecca that the soldan of syrium may neither have access there in future nor may export any more spice the king of portugal be satisfy that every thing shall go accord to he wish in this respect and the court and all the nation be of the same opinion should this purpose succeed it be incredible how abundant this kingdom must soon become in all kind of riches and merchandize and from hence the ship of venice in particular will have to bring they accustomed article of trade to we truly who formerly sustain this branch of commerce entirely by we own resource this decree will be injurious unless he shew we favor -lrb- 1 -rrb- this letter be date 9th October 1501 it be probable that pasqualus would hardly write this _ from _ the court of portugal to he brother in _ lisbon _ it be more likely that they reside in venice -- e -lrb- 2 -rrb- the discovery here refer to seem to have be the coast of labradore and the other country under the north may possibly be greenland this voyage be probably in quest of a north-west passage to indium -- e -lrb- 3 -rrb- in this passage we surely ought to read _ ship may be build _ -- e section iv _ letter from franci sagitta of cremona from lisbon direct to the venetian orator peter pasqualus reside at the court of castile _ -lrb- 1 -rrb- most excellent orator in two former letter i have promise to omit no opportunity of inform you excellency what kind of merchandize might be bring in four vessel which be expect daily from indium they be now arrive and i shall truly state all the merchandize which they have bring which be as follow : one thousand quintal of pepper 450 quintal of cinnamon about fifty quintal of ginger fifty quintal of lac : and as much cotton as may be buy for 400 ducat the reason assign for have bring so small a quantity of spice be that they agree among themselves after sail from hence that two of the ship should steer for the gold mine and the other two for calicut on this account each take only such goods as it be think would be value in the port to which they be bind but when these ship come to calicut they be not allow to trade and be oblige to go to other place on go to cananore they there learn what have be do by peter aliari the factor at cochin for the king the king or rajah of cananore receive we people honourably and offer to supply we commander gratuitously with all kind of spice but thank he gratefully for this kindness he decline the offer say that he must go in the first place to the king factor at cochin and would then return and accept he spice on credit set out therefore for cochin he transact business with the royal agent peter aliari but as the ship do not bring money for they purchase and as the goods they bring be in small request and they could not therefore succeed in make purchase the commander resolve to return to cananore where the rajah have express so much good will for the portuguese and where he barter he merchandize for spice at a good profit he here leave three person with the ship factor and a clerk because the rajah have advance money on credit for the spice that they might not appear to have cheat the rajah yet after all the ship have to come away only half loaded because they have not take out money for they purchase and they goods be in no request the conclusion from this be evident that the indian have no demand for we goods and that money alone be especially desire by they and of which they be in great need it have be report since that these king of the indy give as much merchandize to we admiral without price as would load four ship out of fear of the christian especially the king of calicut who have be tell by he soothsayer to beware of the ensue year as the star threaten he with a great slaughter of he man by the christian and that he kingdom even would be desert owe to dread of that people we have this intelligence from three man who escape from the battle at _ araschorea _ with the barbarian the same thing be report by a native of bergamo who have dwell twenty-five year at calicut which be likewise confirm by a native of valentium who have sojourn there six year in the meantime the king of calicut fit out a large fleet to attack we ship at cananore but they immediately seek for safety by set sail on this account the king of portugal have order eight or ten ship of burthen to be fit out by next January of which seven be already build two ship have be send out this summer one of which be of 700 ton burthen and the other of 500 there be a third in the port of lisbon of 450 ton two other at madeira one of 350 and the other of 230 ton another be fitting out at setubal carry above 160 ton besides these six a caravel be to be add which lately come from the island of chio all of which be entirely at the royal charge and two be to be fit out by the king for certain merchant one of 450 ton and the other of 350 it be agree between these merchant and the king that the king shall be at the sole expence of the voyage and payment of the sailor as in he service that the merchant shall carry out as much money as may suffice for all they purchase and on the return of the ship half of the goods shall belong to the king and the merchant shall be at liberty to sell the other half for they own behoof it appear evident to we that this mode of conduct business will be greatly more to the benefit of the merchant than go entirely at they own risk as have be do hitherto so that the king will probably find abundance of people willing to trade to india on these condition we have accordingly a share in these two ship but of the event god alone can judge -lrb- 1 -rrb- this letter be date 16th September 1502 and by it p pascqualus appear to have go from portugal into spain : -- e section v _ of the weight and money of calicut and of the place whence they procure they spice _ -lrb- 1 -rrb- have already treat concern the article of commerce of all kind in the indy it be proper to give some account of the price and weight of these in the city of calicut a _ bahar _ of nutmeg be sell for 450 _ favus _ a bahar consist of four quintal of 100 pound each and twenty _ favi _ be equal to a ducat a bahar of cinnamon cost 390 favus a _ faraculum _ or the

faracula a faraculum fourteen aratolla and a third as twenty-three venetian aratolla be equal to twenty-two portuguese pound a golden ducat be equal to twenty favus as to those thing which be carry from europe for sale at calicut a faraculum of brass sell for forty-five favus a faraculum of white coral for 1000 a faraculum of silver for twenty favus a faraculum of spurious coral for 300 a faraculum of alum twenty a almenum of saffron sell for eighty favus : the almenum exceed the portuguese pound two aratolla and a half and be therefore equal to about three venetian pound it appear proper to mention the region from whence the various spice be bring to calicut pepper be bring from a certain tower near the coast about fifty league beyond calicut cinnamon come from a country call _ zolon _ ceylon 260 league beyond calicut and from no other place clove come from the district of _ meluza _ which be twelve portuguese league from calicut and be in the country of cananore nutmeg and

lisbon to calicut attribute to the pen of aloysius cadamosto the information it contain respect the principal commodity then bring from indium to europe and they price be curious : yet there be some reason to suspect that the author or editor rather have sometimes interchange the bahar and the faraculum or its twentieth part in the weight of the commodity several of the name of thing and place be unintelligible probably from corrupt transcription -- e -lrb- 2 -rrb- meluza may possibly be the city of malacca then a great emporium of indian trade but it be impossible to reconcile or explain meluza in cananore twelve league from calicut and meluza 740 league from thence -- e -lrb- 3 -rrb- this may possibly refer to the island of ramisseram in the strait of manaar between ceylon and the
