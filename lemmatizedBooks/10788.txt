special scotch sam could ` ardly believe he ear and he stand there ` oldin ' he glass o ' ginger-beer and watch peter 's teetotal uncle drink whiskey and think ' e must be dream i dessay it seem very shocking to you se mr goodman put down ` be glass and dryin ' ` be lip on each other but i find it useful for these attack i -- i s ` pose the flavor 's very nasty se sam take a sip at ` be ginger-beer not exactly wot you could call nasty se mr goodman though i dessay it would seem so to you i do not suppose you could swallow it i do not s ` pose i could se sam but i have a good mind to ` ave a try if it be good for one teetotaller i do not see why it should hurt another mr goodman look at ` im very hard and then he order a whiskey and stand watch while sam arter pretend for a minnit to look at it as though ' e do not know wot to do with it take a sip and let it roll round ` be mouth well se mr goodman look at ` im anxious-like it be not so ` orrid as i ` ad fancy se sam lap-ping

expect se sam -- music - ` all and such-like mr goodman shake he ` ead at 'em music - ` all be not so bad as some people try to make out se sam look ` ere i take some drink to see what the flavor be like suppose you go to a music - ` all to see wot that be like it seem on ' y fair se peter 's uncle consider it be fair se sam and twenty minute arterwards they be sit in a music - ` all drinking each other 's ` ealth and listen to the song -- mr goodman with a big cigar in ` be mouth and he ` at cock over one eye and sam beating time to the music with ` be pipe ` ow do you like it he se mr goodman do not answer ` im because ' e be join in the chorus with one side of ` be mouth and keep ` be cigar alight with the other he just nod at ` im but ' e look so ` appy that sam feel it be a pleasure to sit there and look at ` im i wonder wot peter and ginger be doin ' he se when the song be finish i do not know se mr goodman and wot 's more i do not care if i would ` ad any idea that peter be like wot he be i should never ` ave write to ` im i can not think ` ow you can stand ` im he be not so bad se sam wonder whether he ought to tell ` im ` arf of wot peter really be like bad se mr goodman i come up to london for a ` oliday -- a change mind you -- and i think peter and I be go to ` ave a good time instead o ' that he go about with a face as long as a fiddle he do not drink ' e do not go to place of amusement -- innercent place of amusement -- and ` be idea of enjoy life be to go walk about the street and drinking cup o ' tea we must try and alter ` im ses sam arter do a bit o ' think certainly not se mr goodman lay he ` and on sam 's knee far be it from I to interfere with a feller-creature 's idea o ' wot 's right besides he might get write to ` be sister agin and she might tell my wife but peter say she be dead se sam very puzzle i married agin se peter 's uncle in a whisper ` cos people be tell ` im to keep quiet a tartar -- a perfect tartar she be in a ` orsepittle at present else i should not be ` ere and i should not ha ' be able to come if i ` ad not find five pound wot she would hide in a match-box up the chimbley but wot 'll you do when she find it out se sam open ` be eye i be go to ` ave the house clean and the chimbley sweep to welcome she ` ome ses mr goodman take a sip o ' whiskey it 'll be a little surprise for she they stay till it be over and on the bus he give sam some strong peppermint lozenge wot ' e always carry about with ` im and take some ` imself he say ' e find 'em helpful what be we go to tell peter and ginger se sam as they get near the ` ouse tell 'em se mr goodman tell 'em the truth how we foller 'em when they get off the bus and ` ave be look for 'em ever since i be not go to ` ave my ` oliday spoil by a teetotal nevvy i can tell you he start on peter wot be sit on he bed with ginger wait for they the moment he get inside and all ginger and peter could say do not make any difference mr small see you as plain as what i do he se plainer se sam but i tell you we come straight ` ome ses ginger and we have be wait for you ` ere ever since mr goodman shake he ` ead at ` im say no more about it he se in a kind voice i dessay it be rather tiresome for young man to go about with two old one and in future if you and peter keep together I and my friend mr small will do the same sam shake ` and with ` im and though peter try he ` ardest to make ` im alter he mind it be no good he uncle pat ` im on the shoulder and say they would try it for a few day at any rate and ginger wot think it be a very good idea back ` im up everybody seem pleased with the idea except peter russet but arter sam ` ad tell ` im in private wot a high opinion ` be uncle ` ad get of ` im and ` ow well off he be ' e give way they all enjoy the next evening and sam and mr goodman get on together like twin brother they go to a place of amusement every night and the on ' y unpleasantness that happen be when peter 's uncle knock a chemist 's shop up at a quarter-past twelve one night to buy a penn ` orth o ' peppermint lozenge they ` ad four of the ` appiest evening together that sam ` ad ever know and mr goodman would ` ave be just as ` appy too if it have not ha ' be for the thought o ' that five pound the more ' e think of it the more unlikely it seem that ` be wife would blame it on to the sweep and one night he take the match-box out of ` be pocket and shake he ` ead over it till sam feel quite sorry for ` im do not take up you trouble afore they come he se orsepittle be dangerous place mr goodman cheer up a bit at
