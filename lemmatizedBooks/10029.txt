lion _ conveyance a strong deeply modulate voice reply from the fly and i think he tell you it be engage kelson rejoin bluffly i do not quite understand that the voice of the occupant reply in a even tone i be sorry if there have be any misunderstanding but as i be go to the hotel -- that be no reason why you should take we fly kelson retort he temper rise at the other 's coolness i must ask you to vacate it at once he add with heat how many of you be there the man lean forward show in the doorway a handsome face dark almost to swarthiness only two surely there be no need to turn I out you do not want to play the dog in the manger there be room for all three and i shall be happy to contribute my share of the fare i do not want anything of the sort -- kelson be begin angrily when gifford intervene pacifically it be all right harry we can squeeze in the fellow seem more or less a gentleman do not let 's be churlish he add in a undertone but it be infernal impudence kelson protest yes but we do not want a row it be not as though there be another conveyance he could take all right i suppose we shall have to put up with the brute kelson assent grudgingly but i hate be bounce like this gifford take a step to the carriage-door i think we can all three pack in he say civilly i 'll take the front seat if you like the stranger say without however show much inclination to move oh no stay where you be gifford answer i fancy i be the smallest of the three i shall be quite comfortable there come along harry with no very amiable face kelson get in and take the vacant seat by the stranger he attitude be not conducive to geniality and so for a while there be silence at length as they turn from the station approach on to the main road the stranger speak he deep-toned voice have a musical ring in it yet somehow to gifford 's way of think it be detestable perhaps it be the speaker 's rather aggressive and to a man objectionable personality which make it seem so i be sorry to inconvenience you he say more with a air of say the right thing than from any real touch of regret on a occasion like this they ought to provide more conveyance but country town be hopeless oh it be all right gifford respond politely the drive be not very long a mile the man 's musical inflection jar on gifford who begin to wonder whether they companion could be a professional singer one of they own class he certainly be not i presume you gentleman be go to the hunt ball he ask yes gifford answer rather a new departure have it in a private house the man say quite a sound idea i have no doubt morriston will do we as well -- much better than we should fare at the local hotel or assembly room be you go they be the first word kelson have utter since the start and the slight surprise in they tone be not quite complimentary it must have so strike the other see that he reply with a touch of resentment : yes why not no reason at all kelson answer except that i do not remember to have see you out with the cumberbatch i dare say not the other rejoin easily it be some year since i hunt with they i be live down in the south now and when i be at home usually turn out with the bavistock quite a decent little pack _ faute de mieux _ and bobby amphlett who hunt they be a great pal of mine i see kelson observe guardedly yes i believe they be quite good as far as they go the stranger give a short laugh they or rather a top old dog-fox take we a eleven mile point the other day which be good enough in that country be in town i think i would run down to this dance for old acquaintance ' sake dare say one will meet some old friend no doubt kelson respond dryly as you have be good enough to ask I to share you fly the man observe with a rather aggressive touch of irony i may as well let you know who i be my name be henshaw clement henshaw any relation to gervase henshaw gifford ask he be my brother you know he only by reputation at my profession the bar and i come across a book of he the other day ah yes gervase scribble when he have time he be by way of be a authority on criminology and be i should say gifford add civilly yes he be a smart fellow have the brain of the family i be all for sport and the open-air life and yet think gifford glance at the dark rather intriguing face opposite to he you do not look a sportsman more a _ viveur _ than a regular open-air man more at home in london or pari than in the stubble or covert but he merely nod acceptance of henshaw 's statement my name be kelson the soldier say supply a omission due to henshaw 's talk of himself i have hunt this country pretty regularly since i leave the service and my friend be hugh gifford gifford do not wynford place where we be go to-night belong to the gifford henshaw ask curiosity overcome tact yes gifford answer to a uncle of mine he sell it lately to morriston ah a pity fine old place henshaw observe casually naturally you know it well i have have very good time there gifford answer with a certain reserve as though disincline to discuss the subject with a stranger i have come down now also for old acquaintance ' sake he add casually i see henshaw respond not altogether pleasant though to see a old family place in the hand of stranger personally when a thing be irrevocably go as i take it wynford place be i believe in let it slide out of one 's mind and have no sentiment about it no doubt a very convenient plan gifford reply dryly all the same if i can retrieve my evening kit which have go astray i hope to enjoy myself at wynford place to-night without be trouble with undue sentimentality good henshaw respond with what seem a half-smothered yawn regret for a thing that be go past recall do not pay though as long as there be a chance of get it i believe in never call oneself beat here we be at the _ lion _ chapter ii the stain flower what do you think of we acquaintance gifford say as they settle down in the private room of kelson who make the _ golden lion _ he hunting quarter not much in fact i take a particular dislike to the fellow wrong type of sportsman eh decidedly fine figure of a man and good-looking enough but spoilt by that objectionable cock-sure manner and i should say a by no means decent character a swanker to the finger-tip and that imply a liar not worth discuss kelson say he go to-morrow i make a point of inquire how long he have engage he room for one night good then we sha not be under the ungracious necessity of shake he off i can not tell you how sick i be harry at the loss of my thing no more than i be my dear fellow if only a suit of mine would fit you but that be hopeless they both laugh ruefully at the idea for captain kelson look nearly twice the size of he friend we 'll hope they 'll arrive in time for you to see something of the fun at any rate kelson say i be in no hurry i 'll wait with you you will do nothing of the sort harry gifford protest do you think i can not amuse myself for a hour or two alone you 'll go off at the proper time absurd to wait till every decent girl 's card be full i do not like it hugh nor do i but it be practically my fault in not look sharper after my luggage and better one should suffer than two so it be arrange that captain kelson should go on alone and he guest should follow as soon as he clothes turn up and he could change into they that settle they sit down to dinner tell I about the morriston harry gifford say he be a very good fellow be not he dick morriston one of the best straight goer to hound and straight in every other capacity i should say you know they use to live at friar 's norton near here before they buy you uncle 's place yes i know what be the sister like a fine handsome girl kelson answer without enthusiasm rather too cold and statuesque for my taste although i have hear she have a bit of the devil in she quite a sportswoman and as good after hound as she brother they say she have a thin time of it with she step-mother and have come out wonderfully since the old lady die lord painswick who live near here be suppose to be very sweet on she perhaps the affair will develop to-night the ball will be rather a toney affair morriston have plenty of money heap and the sister be a heiress too the old man do not nearly live up to he income and there be big accumulation which enable the son to buy we property gifford say with a tinge of bitterness well it might have be worse wynford have not pass into the hand of some jew millionaire or city speculator but have go to a gentleman a good fellow and a sportsman eh yes dick morriston be all that as the place have to go you could not have find a better man to succeed you people when the time come to start for the ball gifford go down to see he friend off and to repeat he order concern the immediate delivery of he suit-case when it should arrive henshaw be in the hall bulk big in a fur coat and complain in a masterful tone of the unpunctuality of he fly a handsome fellow gifford be constrain to acknowledge and of a strong positive character the type of man he think who could be very fascinating to woman -- and very brutal he drop he rather bully manner as he catch sight of the two friend and notice gifford 's morning clothes make a casually sympathetic remark on he bad luck oh i shall come on when my thing arrive which ought to be soon gifford respond coldly dislike the man and he rather obvious insincerity we might have drive over together henshaw say address kelson but i hardly care to propose it after the line you take at the station there be a unpleasant curl of the lip as he speak the word almost vindictively as though with intent to put kelson in the wrong but he sneer have no effect on the ex-cavalryman i be drive over in my own trap he reply coolly ignore the other 's intent you will be a good deal more comfortable in a closed carriage decidedly henshaw return with a laugh i be not so fond of a east wind as to get more of it than can be help and after all it be best to go independently to a affair of this sort one may get bore and want to leave early kelson nod with a grim appreciation of the man 's trick of argument and go out to he wait dog-cart henshaw 's fly drive up as gifford turn back from the door i suppose we shall see you towards midnight he say lightly as he pass gifford he tone clearly suggest he utter indifference in the matter i dare say gifford reply and as he go upstairs he hear a order give for mr henshaw 's fire in number 9 to be keep up against he return alone in the oak-panelled sitting-room gifford settle down to wait for he clothes he skim through several picture-papers that be lie about and then take up a novel but a restless fit be on he and he could not settle down to read he throw aside the book and begin think of the old property which he uncle have muddle away and recall the happy time he have spend there from he schoolday onward memory of the rambling old house and its park crowd upon he by force of one circumstance or another he have not be there for nearly ten year and a great impatience to see it again take hold of he he look at the clock at the best supposing there be no hitch he suit-case could hardly arrive for another hour and a half wynford place be a bare mile away perhaps twenty minute ' walk the night be fine and moonlight he be get horribly bore in that room he would stroll out and have a look at the outside of the old place after all it be only the exterior that he could expect to find unaltered doubtless the morriston with they wealth have transform the interior almost out of he knowledge anyhow he would see that later just then he simply long for a sight of the ancient house with its detach tower and the familiar landmark accordingly he fill a pipe put on a thick overcoat and a golf cap and go out leave word of he return within the hour but it be a good two hour before he reappear and the landlord who meet he with the news that the miss suit-case have be await he in he room since twenty minute past ten be strike by a certain peculiarity in he manner it be nothing very much beyond a suggestion of suppress excitement and that rather wild look which linger in a man 's eye when he be just fresh from a dispute or have experience a narrow escape from danger then gifford order a stiff glass of spirit and soda and drink it off before go up to change shall you be go to wynford place sir the landlord inquire as he glance at the clock gifford hesitate a moment yes let I have a fly in a quarter of a hour he answer but it be more than double that time when he come down dress for the dance the old house look picturesque enough in the moonlight as he approach it all the window in the main building be light up and there be a pleasant suggestion of revelry about the ivy-clad pile stand some dozen yard from the house but connect with it by a covered way be a three-storied tower the remains of a much older house and from the lower window of this light also shine gifford enter the well-remembered hall and make he way almost in a dream to the ball-room where many hunting man in pink make the scene unusually gay unable for the moment to catch sight of kelson he have to introduce himself to he host who have hear of he mishap and give he a cheerily sympathetic welcome richard morriston be a pleasant-looking man of about five or six-and-thirty the last man gifford think he would bear a grudge against for possess the old home of the gifford i be afraid you must look upon I rather in the light of a intruder here morriston say pleasantly a very acceptable one so far as i be concerned gifford respond with something more than empty civility it be very kind of you to say so he host rejoin anyhow the least i can do be to ask you with all sincerity to make yourself free of the place while you be in the neighborhood edith he call to a tall handsome girl who be just pass on a man 's arm this be mr gifford who know wynford much better than we do miss morriston leave she partner and hold out she hand we be so sorry to hear of you annoying experience she say these railway people be too stupid i be so glad you retrieve you luggage in time to come on to we gifford be look at she with some curiosity during she speech and quickly come to the conclusion that kelson 's description of she have certainly not err on the side of exaggeration she look divinely handsome in she ball-dress of a darkish shade of blue relieve by a bunch of rose in she corsage and a single diamond brooch statuesque too statuesque kelson have call she certainly she manner and bearing have a certain cold stateliness but gifford have penetration enough to see that behind the reserve and the society tone of she welcome there might easily be a depth of feeling which he friend with a lesser knowledge of human nature never suspect a interesting girl decidedly gifford conclude as he make a suitable acknowledgment of she greeting and i fancy my friend harry take a rather too superficial view of she character he think as stroll off in search of kelson he find himself watch he hostess from across the room with more than ordinary interest he soon encounter kelson come out of a gaily decorate passage which he know lead to the old tower he have a pretty girl on he arm tall and fair but with none of miss morriston 's dignified coldness this girl have a sunny laughing face and gifford think he understand why he friend have not be enthusiastic over the probable lady painswick kelson receive he with delight introduce he with a air of proprietorship it seem to he companion miss tredworth have you be explore the old tower gifford ask we have be sit out there kelson answer with a laugh they have convert the lower room into quite snug retreat in my uncle 's day they be anything but snug gifford observe i remember we use to play hide-and-seek up there he speak with preoccupation he eye fix on a bunch of white flower which the girl wear on she black dress they be slightly blotch and sprinkle with a dark color in a way which be certainly not natural and gifford hold by the peculiar sight look in wonder from the flower to the girl 's face you must give gifford a dance kelson say break up the rather awkward pause i be afraid my card be full miss tredworth say hold it up kelson laugh happily then he shall have one of mine but gifford protest indeed i will not rob you harry he declare i be tired and should be a stupid partner tire kelson remonstrate why you have be rest at the _ lion _ wait for you thing while we have be dance we hardest rest no i go out for a walk gifford reply the deuce you do where do you go to oh nowhere particular gifford answer rather evasively just about the town chapter iii the streak on the cuff hugh gifford do not stay very long at the dance he take a mouthful of supper and then tell kelson that he have a headache and be go to walk back to the _ golden lion _ kelson be distressed my dear fellow come so late and go so early it be too bad this be the best time of the night i hope the old place with its memory have not distressed you oh no be the answer but something have upset I i 'll get back and turn in by the way i do not see that man henshaw no kelson reply casually i have not see he lately but then i have have something better to think about than that ineffable bounder he be here all right in the early part of the evening one could not see anything else dancing more or less well if you will go old fellow do make yourself comfortable at the _ lion _ and call for anything you fancy i be dance this waltz gifford leave the dance and go back to the hotel he seem perplexed and worried so much so that for some time he pace he room restlessly and then instead of turn in he go back to the sitting-room light a pipe and settle himself there to await he friend 's return it be nearly three o'clock when kelson come in why hugh he exclaim in surprise still up i do not feel like sleep gifford answer and if i be to keep awake i would rather stay up kelson look at he curiously i hope the visit to you old home have not be too much for you he remark with the limited sympathy of a strong man whose nerve be not easily affect oh no gifford assure he although somehow i do feel rather out of it i have have rather a tease day but i shall be all right in the morning and be look forward to a run round the scene of my childhood good kelson respond relieved to think he friend 's visit be not after all go to be as dismal as he have begin to fear well hugh he add gaily i have a piece of news for you not that you be engage something a almost apprehensive touch in gifford 's tone rather take he friend aback why not to miss -- the girl you be dance with again gifford 's tone give a check to kelson 's enthusiasm it be with a more serious face that he reply muriel tredworth the best girl in england i hope my dear hugh you be not go to say you do not think so certainly not gifford answer promptly i never see or hear of she before to-night kelson laugh uncomfortably a man in love and in the flush of acceptance want something more than a lukewarm reception of the news i be glad to hear it he respond dryly from you tone one might almost imagine that you know something against muriel heaven forbid gifford ejaculate fervently you do not congratulate I he friend return with a touch of suspicion gifford force a laugh my dear harry you have take my breath away you deserve the best wife in the kingdom and i sincerely hope you have get she he say not very convincingly he half-heartedness not too successfully mask evidently strike kelson one would hardly suppose you think so he say in a hurt tone i wish he add warmly if there be anything at the back of you word you would speak out i should hope we be old friend enough for that gifford glance at the worried face of the big simple-minded sportsman more or less a child in he knowledge of the subtlety of human nature and as he do so he heart smite he we be and i hope we always shall be he declare grasp he hand you be make too much of my unfortunate manner to-night and i be sorry with all my heart i congratulate you and wish you every blessing and all happiness there be a unmistakable ring of sincerity in he speech now and without go aside to question its motive as a more penetrate mind might have do kelson accept he friend 's congratulation without question thanks old fellow he respond brighten as he return the grasp of gifford 's hand i be sure of you good wish you need not fear i have make a mistake muriel be a thorough good sort and we shall suit each other down to the ground we have every chance of happiness before gifford could reply there come a knock at the door the landlord enter beg you pardon captain he say i be sorry to trouble you but could you tell I whether they be keep up the hunt ball very late no mr dipper kelson answer it be all over long ago i be one of the last to come away we leave to the strain of the national anthem mr dipper 's face assume a perplexed expression thank you captain he say my reason for ask the question be that mr henshaw who have a room here have not come in not come in kelson repeat too bad to keep you up mr dipper well captain say the landlord you see it be get on for four o'clock and we want to lock up of course if the ball be go on we should be prepare to keep open all night if necessary but my driver tell I a hour ago it be over so it be i wonder -- kelson turn to gifford -- what can have become of the egregious henshaw i do not think as i tell you in the ball-room i have see he since ten o'clock gifford shrug unless he have come across friend and go off with they he could not well do that without call here for he thing kelson object i suppose he do not do that unknown to you he ask the landlord no captain he thing be all lay out in he room and the fire keep up as he order then i do not know what have become of he kelson return manifestly not interested in the subject i certainly should not keep open any longer if mr henshaw turn up at a unreasonable hour let he wait and get in when he can do not you think so hugh gifford nod i think consider the hour mr dipper will be quite justified in lock up he answer thank you gentleman i will goodnight and the landlord depart kelson turn to a side table and pour out a drink decent fellow dipper and uniformly oblige he say i certainly do not see why he should be inconvenience and keep out of he bed by that swanker who have probably go off with some pal and have not have the decency to leave word to that effect bad style of man altogether hullo what be this what be the matter gifford cross to kelson who be look at he shirt-cuff what be this a dark red streak be on the white linen hang if it do not look like blood kelson say hold it to the light gifford catch he arm and scrutinize the stain it be blood he say positively chapter iv the miss guest next morning captain kelson take he guest for a long drive round the neighborhood before start he ask the landlord at what time henshaw have return he do not come in at all captain dipper answer in a aggrieved tone he fire be keep up all night for nothing i suppose he have be here this morning kelson observe casually no be the prompt reply nothing have be see or hear of he here since he leave last night for the ball kelson whistle that look rather queer do not it hugh gifford nod very i should say what do you make of it he ask the landlord that worthy spread out he hand in a gesture of helplessness it be beyond I gentleman we can none of we make it out i have never know anything quite like it happen all the year i have be in the business oh you 'll have a explanation in the course of the morning all right say kelson with a smile at the host 's worry do not take it too seriously it be not worth it you have get mr henshaw 's luggage which indemnify you and he be manifestly a person quite capable of take care of himself mr dipper give a doubtful jerk of the head it be very mysterious all the same kelson laugh as he go off with he friend i be afraid i can not get up much interest in the doings of the objectionable henshaw he remark lightly as they start off such man as he know what they be about and be not too punctilious with regard to other people 's inconvenience no gifford respond quietly all the same he non-appearance be a little mysterious kelson blow away the suggestion of mystery in a short contemptuous laugh oh he be probably up to some devilry with some fool of a girl he say in a offhand tone i know the type of man they have a keen scent for impressionable woman of whom a fellow of that sort have always half-a-dozen in tow no doubt that be what he come down here for -- a tender adventure that be the only kind of hunting he be keen on take my word for it i quite agree with you there gifford answer with conviction and the subject drop when they return for luncheon they find that nothing have be hear of the _ golden lion 's _ miss guest it be rather a extraordinary move of we friend 's kelson observe with a laugh he surely can not be live all this time in he evening clothes not but what a man like that would not let a trifle stand in he way if he have some scampish sport in view no doubt he be up to a dodge or two by way of obviate these little difficulty in the afternoon the two friend go up to wynford place to call after the dance kelson have naturally be much more inclined to drive over to the tredworth about seven mile away in order to settle he betrothal but gifford suggest that the duty call should be pay first and so it be arrange to kelson 's delight he hear that muriel tredworth and she brother be come over next day to stay with the morriston for another dance in the neighborhood and a near meet of the hound so he warm to the morriston chat away in all a lover 's high spirit by the way he say presently as they sit over tea rather a extraordinary thing have happen at the _ golden lion _ what be that ask he host do you notice a man name henshaw here last night a big dark fellow probably a stranger to you but by way of be a former follower of the cumberbatch a old fellow morriston ask oh no about six-and-thirty i should say eh hugh under forty certainly gifford answer tall and very dark almost to swarthiness of course i remember the man morriston exclaim with sudden recollection i introduce he to a partner i notice the fellow observe lord painswick who also be call theatrical sort of chap what have he do kelson laugh simply disappear that be all disappear there be a chorus of interest how do you mean morriston ask leave the hotel at nine last night and have never turn up since kelson say with a air of tell a amusing story poor host dipper be take it quite tragically notwithstanding the satisfactory point in the case that the egregious henshaw 's elaborate kit still remain in he unoccupied bedroom do you mean to say he never come back all night miss morriston ask never kelson assure she old dipper come to we half asleep at four o'clock to ask whether he be justify in lock up the establishment and nothing have be see or hear of the man since gifford put in that be queer morriston say as though scarcely know whether to take it seriously or otherwise now i come to think of it i do not recollect see anything of the man after quite the first part of the evening do you painswick no can not say i do painswick answer and observe kelson he be not a man to be easily overlook when he be on show i miss he not altogether disagreeably after the early dance what be the idea edith morriston inquire be there any theory to account for he disappearance no kelson answer unless a discreditable one go off at a tangent and still in he evening thing painswick say with a laugh rather uncomfortable this weather that remind I morriston say with sudden animation one of the footman bring I a fur coat and a soft hat this morning and ask I if they be mine they have be unclaimed after the dance and he have ascertain that they belong to none of the man who be stay here nor be they mine that be most curious kelson say with a mystified air henshaw be wear a fur coat and soft hat when we see he in the hall of the _ lion _ just before start do not you remember hugh yes certainly he be gifford answer then they must be he morriston conclude and where be he -- without they painswick add with a laugh dead of cold it be altogether quite mysterious morriston observe with a puzzle air he can not be here still hardly he sister reply you know he she ask kelson quite casually so far as nearly come to a rough and tumble with the fellow for he cheek in scoff we fly at the station constitute a acquaintance gifford act as peacemaker and we put up with the fellow 's company to the town but neither of we imbibe a particularly high opinion of the sportsman do we hugh no gifford assent he be not a take character to man at any rate and we rather wonder how he come to be go to the cumberbatch ball no doubt he get he ticket in the ordinary way morriston say it only show my dear dick he sister observe you may quite easily run risk in give a semi-public dance in you own house morriston laugh oh come edith he protest we need not make too much of it we do not know for certain that the man be a queer character one find objectionable swaggerer everywhere painswick put in anyhow say kelson if this henshaw be a bad lot he have the decency to efface himself promptly enough the puzzle be what on earth have become of he i do not know mr gifford morriston say as the two friend be leave whether you would care for a ramble over the old place a man name piercy have write to I for permission to go over the house he be it appear write a book on the antiquity of the county i have ask he to luncheon to-morrow and we shall be delighted if you and kelson will join we as a preliminary to a personally conduct tour of the house charlie tredworth and he sister be come over for a week 's stay so we shall be quite a respectable party naturally kelson accept the invitation with alacrity and gifford could do no less than fall in with the arrangement hope you will not mind go over to wynford kelson say as they drive back if it be at all painful to you from old association i 'll make a excuse for you gifford hesitate a moment oh no he answer i 'll come there be no use in be sentimental about the place go out of we family and these morriston be quite the right sort of people to have it a splendidly thoroughbred type of girl miss morriston kelson laugh oh yes a magnificent creature cut out for a duchess only you know my dear hugh if i marry a woman like that i should always be a little afraid of she a magnificent chatelaine and all that but too cold for my taste you think there be no deep feeling under the ice of she manner i do not know kelson reply as though the idea be quite novel to he never get so far as to think of that i like a girl with whom you can get on without go through the process of thaw she first and with edith morriston i should say it would be a slow process anyhow she be just the girl for painswick who be evidently after she i should say that with he the ice be a little below the surface gifford venture kelson laugh you have hit it hugh he be easy enough but scratch he and you come upon a very straight-laced aristocrat he and the statuesque edith morriston be make for one another as they enter the _ golden lion _ the landlord meet they well mr dipper any news of you miss guest kelson inquire with characteristic cheeriness ignore the troubled expression on that worthy 's face no captain and we can not imagine what have happen to mr henshaw there be three telegram come for he and i have just get one reply-paid to ask whether he be stay here and you reply go to hunt ball 9 last night not be here since dipper quote it be rather awkward and unpleasant for I sir he add uncomfortably oh you have no responsibility in the matter kelson assure he do not you worry about it mr dipper if the man go out and do not choose to come back that beyond the payment of you charge can be no affair of yours be not that so hugh certainly gifford assent still they host look anything but satisfied yes sir that be quite right all the same we be begin not to like the look of it it be very mysterious it be mr dipper to say the least of it kelson reply still from such opinion as we be able to form of mr henshaw i do not think it worth while make much fuss about it he 'll turn up all right and probably call you a fool for you pain i would not worry about it if i be you gifford say quietly as they turn to go upstairs a telegraph boy come in and hand he message to the landlord who read it and hand it to kelson please wire I without fail directly mr henshaw return gervase henshaw 8 stone court temple london kelson read that be he brother gifford observe all right say kelson let he worry if he like all you have to do mr dipper be what he ask you there he go upstairs with gifford leave the landlord reperus the telegram he plump face dark with misgive chapter v the lock room that night the miss man do not return nor be anything hear of he the morning bring no news and even kelson begin to think there might be something serious in it if it be anybody but that man he say casually over a hearty breakfast i should say it would be worth while take step to find out what have become of he but that fellow can take care of himself and when you come to think of it he come down here a outsider to the ball be in itself rather fishy gifford agree and they fall to discuss the day 's plan kelson be go to drive over to have the momentous interview with miss tredworth 's father he anticipate no difficulty there still as he say the thing have get to be do and the sooner it be over the better why not go to-morrow gifford suggest there will be rather a rush to-day kelson a man of action scoff at the idea oh no muriel and charlie be come over to wynford to luncheon i shall simply get the thing settle and drive back with they so it be arrange gifford spend the morning in a stroll about the familiar neighborhood and when luncheon time come they all meet at wynford place miss morriston be not present she brother apologize for she absence say she have be oblige to keep a engagement to lunch with a friend but that she have promise to return quite early in the afternoon mr piercy the antiquarian prove to be by no means as dry as he pursuit suggest he be a lively little man with a fund of interesting story furnish by the lighter side of he work and altogether the luncheon be quite amusing when it be over morriston suggest that not to waste the daylight they should begin they tour of the house he call upon gifford to share the duty of guidance and the party move off hope you have not be bore all the morning hugh kelson say to he friend as they find themselves side by side any news at the _ lion _ have henshaw turn up yet gifford shake he head no host dipper have have another telegram of inquiry from the brother but have nothing to tell he in return kelson 's face become grave it really do begin to look serious he remark yes dipper have be interview the police on the subject have he well i only hope henshaw have not be play the fool or worse and cause all this fuss for nothing the party move on to the great hall where the dancing have take place and so to the passage connect the main building with the ancient tower now this be the part which will no doubt interest you most mr piercy morriston say this fourteenth century tower which be to-day in a really wonderful state of preservation ah yes the archaeologist murmur they could build in those day they examine the two lower room on the ground and first floor remark on the thickness of the wall show by the depth of the window embrasure which in older day have be put to sterner purpose they admire the solid strength of the tie and hammer-beam in the roof and scrutinize the few article of ancient furniture and tapestry the room contain and the massive oaken iron-bound door which admit to the garden now we will go up to the top room morriston propose it be use only for lumber but there be quite a good view from it he precede the rest of the party up the wind stair to the topmost door hullo he exclaim push at it the door be lock and the key appear to have be take away he add bend down and feel about in the imperfect light the whole party be consequently hold up on the narrow stair i 'll go and ask what have become of the key morriston say make he way past they in a minute he return presently follow by the butler how be it that this top door be lock stent he ask and where be the key i do not know sir alfred mention this morning that the door be lock and the key take away we think you must have lock it sir i no i have not be up here since the morning of the ball when i have those old thing bring up from the lower room to be out of the way do you lock the door then sir no why should i i be certain i do not perhaps one of the man do just go and inquire and have the key look for very good sir this be rather provoke morriston say as they wait i particularly want to show you the view which should be lovely on a clear day like this if we have to wait much longer the light will be go besides it be quite a quaint old room with a curious recess form by the bartizan you may have notice from outside presently the butler return accompany by a footman with several key we can not find the right key sir he announce no one seem to have see it alfr have bring a few like it think one might possibly fit none of they however would go into the lock not even the smallest of they i can not make it out sir say the man kneel to get more effectively to work but no key would enter the footman at last take a box of match from he pocket strike a light and hold it to the key-hole peer in why the key be in the lock on the other side sir he say in astonishment then the door can not be lock morriston say push it the footman rise and push too but the door show no sign of yield it be fasten sure enough this be strange morriston say hi be any one in there he shout but no response come be you sure the key be in the door on the inside he ask certain sir will you look for yourself sir the man reply striking another match and hold it so that he master could convince himself no doubt about that morriston declare as he rise from he scrutiny it be the most extraordinary thing i have ever know can you account for it stent the butler shake he head no sir unless someone be in there now morriston again shout but no answer come i presume there be no way out of the room but this door piercy ask none morriston answer except the window and that be i should say quite eighty foot from the ground eh mr gifford a sheer drop of quite that distance he answer a prohibitive mode of exit piercy observe with a smile yes morriston say i can not understand it at all besides who would be likely to want to play trick here we have have no sign of burglar and in any case they would hardly have be able to bring a ladder long enough to reach up to that window well we must have the mystery clear up i think stent you have better send one of the man on a bicycle into branchester to fetch a locksmith and have the door open somehow have it explain to he that it may be a tough job in the meantime we may as well go and view the tower from the outside as we can not get in accordingly the whole party go down into the hall and so out to the garden where they stroll round the house piercy meanwhile take note of its architectural feature as they come to the tower the ray of a late winter sun be striking it almost horizontally light it up in a picturesque glow piercy with he archaeological knowledge be able to tell the owner and gifford a good deal about the ancient structure of which they have previously be ignorant the sunset would have be worth see from that top window morriston say evidently perplexed and annoyed over the mystery of the lock door i can not make out what have happen the person who lock the door assuredly do not make he exit by the window kelson remark with a laugh as he look up at the sheer surface of the upper wall unless he be bent on suicide in which case we should have find what be leave of he at the foot of the tower as they go on round the house miss morriston be see come up the drive she brother hurry forward to meet she i say edith he exclaim we be in a great fix can you explain how the door of the top room in the tower come to be lock with the key inside miss morriston look surprised what dick we can not get in morriston explain we find the door lock and the key miss and then when alfr try another key he find the right one be in the lock but inside the room miss morriston think a moment my dear dick the door can not be lock it be i tell you he return most certainly lock we have try it and find it quite fast then there must be someone in the room he sister say that morriston reply seem the only possible explanation but i shout several time and get no answer someone play you a trick and the girl laugh but who who he return he sister give a shrug oh you 'll find out soon enough she reply with a smile i shall he reply as two man appear make for the servant ' entrance here come henry with the locksmith miss morriston in she stately way look amuse my dear old dick you have be make a fuss about it you will probably find the door open when you go up and i 'll know who have be play this stupid trick morriston say wrathfully a footman make love to a housemaid turn the key in a panic at be trap kelson say to he host i dare say morriston reply with a laugh of ill-humour and he 'll have to pay for he impudence that explanation by its feasibility be generally accept as the simple solution of the mystery come along morriston call we 'll all go up and see whether the door be open or not we shall just be in time to catch the sunset he lead the way through the hall and the corridor beyond and so up the wind stair what not open yet he exclaim as the last turn show the workman busy at the lock well this be extraordinary the locksmith be kneel and work at the door while the footman stand over he hold a candle the key be in the lock inside be not it morriston ask yes sir the man answer there be no doubt about that how do you account for it the man look up from he task and shake he head can not account for it sir unless so be as there be someone inside can you open it yes sir i 'll have it turn in a minute he take from he bag a long pair of hollow pliers which he insert in the lock and then screw tightly clutch the end of the key then fitting a transverse rod to the pliers and use it as a lever he carefully force the key round and so shoot back the lock there be a short pause while the man unscrew he instrument then he step back and push open the door morriston go in quickly there be the key sure enough he say look round at the inside of the door he take a couple of step farther into the room only to utter a exclamation of intense surprise and horror then turn quickly with a almost scared face go back he cry hoarsely hold up he hand with a arrest gesture kelson mr gifford come here a moment and shut the door look he say in a breathless whisper point to the floor beneath the window through which the deep orange light of the decline sun be stream a exclamation come from kelson as he see the object which morriston indicate and he turn with a stupefied look to gifford my -- gifford 's tooth be set and he fall a step backward as though in repulsion on the floor between the window and a old oak table which have practically hide it from the doorway lay the body of a man in evening clothes one side of he shirt-front stain a dark color although the face lay in the shadow of the high window-sill there be no mistake the man 's identity henshaw kelson gasp chapter vi the mystery of clement henshaw it be the missing man henshaw sure enough the swarthy hue of he face have in death turn almost to black but the feature together with the man 's big muscular figure be unmistakable for some moment the three man stand look at the body in something like bewilderment scarcely realize that so terrible a tragedy have be enact in that place amid those surroundings suicide kelson be the first to break the silence must have be morriston respond or how could the door have be lock from the inside i will send at once for the police and we must have a doctor although that be obviously useless he go to the door then turn will you stay here or -- kelson make a irresolute movement as though waver between the imply invitation to quit the room and a inclination not to run away from the grim business he glance at gifford who show no sign of move just as you like he reply in a hushed voice perhaps we have better stay here till you come back all right morriston assent do not let any one come in and i suppose we ought not to move anything in the room till the police have see it he go out close the door i can not make this out hugh kelson say pull himself together and move to the opposite side of the room no gifford respond mechanically he kelson continue certainly do not give one the idea of a man who have come down here to make away with himself on the contrary he friend murmur in the same preoccupy tone what do you think how can you account for it kelson demand as appeal to the other 's greater knowledge of the world it seem to be with a effort that gifford release himself from the fascination that hold he gaze to the tragedy it be a absolute mystery he reply move to where he friend stand a woman in it for a moment gifford do not answer then he say no doubt about it i should imagine it be awful kelson say drive perhaps for the first time in he life from he habitually casual way of regard serious thing and maybe rouse by gifford 's apathy we do not like -- the man do not appeal to we but to die like this it be horrible and i dare say it happen while the dance be in full swing down there why man muriel and i be in the room below i propose to she there and all the time this be just above we it be horrible one do not like to think of it gifford say reticently i can not understand it kelson go on with a sharp gesture of perplexity i can imagine some sort of love affair bring the poor fellow down to this place but that he should come up here and do this thing even if it go wrong be more than i can conceive take the man as we know he it be out of all reason yes gifford assent but we do not know yet that it be a case of suicide what else kelson return how otherwise could the door have be lock unless -- he glance sharply at the deep recess or inner chamber form by the bartizan hesitate a moment and then go quickly to it look in no nothing there he announce with a breath of relief i have for the moment a idea it might have be a double tragedy he add with a shudder so we be force back to the suicide theory gifford remark he have go to the landing outside the door yes kelson reply as he join he but as to the woman in the case who could she possibly have be i know most of the girl who be at the dance and the idea of a tragedy with any one of they seem inconceivable one would think so gifford respond and yet -- you think it possible kelson demand incredulously possible if far from probable the other answer with conviction there be woman who can be as secret as the grave at any rate so far as appearance to the outer world be concerned i wonder whom he dance with do you remember no i seem to recollect he with a girl in a light green dress but that do not take we far footstep on the stairway announce they host 's return the police will be here directly he report and i hope a doctor i have do my best to keep it from the lady and i do not think that so far any of they have a exact idea of what make I turn they back just as well the horror should be keep dark as long as possible it be such a awful blow to I that i can scarcely realize it yet miss morriston do not know kelson ask no and i only hope it will not give she a dislike to the house when she do for i be hope to have she here a good deal with I even if she marry a police inspector accompany by a detective and a constable now arrive morriston take they into the room of death gifford grasp kelson 's arm i do not think there be any use in we stay here he suggest let we go down the other man nod and they begin to descend you be not go kelson morriston cry hurry to the door we think we could be of no use and might be in the way gifford reply oh i wish you would stay morriston urge go down a few step to they i know it be not pleasant on the contrary it be a ghastly affair but i should like to have you with I till this police business be over i will not ask you to stay up here but if you do not mind wait downstairs i should be so grateful i might want you advice you 'll find the rest of the party in the drawing-room the two could do no less than promise and with a word of thanks morriston go back to the official as the two man cross the hall the drawing-room door open and miss morriston come out be my brother come she ask he will be down soon gifford answer in as casual a tone as he could assume the girl seem strike by the gravity of they face as she glance from one to the other i hope nothing be wrong she observe with just a shade of apprehension there be a momentary pause as each man hesitate between a direct falsehood the truth and a plausible excuse rather wait for the other to speak gifford answer no nothing that you need worry about miss morriston you brother will tell you later on but the hesitation seem to have arouse the girl 's suspicion do tell I now she say with just a tremor of anxiety underlie the characteristic coldness of she tone unless she add it be something not exactly proper for I to hear kelson quickly avail himself of the loophole she give he you have better wait and hear it from dick he say suggest a move towards the drawing-room in the meantime there be nothing you need be alarm about it all sound very mysterious miss morriston return she apprehension scarcely hide by a forced smile i must go and ask dick -- as she turn towards the passage lead to the tower kelson spring forward and intercept she no no miss morriston he remonstrate with a prohibit gesture do not go up there now take my word for it you have better not dick will be down directly to explain what be wrong for a few moment she eye rest on he searchingly very well she say at length if you say i ought not to go i will not but you do not lessen my anxiety to know what have happen there be no particular cause for anxiety on you part kelson say reassuringly she have turn and now lead the way to the drawing-room as they enter they be receive by expectant look well be the mystery solve young tredworth inquire kelson give he a silencing look you 'll hear all about it in good time he reply between lightness and gravity piercy rise to take he leave oh you must not go yet miss morriston protest they be just bring tea but i fear i may be in the way if there be anything -- he urge oh no he hostess insist i do not know of anything wrong at least neither captain kelson nor mr gifford will admit anything you must have tea before you long drive the subject of the mystery in the tower be tacitly drop perhaps from a vague feeling that it be best not allude to at any rate by the lady and the conversation flow with more or less effort on ordinary local topic tea over piercy take he leave you must come again mr piercy while you be in this part of the county miss morriston say graciously when you shall have no episode of lose key to hinder you research my brother shall write to you kelson take the depart visitor out into the hall to see he off you 'll see it all in the papers to-morrow i expect he say in a confidential tone so there be no harm in tell you there have be a most gruesome discovery in that lock room a man who be here at the hunt ball have be find dead suicide no doubt the police be here now good heaven a mercy the lady do not see it yes they 'll have to know sooner or later the later the better yes indeed any idea of the cause of the sad business none as yet a complete mystery probably a woman in it not unlikely good-bye as kelson turn from the door morriston and another man appear at the farther end of the hall and call to he you know dr page he say as kelson join they a terrible business this doctor kelson observe as they shake hand the medico draw in a breath and at first sight in the highest degree mysterious he say gravely dr page say morriston have make a cursory examination of the body the autopsy will take place elsewhere the police be make note of everything important and after dark will remove the body quietly by the tower door so i hope the lady will know nothing of the tragedy just yet as they be speak a footman have open the hall-door and now approach with a card on a salver can you see this gentleman sir he say morriston take the card and as he glance at it a expression of pain cross he face he hand it silently to kelson who give it back with a grave nod it be the card of mr gervase henshaw ii stone court temple eg chapter vii the incredulity of gervase henshaw show mr henshaw into the library morriston say to the footman this be horribly tragic he add in a low tone to kelson but it have to be go through and perhaps the sooner the better he brother yes he mention he on we way from the station the other evening at any rate he will be able to see the situation for himself you will come with I morriston suggest you might fetch you friend gifford kelson nod open the drawing-room door and call gifford out while morriston wait in the hall the brother have turn up he say as the two man join he no doubt to make inquiry what be we to say to he there be nothing to be say but the bare inevitable truth gifford answer you can not now break it to he by degree morriston lead the way to the library by the fire stand a keen-featured sharp-eyed man of middle height and lithe figure whose manner and first movement as the door open show alertness and energy of character there be a certain likeness to he brother in the feature and dark complexion as well as in a suggestion of unpleasant aggressiveness in the expression of he face but where the dead man 's personality have suggest determination overlaid with a easy-going indulgent spirit of hedonism this man seem to bristle with a restless mental activity to be all brain one whose pleasure lay manifestly on the intellectual side one thing gifford quickly note as he look at the man with a painful curiosity be that the face before he lack much of the suggestion of evil which in the brother he have find so repellent this man could surely be hard enough on occasion the strong jaw and a certain hardness in the eye tell that but except perhaps for a uncomfortable excess of sharpness there be none of he brother 's rather brutally scoff cast of expression henshaw seem to regard the two man follow morriston into the room with a certain apprehensive surprise i hope you will pardon my troubling you like this he say to morriston speaking in a quick decide tone but i have be rather anxious as to what have become of my brother of whom i can get no news he come down to the cumberbatch hunt ball which i understand be hold in this house and from that evening seem to have mysteriously disappear he have a important business engagement for the next day Wednesday which he fail to keep and this may mean a considerable loss to he can you throw any light on he movement down here morriston dread to break the news abruptly have not interrupted he question i be sorry to say i can he now answer in a subdue tone sorry henshaw catch up the word quickly what do you mean have he meet with a accident worse than that morriston answer sympathetically henshaw with a start fall back a step worse he repeat you do not mean to say -- he be dead dead surprise and shock raise the word almost to a shout you -- we have morriston say quietly only discover the terrible truth within the last hour or so but dead henshaw protest incredulously how -- how can he be dead how do he die a accident i be afraid it look as though by he own hand morriston answer in a hushed voice the expression of incredulity on henshaw 's face manifestly deepen by he own hand he echo suicide clement commit suicide impossible inconceivable one would think so indeed morriston reply with sympathy may i tell you the fact so far as we know they if you please the word be rap out almost peremptorily morriston point to a chair but he visitor in he preoccupation seem to take no notice of the gesture continue to stand restlessly in a attitude of strained attention the other three man have seat themselves morriston without further preface relate the story of the lock door in the tower and of the subsequent discovery when it have be open henshaw hear he to the end in what seem a mood of hardly restrained somewhat resentful impatience i do not understand it at all he say when the story be finish nor do any of we morriston return promptly the whole affair be as mysterious as it be lamentable still it appear to be clearly a case of suicide suicide henshaw echo with a certain scornful incredulity why suicide in connexion with my brother the idea seem utterly preposterous the door lock on the inside morriston suggest that i grant you be at first sight mysterious enough henshaw return he keen eye fix on morriston but even that do not reconcile I to the monstrous improbability of my brother clement take he own life i know he too well to admit that unfortunately morriston reply sympathetically restrain any approach to a argumentative tone you brother be practically a stranger to I and to we all my friend here captain kelson and mr gifford meet he casually at the railway station and drive with he to the _ golden lion _ in the town where they all put up henshaw 's sharp scrutiny be immediately transfer from morriston to he companion can you gentleman throw any light on the matter he ask sharply none at all i be sorry to say kelson answer readily i may as well tell you how we very slight acquaintance with he come about if you please henshaw respond in a tone more of command than request kelson naturally ignore he questioner 's slightly offensive manner thereupon related the circumstance of the encounter at the station-yard and of the subsequent drive to the town merely soften the detail of they preliminary altercation henshaw listen alertly intent it seem to seize upon any point which do not satisfy he that be all you see of my unfortunate brother he demand at the end we see he for a few moment in the hall of the hotel just as we be start kelson answer you drive here together no no you brother take a hotel carriage and i drive in my own trap with mr -- he indicate gifford who up to this point have not speak no gifford answer i come on later a suit-case with my evening thing have go astray -- be carry on in the train and i have to wait till it be return henshaw stare at he for a moment sharply as though the statement have about it something vaguely suspicious seem about to put another question check himself and turn about with a gesture of perplexity i do not understand it at all he mutter then suddenly face round again he say sharply to gifford have you anything to add sir to what you friend have tell I i can say nothing more gifford answer henshaw turn away again and seem as though but half satisfy the fact he say in a lawyer-like tone do not appear to lead we far but when ascertain fact stop short they may be supplement apart from what be actually know -- i ask this as the dead man 's only brother -- have either of you gentleman form any idea as to how he come by he death he be look at morriston he cross-examining manner now soften by the human touch it have not occur to I to look beyond what seem the obvious explanation of suicide morriston answer frankly henshaw turn to kelson and you sir have you any idea beyond the known fact none be the answer except that he take he own life the door lock on -- henshaw interrupt he sharply now you be get back to the fact captain kelson i tell you the idea of my brother clement take he own life be to I absolutely inconceivable have you any idea however far-fetched as to what really may have happen kelson shake he head none except i must say he look to I the last man who would do such a act i should think so henshaw return decidedly then he address himself to gifford i must ask you sir the same question and i can give you no more satisfactory answer gifford say as a man with knowledge of the world as i take you to be henshaw urge keenly no at least you agree with you friend here that my poor brother do not strike one as be a man liable to make away with himself certainly but one can never tell i know nothing of he or he affair but i do henshaw retort vehemently and i tell you gentleman the thing be utterly impossible but we shall see the body -- be it here the police have charge of it in the room where he be find it be to be remove at nightfall you will wish to see it morriston answer yes morriston lead the way to the tower explain as he go the arrangement on the night of the ball henshaw speak little he mood seem dissatisfied and resentful but he sharp eye seem to take everything in once he ask do my brother dance much he be introduce to a partner morriston reply but after that no one seem to have notice he in the ball-room you mean he disappear quite early in the evening yes so far as we have be able to ascertain morriston answer naturally before this awful discovery we have be much exercise by he mysterious disappearance and failure to return to the hotel all the same henshaw return sourly one can hardly accept the inference that he come down here for the express purpose of make away with himself in you house no i can not understand it morriston reply as he turn and begin to ascend the wind stairway on the threshold of the topmost floor he pause this be the door we find lock on the inside he observe quietly henshaw give a keen look round and nod morriston push open the door and they enter the body of clement henshaw still lay on the floor in charge of the detective and the inspector the third man have be despatch to the town to make arrangement for its removal with a nod to the official henshaw advance to the body and bent over it poor clement he murmur after a few moment ' scrutiny henshaw turn to the officer i be the brother of the decease he say address more particularly the detective what do you make of this the question be put in the same sharp business-like tone which have characterize he utterance in the library judge by the door be lock on the inside the detective answer sympathetically it can only be a case of suicide henshaw frown it will take a good deal to persuade I of that he retort mr -- detective-sergeant finch mr finch do the doctor say suicide i do not hear he express a definite opinion do you inspector no mr finch i rather presume the doctor take it for grant take it for grant henshaw echo contemptuously i be not go to take it for grant i can tell you do the doctor examine the body he make a cursory examination he be arrange to meet the police surgeon for a autopsy to-morrow morning on the table lay a narrow-bladed chisel the lower portion of the bright steel discolor with the dark stain of blood the inspector point to it that be the instrument with which the wound must have be make he remark in a subdue tone it be find lie beside the body henshaw take it up and run he eye over it how could he have get this he demand look round with what seem a distrustful glance i can only suggest morriston answer that one of my man must have leave it when some work be do here a few day ago that be so apparently mr morriston the detective corroborate it have be identify by hayne the estate carpenter henshaw put down the chisel and for some moment keep silence tighten he thin lip as though in strenuous thought then suddenly he demand beyond the fact that the door be find lock from within what reason have you for you conclusion mr finch shrug we do not see how it could be otherwise sir he reply with quiet conviction clearly the deceased gentleman must have be alone in the room when he die might he not have lock the door after the wound be give henshaw suggest in a tone of cross-examination dr page be of opinion that death or at any rate unconsciousness must have be almost instantaneous finch rejoin respectfully even suppose the autopsy bear out that view i shall not be satisfied henshaw declare the inspector take up the argument you see sir take into consideration the position of the room it would be impossible for any second party who may have be here with the decease to leave it undiscovered except by the door to drop from this window which be the only one large enough to admit of a adult body pass through would mean pretty certain death anyhow the party would have be so injure that get clear away would be out of the question will you see for yourself sir he throw back the window and invite henshaw to look down the argument seem conclusive be the window find open or shut it be find unlatched sir finch answer but the servant think that it be open that morning and owe to the extra work in the house that day its fastening in the evening be overlook even if a second person have let himself down from the window the inspector argue the rope would have be here henshaw keep silence seemingly indifferent to the official ' argument i can only tell you i be far from satisfy with the suicide theory he say at length my brother be not that sort of man he have nerve of iron he be in love with life and all it mean to he and he make it a rule never to let anything worry he let the other fellow worry be he motto well we shall see he turn towards the door and as he do so he catch sight of a cardboard box in which be a collection of various article jewellery a watch and chain money a pocket-handkerchief a letter and a dance program the contents of decease 's pocket the inspector observe answer henshaw 's glance of curiosity we have collect and make a list of they and they will in due course be hand to you or to he heir on the coroner 's order be that a letter may i see it as the official hesitate henshaw have snatch the paper a fold note and rapidly run he eye through its contents then he give a curious laugh as he turn over the paper as though seek a address and lay it back in the box a note from my brother to a anonymous lady he observe quietly perhaps if we could find out whom it be mean for she would throw some light on the mystery chapter viii kelson 's perplexity what do you think of mr gervase henshaw kelson say as late in the afternoon he and gifford walk towards the town together henshaw have leave wynford place half a hour previously have keep to the end he attitude of resentful incredulity a nailer gifford answer shortly yes kelson agree he give one the idea of a man who will make trouble if he can as offensive as he brother be i should say although in a different line i do not detect one sign of any consideration for the morriston in they horribly unpleasant position no gifford agree i be very sorry for morriston he behave extremely well consider the irritatingly antagonistic line the man choose to take up brainy man henshaw unpleasantly sharp eh yes gifford reply add to he legal training he be by way of be a expert in criminology i do hope kelson remark thoughtfully he be not go to make himself unpleasant down here the scandal will be quite enough without that horribly rough luck on the morriston as new-comer here to have a affair like this happen in they house i can not think what bring the man down here no he come with a purpose that be certain a woman in it no doubt one can quite sympathize with the brother 's incredulity as to the suicide theory though hardly with he manner of show it the dead man be not that sort the idea be simply staggering gifford make no response and for a while they walk on in silence presently he ask how do you get on to-day -- i mean with colonel tredworth oh everything go off beautifully kelson answer he tone brighten with the change of subject the old boy give I he consent and he blessing i have scarcely be able as yet to appreciate my luck with this affair at wynford place intervene no gifford respond mechanically it be calculate to drive everything else out of one 's head it be suggest say kelson that we should be marry quite soon the tredworth be go abroad next month and do not propose to hurry back so it mean that if the wedding do not take place before they leave it must be postpone till probably the autumn i should think the latter would be the best plan kelson turn quickly to he companion to postpone it he exclaim in a rather hurt tone why on earth should we we have nothing to wait for i mean money or anything of that sort no but settlement take a long time to draw up not if the lawyer be tell to hurry up with they then you will have to find a house and get furniture and there be the trousseau gifford urge oh kelson return with a show of impatience all these detail can be get over in two or three week if we set ourselves to do it i do not believe in wait once the thing be settle i do not believe in rush matter gifford rejoin least of all matrimony kelson stop dead why hugh he say in a expostulatory tone what be the matter with you you be most confoundedly unsympathetic any one would think you do not want I to marry the girl i certainly do not want you to be in too great a hurry gifford return calmly but why why i feel it be a mistake kelson laugh you be not go to suggest we do not know we own mind hardly but why not wait till the family return of course it be no business of mine no kelson reply with a laugh of annoyance and you can not be expect to enter into my feeling on the subject but i think you might be a little less grudging of you sympathy you quite mistake I harry gifford reply warmly it be only in you own interest that i counsel you not to be in a hurry but why what in heaven 's name do you mean kelson demand vaguely apprehensive it be a mistake to rush thing that be all be the unsatisfactory answer if i see the slightest chance of danger i would not hesitate to take you advice kelson say but i do not nor do you since when have you become so cautious gifford force a laugh it be come on with age kelson clap he on the shoulder do not encourage it my dear hugh it will spoil all the enjoyment in you life and in other people 's too if you force the note i promise you i will not hurry on the wedding more than be absolutely necessary very well gifford respond and the subject drop they have finish dinner at which the absorb subject of the tragedy at wynford place be the main topic of they conversation when the landlord come in to say that mr gervase henshaw who be stay at the hotel would like to see they if they be disengage kelson look across at he friend shall we see he gifford nod we have better hear what he have to say we do not want he worry morriston ask mr henshaw up kelson say to the landlord and in a minute he be usher in with a quick decisive movement henshaw take the seat to which kelson invite he i trust you will not think I intrusive gentleman he begin in he sharp mode of speaking but you will understand i be very much upset and horribly perplexed by the terrible fate which have overtake my poor brother i be set myself to search for a clue if ever so slight to the mystery the double mystery i may say and it occur to I that perhaps a talk with you gentleman who be so far the last known person who speak with he might possibly give I a hint i be afraid there be very little we can tell you gifford reply but we be at you service thank you it seem the first civil word of acknowledgment they have hear he utter first of all he proceed fall back to he dry lawyer-like tone i have be to see the medical man who be summon to look at the body dr page he tell I that so far as he cursory examination go the position of the wound hardly suggest that it be self-inflicted be he sure of it kelson ask he will not be positive till he have make the autopsy henshaw answer he merely suggest that it be a very awkward and altogether unlikely place for a man to wind himself anyhow that guard opinion be enough to strengthen my inclination to scout the idea of suicide then say kelson we be face by the difficulty of the lock door henshaw make a gesture of indifference that at first sight present a problem i admit he say but not so complete as to look absolutely insoluble i have as you may be aware make a study of criminology and in my research which have include criminality have come across incident which to the smartest detective brain be at the outset quite as baffling clement 's tragic end be a great blow to I and i be not go quietly to accept the easy obvious conclusion of suicide i know and appreciate my brother better than that i mean to probe this business to the bottom you will be justified kelson murmur i think so -- by the result be the quick rejoinder gifford speak what do you think be the real object in you brother come down here henshaw look at he questioner keenly before he answer it be my opinion my conviction there be a lady in the case may i ask what prompt you to ask the question gifford shrug some idea of the sort be in my own mind he reply with a reserve which could scarcely be satisfy to henshaw perhaps he say keenly you have also a idea who the lady be gifford shake he head not at all he return promptly then why should the idea have suggest itself to you come the cross-examining rejoinder you brother be not a member of the hunt and it seem to we -- curious henshaw take he up quickly that he should come to the ball no doubt i will be perfectly frank with you as i expect you to be with I it be perhaps not quite seemly to discuss my brother 's failing at this time but we want to get at the truth about he death he have i fear rather irregular method in he treatment of woman one can hardly blame he poor fellow he be a fascinating personality at any rate so far as woman be concern they run after he and one can scarcely blame he if he acquire a derogatory opinion of they after all he hold they no cheaper than they make themselves in he eye that note i look at which come from he pocket be write by he to make a assignation be it address gifford put the question quickly almost eagerly no henshaw answer i wish it have be in that case we should be near the end of the mystery kelson be stare at the glib speaker with astounded eye do you suppose a woman kill you brother he almost gasp such thing have be know henshaw return with the flicker of a enigmatical smile but no i do not suggest that -- yet at present i have get no farther than the conviction that clement do not kill himself i mean to find out for whom that note of he be intend not a easy task gifford remark with he eye furtively on kelson who have become strangely interested it may or may not be easy henshaw return but it be to be do the woman who intentionally or otherwise draw my brother down here have to be find and i mean to find she kelson be now stare almost stupidly at gifford neither of you gentleman see my brother dancing henshaw demand sharply i see nothing of he at all in the ballroom gifford answer as i do not arrive till about midnight do you see he harry he ask as though with the design of rouse kelson from he rather suspicious attitude kelson seem to pull himself together by a effort no -- yes i catch a glimpse of he i think with a girl in green you know who she be henshaw demand i have not the vaguest idea kelson answer mechanically i do not see she face henshaw rise perhaps from kelson 's manner he gather that the man be tired and have have enough of he he shake hand with a word of thanks and a apology we may know more after the inquest to-morrow afternoon he remark although i doubt it you will let I consult you again if necessary thanks goodnight as the door close on henshaw kelson turn quickly to gifford with a scared face hugh he cry hoarsely in a voice subdue by fear the blood stain on my cuff that night how do it come there be it -- gifford force a smile my dear harry how absurd what could that have have to do with it kelson give a uncomfortable laugh it be a grim coincidence he say chapter ix the cloak of night at the inquest which be hold next day nothing be elicit which could offer any solution of the mystery of clement henshaw 's death it seem to be pretty generally accept to be a case of suicide although that view be oppose in evidence not only by gervase henshaw on general grounds but also by the medical witness who have grave doubt whether the mortal wound have be self-inflicted just possible but decidedly improbable both from the position of the wound and the direction of the blow be dr page 's opinion it be a downward oblique stab in the throat which have pierce the larynx and penetrate the jugular vein the decease would have be unable to cry out and would probably have quickly become insensible from asphyxiation unless he be left-handed the stab could scarcely have be self-given the police authority commit themselves to no definite theory at that stage and at they request the inquiry be adjourn for a month morriston leave the hall with kelson and gifford ask they to walk back with he to wynford place let we throw off this depressing business as well as we can he say of course i have have to break it to my sister and the other they would have see it to-day in print thank goodness the papers do not look beyond the suicide idea so they be not make much fuss about it if they take a more sensational view as i fear they will now after the medical evidence it would be a terrible nuisance i hope the lady be not much upset when you tell they gifford remark well they already have a idea that something be seriously wrong and that take the edge off the announcement of course they be horribly shock at the idea of the tragedy so close at hand though i soften the detail as well as i could if the suicide idea be to be abandon say kelson speaking with a unusually gloomy preoccupy air the police have a uncommonly difficult and delicate task before they yes indeed morriston respond and i should say that abnormally keen person the brother will keep they up to collar he mean to kelson reply rather grimly we have he for a hour last night cross-examine we naturally to no purpose we could tell he nothing he will not leave a stone unturned morriston say he propose to return here after the funeral in town and i should say observe kelson if the mystery be to be solve he be the man to solve it what do you think hugh gifford seem to rouse himself by a effort from a absorb train of thought oh yes he answer except that it be possible to be a little too clever and so overlook the obvious if say morriston obsess by the subject the case be not one of suicide it must be one of murder where be mr gervase henshaw or any one else go to look for the criminal not among you guest let 's hope kelson say with a touch of uneasiness for one thing morriston reply they or a good part of they be not exactly my guest i can not tell who may have get a ticket and be present there be a great crowd we may have easily rub shoulder with the murderer if murder it be yes so we may say kelson alertly though with something of a shudder not a pleasant idea continue morriston but i do not see if a bad character do get in and mix with the company why he should have do a fellow guest to death nor how he contrived to leave he victim and get out of the room after he have lock the door if the two man have a row over a girl or anything else kelson say there be still that difficulty to be surmount gifford speak from what one could judge of the dead man 's personality and character it be not a far-fetched supposition that he must have have enemy down here morriston object incredulously where he be a stranger unless some ingenious person bent on vengeance track he here and then lure he into the tower then how do the determine pursuer contrive to leave he and the key inside the lock room at wynford place where they have now arrive they find several caller the subject of the tragedy be naturally uppermost in everybody 's mind and the principal topic of conversation morriston and he companion be eagerly question as to what have come out at the inquest but except that the medical evidence be rather sceptical of the suicide theory be unable to relieve the curiosity i think my dear dick remark lord painswick who be there we can furnish more evidence in this room than you seem to have get hold of at the inquest and he look round the company with a know smile what do you mean painswick morriston ask eagerly have anything more come to light only we have have a lady here miss elyot who say she dance with the poor fellow i only just take a turn with he for the waltz be nearly over when he ask I say the girl thus allude to do you wear a green dress kelson ask eagerly yes why only that it must have be you i see with he and can you throw any light on the mystery morriston ask the girl shake she head none at all i be afraid do mr henshaw 's manner or state of mind strike you as be peculiar not in the least miss elyot answer with decision during the short time we be together we talk be quite commonplace mostly of the change in the county do he henshaw know it formerly morriston ask with some surprise oh yes miss elyot answer he use to stay with some people over at lamberton you remember the pelton muriel she turn to miss tredworth of course you do oh yes muriel tredworth answer i remember they quite well although we do not know much about they do not you recollect miss elyot continue meeting this very mr henshaw at a big garden party they give i know you play tennis with he do i miss tredworth reply what a memory you have glady you can not expect I to recollect every one of the score of man i must have play tennis with as she speak she catch gifford 's eye he be watch she keenly more closely perhaps than manners or tact warrant and do you find the place much change since you time mr gifford she inquire as though to relieve the awkwardness not as much as i could have imagine he answer through what seem a fit of preoccupation mr gifford have not have much opportunity yet of see how far it have alter with this tragic affair to upset everything morriston put in no it have be a most unlucky time for he to revisit wynford miss morriston add in she cold tone i hope mr gifford be not go to hurry away from the neighborhood in consequence not if i can prevent it kelson reply with a laugh i hope morriston say hospitably that whether he stay be short or long mr gifford will consider himself quite at home here and i need not say my dear kelson that invitation include you both man thank he we have already do a little trespassing in you park kelson observe with a laugh please do not call it trespassing again miss morriston command let I give you another cup of tea muriel the old house look most picturesque by moon-light observe lord painswick i be quite fascinate by it the other night there be a full moon now gifford say we will stroll round and admire when we leave do not stroll over the edge of the haha as i very nearly do one night morriston say laughingly when it lie in the shadow of the house it be a regular trap moonlight have its danger as well as its beauty painswick murmur sententiously the friendly cloak of night be apt to trip one up gifford add as he speak the word there come a startling little cry from miss tredworth accompany by the crash and clatter of fall crockery gifford 's remark have be make with he eye fix on he friend 's _ fiance _ to whom at that moment miss morriston be hand the refill cup of tea a hand of each girl be upon the saucer as the word be utter by whose fault it be let fall it be impossible to say but the slight cry of dismay have come from miss tredworth oh i be so sorry she exclaim color with vexation how stupid and clumsy of I you lovely china it be my fault edith morriston protest she clear-cut face show no trace of annoyance i think you have hold of the cup and i let it go too soon ring the bell will you dick please do not distress yourself miss tredworth mr morriston entreat she as he cross to the bell i be sure it be not you fault be that a quotation mr gifford miss morriston ask clearly with the object of dismiss the unfortunate episode my remark about the cloak of night he reply perhaps i seem to have hear something like it somewhere and as he speak he glance curiously at miss tredworth chapter x a alarming discovery next evening the two friend at the _ golden lion _ be engage to dine with the morriston they have be out with the hound all day and beyond the natural gossip of the country-side have hear nothing fresh concern the tragedy gervase henshaw have go up to town for he brother 's funeral and host dipper have no fresh development to report in answer to a question from gifford he say he expect mr henshaw back on the morrow or at latest the day after it be altogether a most mysterious affair he observe sagely be free now that he late guest 's perplexing disappearance be account for even in that tragic fashion to regard the business and to moralize over it without much personal feeling in the matter i fancy mr gervase henshaw mean to work the police up to get to the bottom of it for i do not fancy that he be by any means satisfy that he unfortunate brother take he own life and i must say he add in a pronouncement evidently the fruit of careful deliberation i do not know how it strike you gentleman but from what i saw of the decease it be hard to imagine he as make away with himself yes gifford reply but before any other conclusion can be fairly arrive at the police will have to account for the lock door evidently mr dipper 's lucubration have not so far reach a satisfactory explanation of that puzzle he could only wag he head and respond generally ah yes that will be a hard nut for they to crack i be think the dinner at wynford place be make as cheerful as with the gloom of a tragedy over the house could be possible we have the police with a couple of detective here all this morning morriston say and a great upset it have be after have make the most minute scrutiny of the room in the tower they have every one of the servant in one by one and put they through a most search examination but i imagine without result no one in the house and i have question most of they casually myself seem to be able to throw the smallest light on the affair have the police arrive at any theory gifford inquire apparently they have come to no definite conclusion morriston answer they seem to have a idea though -- to account for the problem of the lock door -- that thief might have get into the house with the object of make a haul in the bedroom while every one 's attention be engage down below have secrete themselves in the tower be surprise by henshaw and to save themselves have take the only effectual means of silencing he poor fellow then how with the door lock on the inside do they make they escape miss morriston ask that can so far be only a matter of conjecture she brother answer with a shrug of course they might have provide themselves with some sort of ladder but there be no sign of it and the height of the window in that top room be decidedly against the theory we hear at the _ lion _ kelson remark that the brother gervase henshaw be return to-morrow or next day morriston do not receive the news with any appearance of satisfaction i hope he will not come fuss about here he say with a touch of protest make every allowance for the sudden shock under which he be labor i think he attitude the other day most objectionable do not you i do most certainly gifford answer promptly he manners strike I as deplorable kelson agree yes they host continue it never seem to occur to the fellow that some little sympathy be due also to we but he seem rather to suggest that the tragedy be we fault in ordinary circumstance i should have deal pretty shortly with he but it be not worth while no kelson observe all the same you need not allow a continuation of he behavior i do not intend to morriston reply with decision i hope the man will not want to come ferret in the place that may well be leave to the police but if he do i can not very well refuse he leave he must be free of the house or at any rate of the tower or put in kelson he 'll have a grievance against you and accuse you of try to burk the mystery be he a very objectionable person miss morriston ask we pass one another in the hall as he leave the house and i receive what seem a rather unmannerly stare she brother laugh my dear edith the type of man you would simply loathe abnormally unpleasantly sharp and suspicious with a cleverness which take no account of tact or politeness he question you as though you be in the witness-box and he a criminal barrister try to trap you i do not know whether he behave more civilly to lady but from we experience of the man i should recommend you to keep out of he way i shall he sister reply i should say no respecter of person -- or anything else kelson remark with a laugh let we hope he will not take it into he head to worry we miss morriston say with quiet indifference i be sorry to see morriston observe later on when the lady have leave they that the papers be begin to take a sensational view of the affair yes kelson respond we notice that it will be a nuisance for you the trouble have already begin he host continue somewhat ruefully we have have two or three reporter here to-day worry the servant with all sort of absurd question it be of course all to be account for by the medical evidence that have put they on the scent of what they will no doubt call a sensational development so long as it look like nothing beyond suicide there be not so much likelihood of public interest in the case the police -- gifford begin the police morriston take up the word be fairly nonplussed it seem the farther they get the less obvious do the suicide theory become well we shall see in the meantime i be afraid you and miss morriston be in for a heap of undeserved annoyance kelson observe sympathetically yes morriston agree gloomily i be sorry for edith she be plucky and feel it i expect far more than she care to show when the man go into the drawing-room muriel tredworth make a sign to kelson he join she and sit down some distance apart from the rest they carry on in low tone what seem to be a serious conversation i want to tell you of something extraordinary which have happen to I hugh gifford just catch the word as the girl lead the way out of earshot he have notice that she have be rather preoccupy during dinner a unusual mood for so lively a girl and now he could not help watch the pair in the distance she talk with a earnest troubled expression and he listen to she story in grave wonderment now and again interpose a few word once they look at gifford and he be certain they be speak of he with the gloom of a tragedy over the house the little party could not be very festive avoid it as they set themselves to do the brooding subject could not be ignore general conversation flag and it soon become time for the visitor to say good-night as they walk back to the town together gifford notice that he companion be unusually silent and he tactfully forbear to break in upon he preoccupation at length kelson speak muriel have just be tell I of a unpleasant and unaccountable thing which happen to she this evening a discovery of a rather alarming character i say i would take you advice about it hugh and she agree do it concern the affair at wynford it may kelson answer in a perplexed tone and yet i do not well see how it can anyhow it be uncommonly mysterious we will not talk about it here he add gravely but wait till we get in miss morriston look well to-night gifford remark fall in with he friend 's wish to postpone the more engrossing subject yes kelson agree casually she take this ghastly business quietly enough but that be she way i have be wonder gifford say how much she care for painswick he be manifestly quite smitten but i doubt she be nearly as keen on he kelson laugh if you ask I i do not think she care a bit for he and one can scarcely be surprise he be not a bad fellow but rather a prig and edith morriston be not exactly the sort of girl to suffer that type of man gladly but she brother be all for the match from painswick 's point of view she be just the wife for he money and a statuesque style of beauty altogether i shall be surprise if it do not come off they be not engage then i think not they say he propose regularly once a week but she hold he off arrive at the _ golden lion _ they go straight up to kelson 's room where with more curiosity than he quite care to show gifford settle himself to hear what the other have to tell he i dare say you notice how worried muriel look all dinner-time kelson begin i think that what have happen in the house have get on she nerve but it be something worse than that i mean touch she more nearly tell I gifford say quietly you know kelson proceed they be go to this dance at hasborough to-morrow well it appear that when she maid be overhaul she ball-dress the same she wear here the other night she find blood stain on it that gifford remark coolly may satisfactorily account for the mark on you cuff kelson stare in surprise at the other 's coolness i dare say it do he exclaim with a touch of impatience i have hardly connect the two but what do you think of this how in the name of all that be mysterious can it be account for hardly by the idea that miss tredworth have anything to do with the late tragedy be the quiet answer good heaven man i should hope not kelson cry vehemently that be too monstrously absurd what be miss tredworth 's idea she have none she be completely mystify and incline to be horribly frightened naturally gifford comment in the same even tone he manner seem to irritate kelson i wish my dear hugh i could take it half as coolly as you do he exclaim resentfully i do not know what you want I to do or say harry gifford expostulate the whole affair be so utterly mysterious that i can not pretend even to hazard a explanation in the meantime muriel and i be in the most appalling position why man she may at any moment be arrest on suspicion if this discovery leak out as it be sure to do you can not try to hush it up that would be a fatal mistake gifford say thoughtfully and would immediately arouse suspicion naturally i be not go to be such a fool as to advise that kelson return the discovery will be the subject of the servant ' talk till it get all over the place and into the papers no what i have determine to do unless you see any good reason for the contrary be to go first thing in the morning to the police and tell they what do you say he add sharply as gifford be silent i should not do anything in a hurry gifford answer but surely kelson remonstrate the sooner we take the line of put ourselves in the right the better again gifford pause before reply can miss tredworth give no explanation have she no idea as to how the stain come on she dress none whatever be the emphatic answer you be absolutely sure of that kelson jump up from he chair hugh what be you drive at he cry he eye full of vague suspicion i -- i do not understand the cool way you be take this there be something behind it tell I i will know i have a right evidently the man be almost beside himself with the fear of something he could not comprehend gifford rise and lay a hand sympathetically on he shoulder i be sorry to seem so brutal harry he say gently but this discovery do not surprise I kelson recoil as from a blow stare at he friend with a horror-struck face why good heaven what do you mean he gasp only gifford answer calmly that when you introduce I to miss tredworth at the dance i notice the stain on the white flower she wear you do kelson be stare stupidly at gifford and you know they be blood-stain i could not tell that be the answer but now it be pretty certain they be for some seconds neither man speak then with a effort kelson seem to nerve himself to put another question hugh he say he eye pitiful with fear you -- you do not think muriel tredworth have anything to do with henshaw 's death gifford turn away and lean on the mantelpiece i do not know what to think he say gloomily chapter xi gifford 's commission next morning directly after breakfast kelson start for wynford place as the result of deliberate fully upon the anxious problem before they he and gifford have come to the conclusion that it might be a grave mistake to try to keep secret the maid 's discovery it would doubtless by this time have become a subject of gossip and speculation in the household and consequently would very soon become public accordingly it be arrange that kelson should arrive first and have a private interview with muriel tredworth with a view to ascertain finally and for certain whether she could in any way account for the stain on she dress gifford be to follow half a hour later when they would have a conference with the morriston and afterwards with they approval go into the town and see the chief constable on the subject if gifford be doubtful as to the expediency of the plan and it be with a considerable amount of hesitation that he bring himself to agree to it he seem to have no good reason to urge against it and after all it appear in the circumstance the only politic course to follow secrecy be practically now out of the question and any attempt in that direction would inevitably fail and would in all probability produce result unpleasant to contemplate when gifford arrive at wynford place he find kelson pacing the drive and impatiently expect he come along he exclaim the morriston be wait for we miss tredworth -- be utterly unable to account for the state of she dress kelson declare promptly she be positive that if she notice the man she never speak a word to he nor dance with he she say that if she ever meet he before as accord to that girl the other day be the case she have quite forget the circumstance so the sooner we communicate this discovery to the police the better as it be they say the servant be talk of it so the present position be quite intolerable in the library they find morriston and he sister with the tredworth the situation be discuss and there seem no doubt in the mind of any one of the party that the only thing to be do be to inform the police at once the whole affair be so mysterious morriston say that all sort of absurd rumor will be afloat if we do not take a strong straightforward line at once do not you agree edith certainly i do miss morriston answer with decision i do not suppose she add with a smile that any one would be mad enough to suggest my dear muriel that you be in any way implicate in the affair but the world be full of stupid and ill-natured people and one can not be too careful to put oneself in the right do not you agree captain kelson most decidedly kelson reply with a troubled face charlie tredworth be also quite emphatically of opinion that he sister should make no secret of what have be find the inspector who be here morriston say tell I that major freeman we chief constable intend to come here this morning i 'll say we want to see he directly he arrive it be not long before the chief constable be show into the library morriston lose no time in tell he of the mysterious circumstance which have come to light major freeman a keen soldierly man with the stern expression and uncompromising manner naturally acquire by those whose business be to deal with crime receive the information with grave perplexity he turn a search look upon muriel tredworth i understand you be quite unable to account for the stain on you dress miss tredworth he ask in a tone of courteous insistence quite she answer i do not speak to mr henshaw or even notice he in the ball-room you have -- pardon these question i be put this in you own interest -- you have at no time any acquaintance with mr clement henshaw i can hardly say that i have the girl reply although a friend have tell I that i play tennis with he at a garden-party some year ago a circumstance which you do not recollect the question be put politely even sympathetically yet with a certain uncomfortable directness no muriel answer even when i be remind of it my recollection be of the vaguest description so far as that go i could neither admit nor deny it with any certainty and naturally you never to you knowledge see or communicate with the deceased man since muriel flush no absolutely no she return with a touch of resentment at the suggestion major freeman forbore to distress the girl by any further question thank you he say simply i be sorry to have even appear to suggest such a thing but you and you friend will appreciate that it be my duty to ask these question this look at the moment he continue address himself now to the party in general like prove a very mysterious and i will add peculiarly delicate affair the medical evidence be incline to scout the idea of suicide and my man who have the case in hand be come round to the conclusion that the theory be untenable the lock door -- morriston suggest the lock door say major freeman present a difficulty but still one not absolutely incapable of solution we know he add with a faint smile from the way the door be eventually open that a key can be turn from the other side give the right instrument to effect it which only a burglar or a locksmith would be likely to have kelson suggest major freeman nod quite so i be not for a moment suggest that as a explanation of the mystery it go naturally much deeper than that mr gervase henshaw be to look into he brother 's affair and papers while in town and i be hope that on he return here he may be able to give some information which will afford a clue on which we can work in the meantime my man be not relax they effort in this rather baffling case in which morriston suggest this new piece of evidence do not afford any useful clue major freeman smile a little awkwardly it seem if anything it would appear to complicate the problem still further he reply guardedly still i be very glad to have it and thank you for inform I so promptly miss tredworth may rest assure that should we find it necessary to go still farther into this piece of evidence it will be do with as little annoyance as possible some of the chief constable 's habitual sternness of manner seem to have return to he as he now rise to take leave i will just confer with my man who be on the premise before i leave he say to morriston in a quiet authoritative tone they may have something to report with that he bow to the company and quit the room leave behind he a rather uncomfortable feeling which every one seem to make a effort to throw off but there be clearly nothing to be do except to let the police research take they course and to wait for development the party at wynford be go over to the dance at stowgrave that evening and it be arrange that they would call for kelson and gifford and all go on together accordingly at the appoint time the carriage stop at the _ golden lion _ kelson join miss tredworth and she brother while gifford drive with morriston in answer to he companion 's inquiry morriston say that he have hear of nothing fresh in the henshaw case i see major freeman for a moment as he be leave he say and gather that the police be still at a loss for any satisfactory explanation as to how the crime be commit he make no suggestion as to the stain on miss tredworth 's dress gifford ask no although i fancy he be a good deal exercise by that piece of evidence mention as delicately as possible that it might be necessary to have the stain analyze but do not wish the girl to be alarm or worry about it i can not understand morriston add in a puzzle tone how on earth she could possibly have have anything to do with it no gifford assent thoughtfully it be inconceivable unless by the supposition that she may by some means have come in contact with some one who be concern in the crime you mean if a man have a stain on he coat and dance with she -- something of the sort if there be blood on he lapel or sleeve h be it would be easy to ascertain for certain whom she dance with morriston say reflectively but that again be almost unthinkable and gifford add it seem to go no way towards elucidate the problem of how henshaw come to he death as a matter of fact i should say miss tredworth dance and sit out nearly the whole of the evening with kelson you know he propose at the dance yes i understand that poor kelson i be sorry for he and for they both it be a ominous beginning of they betrothal it be horrible gifford observe sympathetically although one try to think there be really nothing in it for they to be concern about the dance be a enjoyable affair and at any rate for the time disperse the depression which have hang over the party from wynford gifford have engage miss morriston for two waltz and after a turn or two in the second he partner say she feel tired and suggest they should sit out the rest of it accordingly they stroll off to a adjoining room and make themselves comfortable in a retired corner gifford nothing loath to have a quiet chat with the handsome girl whose self-possessed manner with its suggestion of underlie strength of feeling be begin to fascinate and intrigue he imagination it be rather pleasant she say a little wearily to get away from the atmosphere of mystery and police investigation we have be live in at home which i hope and believe will very soon be over gifford respond cheeringly miss morriston glance at he curiously you believe that she return almost sharply how can you think so it seem to I that with little apparent likelihood of clear up the mystery the affair may drag on for week gifford answer with a reassuring smile hardly that if the police can make nothing of it and they seem to be quite nonplussed they will have to give up they investigation and fall back on they first theory of suicide lean back and watch he companion 's face in profile as she sit forward he could see that he suggestion be by no means convincing i wish i could take you view mr gifford she return with the suggestion of a bitter smile i dare say if the authority be leave to themselves they might give up but you forget a very potent factor in the tiresome business the brother mr gervase henshaw he will keep they up to the work of investigation will he not up to a certain point and one can scarcely blame he but even then the police be not likely to continue work on he theory when they lead to no result no miss morriston reply in a unconvinced tone but he be -- she turn to he tell I you candid opinion of this mr gervase henshaw be he very -- objectionable gifford supply as she hesitate unpleasantly sharp and energetic i should say although it be perhaps hardly fair to judge a man labor under the stress of a brother 's tragic death he be determine to get to the explanation of the mystery the tinge of excitement she have exhibit in she former question have now pass away : she now speak in she habitual cold even tone he say so naturally he will do all he can to that end of course it would be a satisfaction to know for certain how the tragedy come about : not that it matter much otherwise but unfortunately he rather pose as a expert in criminology and that will make for pertinacity for a moment miss morriston keep silent it be very unfortunate she murmur at length it will worry poor old dick horribly i think he be already begin to wish he have never see wynford gifford lean forward oh but my dear miss morriston he say earnestly you and you brother must really not take the matter so seriously it be all very unpleasant one must admit but after all except that it happen in you house i do not see that it affect you you think not miss morriston respond mechanically indeed i think so as he speak gifford could not help a slight feeling of wonder that this girl from whom he would have expect a attitude rather of indifference should allow herself to be so greatly worry by the affair for that she be far more troubled than she allow to appear he be certain it be she pride he tell himself a high-bred girl like this would naturally hate the very idea of a sensational scandal under she roof and all its unpleasant rather sordid accompaniment i wish he add with a touch of fervor that i could persuade you to dismiss any fear of annoyance from you mind i wish you could she respond dully with a attempt at a smile suddenly she turn to he with more animation in she manner than she have hitherto show mr gifford you -- i -- she hesitate as though at a loss how to put what she wish to say i have no right to ask you who be a comparative stranger to help we in this -- this worry but if you care to be of assistance i be sure you could of course of course i will he answer with eager gladness only let I know what you wish and you may command the very utmost i can do and please do not think of I as a stranger edith morriston smile and to gifford it be the most fascinating smile he have ever see only let I know how i can serve you he say he pulse tingle i be thinking of my brother she reply in a tone so friendly that it neutralize the rather damp effect of the word he be worry over this business more than one who do not know he well would think i have a idea mr gifford that you might help we by in a way standing between we so far as might be possible and this mr gervase henshaw he stay at you hotel do he not yes he be expect there to-morrow morning if not to-night you may perhaps the girl proceed be able -- i do not know how and i have no right to ask it -- please miss morriston gifford plead to minimize any annoyance we be likely to suffer through he -- he uncomfortable zeal she resume hesitatingly if not that you may if he be friendly with you have a opportunity of get to hear something of he plan and idea and warn I if he be likely to worry we at wynford we do not want the tragedy keep alive indefinitely it would be intolerable i be sure you understand how i feel that be all you may rely on I to the utmost gifford assure she fervently in answer to the question in she eye thank you she say as she rise i feel sure i might ask you this favor and trust you she make a slight movement of put out she hand the gesture be coldly make it might indeed have be check and go for nothing but gifford keenly on the alert for a sign of regard be quick to take the hand and press it impulsively you may trust I miss morriston he murmur thank you she respond simply but he be glad to notice with a touch of relief she lightly take he arm and they go back to the ball-room chapter xii have henshaw a clue next day gervase henshaw make he expect reappearance in branchester he leave he luggage at the _ golden lion _ and then go off to the police-station where he have a long interview with the chief constable mindful of he promise to edith morriston hugh gifford keep about the town with the object of come across henshaw and get to know if possible something of he intention the attraction he have even from they first introduction feel towards miss morriston have become quickly intensify by they strangely confidential talk on the previous evening so far she be to he something of a puzzle but a puzzle of the most fascinating kind it be perhaps strangely unaccountable that she should have choose to invoke he help who be little more than a casual acquaintance still he argue as he review the situation she have probably be draw to he as the one man on the spot who be likely to be of use to they she brother a good sensible fellow of some character be nevertheless a ordinary country gentleman give up to sport of all kind and naturally quite unversed in the subtlety of life and character which can be study only by those who live in the more intellectual atmosphere of city the same judgment would apply to he friend kelson a chivalrous sportsman who would unselfishly do anything in he power to be of help but whose ability and penetration by no means match he willingness and probably these man be type of the bulk of the morriston ' friend and acquaintance at any rate of those who be immediately available consequently gifford conclude it have be to himself she have turn in this trouble influence no doubt by the idea that a londoner with legal training and experience of the world in its many aspect would be the best man she could enlist to help she that she confidence have be draw by any particular personal liking he never for one moment admit that unfortunately be so far all on one side whatever hope the future might hold out to he anyhow he bless he luck that a accident have so quickly break the ice and establish a state of confidential relationship between they as to there be a adequate reason for alarm gifford be not incline to question since he quite realize that this man henshaw might easily constitute himself a grave annoyance to the morriston a clever girl like edith morriston more sensitive than to a casual observer would appear have naturally recognize this danger and be anxious to have the man with he perhaps none too scrupulous method hold in check and to this service gifford be only too happy to devote himself glad beyond measure that the opportunity have be give he by the girl who have fill he thought it be not until evening that he come across henshaw it be to he mind essential not to appear anxious or to seek out the criminologist with the obvious view of get information as to he plan so you be back again mr henshaw he say with a careless nod of greet as they encounter in the hall of the hotel i hear the police have not yet arrive at any satisfactory conclusion henshaw draw back he lip in a slight smile to gifford the expression be a ugly one and he wonder what it portend there be a likelihood of we not be at a loss much longer henshaw reply speak through he tooth with a certain grim satisfaction what you have make a discovery gifford exclaim henshaw 's face harden i be not yet at liberty to say what i have find he return in a uncompromising tone but i think you may take it from I as absolutely certain that my brother do not take he own life with pursed lip gifford nod acceptance of the statement that make the affair look serious not to say sensational he respond i suppose one must not ask you whether you have a clue to the perpetrator no i can hardly say that yet henshaw answer with a rather cunning look you as one of we profession mr gifford will understand that and the unwisdom of premature statement certainly i do gifford agree promptly and be quite content to restrain my curiosity till i get information from the papers henshaw laugh intriguingly there be certain thing that do not find they way into the press he say meaningly the real story in this case may turn out to be one of they eager as he be gifford resolve to show no further curiosity you know best he rejoin almost casually but i hope for the morriston ' sake the mystery will be soon satisfactorily clear up there be a peculiar glitter in henshaw 's eye as he reply no doubt they be anxious naturally they be get rather worry by all this police fuss naturally henshaw repeat gifford 's word with a curious emphasis it be unfortunate for they he add but all the same it be imperative that the manner of my brother 's death should be thoroughly investigate he nod and as unwilling to discuss the matter further open a newspaper and turn away about noon next day gifford go with kelson to wynford place they have see nothing more of henshaw who it seem be rather incline to hold away from they possibly with a view to avoid a opportunity of discuss the affair or because he be occupy in follow up some clue he have or think he have get hold of this be naturally a disappointment to gifford who be anxious on miss morriston 's behalf to keep himself post as to henshaw 's intention of course say kelson the fellow will have hear of the stain find on muriel 's dress and will set himself to make the most of that discovery i only hope he will not take to worry she she be quite enough upset about it without that doubtless that be why he be keep away from we gifford observe he probably have hear of you engagement and have the decency to see that he can not very well discuss the matter with we kelson add on they arrival at wynford place morriston tell they that gervase henshaw be there with a detective in the room of the tragedy there be a decide improvement in he manner to-day he say with a laugh he have be quite considerate and apologetic so much so that i think i shall have to ask he to stay to luncheon it seem rather churlish in the circumstance not to do so when the man be actually in the house on what should be to he a very sad business but you fellow must stay too to take off some of the strain they accept gifford not sorry for more reason than one to stay he presently take a opportunity of join edith morriston in the garden i have be keep a look-out for mr henshaw he say as they stroll off down a secluded walk but so far have have a chance of speak to he only once when i run across he in the hotel yes she respond with a scarcely conceal curiosity to hear what have pass he have evidently get hold of some clue or at least think he have gifford proceed but what it be he do not tell I in fact he rather decline to discuss the affair i fancy he have have a long consultation with the police authority and he would tell you nothing nothing i rather expect he might have come as before to discuss the case with we but he have make a point of keep away i hear however from you brother that he seem far less objectionable this time somewhat to gifford 's surprise she give a rather grudging assent yes i suppose he be i happen to see he on he arrival and he certainly be polite enough but it be possible to be even objectionably polite gifford glance at she curiously wonder what have take place to call forth the remark i know that he say i do hope the man have not annoyed you from what you brother tell we -- oh no she interrupt i can not say he have annoy I -- from he point of view she laugh the man try to be particularly agreeable i think and succeed in be the reverse gifford add i can quite understand still it might be worse oh yes she agree in a tone which do nothing to abate he curiosity the luncheon bell ring out and they turn i have not thank you for look after we interest mr gifford the girl say i have unfortunately be able to do nothing he reply deprecatingly but you have try she rejoin graciously and it be not you fault if you have not succeed it be a comfort to think that we have a friend at hand ready to help we if need be and i be most grateful the unusual feeling in she tone thrill he i should love to do something worthy of you gratitude he respond in a subdue tone you take a lower view of you service than i do she rejoin as they reach the house and no more could be say at luncheon the improvement which they host have mention in henshaw 's attitude be strikingly apparent he dogmatic self-assertiveness which have before be find so irritating be lay aside he manner be subdue he tone be sympathetic as he apologize for all the annoyance to which he host and hostess be be put gifford watch he alertly wonder at the change and more particularly at its cause which set he speculate what do it portend it seem as though the complete alteration in the man 's attitude and manner might indicate that he have get the solution of the mystery and no longer have that problem to worry he certainly there be little to find fault with in he to-day one thing however gifford do not like and that be henshaw 's rather obvious admiration for edith morriston when they take they place at table she have motion to gifford to sit beside she and from that position it gradually force itself upon he notice that henshaw scarcely take he eye off he hostess address most of he conversation and he be a fluent talker to she it be of course scarcely to be wonder at that this handsome capable girl should call forth any man 's admiration gifford himself be indeed begin to fall desperately in love with she but this naturally make henshaw 's rather obvious prepossession none the less disagreeable to he this then he reflect be the explanation of what miss morriston have hint at what she have describe as he objectionable excess of politeness at they meeting that morning happily however gifford feel secure in he position as she accredited ally and in she express dislike to the man whom it seem she have unwittingly fascinate it be indeed unthinkable that this splendid high-bred girl could ever be responsive to the advance of this unpleasantly sharp rather underbred man and he be a little surprised that she could respond to he remark quite so genially with more graciousness indeed than even she position as hostess call forth he could not quite reconcile it with the way she have speak of he previously but then he tell himself that he be make too much of the business and see what be mere politeness through the magnifying glass of jealousy and so secure in he position he proceed to view henshaw 's attempt to ingratiate himself with a amuse equanimity chapter xiii what gifford see in the wood during the next day or two gifford see next to nothing of gervase henshaw they have part amicably enough after luncheon at wynford place indeed the change in henshaw 's demeanor have be something of a puzzle to the two friend although kelson do not seem much exercise by it the fellow have evidently come to the conclusion that in deal with people like the morriston a offensive brow-beating manner do not pay he remark casually gifford however have a idea that the reason for the change lay somewhat deeper than that he wonder whether in the absence of any other apparent cause edith morriston 's attractiveness have have anything to do with it it be not a pleasant idea still if it save she annoyance that would be something gain he think and that it should have any farther result be out of the question he have not have that day a opportunity of any private talk with miss morriston for she have drive out after luncheon to pay a call but a certain suggestion of warmth in she leave-taking have assure he that she still look for he help and that the condition be not change what he have undertake so eagerly be now however not easy of accomplishment for reason at which gifford could only guess henshaw seem to be play a elusive game he keep out of sight or at any rate avoid all intercourse with the two friend and on the rare occasion when they meet he be to gifford tantalizingly uncommunicative that something be evidently behind he reticence make it all the more unsatisfactory since the result be that gifford have no object in go to wynford place for he have nothing to tell indeed he learn more from the morriston than from henshaw the police have conclude they investigation on the premise much to the relief of the household who be now leave in peace they do not seem to have come to any definite conclusion as to how the tragedy happen morriston say they have a idea as i gather from major freeman where to look for the murderer if murder it be which i be rather incline to doubt be henshaw likely to give up the search gifford ask morriston look puzzle i can not make out he answer in a slightly perplexed tone even freeman do not seem to know what he idea be he be still about here yes gifford reply i catch a glimpse of he this morning curious morriston remark i come across the fellow yesterday afternoon in the big plantation here he be moon about and do not seem best please to see I but he be quite duly apologetic say he be puzzling over the tragedy and hope i do not mind he trespassing on my property of course i tell he he be free to come and go as he like but it do strike I as peculiar that he should be think out the case in that plantation which have no possible connexion with the scene of the crime yes it be curious gifford agree reflectively do he tell you what he be do about the business morriston shake he head no he be not communicative do not seem to have much to go upon of course one can not tell what the fellow have at the back of he mind but i be rather surprise that a londoner of he energy and smartness should spend he time loaf about down here with what seem a poor chance of any result and i nearly tell he so perhaps it be as well you do not gifford reply he be suspicious enough to imagine you might have a motive in want to get rid of he morriston laugh i have he be not exactly the man one want to have prowl about the place but it would not be polite to hint as much the episode trivial as it seem to morriston give gifford food for disagreeable reflection why indeed should henshaw be hang about in the grounds of wynford and give so unconvincing a reason what trouble gifford most be that the man 's reticent attitude preclude all hope of he learn anything of he plan which could usefully be impart to miss morriston evidently there be nothing to be get out of he the rather open confidence he have display on he first appearance at branchester have quite disappear and if gifford be to find out anything worth report it would assuredly not be due to any communication from the man himself he have accordingly to be content with the resolve to keep a wary eye on henshaw 's movement he be now pretty free to do this the tredworth have end they visit at wynford and have return home and naturally kelson spend much of he time over there leave gifford to he own device it have in view of gifford 's commission from miss morriston be arrange that he should share kelson 's room at the _ golden lion _ no longer as a guest so that both man be now independent of each other the date of kelson 's wedding seem now likely to be put off for some month as he friend have suggest the unpleasant episode of the stain on muriel tredworth 's dress have although there be no indication of attach serious importance to they nevertheless cast a uncomfortable shadow over the happiness of she betrothal and without give any specific reason she have declare for a postponement of the wedding for which there be after all a quite natural reason perhaps it be just as well kelson remark to he friend although it be absolutely unthinkable that muriel could have have anything to do with the affair yet one can quite appreciate she wish to wait till perhaps something crop up to give we the explanation beyond all question it be rather a blow to I and i hope if the mysterious mr gervase henshaw be really on the track of the crime he will produce he solution without much more delay for a girl like muriel to have even the faintest suspicion hang over she be simply hateful meanwhile the mysterious mr henshaw seem in no hurry to make known he theory if he have one yet he still remain in branchester write all the morning and go out in the afternoon usually with a handful of letter for post he always nod affably to gifford when they meet but beyond a casual remark on the weather or the event of the day show no disposition to chat but now while gifford be in this unsatisfactory state of mind persevere yet baffle in what he have undertake to do a very singular thing come to pass he stroll out one afternoon aimlessly wonder whether the negative result of he effort justify he remain in the place and yet loath to leave it hold there as he be by the attraction of edith morriston he feel he could be make but little way in she favor see how he be fail in what he have undertake to do for she and as he walk he discuss with himself whether it would not be possible to hit on some more active plan of become acquaint with henshaw 's knowledge and intention it be obviously a delicate business and after all he think now that the man 's undesirable presence have practically cease to be a annoyance to the morriston there scarcely seem any need to bother about he on the other hand however there be a certain strong curiosity on he own part to know henshaw 's design and what keep he in the town gifford 's walk take he over well remembered ground he be stroll along a path which lead through the wynford property over a rustic bridge across a stream he have often fish when a boy and so on into a wood which form one of the home covert make he way through this familiar haunt of by-gone day he come to one of the long ride which bisect the wood for some quarter of a mile he turn into this and be just look out for a comfortable trunk where he might sit and smoke when he catch sight of two figure in the distance ahead walk slowly just on the fringe of the ride a man and a woman they back be towards he but he blood give a leap at the sight as they identity flash upon he it be in its unexpectedness a almost appalling sight to he as he realize that the two be none other than henshaw and edith morriston chapter xiv gifford 's perplexity next moment gifford have instinctively spring back into the covert of the tree almost daze by what he have see henshaw and edith morriston could it be possible he eye must have deceive he about the girl there could be no doubt she tall graceful figure be unmistakable but the man surely he have be mistake there it must have be she brother or perhaps a friend who have be lunch with they have gifford he mind obsess by henshaw jump to a false conclusion he stoop and creep warily beyond the fringe of tree look after the pair they be now some thirty yard away there could be no doubt that the lady be edith morriston and the man incredible as it might seem he be surely gervase henshaw gifford have see he some two hour earlier and now recognize he gray suit and dark feel hat he stay crouch down look after the amazing pair seek a sign that the man be not henshaw after all it be he tell himself more likely that he have make a mistake than that miss morriston could be stroll in confidential talk -lrb- for such seem the case -rrb- with that fellow it be too astounding for belief they have stop now at the end of the ride the man talk earnestly it seem miss morriston standing with head bent down and score the grass with she walking-stick as though in doubt or consideration would they turn and put the man 's identity beyond uncertainty gifford have not long to wait miss morriston seem to draw off and begin to walk back down the ride she companion turn and promptly put himself by she side there be no doubt now as to who he be gervase henshaw as one glance now that the face be reveal prove that gifford draw back quickly and hurry deeper into the thick wood fearful lest he footstep should be hear when he have go a safe distance a intense curiosity make he halt and turn from he place of hide he could just see the light of the ride along which the couple would pass he hate the idea of spy upon edith morriston after all if she choose to walk and talk with this man it be no business of he but a supreme distrust of henshaw unreasonable enough perhaps but none the less keen make he suspicious that the man might be play some cowardly game might have draw the girl to he by unfair means otherwise it be surely inconceivable that she should have consent -- condescend indeed -- to meet he in that clandestine manner as gifford stay hesitate between a breach of good form and a legitimate desire to learn whether the girl be be subject to unfair treatment the sound of henshaw 's rather penetrate voice come into earshot and a few seconds later they pass across the line of gifford 's sight he could catch but a glimpse of they through the intervene tree as they go by slowly but it be enough to tell he that henshaw be talk earnestly argue it seem and on edith morriston 's clear-cut face be a look of trouble which be not good to see it make gifford flush with anger to think that this lovely high-bred girl be be worried probably be make love to by a man of that objectionable type for that she could be in that situation without coercion be not to be believe the reason for henshaw 's prolonged and rather puzzling stay in the place be now account for moreover to gifford 's bitter reflection the whole business seem clear enough henshaw have be catch and fascinate by edith morriston 's beauty and be as be obvious a man of energy and determination be now in some subtle way make use of the tragedy as a means of force he unwelcome attention on she how otherwise could this astounding familiarity be arrive at sick with disgust and indignation gifford turn away and retrace he step through the wood dismiss as likely to lead to a false position he first impulse to appear on the scene and stop at any rate for that day henshaw 's design he feel that to act precipitately might do less good than harm he be after all on private ground there and have no right to intrude upon what in all likelihood miss morriston wish to be a secluded interview what course he would take in the future be another matter and one which demand instant and serious consideration the right line to adopt be indeed a perplexing problem gifford recall morriston 's story of have meet henshaw hang about more or less mysteriously in the plantation and the annoyance he have express at the encounter the reason be plain enough now of course the man be wait either to waylay edith morriston or to meet she by appointment it be not a pleasant reflection since the fact show that these clandestine meeting have probably be go on for some day past that henshaw 's object be more or less disreputable could not be doubt and to gifford the amazing and troubling part of it be that edith morriston the very last woman he would have suspect of consent to such a course who have profess a absolute dislike and repugnance to henshaw and fear of he annoying presence should be meet he thus willingly have he not see they with he own eye he would have scoff at the idea as something inconceivable now what be he to do for it be clear that justified or not as he might be think in interfere in matter which do not concern he something must be do the one obvious course which it seem he ought to take be to give richard morriston a hint of what be on foot if not a stronger and more explicit statement for that morriston could be privy to the correspondence between he sister and henshaw be quite unlikely if anything underhand be go on if henshaw be hold some threat over the girl or pursue she with unwelcome attention she brother as she natural guardian should be warn that seem to gifford he manifest duty and yet he shrink from anything which might seem treachery towards the girl for if she need she brother 's help and protection against the man it would be a easy matter for she to complain of he persecution why he wonder have she not do so it be all very mysterious he try to imagine how the position have come about on henshaw 's side it be plain enough miss morriston be not only a strikingly handsome girl but she be a heiress possess accord to kelson a considerable fortune in she own right there clearly be henshaw 's motive a incentive to a unscrupulous man to use every art fair and unfair to force himself into she favor but how have he succeed so quickly as to make this rather haughty reserved girl consent to meet in secret the man whom she profess to dislike and avoid that this unpleasantly sharp push product of the less dignified side of the law could have any personal attraction for one of edith morriston 's taste and discrimination be impossible and yet there the challenging fact remain that confidential relation have be establish between the disparate pair be it possible that this man could have find out something connect edith morriston with he brother 's death the feasibility of the idea come as a shock to gifford he stop dead in he walk as the notion take form in he brain the possibility of this most mysterious case be too complicate to be grasp at once and so with he mind in a whirl of vague conjecture and apprehension he reach he hotel and there a new development in the mystery await he chapter xv another discovery kelson be in they sitting-room read the _ field _ he start up as gifford enter and fling away the paper my dear hugh i have be wait for you he exclaim what be the matter anything wrong gifford ask with a certain apprehensive curiosity as he notice sign of suppress excitement in he friend 's face i do not know whether it be all wrong or whether it be all right kelson reply anyhow it have relieve my mind a good deal control he own tendency to excitement gifford put aside he hat and stick and sit down let 's hear it he say quietly well another unaccountable thing have it appear happen at wynford place a pendant or whatever you call it to that which have be trouble muriel what do you think as i be ride along the loxford road this afternoon i meet dick morriston and he tell I that another discovery of blood-stain have be make at wynford on a girl 's ball-dress too and on whose do you suppose it be not miss morriston 's gifford suggest breathlessly kelson nod with a slight look of surprise at the correctness of the guess yes be not it queer poor old dick be in rather a way about it and i must say the whole business be decidedly mysterious gifford be think keenly how do it come out who find the mark he ask well kelson answer it appear that edith morriston 's maid find they some day ago in fact the day after a similar discovery have be make on muriel 's gown she have bring the dress which she mistress have worn at the hunt ball out of the wardrobe where it hang in order to fold it away she appear to have spread it on the bed where the sun shone on it and in the strong light she notice on the dark material some brownish discoloration with what have happen about the other dress in she mind she examine the mark closely and with such intentness as to raise the curiosity of a housemaid who happen to come into the room at first miss morriston 's maid try to put she off but the other girl who be sharp-eyed have see the mark be not to be hood-winked and the mischief be do the housemaid seem to be a foolish babble creature and the discovery soon become the talk of the servant ' hall whence it spread till it reach the police and what be they do about it gifford ask morriston say they have have a detective up at the house examine the gown be so utterly at sea over the affair the police be doubtless glad to catch at anything there seem little question that the stain be blood and that make the whole business still more puzzling dick morriston be naturally very exercise about it but i be very glad for muriel 's sake that the second discovery have be make in fact i have be just wait till i see you before ride over to tell she of it and relieve she mind yes gifford respond mechanically of course it remove any serious suspicion from miss tredworth and say kelson eagerly it divide the odium if there be any in fact to my mind it reduce the whole suspicion to a absurdity for that both girl could have be concern in henshaw 's death be absolutely incredible yes gifford agree thoughtfully they could not both have have a hand in it or either for that matter kelson return with a laugh do not you admit that the idea be in the highest degree ridiculous he add more sharply as gifford remain silent it be -- inconceivable he admit abstractedly kelson who have take up he hat and crop and be turn to the door wheel round quickly my dear hugh he exclaim impatiently what be the matter with you what monstrous idea have you get in you head you owe it to I and i really must ask you to speak out plainly it seem almost a insult to muriel to ask the question but do you still persist in the notion that she have even in the most innocent way anything to do with henshaw 's death because i have she positive assurance that she know nothing of it beyond what be common knowledge i too be quite certain of that now gifford answer why do you say now kelson demand sourly surely you never seriously entertain such a abominable idea you must admit my dear harry gifford reply calmly that with a man stab to death in practically the next room the blood-stain on miss tredworth 's dress be bind to give rise to conjecture one would suspect a archbishop in a similar position but that be all over now i be as convinced as you can be that miss tredworth know nothing of the business on you honor that be you opinion on my honor this new discovery have change you opinion it have at least show I how dangerous it may be to jump to conclusion kelson draw in a breath yes indeed poor muriel have suffer from the suspicion as well as from the horrible shock of the discovery still this new development though it acquit she do nothing towards solve the mystery i wonder whether edith morriston have any idea as to how she dress get marked i wonder gifford respond abstractedly well say kelson i be off to carry the good news to muriel do not wait dinner for I if i be not back by seven-thirty it be rather a relief to gifford to be leave alone that he might review the situation without interruption he first thought have be could this last discovery be accountable for what he have see that afternoon doubtless after the information reach the police it would not be long in be convey to henshaw and he be now make use of it to put the screw on use the hold he have gain over edith morriston to bend she to he will what be that marriage to gifford the thought be monstrous yet if it should be that henshaw have information which put the girl in he power what could she do that she have consent to meet he secretly and listen to he go to show that she feel she position to be weak if so she might need help a adviser a man to stand between she and she persecutor think out the situation strenuously gifford determine to seek a private interview with edith morriston and offer himself as she protector at the worst she could but snub he and the chance be he think greatly in favor of she accept he offer of help for from she character he judge she be not a girl to make a stronger appeal to he than the casual invoke of he assistance which have already take place he have a very cogent reason for believe that he could be of assistance although there be certain element in the mystery which might in he ignorance of they upset he calculation anyhow in consideration of the trust edith morriston have show in he he would seek a interview with she and chance what it might bring forth chapter xvi a explanation in pursuance of this plan gifford propose to he friend that they should call at wynford place on the next day kelson have return from the tredworth in high spirit the news he carry there have lift a weight off he fiance 's mind and indeed restore the happiness of the whole family there be no cloud over the engagement now and they could all look forward to the marriage without a qualm if kelson might in ordinary circumstance have wonder at the motive for he friend 's proposal which be but thinly disguise he be in too happy a state of preoccupation to trouble he head about it i be you man he respond promptly it so happen that muriel be lunch at wynford to-morrow so it will suit I well enough i should not be surprise if we get a note in the morning ask we to lunch there too the morning however bring no note of invitation a failure which rather surprise kelson although gifford think he could account for it nevertheless he determine to go and do he best to get a private talk with edith morriston however disincline she might be to grant it the two man go up to wynford early in the afternoon but it be a long time before gifford get the opportunity he seek edith morriston seem as friendly and gracious as ever but whether by accident or design she give no chance for gifford to get in a private word with the knowledge of what he have see on the previous afternoon and of the change in she attitude he be too shrewd to show any anxiety for a confidential talk he watch she closely when he could do so unobserved but she face give no sign of trouble or embarrassment he wonder if there could after all be anything in he idea of persecution and the more curious he become the more determine he grow to find out but somehow miss morriston contrived that they should never be alone together when kelson and muriel tredworth stroll off lover-like miss morriston keep she brother with she to make a third the three go round to the stable and inspect the hunter then through the shrubbery to admire a wonderful bed of snowdrop as they stand there look over the undulating park and gifford curb he impatience be talk of certain change which have take place since he early day there the butler be see hurry towards they caller i suppose morriston observe with a half-yawn what be it stent could i speak to you sir the man say stop short a little distance away morriston go forward to he and after they have speak together he turn round and with a excuse I for a few minute go off towards the house with the butler so at last the opportunity have come gifford glance at he companion and notice that she face have go a shade paler than before the interruption i wonder what can be the matter she observe a little anxiously gifford thought then she laugh i dare say it be nothing stent be become absurdly fussy and all the alarm and discovery we have have lately have not diminish the tendency the latest discovery must have come rather as a relief gifford venture tentatively the mark on my dress you mean she laugh so far that i now share with muriel tredworth the suspicion of know all about the tragedy hardly that gifford reply with a smile there can be no cause for that fear by the way he add more seriously i owe you a account of my failure to gain any information for you with regard to mr gervase henshaw 's plan he be not communicative miss morriston suggest casually gifford shake he head no i be never able to get hold of he in fact it seem as though he rather make a point of avoid we and if we do meet he be vagueness and reticence personify they be walk slowly back along the shrubbery path the girl turn to he for a instant she expression soften in a look of gratitude it be very kind of you mr gifford to take all this trouble for we and i be sure it be not you fault that the result be not what you might wish it be rather absurd of I to set you the task but i be none the less grateful please think that and do not bother about it any more but if the man be likely to annoy you he urge have you longer any reason to fear he she turn swiftly fear he what do you mean we think he might be unscrupulous and might make himself objectionable she shrug i dare say it be possible i must confess he pursue i can not quite make the fellow out nor he motive for remain in the place you brother tell I he come across he hang about in one of you plantation he think the blood leave she face for a instant but otherwise she show no sign of discomposure how do he account for he be there she ask calmly unsatisfactorily enough i forget he actual excuse be that all she demand coldly i believe so but it be hardly desirable as you brother say to have the man prowl about the property for a moment she be silent no she say as though by a afterthought she manner trouble he i hope he be not attempt to annoy you he say searchingly she look surprised and he think a little resentful at he question I she return coldly by hang about in the plantation if he go no farther than that -- why should he she demand in the same rather chill tone i do not know gifford reply set back by she manner except that i have no high opinion of the fellow it occur to I he might possibly attempt to persecute you she glance round at he curiously with a little disdainful smile what make you think he would do that she return she attitude be to he not convince he feel there be a certain reservation beneath the rather cut tone i be glad to know there be no question of that he reply with quiet earnestness i hope if anything of the kind should occur and you should need a friend you will not overlook I you be very kind she respond but without turn towards he he think however that she low tone have soften and it give he hope i should scarcely take upon myself to suggest this he say but i be embolden by two fact one that you have already ask I to be you ally you friend in this business the other that there be something about henshaw and he action which i do not understand i hope you will forgive my boldness he companion have glance round now keenly as though to probe for the meaning which might lie beneath he word he speculate whether she might be wonder how much he know be he cognisant of she meeting with henshaw but whatever she thought she answer in the same even voice there be nothing to forgive on the contrary i be most grateful they be near the house and gifford be debate whether he dare suggest another turn along the shrubbery path when richard morriston appear at the hall door beckon to they and go in again i wonder what dick want have anything more come to light miss morriston observe with a rather bore laugh as she slightly quicken she pace as they go in she call dick and he answer she from the library there they find he with kelson and muriel tredworth a glance at they face tell gifford that they be all in a state of scarcely suppress excitement i say edith what do you think she brother exclaim we have make a rather important discovery be you in the middle room of the tower during the dance for a moment he sister do not answer no i do not think i be she say with what seem to gifford a certain amount of apprehension in she eye although she expression be calm enough oh but my dear girl you must have be morriston insist vehemently we have find the explanation of the stain on miss tredworth 's dress and on yours you have he sister reply look at he curiously yes beyond all doubt the mystery be make clear come and see he lead the way across the hall and up the first story of the tower there be the explanation he say point to some dark red patch on the back of a sofa and on the carpet below it be not a pleasant idea morriston say but you see these mark be directly under the place where the dead man lay in the room above the blood from he wound evidently run through the chink of the flooring on to the beam of the ceiling here and so fall drop by drop on the couch and on any one sit there rather gruesome but i be sure we must be all very glad to get the simple explanation the only wonder be that no one thought of it before muriel be sit just at that end of the sofa when i propose to she kelson say in a low voice to gifford i be delighted the matter be so completely account for he friend return what fool we be ever to have take it so tragically but he expression change as he glance at edith morriston she have deny that she have be in the room i have send down to the police to tell they of the discovery morriston be say the fact be that since the tragedy the servant appear to have rather shun this part of the house or at any rate to have devote as little time to it as possible otherwise this would have come to light sooner anyhow it be a source of congratulation to miss tredworth and you edith of course you must have be in here i remember sit just there ugh miss tredworth say with a shudder i can swear to that kelson corroborate with a know smile you must have do the same or brush against the sofa edith morriston say cheerfully well i be glad that be settle although it bring we no nearer towards solve the mystery of what happen overhead no kelson remark it look as though that be go to remain a mystery the butler come in major freeman be here sir he say with mr henshaw and would like to speak to you morriston look surprised alfred have be very quick we send he off only about a quarter of a hour ago alfred meet major freeman and mr henshaw with the detective just beyond the lodge gate sir then they be come up here independently of my message yes sir alfred give major freeman the message and come back morriston move towards the door i will see these gentleman at once he say in the library sir involuntarily gifford have glance at edith morriston she be stand impassively with set face and at he glance she turn away to the window but not before he have catch in she eye a look which he hate to see a look which seem to confirm a suspicion already in he mind chapter xvii what a girl see with morriston 's departure a rather uncomfortable silence fall upon the party leave in the room every one seem to feel that there be something in the air the shadow of a possibly serious development in the case even kelson who be otherwise incline to be jubilant over the free of he fiance from suspicion seem to feel it be no time or place just then for gaiety and he expression grow as grave as that of the rest i wonder what these fellow have come to say he observe as he pace the room let 's hope to announce that at last they be go to leave you in peace edith miss tredworth say edith morriston do not alter she position as she stand look out of the window thank you for you kind wish muriel she respond in a cold voice but i be afraid that be too much to hope for just yet yet one do not see what else it can be kelson observe reflectively they can hardly have find out exactly how the man come by he death much more likely to have abandon they latest theory eh hugh gifford be look hold by the grip of he imagination at the tall figure by the window wonder what be pass behind that veil of impassiveness i do not see what they can have find out away from this house he say rousing himself by a effort to answer and they do not seem to have be here lately well we shall see kelson say casually ah here come dick back again morriston hurry in with a serious face in answer to kelson 's well dick he say it appear a rather extraordinary piece of evidence have just come to light one which if true completely solve the mystery of the lock door i ask freeman if there be any objection to you fellow come to the library and hear the story he be quite agreeable so will you come you too edith and miss tredworth there be nothing at all horrible in it so far for the first time edith morriston turn from the window be it necessary dick she protest quietly i would just as soon hear it all afterwards from you these police visitation be rather get on my nerve very well dear you shall hear all about it later on she brother respond and lead the way down to the library gifford be the last to leave the room and he glance back show he that edith morriston have turn again to the window and resume she former attitude in the library be the chief constable gervase henshaw and a local detective now major freeman morriston say as he close the door we shall be glad to hear this new piece of evidence major freeman bow shortly it come to this he begin a young woman name martha hayne belong to branchester call at my office this morning and make a statement which if reliable must have a important bearing on this mysterious case it appear from she story that on the night of the hunt ball hold here she have be pay a visit to some friend at rapscot a village as you know about a mile beyond wynford on she way back to the town for which she start at about 945 she take as a short cut the right-of-way path run across the park and pass near the house as she go by she be naturally attract by the light window and could hear the band quite plainly she stop to listen to the music at a point which she have indicate almost directly opposite the tower she say she have stand there for some little time when she attention be suddenly divert to what seem a mysterious movement on the outside of the tower a dark body presumably a human being appear to be slowly slide down the wall from the topmost window unfortunately before she could quite realize what she be look at -- and we may imagine that a country girl would take some little time to grasp so unusual a situation -- a cloud drift across the moon and throw the tower into shadow the girl continue however to keep she eye fix on the spot where she have see the dark object descend with the result that in a few seconds she see it reach and pass over one side of the window of the lower room which be sufficiently light up to silhouette anything place before it she see the object move slowly over the window and disappear in the darkness beneath it when a few seconds later the moon come out again nothing more be to be see the girl stay for some time watch the tower but without result she be a more or less ignorant unsophisticated country-woman and what she have see she be quite unable to account for naturally she hardly connect it with any sort of tragical occurrence the house with its light and music seem give over to gaiety that any one should just then have meet he death in that upper room never enter she imagination a vague idea that a thief might have get into the house and she have see he escape by the tower window do indeed as she say cross she mind and that supposition prevent she from approach the tower to satisfy she curiosity but as nothing more happen she begin to think less of the significance of what she have see in fact almost persuade herself that it have be something of a optical delusion presently have have enough of standing in the cold wind she resume she way go home and to bed and early next morning leave the town to enter a situation in another part of the country it appear that she have take cold by she loitering and soon after reach she destination become so ill that she have to keep she bed and it be only on she recovery a few day ago that she hear what have happen here that night directly she could get away she come over and tell she story to we a pity she could not have come before morriston remark as the chief constable pause she evidence be highly important dispose as it do of the mystery of the lock door yes major freeman agree and also of the suicide theory the question now be -- who be the person who be see descend from the window could this girl tell whether it be a man or a woman the question come from henshaw who have hitherto keep silent she think it be a man major freeman answer but could not swear to it the fact of the object be close to the wall make it almost impossible in the imperfect light to distinguish plainly but i think we may take it that it be a man the feat could be hardly one a woman would undertake no gifford agree and there would seem little chance of identify the person none at all so far as the girl hayne be concerned major freeman reply but we have something to go upon a start point for a new line of inquiry the person see escape must have lower himself by a rope from that top window and a considerable length would be require i have take the liberty mr morriston of set a party of my man to search the grounds for the rope they will begin by drag the little lake by all means morriston assent detective sprule the chief proceed would like to make another examination of the ironwork of the window may he go up now certainly morriston answer and the detective leave the room gifford speak the girl see nothing of the escape person after he reach the ground nothing she say major freeman answer but the base of the tower be in deep shadow which would prevent that a pity she curiosity be not a little more practical henshaw observe yes gifford turn to he you be prove correct mr henshaw in you repudiation of the suicide idea perhaps in view of this latest development you may have knowledge to go upon of some one from whom you brother might have apprehend danger henshaw 's set face give indication of nothing but a study reserve no one certainly he answer coolly from whom he might apprehend danger to he life there must have be a motive for the act kelson observe unless it be a sudden quarrel there appear major freeman put in to be no evidence whatever of anything lead up to that no the cause be so far quite mysterious henshaw say it seem to gifford that there be something of undisclosed knowledge behind he word and he fall to wonder how far the motive be mysterious to he morriston proceed to acquaint major freeman with the discover cause of the mark on the lady ' dress and they all go off to the lower room where the position of the stain be point out edith morriston be no longer there miss tredworth sit at this end of the sofa morriston explain and so the mark on she dress be clearly account for and miss morriston henshaw put the question in a tone which have in it gifford think a touch of scepticism oh my sister must have be in here too morriston reply or how could she dress have be stain unless indeed she brush against miss tredworth 's or someone else be that be clear there seem no alacrity in henshaw to accept the conclusion and he do not respond i be glad this part of the mystery be so satisfactorily settle the chief constable remark now we have the issue narrow well sprule the detective have appear at the door i have examine the ironwork of the window sir he say and have find under the magnifying-glass trace of the fraying of a rope as though cause by friction against the iron staple sufficient sign to bear out the young woman 's statement quite sir there be upon close examination distinct evidence of a rope have be work against the hinge of the window very good sprule we may consider that point settle major freeman say have finally satisfied themselves as to the cause of the stain on the floor and sofa the chief constable and he subordinate propose to go to the lake and see whether the man who be drag it have have any success morriston and henshaw with kelson and gifford accompany they as they come in sight of the boat the detective exclaim they have find it and the man be see haul up a rope out of the water sooner than i expect major freeman observe as they hurry towards the nearest point to the boat the rope when land prove to be of considerable length sufficient when double they calculate to reach from the topmost window to within five or six foot of the ground the escape person henshaw say must have slide down the double rope which have be pass through the staple of the window and then when the ground be reach have pull it away coil it up carry it to the lake and throw it in obviously that be the procedure and it account completely for the lock door the chief constable and the detective agree a man would want some nerve to come down from that height the latter remark any man or woman either for that matter henshaw return dogmatically would not hesitate to take the risk as a alternative to be trap up there with he victim you be not suggest it might have be a woman who be see slide down the rope gifford ask pointedly henshaw shrug i suggest nothing as to the person 's identity he reply in a sharply guard tone that be now what remain to be discover chapter xviii the lose brooch the police authority with henshaw and morriston go off with the rope to experiment in the room of the tragedy i do not suppose we be wanted kelson say quietly to gifford let 's go for a turn round the garden i wonder where muriel have get to they find miss tredworth on the lawn i be wait for edith she say we 'll stroll on and gifford can bring miss morriston after we kelson suggest and the lover move away leave gifford much to he satisfaction wait for edith morriston in a few minute she make she appearance gifford mention the arrangement and they stroll off by the path the other have take it seem to gifford that he companion 's manner be rather abnormal unlike she usual cold reserve there be sign of a certain suppress excitement i hope she say that major freeman and he people be satisfy with we discovery that the mark on muriel 's dress and mine come there by accident evidently quite convinced gifford answer that be well she respond with a rather force laugh it be rather too bad to suspect we on that evidence of know anything about the affair i do not suppose for a moment they do gifford assure she i do not know the girl return anyhow it be rather a embarrassing not to say painful position for we to be in but that be at a end now nevertheless gifford could tell that she be not so thoroughly relieve as she word imply completely he declare you have hear of the new piece of evidence he add casually for a moment she stop with a start instantly recover herself no what be that in a tone almost of unconcern gifford tell she of the statement make by the country girl and its corroboration in the finding of the rope as he continue he feel sure that the story be grip he companion more and more closely at last she stop dead and turn to he with eye which have in they intense mystification as well as fear mr gifford do you believe that story i see no reason for disbelieve it he answer quietly it be practically the only conceivable solution of the mystery of the lock door surely -- she stop check the vehement objection that rise to she lip this girl she go on as though search for a plausible argument be it not likely that she be mistake we know what these country people be and she could not have see very clearly but gifford argue gently she statement be confirm by the finding of the rope edith morriston be think strenuously desperately he could see that the word she speak be but mechanical the mere froth of a seething brain yet she splendid self-command -- and he recognize it with admiration -- never desert she however supreme the struggle may have be to retain it a seat be by they she go across the path to it and sit down gifford see that she be deadly pale i fear this wretched business be upset you miss morriston he say gently let I run to the house and fetch something to revive you she make a gesture to stay he and by a effort seem to shake off the threatening collapse no no she say please do not it be very stupid of I but these repeat shock be rather try you see one have never have any experience of the sort before it be more than stupid of I to blunder into the story gifford say self-reproachfully but it never occur to I -- no no of course not she respond and after all i be bind to hear all about it sooner or later sit down and tell I you opinion of the affair suppose the girl be not mistake who do you think the person see escape from the window could have be that be difficult to say a thief no doubt that be a natural conclusion have the police any idea not that i know of i should say decidedly no definite idea or mr henshaw whatever mr henshaw 's idea may be he keep they to himself miss morriston check the remark she have seem about to make and for a few minute there be a awkward silence gifford break it i be so sorry that i have be unable to get any hint of he intention believe I it have not be for want of try but the man for reason best know to himself seem determine to remain inscrutable the girl be stare in front of she yes she respond with a catch of she breath that be evident but it do not much matter i know you have try you best to do what i be foolish enough to ask you and now please do not think any more of it in my ignorance of the man 's character i set you a impossible task all i can do now be to thank you for you sympathy and devotion she tone pained he horribly i hope miss morriston he reply warmly you be not ask I to end my devotion she give a little bitter laugh see that it be useless i have no right to ask its continuance she reply almost coldly nor to expect you to involve yourself in my -- in we worry but if i ask to be allow that privilege he urge she shake she head no no my friend she insist with less warmth than the word imply it can lead to no good and would be a mistake let the man alone to involve yourself with he can bring you nothing but trouble promise I you will take no further heed of this unhappy business she turn to he as she speak the last word and there seem less trouble in she face than in he for at he heart there be a sickening fear and suspicion of what the word portend i can not promise that he object but i ask you it be my wish she return with a touch of command for my sake or yours he rejoin for both give I you promise you must if we be to remain friend she look and the fascination in she voice seem to pull the very heart out of he you be ask a cruelly hard thing of I he reply with a tremor in he voice i do not understand -- no you do not understand she interrupt quickly it be enough to know that you have take a girl 's foolish commission too seriously so seriously as to run the risk of make thing even worse than they threaten to be now i ask you to leave well alone if it be well he say doubtfully of course why should it not be she rejoin in a not very convincing tone now i shall rely on you -- and i be sure it will not be in vain -- to respect my wish thing seem to be in a horrible muddle she add with a rather dreary laugh but let 's hope they will right themselves before long she rise compelling he to rise too something in the tone and manner of she last speech make he quite unwilling to end they conference and desperately anxious to speak out everything that be in he mind and try to bring matter to a crisis do not go for a moment he say as she begin to move away towards the house i have something to say to you she turn quickly and face he with a suggestion of displeasure in she eye what be it she say with a touch of impatience only this he answer quietly have you lose a brooch miss morriston at the question the blood leave she cheek as it have do a little while before then surge back till she face be suffuse a brooch yes i have miss one have you find it the word be speak with a calmness which fail to hide the eagerness behind they i think so he answer take out he letter-case a pearl set in diamond mount on a safety-pin he open the case and show it pin into the soft lining yes that be mine she say and for a moment or two by a strange attraction each look into the other 's eye gifford bent he head over the case as he unfasten the brooch and take it out where -- where do you find it something in the girl 's voice make he glad that he be not look at she in the garden he say in the garden she repeat he be look up now and see the intense relief in she face to-day no last time i be up here i ought to have take it to the house at once but -- but it be a temptation to I to keep it till i could give it back to you like this do forgive I it be plain she divine what he mean but she cold manner come to the aid of she embarrassment i be only too glad to have it again i be so glad you find it so be i he respond with a touch of fervor i wish i could relieve you mind of everything else as easily i be sure you do she say wistfully and impulsively half put out she hand he catch it as she be in the act of check the action and draw it back you may be sure -- quite sure of my devotion he say and raise she hand to he lip a exclamation and a sudden start as the hand be quickly withdraw make he look up edith morriston 's eye be fix with something like fear on a object behind he a intuition tell he what it be before he look round to see henshaw with he characteristic rather stealthy walk come towards they gifford set he tooth hard as the two face round and await henshaw 's approach this man shall not annoy you he say in a undertone do not quarrel with he for heaven 's sake she entreat in the same tone under she breath as the disturbing presence draw near there be a strange excitement in she voice though none in the set face i think you brother be look for you miss morriston henshaw say in he even voice when he be within a dozen pace of they i be just go to look for he the girl reply in a voice strangely change from that in which she have talk with gifford be not it lucky mr gifford have pick up in the garden a brooch i lose some day ago i do not dare to tell dick as it be he gift henshaw give a casual glance at the ornament i congratulate you he respond coolly then gifford see he eye seek hers as he add : where be it find near the tower the covert malice of the insinuation be plain in the questioner 's look although the tone be casual enough no on the lawn gifford reply quietly chapter xix in the churchyard nothing more of importance happen that day at wynford and gifford have no further opportunity of private talk with edith morriston but it be evident to he and the knowledge give he intense concern that the girl go in fear of gervase henshaw that he be intimidate she and use he brother 's death for that purpose be beyond doubt and the very fact that edith morriston be a woman of uncommon courage and self-control one who in ordinary circumstance would be the last to give way to fear or submit to bully show how serious the matter have become gifford on he part determine that this intolerable state of thing must come to a end and that in spite of the command lay upon he by the girl he would now pit himself against she persecutor he have give no actual promise and even if he have it would have be draw from he in ignorance of certain means which he possess of help in this crisis and a significant circumstance which come to gifford 's knowledge a day or two after he interview with edith morriston in the garden of wynford be the cause of he begin to take action without further delay late on the next Sunday afternoon gifford have go for a country walk which he have arrange to bring he round in time for the evening service at the little village church of wynford standing just outside the park boundary he way take he by well-remembered field-path which although towards the end of he walk darkness have set in he have no difficulty in trace the last field he cross bring he to a by-road join the highway which run through wynford the junction be about a quarter of a mile from the church as he near the stile which admit to the road he see on the other side of the hedge and show just above it the head of a man at the sound of he footstep the man quickly turn and as for a moment the fitful moonlight catch he face gifford be sure he recognize gervase henshaw but he take no notice and keep on he way to the stile which he cross and gain the road as he do so he glance back a horse and trap be wait there with henshaw in it he be now bend down probably with the object of conceal he identity and have move on a few pace farther down the road why be he wait there gifford ask himself the obvious question with a decidedly uneasy feeling henshaw the londoner on a Sunday evening wait with a horse and trap in a unfrequented lane a road which run nowhere but to a farm what do it mean naturally gifford 's suspicion connect edith morriston with the circumstance and yet he tell himself the idea be monstrously improbable it be more likely that henshaw be bind upon some search with the police he movement be and have be for some time mysterious enough gifford 's impulse as he turn into the high road be to stay there in concealment and watch for the upshot of henshaw 's presence the suggestion do not however altogether commend itself to he he dislike the idea of spy even upon such a man as henshaw whom he have good reason to suspect of play a dastardly game it be probable too that henshaw have recognize he and might be on the look-out it would be intensely humiliating to be catch watch so turn the pro and con over in he mind gifford walk slowly on in a state of irresolution till he come to a wicket-gate which admit from the road to a path which run through the churchyard there he stop debate with himself whether he should turn back and keep a eye on henshaw or go on into the church where service be just begin it do seem absurd to imagine that henshaw with he conveyance could be wait there by appointment for a girl of the character and position of edith morriston true he have see they walk together in secret which be strange enough but that need not necessarily have be a planned meeting such a urgent curiosity have hold of he at the bare possibility of something wrong that he temporize with he scruple be about to turn back to the lane when he see the figure of a woman come towards he along the churchyard path she be tall and so far as he could make out muffle in a cloak and veil he heart give a leap for although the woman 's face and figure be indistinguishable the height and gait correspond with those of edith morriston as she come near the little gate where he stand she stop dead seem to hesitate a moment and then turn as though to go back determine to set he doubt at rest gifford pass quickly through the gate and follow she at a overtake pace evidently sensible of she pursuit the woman quicken she step and as gifford gain on she turn quickly from the path thread she way among the grave to escape he she have go but a few step when in she hurry she trip over the mound of a small unmarked grave and fall to the ground gifford run to she and take she arm assist she to rise miss morriston he exclaim for he now be sure of she identity i hope you be not hurt he add mechanically he mind full of a greater and more critical contingency mr gifford she respond but he be sure she have not recognize he then for the first time oh no thank you i be not in the least hurt it be stupid of I to trip and fall like that be you go to church she add evidently wish to get away i be he answer and you i be too she say conquer she embarrassment but i have a headache and prefer the fresh air do not let I keep you she hold out she hand service have begin he take she hand miss morriston he say gravely do not think I very unmannerly but i be not go to leave you here in the bright moonlight he could see she expression of rather haughty surprise i think you be unmannerly mr gifford she retort defiantly may i ask why you be not go to leave I here because he answer with quiet decision mr henshaw be wait just there in turner 's lane be he the same defiant note but there be anxiety behind the cold pretence yes and pardon I i have a idea he be wait there for you he firm tone and manner baffle equivocation what be it to you if he be she return with a brave attempt to suggest cold displeasure but she lip tremble and she voice be scarcely steady it be something to I he reply insistently because it mean a great deal to you this man be persecute you he be -- mr gifford she exclaim you take -- he hold up he hand please let I finish miss morriston i can convince you that i be not take too much upon myself i be no fool and be not interfere without warrant this man henshaw have succeed in persuade you that you be in he power that be very far from be the case and i can prove it i do not understand you mr gifford the tone of cold annoyance be go now

go through the churchyard to the private gate into the park if i have not happen to come along just then and see henshaw wait -- oh do not talk of that now she entreat i know it mean horrible misery for the rest of my life but anything seem better than the terrible scandal which threaten we with which henshaw threaten you the scoundrel gifford correct now you shall see how little he really have

mr gifford do trust I and tell I everything i hope it be not necessary to talk of trust between we he reply with as much tenderness as he chivalry permit no forgive I i hope not she respond quietly now please tell I mr gifford what i be longing to hear you will remember gifford begin as they slowly pace the moon-lit path that on the evening i come down here my suitcase contain my evening clothes have go astray on the railway there be no chance of its turn up at the hotel before ten o'clock and i be therefore prevent from appear at the dance till quite late naturally i would not hear of kelson wait for I which like the good-natured fellow he be he propose to do he therefore go off in good time yes i remember he arrive quite early edith morriston murmur clement henshaw gifford proceed leave the hotel about the same time they must have reach you house within a few minute of one another as he pause he companion look round at he inquiringly yes she say with a certain suggestion of reticence i remember that too gifford continue have see kelson off i go up to we sitting-room to wait till my kit should arrive i be very keen on see again the old place where in my young day i use to spend such happy month and my enforced wait soon become almost intolerable boredom the result be that i get a fit of the fidget i could not settle down to read and at last have still a hour to spare i resolve in my restlessness to stroll out and take a preliminary look from outside at what be practically my old home yes there be a catch of grow excitement in edith morriston 's voice which be scarcely above a whisper the wind be sharp that night as we all know gifford go on and forbid loitering a smart walk of fifteen or twenty minute bring I here know as i do every path and short cut across the park the old familiar house look picturesque enough with its many light window and every sign of gaiety keep away from the front entrance where carriage be constantly drive up and a good many people be about i go round to the other side avoid the stable and pass along by the west wing this of course bring I to the old tower the scene of many a game and frolic in my young day at its foot i stand for a while recall memory of the past in the mere idleness of affectionate remembrance i go up to the garden door of the tower and mechanically turn the handle it be unlock i hardly know what make I go in a impulse to stand again in those once familiar surroundings it be fascinating to be in the old tower which the dim light show I be just as i have last see it more than a dozen year ago the past come vividly back to I and i stand there for a while indulge in a reverie of old day the association of the place seem every moment to grip I more compellingly the tower seem quiet and altogether desert all i could hear be the dance-music away in the hall there could be no risk i thought of be see if i go up to the floor above : and i quietly ascend the stair to the first landing the narrow passage lead to the hall be light up with sconce at its farther end i could see the movement of the dancer the band be play a favorite waltz of mine and i stay there rather enjoy the music and the sight from my safe retreat it do not seem likely that any one would be come to the tower and i resolve foolishly enough for of course i be in my travel suit to wander up to the next floor and take a look at the room which hold a rather sentimental association for I it be a stupid thing to do as i be there in for the moment a rather questionable situation still i feel pretty secure from be notice and go up warily to the next floor there i find the room considerably alter from my recollection of it especially as it be arrange as a sitting-out room but no one be there nor be there any sign of its have be use which from its rather secluded position be natural enough have give a reminiscent look round i conclude that it would be best to make a retreat especially as there would be ample opportunity later in the evening for I to visit it again i turn and go to the door on reach the stair i hear to my great annoyance the sound of person come up and the subdue tone of a man 's voice i realize that i be catch and my one chance of escape be to retreat up the topmost flight of stair and wait in the darkness till the couple have go into the room i have just quit accordingly i turn and go up the remain flight on tip-toe two stair at a time wait beyond the turn in hide till the coast should be clear the couple have now reach the landing below and so far as i could tell go into the room i be just about to make a quick descent hope to get past that and other awkward point unnoticed when to my dismay i become aware that the people whom i have think safely settle in the room below have come out and be begin to mount the topmost flight of stair this be indeed a most awkward predicament for I and i debate for a moment whether my best course would not be to go boldly down the stair and pass they rather than retreat to the top room if i have choose the former course how differently thing might have turn out at any rate for better or worse the situation as it exist to-day might have present itself in quite another form edith morriston glance quickly at gifford as he utter the reflection she seem about to speak but check the impulse and he continue : tread noiselessly i bolt up the remain stair and go into the dark room at the top at the door which stand open i stop and listen to my intense vexation for the situation be become decidedly unpleasant the pair be still come up in silence now but i could hear they approach footstep and the rustle of the lady 's dress unfortunately there be no corner on the top landing where i could stand hide so i be force to draw back into the room happily it have be so familiar to I from childhood that i could find my way about it in the dark i well remember the little inner room form by the bartizan of the tower and into this i tip-toed feeling horribly guilty if only i have not be in that suspicious brown suit in evening clothes there would of course have be no necessity for this surreptitious retreat i devoutly hope that the two be merely bent on explore the place and that the darkness of the old lumber-room would quickly satisfy they curiosity and send they down again i hear they come into the room the man speaking in a tone so low that the word be indistinguishable from where i stand and then the sound of the door be shut strike my ear unpleasantly then the man speak in a more audible voice a voice which in a flash i recognize as henshaw 's and he first word catch my attention with a unpleasant grip chapter xxi gifford continue he story ` fail to get the regular invitation i have a right to expect i have have to take this mode of see you ' i just catch the word in henshaw 's metallic rather penetrate voice the lady 's reply be give in a tone so low that at the distance i stand the word be indistinguishable ` unmanly ' he exclaim evidently take up she word ' i do not admit that for a moment you know how we stand to one another and what my feeling be towards you it be no use for you to try to ignore they or I i will not stand be treat like this there be no reason why my advance should be repulse as though they be a insult ' i catch the last word of the lady 's reply : ' -- good reason and you know it ' it be more than clear to I now that i be to be the witness of a very hateful piece of business the man 's tone even more than he word make my blood boil and i begin to congratulate myself on be thus accidentally in a position to protect if need be the girl whom this fellow be evidently bully with the utmost care i creep nearer to the small curtained arch which admit to the larger room the pitch darkness of the little turret chamber in which i stand make I feel quite safe from observation and i have no qualm now about eavesdropping the situation surely justify it i go forward till i could get a sight round the arch of the two person in the room they be stand near the window at some distance from I in the obscurity not quite as impenetrable as that out of which i look i could distinguish the tall figure of the girl in a dark ball-dress and face she towards I the big form of henshaw you have no idea who the lady be edith morriston interrupt he to ask naturally not the vaguest gifford answer when i have go as far as be safe i set myself to listen again ' i do not know what you game be or whether you think you can play the fool with I ' henshaw be say in a ugly tone ` but i warn you not to try it i be not a man to be fool now let we be friend again ' he add in a softer tone it seem as though he put out he hand for a caress for the girl start back and i hear she say ` never ' ` folly ' he exclaim then take a step forward ` you be in love with another man ' he demand i could hear the hiss of the question ` if i be i should not tell you ' be the defiant reply in a low voice ` you would not ' he snap viciously ` let I tell you this then you shall never marry another man while i live i hold the bar to that as you will find ' ` you mean to act like a cad ' i hear the girl say ' i mean to act ' he retort ` like a sensible man who have a fair advantage and mean in spite of you caprice to keep it ' ` fair ' the girl echo in scorn ` yes fair ' henshaw insist with some heat ' i save you from a scandal that would have ruin you and it be natural i should ask my reward but you notion of gratitude which have lead I on to love you soon evaporate but i be not so easily dismiss ' ` you mean to continue you cowardly persecution ' there be a tremor in the girl 's voice that make I long to get at the man ' i mean to marry you ' he retort ` or at least -- ' ` do not touch I ' she say hoarsely as he approach she ` you be come away with I to-night ' he insist ` you need not pretend to be horrify it will not be you first nocturnal adventure and i have wait quite long enough ' he have drive she to the other corner on the window side of the room as i lean forward ready to fasten on the man when he should offer violence i hear a peculiar sound as of a loose piece of wood or iron striking the sill ` keep away ' the girl say in a hoarse whisper ` if you drive I to desperation i swear i will kill you ' there follow a vicious laugh from henshaw and i could tell from the panting which follow that a struggle be go on just then the moon come out and i could see that henshaw be try to get some object -- a weapon i guess -- away from the girl it be a wonder that neither of they see I in the dark opening i must have still be practically hide and they too intent on they struggle to notice anything beyond i be just on the point of spring out to the girl 's assistance when she stagger back and turn make a rush for the door in a moment henshaw be after she but in he blind haste he either trip or stumble and fall heavily i think it likely that in the dark he strike against the corner of the rather massive oak table in the center of the room and be throw off he balance he rise immediately but i be now close behind he and as he put out he arm to clutch the girl who be then half through the doorway i grip he by the collar and with all my strength swing he back into the room he must have be most horribly surprise for he utter a gasping cry as he spin round and instead of keep he foot and rush at I as i expect he go down with a thud by the window they have stop in they walk now and edith morriston be listen almost breathlessly to gifford 's graphic story never for a moment have he suggest the lady 's identity for all that have pass neither of they might have know it i turn quickly to the door gifford continue but to my surprise the lady whom i expect to find there have disappear i could neither see nor hear any sign of she i take a step back into the room fully expect a onslaught from the infuriate henshaw ` you cowardly brute ' i exclaimed in the heat of my anger and excitement but no reply come and to my wonder he lay still on the floor where he have fall chapter xxii how gifford escape i wait for some time in silence expect he every moment to rise and retaliate he be a big muscular man but it never occur to I to be in any fear of he physically for one thing my indignation be too hot to admit fear i happen to be quite good enough at boxing to be able to take care of myself and i be sure -- all the more from he continue to lie there -- that such a despicable bully must be a coward ` you have better get up and clear out of this house ' i say wrathfully ` before you get the thrashing you so richly deserve ' no answer come as i wait for one there be save for my own breathing dead silence in the room before speak i have hear something like a long draw sigh come from the man on the floor but now listen intently i could hear nothing two explanation suggest themselves to account for he still lie there one shame at he vile conduct have be witness by a third person the other that he have strike he head against the wall in fall and be stunned naturally i be not greatly concern at the fellow 's condition whichever it be still it would i conclude be well to settle the matter and if he be merely skulk see that he clear out of the house i shut the door and then cross to where the man lay strike a match and hold it out to get a view of he he lay on he face with he arm bent under he i prod he with my foot but he do not stir he lay absolutely rather uncannily still the match burn out i strike another and lean over to get a sight of he face to my horror there meet my eye a dark wet patch on the floor which i instinctively feel must be blood you may imagine the terrible thrill the conviction give I yet i could not believe even then that anything really serious have happen i strike a fresh match and hold it up with one hand with the other take the man 's shoulder and turn he over on he back then i know that i be there with a dead man the hue of the face be unmistakably that of death and the cause of it be plainly to be see there be a wound in the man 's neck from which blood come freely how have the wound -- clearly a fatal one -- be cause i search for a explanation that which force itself upon I be that the girl have in she desperation stab she persecutor with some weapon she have find there or bring with she it be a horrible idea to entertain although the act would have be almost justified i wonder if by chance the weapon be still there strike a match i look round yes there on the floor near the spot where henshaw have first fall lay a narrow blood-stained chisel whatever my first conclusion be i can see now the most probable explanation of how henshaw come by he death-wound he have force the chisel away from the girl he have keep it in he hand in he eagerness to prevent he victim 's escape he have not realize that he be hold it point upward and when he fall it have pierce he with all the force of he heavy body fall plump on it then you know it be a accident edith morriston draw a great breath of relief from the painful tension with which she have listen i can see it be a pure accident gifford answer all the same it be a accident with a ugly look about it and i quickly realize that i be in a equivocal -- not to say dangerous situation it be a terrible predicament for you the girl say sympathetically it be indeed and one which call for prompt action moreover the very fact that i be not in evening clothes make it all the more suspicious i pull my wit together and proceed to make quite sure that the man be actually dead that i find be beyond all doubt the case and it now remain for I to make my escape before be find there in that hideous situation i go out to the landing close the door after I with the idea of get down the stair and escape into the garden as secretly as i have come in i have creep down a very few stair when i find this be not to be a chatter of voice just below tell I that people be in the tower and lean over i could see couple pass between the passage to the hall and the room below I at any moment i realize some of they might take it into they head to explore the topmost room when the result would be disastrous certainly in my mufti i could not get past the next floor just then without exciting fatal notice and to wait for a opportunity when the coast might be clear be too dangerous see the risk of someone come up it be not easy to see my way of escape i go to the top room and lock the door my nerve be pretty strong but they be severely try when i shut myself in with the dead man and have the consciousness of have lay myself open to the charge of be he murderer i stand there by the door think desperately what i could do fool that i have be to venture into the place in that garb but who could have foresee the result anyhow there be no time for reflection it be necessary to act and seek a possible expedient hopelessly enough i go into the little inner room and strike a match in a moment a thrill of hope come to I for the first object the light show I be a big coil of rope conspicuous among the odds and end of lumber in the recess the idea of escape by the window have only occur to I to be dismiss as a sheer impossibility the height of the tower make that quite prohibitive but here seem a chance of it if only the rope be long enough i get hold of the coil as my match burn out and pull it away from the surround rubbish its weight give I hope that it would be sufficient in haste i drag it to the outer room into which the moonlight be now streaming with a shudder glance at the dead man whose ashen face stare up in ghastly fashion in the moonbeam i open the window and look out to make sure that no one be below satisfy on that point i bring forward the rope and begin pay it out of the window to my content i see that there be a strong iron stanchion at the side which would allow of the rope be fasten to it there be light enough just then to enable I to see pretty well when the end of the rope reach the ground and upon examine what be leave in the room i calculate that not much more than half be outside in a flash the discovery give I a idea why should i not simply pass the rope behind the stanchion and use it double by that mean i could pull it down after I when i reach the ground and so not only effect my escape but also leave the fact unknown that together with the door lock on the inside would tend to make henshaw 's death a mystery with a strong probability in favor of suicide which would be altogether the happiest conclusion to arrive at in fact my hastily form calculation be as we know subsequently bear out and the suicide theory would probably have be quietly accept have it not be for the intervention of gervase henshaw with he smartness and incredulity that be practically the end of my story miss morriston i lay the chisel by the body go to the window pull in the rope carefully get the center adjust it through the stanchion and with a last look at the dead man get out of the window a rather nerve-trying business and begin to lower myself i have calculate that the double rope be long enough to take I to within a few foot of the ground and this prove to be the case when i come to the end i let go of one side and pull the other with I as i drop then i draw the rope down the latter half when release fall with a great thud hastily i set off for the lake drag the rope after I at the landing-stage by the boat-house i coil it up as best i could and throw it in as i have anticipate it be thick and heavy enough to sink without be weighted then with a last glance at the tower i make my way as quickly as possible to the hotel in a state of nerve which you may imagine little thinking that my descent from the tower have be witness my first intention be to abandon all idea of go to the dance but on reflection i come to the conclusion that i have better at least put in a appearance there accordingly i change and come on late to the ball as you know naturally a great curiosity possess I to find out the girl who have play the third part in the drama which have be enact in the tower but i have not see she face nor hear she voice sufficiently to be able to recognize it there be several tall girl in the room yourself among the number but naturally it never occur to I -- he stop awkwardly just as by inadvertence he be about to say that which all along he have studiously refrain from suggest to suspect I edith morriston complete he sentence with a smile no he continue frankly you would have be the last person to enter my head in that connexion and then kelson come out of the passage from the tower with miss tredworth to whom he have just propose he introduce I in a way which suggest they new relationship and we have just begin to chat when to my horror i notice what to my mind go to prove that she be the person for whom i be look there be dark red stain on the white rose she wear on she dress it be a unpleasant shock to I place I as it seem in a terribly difficult position for at the first blush of my discovery it all seem to fit in clement henshaw have be i imagine in love with miss tredworth before kelson appear on the scene she have throw he over for my friend and henshaw take he rejection in bad part have threaten to expose some questionable incident in she past now that be all happily explain away and i will not retrace the step by which my imagination lead I on but you see how painfully i be situate with respect to my friend that be my story miss morriston have i know what i know now i should not have keep it to myself so long but up to a certain point until the last few day there seem no reason for make the dangerous secret know to any one now when it appear necessary to protect you from this man henshaw the account of the part i play in the tragedy must be tell in you interest edith morriston draw in a deep breath as gifford cease speak it be very kind and chivalrous of you mr gifford she say in a low voice to run this risk for I although you tell I the story shall never involve you in danger i be ready for you sake to face any danger the tell of my secret may hold for I he respond firmly i be sure of that as i be sure of you she reply then add with a change of tone you be certain for a while that muriel tredworth have not only be guilty of something discreditable in she past but have stab to death in you presence the man who know she secret i be afraid there seem to I no alternative but to believe it he acknowledge when you find out that you be mistake in she identity and that she have nothing whatever to do with the tragedy you would naturally transfer the opinion you have hold of she to -- to the other woman -- the one who be actually there the question be put searchingly and be not to be evade that would be a natural consequence gifford admit frankly but there be in my mind always a grow doubt whether the wound have not be give accidentally and that doubt become almost certainty when the real identity of henshaw 's victim become apparent edith morriston look at he steadily you know it -- for certain she ask almost coldly naturally i can not fail to know it now he answer sympathetically she give a rather bitter laugh i shall not deny it to you mr gifford even if i think it could be of any use but know so much you owe it to I to hear my explanation of matter which look so black against I and above all to accept my absolute assurance that so far as i be concerned clement henshaw 's wound be quite accidental indeed i never dream that he have be hurt until he body be find gifford seize she hand by a irresistible impulse miss morriston if you only know how glad and relieved i be to hear you say that he exclaim when you hear my story she say composedly but with a underlie bitterness which be hardly to be conceal the story of a long martyrdom of persecution -- for it have be nothing less -- you will acquit I of be guilty of anything disreputable what i do be innocent enough and it moreover be force upon I tell I he urge tenderly i must tell you she return if only to set myself right in you eye who have be witness of the terrible sequel to it all but not to-night it be too late and the story be long : it must be tell at length dick will be home by this and i must go i would ask you to come in but there would be no opportunity for private talk there will you meet I to-morrow morning at half-past ten by the summer-house near the wood that run up to jame ' farm you know it well i will be there it be rather a long way for you to come she say but there be reason for avoid the big wood with the ride i know he reply henshaw might be on the look-out there for you then he add in answer to she quick look of curiosity i happen once by accident to see he there with you ah yes she admit with a shudder i will tell you about that i think i can guess he say quietly now in the meantime you will take no notice of this man if he write or try to see you he will probably be exasperate by you not keep the appointment this evening and may determine to put the screw on yes she agree with a linger fear in she voice leave he to I to deal with gifford say reassuringly and do make up you mind that all will be well i will thanks to you my friend in need and so with a warm pressure of the hand they part chapter xxiii edith morriston 's story next morning gifford be in good time at the rendezvous a sequestered corner of the park and edith morriston soon join he let we come into the summer-house she suggest it will be more convenient for my long story first of all tell I gifford say have anything happen since last night have henshaw make any move she take out a note and hand it to he only that she say with a uneasy laugh there must have be some misunderstanding last evening gifford read i can not think that you not keep the appointment be intentional anyhow i can wait till to-night then i shall be at the lane just beyond the church at 730 that you may not repent i hope you have not repent that be all a thinly veil threat gifford observe the man in he way seem as great a bully as he brother may i keep this i be go to see mr henshaw presently and have a serious talk with he after which i shall hope to be able to convince you that you trouble be at a end if you can do that -- she say the knowledge that i have be of service to you will be my great reward i hope i be sufficiently a gentleman not to ask or expect any other she make no reply they have enter the little rustic summer-house and sit down dick have drive into branchester edith morriston say perhaps to end a embarrassing pause he will not be back till luncheon so we be not likely to be interrupt that be well gifford answer now please begin what i be most anxious to hear the story i have to tell you mr gifford edith morriston begin be not a pleasant one and be as humiliating to I to relate as be the experience the terrible experience i have to go through but to be fair to myself i must be quite frank with you and be sure you will never give I cause to repent speak unreservedly you can rely upon my honor to respect you confidence gifford respond warmly i know i may the girl answer well then you must know first of all that my father marry a second time and he unfortunately choose a woman well connect enough but heartless and a utter snob i suppose man be often blind to these hateful quality before marriage doubtless a clever unscrupulous woman be able to hide she fault when she have the main chance in view my stepmother be a good deal younger than my father and i dare say on the whole make he socially at any rate a fairly good wife she one idea be social aggrandizement at any cost and i unhappily be to fall a victim to it i suppose we ought not to blame she for determine that i ought to marry well she want to do the best for the family and be constitutionally incapable of make allowance for or consider any one 's private feeling to make a long story short my stepmother in pursuance of she policy determine that i should marry a certain peer whose name i need not mention he be altogether a bad lot and i soon come to know it i receive certain warning but without they i could see that the man be all wrong and i tell my stepmother what i thought of he she scoff at the idea that he be any worse than the average man all i have to concern myself with be the fact that he be a peer of ancient lineage of large property and there be not another girl in the kingdom who would not jump at he i might well chance he make I unhappy since he could make I a countess and to refuse he would be absolute madness mr morriston 's face grow black at the very think of it she soon get my father on to she side and between they i have a hateful time of it it be the old story which will be tell as long as there be worldly selfish woman on the earth but it be none the less fresh and poignant to I who have to live through the experience thing get so bad through my continued refusal to fall in with my stepmother 's wish that i be reduce to a state border on despair my father whom i loved be turn against I he mind be so prejudiced in favor of the man whom i be be gradually force to take as a husband that he could see no good reason only sheer obstinacy in my refusal altogether my life be become a perfect hell dick who might have stand by I and make thing less unbearable be away on a two year ' tour for big game shooting i have no one to confide in no one to help I just as thing be at they worst and i be get quite desperate i meet at a dance a man name archie jolliffe he have be a sailor but have come into money have give up the service and settle down to enjoy himself he and i get on very well together from the first he be a breezy genial young fellow fond of fun and adventure and a pleasant contrast in every way to the man who be threaten to ruin my life i do not know that in happier circumstance i should have care for jolliffe there be not much in he beyond he capacity for fun he be incline to be fast in a foolish sort of way a man 's man rather than one for whom a woman could feel much respect still he be not vicious like the other for whom my dislike increase every time i see he well archie jolliffe fall in love with I and in he impetuous way make no secret of it i need not say it do not take long for my step-mother to become aware of it and with the idea that i be encourage he she become furious except that poor archie be a welcome change from the atmosphere of my home and the hateful attention of the man who be always be leave alone with I i do not really care for he and but for mr morriston 's attitude i should have tell he it be no use he thinking of I consider the sequel i wish i have do so but it be too late now for regret he love-making give I a chance of defy my stepmother and i rather enjoy baulk she plan to keep archie and I apart if i do not encourage he -- indeed i refuse he every time he propose -- i do not dismiss he as i ought to have do and he evidently have a idea that perseverance would win the day and so after a fashion it do matter reach such a pitch at last that it become plain that i must either consent to marry the man i loathe or leave my home for good goad on by my apparent encouragement of archie jolliffe my stepmother resolve to bring matter to a crisis she start a terrific row with I one day my father be bring into it and i stand up against they both the upshot be that when the interview be over i go out of the house boil with indignation and for the time utterly reckless chance catch the psychological moment and throw I in the way of archie jolliffe he see something be wrong and press I to tell he what have happen he be so chivalrous and sympathetic that i be lead in my turbulent state of mind to become confidential the more so when he tell I he have know for some time how i be be treat ` you must not marry that man ' he say ` it be a outrage for you people to suggest such a thing he be a big swell and all that with heap of money but any man in town who know anything will tell you he be quite impossible ' i have hear that and have tell my stepmother but of course it do not suit she to heed I she care for nothing beyond the fact that i should be a countess and say so archie and i talk together for a long time and with the result that in my longing for protection from the power against I and my indignation at the way i be be treat i have promise when we part to marry he and we have plan to elope together that very night at that time we be live at haynthorpe hall -- you know it -- about ten mile from here that evening i slip out of the house after dinner and meet archie who be wait for I at a quiet spot outside the village he plan be to drive across country to branchester junction where it be not likely we should be notice or recognize catch the night train up to town and be marry there next morning you may imagine the state of desperation -- utter desperation and recklessness -- i be in to have consent to such a thing but i could see no help for it and of two evil i seem to be choose the least the future look hideously vague and dark still jolliffe be capable of be transform into a decent husband while the other man assuredly be not archie seem overjoyed poor fellow as i mount into the dog-cart he have hardly expect that i should not repent once we be fairly off and bowling along the dark road a sense of relief come to I and whatever qualm i may have feel soon vanish however wrong my conduct be i have be drive to it and my father for whom i be sorry by take part against I deserve to lose I my companion have the tact not to talk much and i be glad to think he could realize the seriousness of the step he have persuade I to take but the little he do say be affectionately sympathetic and now that the die be cast it comfort I to indulge hope of he all go well till we be about three mile from branchester then a awful thing happen we horse be a fast trotter and archie let he have he head know that it would never do for we to miss the train as we turn a blind corner we come into collision with another dog-cart which we have neither see nor hear the force of the impact be so great that we off-wheel be smash the cart go over we be both fling out and as i fall i realize horribly that my desperate expedient be a failure i be not much hurt for my fall be break and i soon scramble to my foot but archie lay there motionless the man who be the only occupant of the other dog-cart have pull into the hedge and alight he come up to offer he help and to express he sorrow at the accident which he say doubtless with truth be not he fault i dare say you will have guess that the man be clement henshaw between we we raise archie and carry he to the side of the road he be quite insensible and breathing heavily ' i be afraid he be rather seriously hurt ' the man say sympathetically ` we ought to get he to branchester hospital as soon as possible ' i be so overwhelm by the sudden and terrible end to we adventure that i could think of nothing by a great piece of luck a belated dray come along on its way to branchester into this with the driver 's help we lift poor archie and then henshaw and i drive on in he trap to prepare the hospital authority for the patient 's arrival the doctor after a cursory examination give very little hope and i leave the hospital in a most wretched state of mind feeling more than indirectly responsible for the end of that bright young life henshaw arrange for the horse and smash dogcart to be fetch from the scene of the accident and then he ask where in the town he should escort I i thank he and say a good deal to he surprise that i be not go to stop in branchester but would hire a fly and drive to my destination i stand of course in a hideously false position and that he very soon begin to divine he would not hear of my get a fly at that hour of the night but insist on drive I in he trap to wherever i wish to go unhappily i have no idea of the man 's character or i should never have dream of accept he offer but i be then in no state of mind to judge he nature or question he motive he have prove himself infinitely kind and resourceful so in my lonely and agitate condition i consent little imagine what the dire result to I would be on the drive back to my home i be naturally in a horribly distressed state of mind and hardly dare think of the future my companion tactfully refrain from much talk although i have a idea that he curiosity be greatly excite to learn the explanation of the affair he put occasionally a lead question which i always evade when he take the hint and do not press he inquiry so far as every one else be concern there have be no idea of connect I with poor archie jolliffe the hospital people believe that he have be drive alone and that i have be in the trap with henshaw i dare say they take I for he sister or he wife at last after one of the most wretched hour i ever spend -- and i have have more than my fair share of trouble -- we reach haynthorpe and on the outskirts of the village i ask henshaw to set I down he stop and look at I curiously ` can not you trust I to drive you to you home ' he say insinuatingly i reply that i prefer to get down where we be and thank he as warmly as i be able for all he service ` you have not even tell I you name ' he protest ` mine be clement henshaw i be stay at flinton for hunting ' my answer be that he must not think I ungrateful but that i would rather not tell he my name it could be of no consequence to he ' i should like at least ' he urge ` to be allow to drive over and report how you -- friend -- or be it you brother -- be get on ' i thank he make the best excuse i could for refuse get down from the trap and hurry off through the dark village street thankful to get away from those awkward question but if i think i have finally get rid of mr clement henshaw i be in my ignorance of the man woefully mistaken chapter xxiv how the story end when i reach the house luck unexpectedly favor I my maid whom i have be oblige to take up to a certain point into my confidence and who after the manner of she class have acquire more than a sympathetic inkling of the way my people have be treat I be wait up on the look-out for my return and quietly let I in she tell I that no one but herself have any idea that i be out of the house she have lead they to believe that i have go to bed early with a headache which consider the stress of the past two day be plausible enough so i get back safely to my room which it have not seem likely i should ever enter again and next morning i could see that my over-night 's adventure be quite unsuspected naturally i anticipate a continuation of my stepmother 's attempt to force I into the marriage she have in view and it rather puzzle I to understand why they seem to be drop the prospective bridegroom do not come to the house and stranger still he name be not mention the explanation be soon forthcoming i do not see the newspaper just then in fact i have a idea they be purposely keep away from I but some people who be call mention a big society-scandal come on in the law court in which this precious peer be desperately involve the relief with which i hear the news be unbounded consider all it mean for I but my joy be turn to bitter grief by the news that archie jolliffe after lie unconscious for nearly a week have die of he injury i have contrived during the day he linger to make secret inquiry as to he condition and so know that what would have seem my heartless absence from he bedside have make no difference to he poor fellow gifford comment it be unspeakably sad edith morriston continue but it seem like fate see how thing rearrange themselves afterwards certainly if i be to blame for he piteous end i be to pay the penalty for no sooner be i out of one trouble than another be ready for I after this long preface i come to the most unpleasant episode of henshaw and he persecution on the day i hear of poor archie 's death i have go out for a walk possess by a great longing to be alone in my grief on my way home by a woodland path lead to the hall grounds i to my great annoyance come upon clement henshaw i can not say i be altogether surprise for i have catch a glimpse of some one very like he in the village a day or two before of that i have think little merely take care that the man do not see I but now there be no avoid he and i have more than a suspicion that he have be lie in wait for I at the risk of appear horribly ungrateful i make up my mind on the instant to try to pass he with a bow but need not say that be utterly futile he stand directly in my path and raise he hat ' i be sorry to be the bearer of sad news miss morriston ' he say so he have find out my name assuredly not by accident and the fact anger I perhaps unreasonably ' i have hear of mr jolliffe 's death ' i reply coldly ` if that be what you have to tell I ' ' i think ' he rejoin with assurance ` it quite possible you might not have hear so soon ' from he manner i begin to see that the man be likely to become a annoyance if he be not snub but soon discover that it be not so easily do i thank he coldly enough and try to dismiss he but he insist on walk with I what could i do he seem determine to force he company upon I and i could not run away he try to get out of I how i have come to be drive with archie that night and although i evade he question it be plain that he have a shrewd inkling of the reason not to weary you with a long account of this disagreeable and humiliating affair i will only say that from that day forward i become subject to a determine system of persecution from clement henshaw he waylay I on every possible occasion hold over I a covert threat of the exposure of my escapade till at last i be absolutely afraid to go outside the house for fear of meet he he want to marry you gifford suggest edith morriston give a little shudder i suppose so he be always make love to I and be quite impervious to snub when in consequence of my keep within bound of the house and garden he could not see I he take to write and keep I in terror lest one of he letter should fall into my stepmother 's hand i wish afterwards that i have take a bold line confess what have happen and defy the consequence i think it be the fear of be disgrace in my brother 's eye on he return which keep I from do so in the midst of my worry my father fall into a state of bad health and we take he down to the devonshire coast for change of air needless to say henshaw soon find out we retreat and to my dismay appear there he persecution go on with renew vigor and i have less chance there of escape it be nearly at my wit ' end when fate curiously enough again intervene we be catch in a storm on a long country excursion my stepmother get a severe chill and within a week be dead we return to haynthorpe my father be now in a very precarious state of health henshaw follow we with a pertinacity that be almost devilish but i now venture to defy he threat of expose I he strenuously deny any such intention and declare himself madly in love with I i have now take courage enough to reject he uncompromisingly i forbid he ever to speak to I again and as after that he disappear from the village begin to flatter myself that i have get rid of he my father grow worse now from day to day he linger through the summer and with the chill day of autumn the end come dick hurry home and arrive just in time to see he alive he leave a much larger fortune than we have suppose he to possess and dick always fond of sport be soon in negotiation for this place which have come into the market no sooner have we settle in here than to my horror clement henshaw begin to renew he persecution he have evidently hear that i have inherit a good share of my father 's fortune and be worth make another effort for he recommence to write to I he come down secretly and waylay I and when everything else fail he resort to threat not veil as before but open and unmistakable he vow that if i persist in refuse to marry he he would take good care that i should never marry any one else he hold he say my reputation in he hand he hope he should never have to use he power but i ought to consider the state of he feeling towards I and not goad he to desperate measure in short he take all the joy out of my life for i have come from mere dislike simply to loathe the man who could show himself such a dastardly cad and the worst of it be that i see no way out of it dick be a good fellow and very fond of I but although you might not think it he be almost absurdly proud of the family name and its unsmirched record and if i have confide in he and he have horsewhip henshaw what good could that have do it would simply have infuriate the man who would have at once make public my escapade and few people would have give I the credit of its be innocent dick have just sink a large part of he fortune in this place he have take over the hound and be certain of become popular all that would be nullify and upset if this man henshaw choose to let loose he tongue for how could i even pretend to deny he story at the very least the truth would mean a hateful reflection on my dead father and the whole thing would have lead to a intolerable scandal yet it seem as though this could be avoid in no other way but by marry my persecutor a man whom i have reason to hate and who have show himself to be such a unchivalrous bully about this time -- that be shortly before the hunt ball -- rumor have get about the neighborhood that i be go to marry lord painswick he be certainly pay I a good deal of attention and i fancy dick would have like the match but i could not bring myself to care for painswick and indeed he courtship only add to my other worry but clement henshaw hear the rumor and it have naturally the effect of rouse he wretched pursuit of I to greater activity he vow with brutal vehemence that i should not marry painswick and declare that when we engagement be announce he would tell he the story he have against I that in itself do not trouble I much since i have no intention of marry painswick still the man 's relentless persecution be get more than i could bear i now come to the night of the hunt ball for some day previously i have see or hear nothing of henshaw and have even begin to hope that something might have happen to make the man abandon he line of conduct i might have know he better to my intense annoyance and dismay i see he come into the ballroom with all the hateful assurance that be so familiar to I i could not well escape see that i be act as hostess for a while he beyond a formal greet let I alone but i feel what be surely come and it be almost a relief when he take a opportunity of ask for a dance he must have see the hate in my eye as in my hesitation they meet he for he say with a forced laugh ` you need not do violence to you feeling by dance with I miss morriston if you do not care to but there be something i must say to you let we come out of the crowd to where we shall not be overhear ' i have never feel so madly furious with the man as at that moment and it be with a reckless desire to tell he in strong language my opinion of he tactic to insult he if that be possible to declare that i would die rather than yield to he that i lead the way to the tower my desire to get out of the crowd be even greater than he for a mad hope possess I that in some desperate way i might bring we relation to a final issue we go into the sitting-out room ` some one will be come in here ' he object ` be there a room upstairs where we can talk ' ` there be a room up there ' i answer as steadily as my indignation would let I and unheed the idea of compromise myself i go up the dark staircase in front of he naturally the idea that we stormy interview be to have a witness would have be the last thing to enter my mind it never occur to I to make sure no one be already in the room when we enter it you know what happen mr gifford so i need not go through that the man show himself the cowardly bully that he be somehow up there alone with he as at least i think in the dark my courage give way and it be only when the man seek in he vehemence to take hold of I that anger and disgust cast out fear it be quite by accident that i touch and catch up the chisel lie on the window-sill as the man 's hand seek I it strike the edge of the chisel and get a wound that must have be how the blood come upon my dress he seize my arm and after a struggle wrench the implement away but i never strike he with it far from give he he death-blow the chisel be never in my hand afterwards when i rush for the door in a sudden panic for know that i have hurt he i believe the man in he rage might be capable of anything and when in spring after I he stumble and fall the chisel must have be hold by he edge upward and so pierce he to he death that i be certain now gifford say be what must have happen and you think i have stab he the girl say with a reproachful smile i hardly dare ask you to forgive I for harbour such a thought he reply yet have it be true i who have be a witness of the man 's vile conduct could never have blame you if ever a act be justifiable -- a elongate shadow shot forward on the ground in front of they gifford stop abruptly and with a involuntary action he companion clutch he arm as both look up expectantly next moment gervase henshaw stand before they chapter xxv defiance for some moment henshaw do not speak indeed it be probable that the unexpected success of he search for edith morriston -- for such doubtless be he object -- have so disagreeably startle he that he be unable to pull those sharp wit of he together at once but the expression which flash into he eye and that come instantaneously be of so vengeful and threaten a character that gifford feel glad he be there to protect the girl from she now enraged persecutor i do not expect to find you here miss morriston the word come sharply and wrathfully when the man have find he glib tongue gifford answer miss morriston and i have be enjoy the view and the air of the pine the commonplace remark naturally as it be intend go for nothing henshaw affect not to notice it i be glad i have come across you miss morriston he say with a evident curb of he chagrin as i have something rather important to say to you i be afraid i can not hear it now mr henshaw the girl return coldly henshaw 's face darken i really must ask you to grant I a interview without delay he retort insistently as though secure in he sense of power over the girl i be sure mr gifford will permit -- mr gifford will do nothing of the sort come the bold and rather startling reply from the person allude to as a friend of miss morriston 's i do not intend to allow you to hold any more private conversation with she no doubt with he knowledge of the world and of he own advantage henshaw put down gifford 's resolute speech to mere bluff and gervase henshaw be too old a legal practitioner to be bluff i do not for a moment admit you right to interfere he retort with a assumption of calm superiority i be address myself to miss morriston who do not i hope approve of you somewhat singular manners gifford take a step out of the summerhouse and sternly face henshaw i be sure miss morriston will endorse anything i choose to say to a man who have constitute himself she cowardly persecutor he say now we do not want to have a dispute in a lady 's presence he add as henshaw begin a angry rejoinder you have get unless you wish very unpleasant consequence to follow to render a account to I as miss morriston 's friend of you abominable conduct towards she but not here you have better come to my room at the hotel at three o'clock this afternoon and hear what i shall have to say and in the meantime you will address miss morriston only at the risk of a horsewhipping henshaw be look at he steadfastly through eye that blaze with hate i wonder if you quite know whom and what you be try to champion he snarl perfectly be the cool reply a much wrong and cruelly persecute lady you have better postpone what you have to say till this afternoon when we will come to a understanding as to you conduct now as you be on private land you have better take the nearest way to the public road henshaw look as though he would have like to bring the dispute to the issue of a physical encounter have but the coward in he dare i be here by permission he return stand he ground which have be rescind by the vile use to which you have choose to put it gifford rejoin i have miss morriston 's authority to treat you as a trespasser and to order you off she brother 's land henshaw fall back a step very well mr gifford he return with a ugly sneer you talk with great confidence now but we shall see you will be wiser by this time tomorrow with that he turn and walk off gifford after watch he for a while go back to the summer-house i have put thing in the right train there he remark with a confident laugh i hope to be able to tell you this evening that mr henshaw be a thing of the past you be very sanguine she say a little doubtfully i be afraid you do not know the man i be afraid i do he reply he be obviously not a easy person to deal with but i think i see my way tell I he have threaten you in order to induce you to elope with he yes he have find evidence among he brother 's correspondence of the hold he have over I and of he persecution that would afford a sufficient motive for my kill he and how could i prove that i do not strike the blow it might be difficult gifford answer thoughtfully but i may be able to do it of course he know you to be a heiress i be sure of that from something he once let slip it have be my inheritance which have bring all this trouble upon I at any rate its persistency yes this man must be something of a adventurer as he brother be we shall see gifford say with a grim touch now i must not keep you any longer i be so grateful for the confidence you have give I may i call later on and tell you the result she eye be on he in a almost piteous search for hope in he resolute face of course she respond i shall be so terribly anxious to know chivalrously avoid any suggestion of tenderness he shake hand and go off towards the town chapter xxvi issue join punctually at the appoint time gervase henshaw be show into gifford 's room kelson have receive from he friend a hint of what be afoot and have naturally offer he service to back gifford up but they be refuse it be very kind of you harry gifford have say and just what one would have expect from you but as you shall hear later this be not a business in which you or any one could usefully intervene in fact it would be dangerous for I consider the man i be deal with to say what i have to say before a third person so kelson go off to spend the afternoon at the tredworth ' when henshaw come in he expression bear no indication of the term on which he and gifford have lately part the keen face be unruffled and almost genial but gifford be not the man to be deceive by that outward seeming henshaw bow and take the chair the other indicate there be a short pause as though each wait for the other to begin in the end it be gifford who speak first i should like to come to a understanding with you mr henshaw with regard to a very serious annoyance not to say persecution to which miss morriston have be subject at you hand henshaw draw back he thin lip in a smile i have to tell you gifford continue once and for all that it must cease miss morriston authorize you to tell I that the question be put with something like a sneer i should hope it require no authority gifford retort have cognizance of what have be go on it be my plain duty -- why yours henshaw interrupted coolly for a very good reason gifford reply one which i may have to tell you presently he see henshaw flush and dart a glance of hate at he it be plain he have misinterpret the reply but the exhibition be only momentary admit in the meantime you right to interfere henshaw say now with perfect coolness allow I to tell you that you be take a very foolish course i shall be glad to know how the reason be that if you have any regard as you suggest for miss morriston you be go the right way to do she a terrible injury gifford rise and stand by the fire-place to come to the point at once without further preliminary fencing he say quietly you mean i take it that i be force you to denounce she as be guilty of you brother 's death for a instant henshaw seem take aback by the other 's directness there can be no doubt hold the evidence i do that she be guilty of it he retort uncompromisingly i beg you pardon mr henshaw gifford object with decision there can be and be a very great deal more than a doubt of it henshaw shoot a search glance at the man who speak so confidently as though try to probe what if anything be behind he word perhaps you know then he return with he sneering smile how otherwise if the lady have no hand in it my brother come by he death i do be the quiet answer then still the smile of sneering incredulity it be clearly you duty to make it known clearly gifford assent in a calm tone that be why i ask you to come here this afternoon henshaw be look at he with a sort of malicious curiosity in spite of he smartness he seem at a loss to divine what the other be drive at unless it be a well-studied line of bluff but that gifford could have apart from what edith morriston might have tell he any intimate knowledge of the tragedy be inconceivable i shall be glad to hear what you have to say mr gifford he respond in perhaps much greater curiosity than he choose to show then i have to inform you positively gifford answer that you brother 's fatal wound be the result of a pure accident come from edith morriston 's champion there be nothing surprising in that assertion certainly if that be the other 's strong suit he could easily beat it it be therefore in a tone of confidence and relief that he demand you can prove it i can by miss morriston 's testimony not at all by my own you own henshaw 's question be put with a curl lip my own gifford repeat steadfastly may one ask what you mean by that henshaw 's contemptuous incredulity be by no means diminish even by the other 's confident attitude gifford give a short laugh naturally you do not take my meaning obviously you think i be not a competent witness that i know nothing except by hearsay you be extraordinary as it may seem quite wrong my testimony would be of nothing but what i myself see and hear what do you mean henshaw have for a moment seem to be calculate the probability of this monstrous suggestion be a fact and have dismiss it with the contempt which show itself in he question i mean gifford reply with quiet assurance that i happen to be a witness of the interview in the tower-room between you brother and miss morriston that i be there when he receive he death-wound and that it be i whom the girl hayne saw descend by a rope from the top window henshaw have start to he foot he face work with a almost passionate astonishment you -- you tell I all that he cry and expect I to believe it i have tell you and shall tell you nothing be the cool reply that i be not prepare to state on oath in the witness-box for a while henshaw seem without the power to reply dumbfounded as he active brain try to realize the probability of the declaration it seem to I he say at length in a voice of which he be scarcely master that whether you statement be true or otherwise you be place yourself in a uncommonly dangerous position mr gifford i be aware that i be invite a certain amount of ugly suspicion gifford agree but the truth which might have remain a mystery have be force from I by the necessity of protect miss morriston perhaps you have better hear a frank account of the whole story and the explanation of what i admit you be so far justified in set down as concoct and wildly improbable i should very much like to hear it henshaw return in a tone which hold out no promise of credence thereupon gifford give he a terse account of the event and the chance which have lead he into the tower and to be a secret witness of what happen there remember that he be address the dead man 's brother he recount the detail of the interview without feel indeed he throw no more color into it than if he have be open a case in court he simply state the fact without comment henshaw listen to the singular story in a attitude of doggedly unemotional attention lawyer-like he restrain all tendency to interrupt the narrative and ask no question as it proceed nevertheless it be clear he be think keenly eager to note any weak point which he could turn to use when the recital have come to a end he say coolly -- you story be a very extraordinary one mr gifford i will not call it as it seem at first sight wildly improbable but it be at any rate a almost incredible coincidence with you knowledge of the law i need scarcely remind you that the fact as you have just recount they place you in a rather unenviable position as i have already say gifford reply my story be calculate to suggest suspicion against I but i be prepare to risk that consequence in court henshaw observe with a malicious smile handle by a counsel who know he business you statement could be give a very ugly turn indeed as i have just tell you gifford return quietly i would take that risk rather than allow miss morriston to remain longer under suspicion as for myself i should have every confidence in the result it be well to be sanguine henshaw sneer if you have not already do so be you prepare to repeat you story to the police most certainly i be if necessary be the prompt answer but i do not fancy you will wish I to do so henshaw 's look be one of surprise real or affected indeed why so i will tell you gifford reply with a touch of sternness because it would be absolutely against you interest for one thing it would short of absolute proof leave still the shadow of doubt over you brother 's death it would effectually put a stop to you design on miss morriston which in any case must come to a end and it would show up you dead brother 's character and conduct in a very disreputable light now what i have to say to you be this i know that follow in you brother 's footstep you have be subject miss morriston to a amount of very hateful persecution there may have be a certain excuse for it at any rate a degree of temptation but you design have not be welcome to the lady and they must forthwith come to a end now unless you undertake to cease you attention to miss morriston in short to put a end at once and for all to this persecution i shall effectually remove the hold you imagine you have over she by go straight to the police give they the real story of what happen in the tower that night and as a natural consequence shall give evidence to that effect at the adjourn inquest you will know best whether it would be worth you while to force I to do this i simply state the position he wait for henshaw 's answer the man be plainly corner and seem to be divide between a desire to let gifford go on and place himself in a dangerous situation and the more expedient course of raise a scandal which would touch he as well as disgrace he dead brother this be a clever piece of bluff mr gifford he say at length but -- it be no bluff at all gifford interrupted firmly i be merely determine to take the obvious course to save miss morriston from something a good deal worse than annoyance i have no wish to discredit the dead but i must remind you that the persecution of miss morriston by you brother have go on for a very considerable time and have latterly develop into a atrocious system of bully it be not a occasion for mince one 's expression and i must say that in my opinion you own conduct have be very little if any better and that will be the judgment of every decent man if the truth come out as come out it shall unless you agree to my term before you leave this room for a while henshaw make no reply he sit think strenuously evidently weigh he chance estimate the strength of he adversary 's position now and again he shoot a glance half probe half sullen at gifford who lean back against the mantelpiece coolly await he answer at length he speak this be a very fine piece of bravado mr gifford but i be not such a fool as it please you to think I it be very good of you to explain to I my position in this affair i be however quite capable of see that for myself and you can hardly expect I to look upon you gratuitous advice as disinterested the man be talk to gain time gifford shrewdly guess that i might be pardon for suppose you do not altogether realize how you stand he reply quietly but after all that be as you suggest you affair henshaw force a smile the point of view be everything he say in a preoccupy tone and ours yours and mine be diametrically oppose the point of view which perhaps ought most to be consider gifford retort with rise impatience be that of the honorable profession to which we both belong if you be prepare to face the odium professional and social of a exposure -- henshaw interrupt he with a wave of the hand you may apply that to yourself and to you friend miss morriston he say sharply i can take care of myself thank you gifford shrug very well then there be no more to be say he cross the room and take up he hat i will go and see major freeman at once at the door he turn to see with surprise and a certain satisfaction that henshaw although he have rise from he chair seem in no hurry to move you be come with I he suggest it would be quite in order i think for you to be present at my statement -- unless you prefer not it seem clear that the rather foxy gervase henshaw have really more than suspect a study game of bluff but now gifford 's attitude tend to put that out of the question in the circumstance as you statement will consist mainly of a slander against I and my dead brother henshaw reply sullenly i prefer to keep out of the business for the present i fancy he add with a ugly significance that the police will be quite equal to deal with the situation without any assistance or intervention from I gifford ignore the covert threat very well then he say throw open the door and standing aside for henshaw to pass out i will go alone yes it will be better but henshaw do not move i do not quite gather he say in answer to gifford 's glance of inquiry exactly what you object be in take this step i should have think -- gifford begin be it henshaw proceed fall back now to he ordinary lawyer-like tone -- be it merely to checkmate what you be pleased to call my design upon miss morriston that will be a mere incidental result gifford answer shut the door and come back into the room my object be to put it at once and for all out of you power to hold over miss morriston the threat that she be at any moment liable to be accuse -- by you of all people -- of you brother 's murder and so suggest that she be in you power why do you say by I of all people you who profess a affection for she you word profess scarcely do I justice mr gifford henshaw return draw back he shut lip i have and have a very sincere affection for edith morriston which it seem i be not to be allow to declare or even have credit for as a man of the world you can hardly pretend to be ignorant of what a man will do when he happiness be at stake what he do under such a stress be no guide to he real feeling but we need not labor that point my affection genuine or not seem to be in no fair way to be requite and i have already make up my mind to leave it at that i have merely keep up the game to this point out of curiosity to see how far you -- shall we say knight-errantry -- would lead you i will now relieve you from the necessity of go through a act of quixotic folly which would assuredly sooner or later have unpleasant consequence for you so gifford realize with a thrill of pleasure that he have win he feel that in much of he speech the man be lie that no consideration of mere unrequited affection have induce he to abandon he design i be glad to hear you have come to a sensible conclusion he say as coolly as the sense of triumph would let he whatever happen you could hardly have expect you -- plan to succeed i do not know that henshaw retort with a touch of a beaten man 's malice anyhow i have my own idea on the subject but look into the future with my brother 's blood between we i think it might have turn out a hideous mistake a safe conjecture gifford comment between indignation and amusement at the cool way the man be now try to save he face anyhow there be a end of it henshaw say with a air and gesture of half scornfully dismiss the affair and so i bid you good afternoon as he walk towards the door gifford intercept he not quite so fast mr henshaw he say resolutely we can not leave the affair like this what do you mean henshaw ejaculate with a look which be half defiant half apprehensive you have hear my story gifford pursue with steady decisiveness and have i presume accept it for what it be worth the smart of defeat prompt the futile reply that will not do at all gifford return with sternness you either accept the account i have just give you or you do not there be something like murder in henshaw 's eye as he reply this bullying attitude be what i might expect from you to put a end however to this most unpleasant interview you may take it that i accept you statement to the absolute exoneration of miss morriston naturally i must have you assurance in write henshaw fall back a step and for a moment show sign of a uncompromising refusal you be go a little too far mr gifford he say doggedly not at all gifford retort it be imperatively necessary be it henshaw sneer for what purpose for miss morriston 's protection the sneer deepen i should have think that purpose quite negligible see how valiantly the lady be already protect but i have no objection he add in a offhand tone as you seem to distrust the lasting power of bluff to give you a extra safeguard indeed i think it just as well all thing consider that miss morriston should have it give I a pen and a sheet of paper henshaw 's manner be now the quintessence of insolence but gifford could afford although it cost he a effort to ignore it with the practice pen of a lawyer henshaw quickly write down a short declaration sign it with a flourish and then flick it across the table to gifford that should meet the case he say lean back confidently and thrust he hand into he pocket deal with one who like himself be learn in the law he have to save trouble write a terse declaration which he know should be quite acceptable it simply state that from certain fact which have come to he knowledge he be quite satisfied that he brother 's death have be cause by a accident and that no one be to blame for it and he thereby undertake to make no future charge or imputation against any one in connexion therewith yes that will do gifford answer curtly when he have read the few line henshaw rise with a rather mock smile i congratulate you on you -- luck mr gifford he say with a study emphasis and so leave the room chapter xxvii gifford 's reward with the precious declaration in he pocket gifford lose no time in go to wynford place he light heart must have be reflect in he face for edith morriston 's anxious look brighten as she join he in the drawing-room all the same it seem as though she almost fear to ask the result and he be the first to speak i bring you good news miss morriston you have nothing more to fear from gervase henshaw ah she catch she breath and for a moment seem unable to respond tell I she say at length almost breathlessly i have have a long and as you may imagine not very pleasant interview with the fellow he answer quietly and be happy to say i win all along the line you win you mean -- he have take the declaration from he pocket-book and for answer hand it to she with a manifest effort to control she feeling she read it eagerly then she voice tremble as she speak mr gifford what can i say i wish i know how to thank you please do not try he reply lightly if you only know the pleasure it have give I to get the better of this fellow you would hardly consider thanks necessary would you care to hear a short account of what happen he add tactfully with the intention see how painful the revulsion be of give she time to recover from she agitation please do tell I she speak mechanically still hardly able to trust she voice above a whisper they sit down and he relate the salient point of he interview with henshaw it be lucky that i happen to have something of a hold over he he conclude with a laugh mr gervase henshaw be not want in determination and it take a long time to persuade he that he could not possibly win the game he be play but he stand to lose more heavily than he could afford the conclusion however be at last bear in upon he that the position he have take up be untenable and that paper be the result that paper she say in a low voice mean life to I instead of a living death it mean more than i can tell you more than even you can understand he have rise but before he could speak she have come to he and impulsively take he hand mr gifford she say tell I how i can repay you she eye meet he they be full of gratitude and something more but he resist the temptation to answer she question in the way it be plain to he he be invite to do it be reward enough for I to have serve you he respond steadily see that chance give I the power i could do no less you would have risk you life for mine she persist she eye still on he hardly that he return with a effort to force a smile but have it be necessary i should have be quite content to do so and you will not tell I how i can show my gratitude i do not do it for reward he murmur scarcely able to restrain himself i be sure of that she assent but you once hint or at any rate lead I to believe that i could repay you there could be no pretence of ignore she meaning now still he feel that chivalry forbid he acceptance i be wrong he reply with a effort and most unfair if i suggest a bargain have you repent the suggestion she ask almost quizzingly and with a curious absence of she characteristic pride only in a sense he answer i hope i be too honorable to take a unfair advantage she laugh now joyously it seem if you scruple be so strong there will be nothing for it but for I to throw away mine and offer myself to you edith he exclaim in a flash of rapture then check the passionate impulse to take she in he arm you must not not now not now it be not fair to yourself at the moment of you release from this horrible danger you can not be master of yourself you must
