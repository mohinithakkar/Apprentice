most remarkable woman that ever live be here present to american reader for the first time ninon or mademoiselle de l'enclos as she be know be the most beautiful woman of the seventeenth century for seventy year she hold undisputed sway over the heart of the most distinguished man of france queen prince nobleman renowned warrior statesman writer and scientist bow before she shrine and do she homage even loui xiv when she be eighty-five year of age declare that she be the marvel of he reign how she preserve she extraordinary beauty to so great a age and attract to she side the greatest and most brilliant man of the century be tell in she biography which have be entirely re-written and new fact and incident add that do not appear in the french compilation she celebrated letter to the marquis de sévigné newly translate and appear for the first time in the united state constitute the most remarkable pathology of the female heart its motive object and secret aspiration ever pen with unsparing hand she unmask the human heart and unveil the most carefully hide mystery of femininity and every one who read these letter will see herself depict as in a mirror at a early age she perceive the inequality between the sex and refuse to submit to the injustice of a unfair distribution of human quality after due deliberation she suddenly announce to she friend : i notice that the most frivolous thing be charge up to the account of woman and that man have reserve to themselves the right to all the essential quality from this moment i will be a man from that time -- she be twenty year of age -- until she death seventy year later she maintain the character assume by she exercise all the rights and privilege claim by the male sex and create for herself as the distinguished abbé de chateauneauf say a place in the rank of illustrious man while preserve all the grace of she own sex life of ninon de l'enclos chapter i ninon de l'enclos as a standard to write the biography of so remarkable a woman as ninon de l'enclo be to incur the animadversion of those who stand upon the dogma that whoso violate one of the ten commandment be guilty of violate they all particularly when one of the ten be conventionally select as the essential precept and the most important to be observe it be purely a matter of predilection or fancy perhaps training and environment may have something to do with it though judgment be want but many will have it so and hence they arrive at the opinion that the end of the controversy have be reach fortunately for the common sense of mankind there be other who repudiate this rigid rule and excuse for human conduct who refuse to accept as a pattern of morality the sabbath breaker tyrant oppressor of the poor the grasp money maker or charity monger even though he personal chastity may entitle he to canonization these insist that although ninon de l'enclo may have persistently transgress one of the precept of the decalogue she be entitle to great consideration because of she faithful observance of the other not only in they letter but in they spirit and that she life contain much that be serviceable to humanity in many more way than if she have studiously preserve she personal purity to the sacrifice of other quality which be of as equal importance as virtue and as essential to be observe another difficulty in the way of establish she as a model of any kind on account of she deliberate violation of the sixth precept of the decalogue be the fact that she be not of noble birth hold no official position in the government of france either during the regency or under the reign of loui xiii but be a private person retire in she habit faithful in she liaison and friendship delicate and refine in she manners and conversation and eagerly seek for she wisdom philosophy and intellectual ability have she be a semirami a messalina a agrippina a catherine ii or even a lady hamilton the glamor of she exalted political position might have cover up a multitude of gross vulgar practice cruelty barbarity oppression crime and act of misgovernment and have conceal she spiritual deformity beneath the grandeur of she splendid public vice and irregularity the mantle of royalty and nobility like dipsomania excuse a multitude of sin hypocrisy and injustice and incline the world to overlook disregard or even condone what in they be consider small vice eccentricity of genius but which in a private person be magnify into mountain of viciousness and call forth a army of well mean but inconsistent people to reform they by brute force it be time to interpose a impasse to the further spread of this misapprehension of the nature and consequence of human act and to demonstrate the possibility in humble walk of life of virtue worth cultivate and to erect model out of those who while they may be derelict in they ethical duty be still worthy of be imitate in other respects we standard and pattern of morality be so high as to be unattainable not in the detail of the practice of virtue but in the personnel of the model royal and noble blood permeate with the odor of sanctity virtuous statesmanship or proud political position attain through the rigid observance of the ethical rule of personal purity be nothing to the rank and file the pollous who can never hope to reach those elevation in this world as well expatiate upon the virtue of croesus to a man who will never go beyond he day 's wages or expect the homeless to become ecstatic over the magnificence of nabuchodonosor 's babylonian palace such extreme possess no influence over the ordinary mind they be the mere vanity of the conceit the mistake of moralist the history of ninon de l'enclos stand out from the page of history as a pre-eminent character before which all other be stale whatever they pretension through position and grandeur notwithstanding that one great quality so much admire in woman -- womanly purity -- be entirely want in she conduct through life while no apology can be effectual to relieve she memory from that one stigma the other virtue connect with it and which she possess in superabundance deserve a close study inasmuch as the trend of modern society be in the direction of the philosophical principle and precept which justify she in pursue the course of life she prefer to all other she be a ardent disciple of the epicurean philosophy but in she adhesion to its precept she add that altruistic unselfishness so much insist upon at the present day chapter ii consider as a parallel the birth of ninon de l'enclo be not herald by salvo of artillery te deum or such other demonstration of joy as be attendant upon the arrival on earth of prince and offspring of great personage nevertheless for the ninety year she occupy the stage of life she accomplish more in the way of shape great national policy successful military movement and brilliant diplomatic success than any man or body of man in the seventeenth century in addition to that she genius leave a impress upon music and the fine art a impress so profound that the high standard of excellence both have attain in we day be due to she effort in establish a solid foundation upon which it be possible to erect a substantial structure moreover in she hand and under she auspices and guidance language belle lettre and rhetoric receive a impetus toward perfection and raise the french language and its literature fiction poetry and drama to so high a standard that its production be the model of the twentieth century it be ninon de l'enclo whose brilliant mentality and intellectual genius form the mind the soul the genius of such master mind as saint-evremond la rouchefoucauld molière scarron la fontaine fontenelle and a host of other in literature and fine art the great condé de grammont de sévigné and the flower of the chivalry of france in war politics and diplomacy even richelieu be not unaffected by she influence strange power exert by one frail woman a woman not of noble birth with only beauty sweetness of disposition amiability goodness and brilliant accomplishment as she weapon it be not a case of the moth and the flame but the operation of a wise philosophy the precept of which be decently moderately and carefully inculcate a philosophy upon the very edge of which modern society be hang afraid to accept openly through too much attachment to ancient doctrine which have draw man away from happiness and comfort and convert he into a bitter pessimism that often lead to despair as have already be suggest have ninon de l'enclos sit upon a throne or command a army the page of history would teem with the renown of she exploit and great victory be award to she instead of to those who would have meet with defeat without she inspiration pompey in he vanity declare that he could raise a army by stamp he foot upon the ground but the raising of ninon de l'enclos ' finger could bring all the chivalry of europe around a single standard or at the same gentle signal cause they to put aside they arm and forget everything but peace and amity she dominate the intellectual genius of the long period during which she live and reign over they as they absolute queen through the sheer force of she personal charm which she never hesitate to bestow upon those whom she find worthy and who express a desire to possess they studiously regulate however by the precept and principle of the philosophy of epicurus which today be rapidly gain ground in we social relation through its better understanding and appreciation she life bear a great resemblance to the history in which we read about the most celebrated woman of ancient time who occupy a middle station between the condition of marriage and prostitution -- a class of woman whose greek name be familiarize to we ear in translation of aristophane ninon de l'enclo be of the order of the french hetaera and as by she beauty and she talent she attain the first rank in the social class she name have come down to posterity with those of aspasium and leontium while the less distinguished favorite of less celebrated man have share the common oblivion which hide from the memory of man every degree of mediocrity whether of virtue or vice a class of this kind a status of this singular nature exist amongst accomplished woman who inspire distinguished man with lofty ideal and develop the genius of man who otherwise would have remain in obscurity can never be uninteresting or uninstructive indeed it must afford matter for serious study they be prefigure or prototype of the influence that aim to sway mankind at the present day in government politics literature and the fine art as a distinguished example of such a class the most prominent in the world in fact apart from a throne ninon de l'enclo will peculiarly engage the attention of all who whether for knowledge or amusement be observer of human nature under all its variety and circumstance it would be idle to enter upon a historical digression on the state of female manners in ancient athen or in europe during the last three century the reader should discard they from he mind when he peruse the life of ninon de l'enclo and examine she character and environment from every point of view as a type toward which be trend modern social condition at first blush and to a narrow intellect a individual woman of the character of ninon de l'enclos would seem hopelessly lose to all virtue abandon by every sense of shame and irreclaimable to any feeling of social or private duty but only at first blush and to the most circumscribed of narrow mind who fortunately do not control the policy of mankind although occasional disorder here and there indicate that they be endeavor to do so a large majority of mankind be of the settle opinion that every virtue be bind up in that of chastity we manners and custom we law most of we various kind of religion we national sentiment and feeling -- all we most serious opinion as well as we dearest and best root prejudice forbid the dissevering in the mind of woman of any class the idea of virtue and female honor that be we public opinion be along that line to raise openly a doubt on this head or to disturb on a point consider so vital the settle notion of society be equally inconsistent with common prudence and the policy of common honesty and as tend to such a end we be apt to consider all discussion on the subject as at least officiously incur danger without a opportunity of inculcate good but however strongly we insist upon this opinion for such purpose there be other in which it be not useless to relax that severity for a moment and to view the question not through the medium of sentiment but with a eye of philosophic impartiality we be gradually near the point where it be concede that in certain condition of society one fail be not wholly incompatible with a general practice of virtue -- a remark to be meet with in every homily since homily be write notwithstanding that rigid rule already allude to in the previous chapter it be surprising that it have never occur to any moralist of the common order who deal chiefly with such general reflection to apply this particular maxim to this particular social status we follow the wise precept of honesty find in cicero although we know that he be at the time he be write they plunder he fellow man at every opportunity we admiration for bacon 's philosophy and wisdom reach adulation although he be the meanest of man and be guilty of the most flagrant crime such as judicial bribery and political corruption we read that aspasium have some great and many amiable quality so too have ninon de l'enclos and it be worthy of consideration how far we judge candidly or wisely in condemn such character in gross and treat they virtue as saint austin be wont to deal with those of he heathen adversary as no better than splendid vice so unparalleled in they magnitude as to become virtue by the operation of the law of extreme there be no law permit a man to marry he sister and there be no law forbid king cambys to do as he like another grave point to be consider be this : the world as it now stand its law system of government manners and custom and social condition have be build up on these same splendid vice and whenever they have be tame into subjection to mediocrity -- let we say to clerical or ecclesiastical domination -- government society and moral have retrograde the social condition in france during ninon de l'enclos ' time and in england during the reign of charle ii be startling evidence of this accusation moreover it be fast become the condition to-day a fact indicate by the almost universal demand for a revolution in social ethic the foundation to which for some reason have become awry threaten to topple down the structure erect upon it society can see nothing to originate a incalculable number of attempt to better human condition always prove failure and worsen the human status it be dawn upon the mind of the true lover of humanity that there be nothing else to be do but to revert to the past to find the key to any possible reform and to that past we be edge rapidly though it must be say unwillingly in the hope and expectation that the old foundation be possess of sufficient solidity to support a new or re-modeled structure the life of ninon de l'enclos upon this very point furnish food for profitable reflection inasmuch as it give a insight into the great result to be obtain by the following of the precept of a ancient philosophy which seem to have survive the clash of age of intellectual and moral warfare and to have demonstrate its capacity to supply defect in segregate dogmatic system wholly incapable of any syncretic tendency chapter iii youth of ninon de l'enclos anne de l'enclos or ninon as she have always be familiarly call by the world at large be bear at paris in 1615 what she parent be or what she family be a matter of little consequence to all person who have attain celebrity over the route pursue by she original rank and station be not of the least moment by force of he genius in hew for himself a niche in history napoleon be truly he own ancestor as it be say he love to remark pleasantly so with ninon de l'enclo the novelty of the career she lay out for herself to follow and do follow until the end with unwavering constancy justify we in regard she as the head of a new line or dynasty in the case of mighty conqueror whose path be strew with violence even lust no one think of a ignoble origin as in any manner derogatory to the eminence on the contrary it be consider rather as matter to be proud of the idea that out of ignominy surround by condition devoid of all decency justice and piety a individual can elevate himself up to the highest pinnacle of human power and glory have always and will always be regard as a example to be follow and the badge of success stretch to cover the means of its attainment this be the universal custom where success have be attain the failure be relegate to a well merit oblivion as unworthy of consideration either as lesson of warn or for any purpose we youth be very properly teach only the lesson of success it be in evidence that ninon 's father be a gentleman of touraine and connect through he wife with the family of abra de raconis a race of no mean repute in the orleanoi and that he be a accomplished gentleman occupy a high position in society voltaire however declare that ninon have no claim to a parentage of such distinction that the rank of she mother be too obscure to deserve any notice and that she father 's profession be of no higher dignity than that of a teacher of the lute this account be not less likely from the remarkable proficiency acquire by ninon at a early age in the use of that instrument it be equally certain however that ninon 's parent be not obscure and that she father be a man of many accomplishment one of which be he skill as a performer on the lute a fact which may have induce voltaire to mistake one of he talent for he regular profession ninon 's parent be as opposite in sentiment and disposition as the pole of the earth madame de l'enclos be a prudent pious christian mother who endeavor to inspire she daughter with the same pious sentiment which pervade she own heart the fact be that the mother attempt to prepare she daughter for a conventual life a profession at that period of the highest honor and one that lead to preferment not only in religious circle but in the world of society at that time conventual and monastic dignitary occupy a prominent place in the formation of public and private manners and custom and if not regard impeccable they opinion be always consider valuable in state matter of the greatest moment even the security of throne the welfare and peace of nation sometimes depend upon they wisdom judgment and decision with this laudable object in view madame de l'enclos carefully train she daughter in the holy exercise of she religion to which she hope to consecrate she entire life but the fond mother meet with a impasse a insurmountable obstacle in the bud ninon herself who even in the temple of the most high when she parent imagine she to be absorb in the contemplation of saintly thing and imbibe inspiration from she hour the life of the saint or a introduction to a holy life a book very much in vogue at that period the child would be devour such profane book as montaigne scarron 's romance and epicurus as more in accordance with she trend of mind even at the early age of twelve year she have master those author and have lay out a course of life not in accord with she good mother 's idea for it exclude the idea of religion as commonly understand and crush out the sentiment of maternity that crowning glory to which nearly all young female child aspire although in they at a tender age it be instinctive and not base upon knowledge of its meaning this beginning of ninon 's departure from the beaten path should not be a matter of surprise for all the young open they heart to idea that spring from the sentiment and passion and anticipate in imagination the part they be to play in the tragedy or comedy of life it be this period of life which the moralist and educator justly contend should be carefully guard it be really a concession to environment and a tacit argument against radical heredity as the foundation upon which rest the character and disposition of the adult and which be the mainspring of he future moral conduct it be impossible to philosophize ourselves out of this sensible position in the case of ninon there be she mother a woman of undoubted virtue and exemplary piety follow the usual path in the training of she only child and make a sad failure of it or at least not make any impression on the object of she solicitude this be however not due to the mother 's intention : she training be too weak to overcome that come from another quarter it have be say that ninon 's father and mother be as opposite as the pole in character and disposition and ninon be suspend like a pendulum to swing between two extreme one of which have to prevail for there be no midway stop place it may be that the disciple of heredity the opponent of environment will perceive in the result a strong argument in favor of he view of humanity be that as it may ninon swing away from the extreme of piety represent by she mother and be catch at the other extreme by the less intellectually monotonous idea of she father there be no mental conflict in the young mind nothing difficult on the contrary she accept he idea as pleasanter and less conducive to pain and discomfort too young to reason she perceive a flowery pathway follow it and avoid the thorny one offer she by she mother monsieur de l'enclo be a epicurean of the most advanced type accord to he the whole philosophy of life the entire scheme of human ethic as evolve from epicurus could be reduce to the four follow canon : first -- that pleasure which produce no pain be to be embrace second -- that pain which produce no pleasure be to be avoid third -- that pleasure be to be avoid which prevent a greater pleasure or produce a greater pain fourth -- that pain be to be endure which avert a greater pain or secure a greater pleasure the last canon be the one that have always appeal to the religious sentiment and it be the one which have enable a army of martyr to submit patiently to the most excruciating torment to reach the happiness of paradise the pleasure contemplate as a reward for endure the frightful pain the reader can readily infer however from he daily experience with the human family that this construction be seldom put upon this canon the world at large view it from the epicurean interpretation which mean earthly pleasure or the purely sensual enjoyment it be certain that ninon 's father do not construe any of these canon accord to the religious idea but follow the commonly accept version and impress they upon he young daughter 's mind in all they various light and shades imbibe such philosophy from she earliest infancy the father take good care to press they deep into she plastic mind it be not astonishing that ninon should discard the more distasteful fruit to be painfully harvest by follow she mother 's tuition and accept the easily gather luscious golden fruit offer she by she father like all child and many adult the glitter and the tinsel of the present enjoyment be too powerful and seductive to be resist or to be postpone for a problematic pleasure the very atmosphere which surround the young girl and which she soon learn to breathe in deep pleasurable draught be surcharge with the intoxicating oxygen of freedom of action liberality and unrestrained enjoyment while still very young she be introduce into a select society of the choicest spirit of the age and speedily become they idol a position she continue to occupy without diminution for over sixty year no one of all these man of the world have ever see so many personal grace unite to so much intellectuality and good taste ninon 's form be as symmetrical elegant and yield as a willow she complexion of a dazzling white with large sparkling eye as black as midnight and in which reign modesty and love and reason and voluptuousness she tooth be like pearl she mouth mobile and she smile most captivating resistless and adorable she be the personification of majesty without pride or haughtiness and possess a open tender and touch countenance upon which shone friendship and affection she voice be soft and silvery she arm and hand superb model for a sculptor and all she movement and gesture manifest a exquisite natural grace which make she conspicuous in the most crowded drawing-room as she be in she youth so she continue to be until she death at the age of ninety year a incredible fact but so well attest by the gravest and most reliable writer who testify to the truth of it that there be no room for doubt ninon attribute it not to any miracle but to she philosophy and declare that any one might exhibit the same peculiarity by follow the same precept we have it on the most undoubted testimony of contemporaneous writer who be intimate with he that one of she dearest friend and follower saint-evremond at the age of eighty-nine year inspire one of the famous beauty of the english court with a ardent attachment the beauty of she person be so far develop at the age of twelve year that she be the object of the most immoderate admiration on the part of man of the greatest renown and she beauty be embalm in they work either as a model for the world or she be enshrine in song poetry and romance as the heroine in fact ninon have as tutor the most distinguished man of the age who vie with one another in embellish she young mind with all the grace learning and accomplishment possible for the human mind to contain she native brightness and active mind absorb everything with a almost supernatural rapidity and tact and it be not long before she become they peer and she quality of mind reach out so far beyond theirs in its insatiable longing that she in she turn become they tutor adviser and consoler as well as they tender friend chapter iv the moral of the period example of the precocious talent display by mademoiselle de l'enclo be not uncommon in the twentieth century but the application she make of they be remarkable and uncommon accomplish in music learn and proficient in the language a philosopher of no small degree and of a personal beauty sometimes call beauté de diable she appear upon the social stage at a time when a new idol be a imperative necessity for the salvation of moral sanity and the preservation of some remnant of personal decency in the sexual relation cardinal richelieu have just succeed in consolidate the usurpation of the royal prerogative on the rights of the nobility and the people which have be silently advance during the precede reign and be follow by the long period of unexampled misgovernment which oppress and impoverish as well as degrade every rank and every order of man in the french kingdom cease only with the revolution the great cardinal minister have build worse than he have intend it be to be hope for he clerico-political system have practically destroy french manhood and leave society without a guide star to cement the rope of sand he have spin unable to subject the master mind among the nobility to its domination ecclesiasticism have succeed in destroy they by augment royal prerogative which it could control with less difficulty public maxim of government connect as they be with private moral have debauch the nation and plunge it into a depth of degradation out of which richelieu and he whole entourage of clerical reformer could not extricate a single individual it be a riot of theological morality the whole body of the french nobility and the middle class of citizen be reduce to a servile attendance on the court as the only means of advancement and reward every species of industry and merit in these class be sedulously discourage and the motive of honorable competition for honorable thing be withdraw no pursuit or occupation be leave they but the frivolous duty or the degrading pleasure of the palace next to the king the woman naturally become the first object of they effeminate devotion and it be difficult to say which be soonest corrupt by courtier consummate in the art of adulation and unwearied in they exercise the sovereign rapidly degenerate into a accomplished despot and the woman into intriguer and coquette richelieu have indeed succeed in subject the state to the rule of the church but ninon be destine to play a important part in modify the evil which afflict society and at least elevate its tone from the method she employ to effect this change it may be suspect that the remedy be equivalent to the hanemannic maxim : similium similbus curantur a strange application of a curative agent in a case of moral decrepitude however valuable and effective it may be in physical ailment the world of the twentieth century bind up as it be in material progress refuse to limit its object and aim to the problematic enjoyment of the pleasure of paradise in the great hereafter or of suffer with stoicism the pain and misfortune of this earth as a means of avoid the problematic pain of hell future reward and punishment be no longer incentive to virtue or right live the only drag upon human act of every kind be now that great political maxim the non-observance of which have often deluge the earth with blood sic utere tuo ut alienum non laeda which be to say : so use thine own as not to injure thy neighbor it be a conventional principle one of contract in reality but it have become a great doctrine of equity and justice and it be inculcate by we educational system to the exclusion of the purely religious idea and the elimination of religious dogma which tend to oppressive restraint be carefully foster there be another reason why man 's mind be impel away from the purely sentimental moral doctrine insist upon by sectarianism which be ecclesiasticism run riot and the higher the education the deeper we delve into the secret motive of that class of mankind the deceptive outward appearance of which dominate the page of history which be that the greatest and most glorious system of government the wisest and most powerful of ruler the greatest and most liberal statesman hero and conspicuous conqueror originate in violation of the decalogue and those nation and kingdom which have be found upon strictly ecclesiastical idea have all sink beneath the shift sand of time or have become so degenerate as to be byword and object of derision from the same viewpoint a strange phenomenon be observable in the world of literature art and science the brightest greatest genius whose work be pointed to with admiration study as model and standard make the basis of youthful education imitate and even weep over by the sentimental be in they private life person of the most depraved moral why this should be the case it be impossible even to conjecture the fact only remain that it be so perhaps there be so many different standard of morality that humanity weary of the eternal bickering consequent upon the conflict enter into for they enforcement have make for themselves a new interpretation which they find less difficult to observe and find more peace and pleasure in follow to take a further step in the same direction it be curious that in the life of the saint those who spend they whole earthly existence in abstinence work of the severest penance and mortification of the flesh the tendency of demoniac influence be never in the direction of sabbath break profanity idolatry robbery murder and covetousness but always exert itself to the fullest extent of its power in attack upon chastity all other vision be absent in the hair-shirted and self-scourgings bring out nothing but sexual ideality sensual temptation the reason for this peculiarity be not far to seek what be dominant in the mind always find egress when a favorable opportunity be present and the very think of unchastity as something to be avoid lead to its contemplation or its creation in the form of temptation the virtue of chastity be the one law and its observance and violation be study from every point of view and its numberless permissible and forbid limitation expatiate upon to such a degree that he who escape they altogether could well attribute the result to the interposition of some supernatural power the protection of some celestial guardian one be remind of the expression of st paul : i have not know lust have the law not say : thou shalt not covet lord beaconsfield 's opinion be that excessive piety lead to sexual disorder accord to ninon 's philosophy whatever tend to propagate immoderation in the sexual relation be rigidly eliminate and chastity place upon the same plane and in the same grade as other moral precept to be wisely control regulate and manage she put all she morality upon the same plane and thereby succeed in equalize corporeal pleasure so that the entire scale of human act produce a harmonious equality of temperament whence goodness and virtue necessarily follow the pathway be unobstructed it be too much to be expect or even to be hope for that there will ever be any unanimity among moral reformer or any uniformity in they standard of moral excellence the educate world of the present day reading between the line of ancient history and some that be not so very ancient see ambition for place and power as the move cause the inspiration behind the great majority of revolution and they have come to apply the same construction to the great majority of moral agitation and movement for the reform of moral and the betterment of humanity with pecuniary reward or profit however add as the sine qua non of maintain they cure the agitation by remove the occasion for it and othello 's occupation would be go hence the agitation continue as a eminent theologian declare with a conviction that go home to a multitude at the congress of religion when the columbian exposition be in operation : if all the religion in the world be to be merge into one who or what will support the clergy that will be deprive of they salary by the change in management the golden calf and aaron be there but where be the angry mose chapter v ninon and count de coligny it be impossible for a maiden train in the philosophy of epicurus and surround by a brilliant society who assiduously follow its precept to avoid be catch in the mesh of the same net spread for other woman beloved and even idolize on all side as a object that could be worship without incur the displeasure of richelieu who prefer he courtier to amuse themselves with woman and gallantry rather than meddle with state affair and be dispose both through inclination and training to accept the situation ninon feel the sentiment of the tender passion but philosophically wait for a worthy object that object appear in the person of the young gaspard count de coligny afterwards duc de chatillon who pay she assiduous court the result be that ninon conceive a violent passion for the count which she could not resist in fact do not care to resist and she therefore yield to the young man of distinguished family charming manners and a physically perfect specimen of manhood it be allege by voltaire and repeat by cardinal de retz that the early bloom of ninon 's charm be enjoy by richelieu but if this be true it be more than likely that ninon submit through policy and not from any affection for the great cardinal it be certain however that the great statesman 's attention have be call to she grow influence among the french nobility and that he desire to control she action if not to possess she charm she be a tool that he imagine he could utilize to keep he rebellious noble in he leash abbé raconi ninon 's uncle and the abbé boisrobert she friend who stand close to the cardinal have suggest to he eminence that the charm of the new beauty could be use to advantage in state affair and he accordingly send for she at first through curiosity but when he have see she he hope to control she for he personal benefit although occupy in vast project which he great genius and activity always conduct to a happy issue the great man have not renounce the affection of he human nature nor he intellectual gratification he aim at everything and do not consider anything beneath he dignity every day see he engage in cultivate a taste for literature and art and some moment of every day be set apart for social gallantry when it come to the art of pleasing and attract woman we have the word of cardinal de retz for it that he be not always successful perhaps it be only inferior mind who possess the art and the genius of seduction the intriguing abbé in order to bring ninon under the influence of he master and to charm she with the great honor do she by a man upon whom be fix the eye of all europe prepare a series of gorgeous fêtes banquet and entertainment at the palace at rueil but ninon be not in the least overwhelmed and refuse to hear the sigh of the great man hope to inspire jealousy he affect to love marion de lorme a proceeding which give ninon great pleasure as it relieve she from the importunity of the cardinal the end of it be that richelieu give up the chase and leave ninon in peace to follow she own device in she own way whatever may have be the relation between ninon and cardinal richelieu it be certain that the count de coligny be she first sentimental attachment and the two lover in the first intoxication of they love swear eternal constancy a process common to all new lover and believe possible to maintain it be not long however before ninon perceive that the first immoderate transport of love gradually lose they activity and by apply the precept of she philosophy to explain the phenomenon come to regard love by its effect as a blind mechanical movement which it be the policy of man to ennoble accord to the conventional rule of decency and honor to the exclusion of its original meaning after coldly reasoning the matter out to its only legitimate conclusion she tear off the mask cover a metaphysical love which could not reach or satisfy the light of intelligence or the sentiment and emotion of the heart and which appear to she to possess as little reality as the enchanted castle marvel of magic and monster depict in poetry and romance to she love finally become a mere thirst and a desire for pleasure to be gratify by indulgence like all other pleasure the germ of philosophy already grow in she soul find nothing in this discovery that be essentially unnatural on the contrary it be essentially natural it be clear to she logical mind that a passion like love produce among man different effect accord to different disposition humor temperament education interest vanity principle or circumstance without be at the same time found upon anything more substantial than a disguise though ardent desire of possession the essential of its existence after which it vanish as fire disappear through lack of fuel dryden the celebrated english poetic and literary genius reach the same opinion in he letter to clarissa have reach this point in she reasoning she advance a step further and consider the unequal division of quality distribute between the two sex she perceive the injustice of it and refuse to abide by it i perceive she declare that woman be charge with everything that be frivolous and that man reserve to themselves the right to essential quality from this moment i shall be a man all this grow out of the ardor of a first love which be always follow by the lassitude of satiety so far from cause ninon any tear of regret nerve she up to a philosophy different from that of other woman and make it impossible to judge she by the same standard she can not be consider a woman subject to a thousand fantasy and whim a thousand trifling conceal propriety of position and custom she moral become the same as those of the wisest and noblest man of the period in which she live and raise she to they rank instead of maintain she in the category of the intriguing coquette of she age it be not improbable that she experience of the suffering attendant upon the decay of such attachment a suffering allude to by those who contemplate only the intercourse of the sex through the medium of poetry and sentiment have considerable influence in determine she future conduct at a early age follow upon she liaison with count coligny she adopt the determination she adhere to during the rest of she life of retain so much only of the female character as be force upon she by nature and the insuperable law of society act on this principle she society be chiefly compose of person of she adopt sex of whom the most celebrated of they time make she house a constant place of meet a curious incident in she relation with count de coligny be she success in persuade he to adjure the error of the huguenot and return to the roman catholic church she have no religious predilection feel herself spiritually secure in she philosophic principle but seek only he welfare and advancement he obstinacy be deprive he of the advantage due he birth and personal merit consider that ninon be scarcely sixteen year of age respire nothing but love and pleasure to effect by tenderness and the persuasive strength of she reasoning power such a change in a man so obstinate as the count de coligny in a obstinate and excessively bigoted age be something unique in the history of lover of that period woman then care very little for religious principle and rarely exert themselves in advance the cause of the dominant religion much less think of the spiritual need of they favorite the reverse be the rule in these modern time when woman be the most ardent and persistent proselytizer of the various sect a custom which recall the remark of a distinguished lawyer who fail to recover any asset from a notorious bankrupt he be pursue for the defraud creditor : this man have everything in he wife 's name -- even he religion ninon 's disinterested counsel prevail and the count afterward abjure he error become the duc de chatillon marquis d'andelot and die a lieutenant general bravely fight for he country at charenton chapter vi the bird of the tournelle have decide upon she career ninon convert she property into prudent and safe security and purchase a city house in the rue des tournelles au marais a locality at that time the center of fashionable society and another for a summer residence at picpusse in the environs of pari a select society of wit and gallant chevalier soon gather around she and it require influence as well as merit to gain a entrance into its rank among this élite be count de grammont saint-evremond chapelle molière fontenelle and a host of other no less distinguished character most of they celebrate in literature art science and war ninon christen the society oiseaux des tournelles a appellation much coveted by the beau and wit of pari and which distinguish the choose company from the less favored gentleman of the great metropolis among those who long for entrance into this charming society of choice spirit be the count de charleval a polite and accomplished chevalier indeed but of no particular standing as a literary character nothing would do however but a song of triumph as a test of he competency and he accomplish it after much labor and consumption of midnight oil scarron have preserve the first stanza in he literary work the other be lose to the literary world perhaps with small regret the sentiment express in the first stanza rescue from oblivion will be sufficient to indicate the character of the other : je ne sui plus oiseau des champ mais de ces oiseaux des tournelles qui parlent d'amour en tout temp et qui plaignent les tourterelles de ne se baiser qu'au printemp which liberally translate into english will run substantially as follow : no more be i a wild bird on the wing but one of the bird of the tower who the love in they heart always sing and pity the poor turtle dove that coo and never kiss only in spring scarron allude to the delicacy of the count 's taste and the refinement of he wit by say of he : the muse bring he up on blanc mange and chicken broth how ninon keep together this remarkable coterie can best be understand by a incident unparallele in female annals the count de fièsque one of the most accomplished noble of the french court have it appear grown tired of a attachment of long standing between ninon and himself before the passion of the former have subside a letter contain a account of he change of sentiment with reason therefor be present he mistress while employ at she toilette in adjust she hair which be remarkable for its beauty and luxuriance and which she regard as the apple of she eye afflict by the unwelcome intelligence she cut off half of she lovely tress on the impulse of the moment and send they as she answer to the count 's letter strike by this unequivocal proof of the sincerity of she devotion to he the count return to he allegiance to a mistress so devoted and thenceforward retain it until she herself weary of it and desire a change as a illustration of she sterling honesty in money matter and she delicate manner of end a liaison the follow anecdote will serve to demonstrate the hold she be able to maintain upon she admirer m de gourville a intimate friend of ninon 's adhered in the war of the fronde to the party of the prince of condé one of the bird of the tournelle compel to quit pari to avoid be hang in person as he be in effigy he divide the care of a large sum of ready money between ninon de l'enclos and the grand pénitencier of notre dame the money be deposit in two casket on he return from exile he apply to the priest for the return of he money but to he astonishment all knowledge of the deposit be deny and that if any such deposit have be make it be destine for charitable purpose under the rule of the pénitencier and have most probably be distribute among the poor of paris de gourville protest in vain and when he threaten to resort to forcible mean the power of the church be invoke to compel he to abandon he attempt so cruelly disappoint in a man whom all pari deem incorruptibly honest de gourville suspect nothing else from mademoiselle de l'enclos it be absurd to hope for probity in a woman of reprehensible habit when that virtue be absent in a man who live a life of such austerity as the grand pénitencier hence he determine to abstain from visit she altogether lest he might hate the woman he have so fondly love ninon however have other design and learn that he have return send he a press invitation to call upon she ah gourville she exclaim as soon as he appear a great misfortune have happen I in consequence of you absence that settle the matter in de gourville 's mind he money be go and he be a pauper plunge in mournful reflection de gourville dare not raise he eye to those of he mistress but she mistake he agitation go on hastily : i be sorry if you still love I for i have lose my love for you and though i have find another with whom i be happy i have not forget you here she continue turn to she escritoire here be the twenty thousand crown you intrust to I when you depart take they my friend but do not ask anything from a heart which be no longer dispose in you favor there be nothing left but the most sincere friendship astonish at the contrast between she conduct and that of she reverend co-depositary and recognize that he have no right to complain of the change in she heart because of he long absence de gourville related the story of the indignity heap upon he by a man of so exalt a character and reputation you do not surprise I say ninon with a win smile but you should not have suspect I on that account the prodigious difference in we reputation and condition should have teach you that then add with a twinkle in she eye : ne suis-je pas la gardeuse de la cassette ninon be afterward call la belle gardeuse de cassette and voltaire whose vigilance no anecdote of this nature could escape have make it with some variation the subject of a comedy well know to every admirer of the french drama under the name of la dépositaire ninon have she preference and when one of she admirer be not to she taste neither prayer nor entreaty could move she hers be not a case of vendible charm it be le bon appetit merely a epicurean virtue the grand prior of vendôme have reason to comprehend this trait in she character the worthy grand prior be a impetuous wooer and he see with great sorrow that ninon prefer the count de miossens and de palluan to he clerical attraction he complain bitterly to ninon but instead of be soften by he reproach she listen to the voice of some new rival when the grand prior think he turn come next this put he in a great rage and he resolve to be revenge and this be the way he fancy he could obtain it one day shortly after he have leave ninon 's house she notice on she dress table a letter which she open to find the follow effusion : indigne de mes feux indigne de mes larmes je renonce sans peine à tes faibles appas mon amour te prêtait des charmes ingrate que tu n'avais pas or as might be say substantially in english : unworthy my flame unworthy a tear i rejoice to renounce thy feeble allure my love lend thee charm that endear which ingrate thou couldst not procure instead of be offend ninon take this mark of unreasonable spite good naturedly and reply by another quatrain base upon the same rhyme as that of the disappointed suitor : insensible à te feux insensible à tes larmes je te vois renoncer à mes faibles appas mais si l'amour prête des charmes pourquoi n'en empruntais-tu pas which be as much as to say in english : care naught for thy flame care naught for thy tear i see thee renounce my feeble allure but if love lend charm that endear by borrow thou mightst some procure chapter vii effect of she mother 's death it be not to be wonder at that a girl under such tutelage should abandon herself wholly both mind and body to a philosophy so contrary in its principle and practice to that which she mother have always endeavor to instill into she young mind the father be absent fighting for heaven alone know which faction into which france be break up there be so many of they and the mother and daughter live apart the disparity in they sentiment make it impossible for they to do otherwise for this reason ninon be practically she own mistress and not interfere with because the husband and wife could not agree upon any definite course of life for she to follow ninon 's heart however have not lose any of its natural instinct and she love she mother sincerely a trait in she which all pari learn with astonishment when she mother be take down with what prove to be a fatal illness madame de l'enclos separate from both she husband and daughter and devote she life to pious exercise acquire against they the violent prejudice natural in one who make such a sacrifice upon the altar of sentiment the worldly life of she daughter give birth in she mind to a opinion which she deem the natural consequence of it the love of pleasure in she estimation have destroy every vestige of virtue in she daughter 's soul and she neglect of she religious duty have convert she into a unnatural be but she be agreeably divert from she ill opinion when she malady approach a dangerous stage ninon fly to heir mother 's side as soon as she hear of it and without become a enemy of she philosophy of pleasure she feel it incumbent upon she to suspend its practice friendship liaison social duty pleasure everything cease to amuse she or give she any satisfaction the nursing of she sick mother engage she entire attention and she fervor in this dutiful occupation astonished madame de l'enclo and soften she heart to the extent of acknowledge she error and correct she estimate of she daughter 's character she love she daughter devotedly and be happy in the knowledge that she be as devotedly love but this be not the kind of happiness that could prolong she day notwithstanding all she philosophy ninon could not bear the spectacle present by she die parent she soul be rent with a grief which she do not conceal unashamed that philosophy be impotent to restrain a exhibition of such a natural weakness moreover she die mother talk to she long and earnestly and with she last breath give she loving counsel that sink deep into she heart already soften by a uncontrollable sorrow and weaken by long vigil scarcely have madame de l'enclo close she eye upon the thing of earth than ninon conceive the project of withdraw from the world and enter a convent the absence of she father leave she absolute mistress of she conduct and the few friend who reach she despite she express refusal to see any one could not persuade she to alter she determination ninon heart broken distract and desolate throw herself bodily into a obscure convent in the suburb of pari accept it in the throe of she sorrow as she only refuge and home on earth saint-evremond in a letter to the duke d'olonne speak of the sentiment which be incentive to piety : there be some whom misfortune have render devout through a certain kind of pity for themselves a secret piety strong enough to dispose man to lead more religious life scarron one of ninon 's closest friend in he epistle to sarrazin thus allude to this conventual escapade : puis j' aurais su \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* ce que l'on dit du bel et saint exemple que la ninon donne à tous les mondains en se logeant avecque les nonais combien de pleurs la pauvre jouvencelle a répandus quand sa mère san elle cierge brûlants et portant écussons prêtres chantant leur funèbres chanson voulut aller de linge enveloppée servir aux vers d'une franche lippée which translate into reasonable english be as much as say : but i might have know \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* what they say of the example so holy so pure that ninon give to worldling all by dwelling within a nunnery 's wall how many tear the poor lorn maid shed when she mother alone unafraid mid flaming taper with coat of arm priest chant they sad funereal alarm go down to the tomb in she wind sheet to serve for the worm a mouthful sweet but the most poignant sorrow of the human heart be assuage by time saint-evremond and marion de lorme richelieu 's belle amie expect to profit by the calm which they know would not be long in steal over the heart of they friend marion however despaired of succeed through she own personal influence and enlist the sympathy of saint-evremond who know ninon 's heart too well to imagine for a moment that the mournful monotonous life she have embrace would satisfy she very long it be something to be admit to she presence and talk over matter a privilege they be accord after some demur the first step toward ransom they friend be follow by other until they finally make great stride through she resolution they bring she back in triumph to the world she have quit through a species of frivolity so they call it of which she be never again guilty as long as she live this episode in ninon 's life be in direct contrast with one which occur when the queen regent anne of austrium listen to the complaint of she jealous maid of honor attempt to dispose of ninon 's future by immure she in a convent ninon 's celebrity attain such a summit and she drawing room become so popular among the élite of the french nobility and desirable youth that sad inroad be make in the entourage of the court nothing but the cull of humanity be leave for the lady who patronize the royal function in addition to this she excite the envy and jealousy of a certain class of woman whom ninon call jansensist of love because they practice in public the puritanic virtue which they do not even have tact enough to render agreeable it be conceivable that ninon 's brilliant attraction not to say seductive charm and she unparalleled power to attract to she society the brightest and best man of the nation engender the most violent jealousy and hatred of those whose feebler charm be ignore and relegate to the background the most bitter complaint and accusation be make against she to the queen regent who be beset on all side by loud outcry against the conduct of a woman whom they be powerless to imitate until to quiet they clamor she deem it she duty to act anne of austrium accordingly send ninon by special messenger a peremptory order to withdraw to a convent give she the power of selection at first anne intend to send she to the convent of repentant girl -lrb- fille repenty -rrb- but the celebrated bauton one of the oiseaux des tournelles who love a good joke as well as he do ninon tell she that such a course would excite ridicule because ninon be neither a girl nor a repentant -lrb- ni fille nus repentie -rrb- for which reason the order be change leave ninon to she own choice of a prison ninon know the source of the order and foresee that she numerous distinguished admirer would not have any difficulty in protect she and persuade the queen regent to rescind she order and therefore give herself no concern receive the order as a pleasantry i be deeply sensible of the goodness of the court in provide for my welfare and in permit I to select my place of retreat and without hesitation i decide in favor of the grand cordelier now it so happen that the grand cordelier be a monastery exclusively for man and from which woman be rigidly exclude moreover the moral of the holy brotherhood be not of the best as the writer of they history during that period unanimously testify m de guitaut the captain of the queen 's guard who have be intrust with the message happen to be one of the bird and he assure the regent that it be nothing but a little pleasantry on the part of ninon who merit a thousand mark of approval and commendation for she sterling and brilliant quality of mind and heart rather than punishment or even censure the only comment make by the queen regent be : fie the nasty thing accompany by a fit of laughter other of the bird come to the rescue among they the duc d'enghien who be know not to value he esteem for woman lightly the matter be finally drop anne of austrium finding mean to close the mouth of the envious chapter viii she increase popularity ninon 's return to the gayety of she drawing room be hail with loud acclamation from all quarter the envy and jealousy of she female enemy the attempt to immure she in a convent and she selection of the grand cordelier as she place of retreat bring she new friend and admirer through the notoriety give she and all pari resound with the fame of she spirit she wit and she philosophy lady of high rank seek admission into she charming circle many of they it be to be imagine because they possess exaggerated idea of she influence at court have she not brave the queen regent with impunity she drawing room soon become the center of attraction and be nightly crowd with the better part of the brilliant society of paris ninon be the acknowledged guide and leader and all submit to she sway without the slightest envy or jealousy and it may also be say without the slightest compunction or remorse of conscience the affair with the queen regent have one good effect it separate the desirable from the undesirable in the social scale compelling the latter to set up a establishment of they own as a counter attraction and as they only hope of have any society at all they establish a little court at the hôtel rambouillet where foppishness be a badge of distinction and where a few narrow mind starched moralist poison metaphysics and turn the sentiment of the heart into a burlesque by they affectation and they unrefined even vulgar attempt at gallantry they cull choice expression and epigram from the literature of the day employ they memory to conceal they paucity of original wit and practice upon they imagination to obtain a salacious philosophy which consist of sodden idea flat in they expression stale and unattractive in they adaptation ninon 's coterie be the very opposite consist as it do of the very flower of the nobility and the choicest spirit of the age who banish dry and sterile erudition and sparkle with the liveliest wit and polite accomplishment there be some who elude the vigilance of ninon 's shrewd scrutiny and make they way into she inner circle but they be soon force to abandon they pretension by they inability to maintain any standing among a class of man who be so far beyond they in rank and attainment not long after she return to the pleasure of society after the convent episode ninon be call upon to mourn the demise of she father m de l'enclo be one of the fortunate man of the time who escape the danger attendant upon be on the wrong side in politics for some inscrutable reason he take side with cardinal de retz and on that account be practically banish from pari and compel to be satisfy with the rough annoyance of camp life instead of be able to put in practice the pleasant precept of he philosophy he be finally permit to return to pari with he head safe upon he shoulder and flattered himself with the idea that he could now make up for lose time promising himself to enjoy to the full the advantage offer by he daughter 's establishment he embrace he daughter with the liveliest pleasure imaginable take upon himself all the credit for she great reputation as due to he effort and to he philosophical training he be flatter at the success of he lesson and enter upon a life of joyous pleasure with as much zest as though in the bloom of he youth it prove too much for a constitution weaken by the fatigue of year of arduous military campaign and he succumb the flesh overpower by the spirit and take to he bed where he soon reach a condition that leave he friend no hope of he recuperation aware that the end be approach he send for he daughter who hasten to he side and shed torrent of tear but he bid she remember the lesson she have learn from he philosophy and wish to give she one more lesson say in a almost expire voice : approach nearer ninon you see nothing leave I but a sad memory of the pleasure that be leave I they possession be not of long duration and that be the only complaint i have to make against nature but alas my regret be vain you who must survive I utilize precious time and have no scruple about the quantity of you pleasure but only of they quality say which he immediately expire the philosophical security exhibit by she father in he very last moment inspire ninon with the same calmness of spirit and she bear he loss with equanimity disdain to exhibit any immoderate grief lest she dishonor he memory and render herself a unworthy daughter and pupil the fortune leave she by she father be not so considerable as ninon have expect it have be very much diminish by extravagance and speculation but as she have in mind de la rochefoucauld 's maxim : there be some good marriage but no delicious one and do not contemplate ever wear the chain of matrimony she deposit she fortune in the sinking fund reserve a income of about eight thousand livre per annum as sufficient to maintain she beyond the reach of want from this time on she abandon herself to a life of pleasure well regulate it must be confess and in strict accordance with she epicurean idea she light heartedness increase with she love and devotion to pleasure which be not astonishing as there be privileged soul who do not lose they tender emotion by such a pursuit though those soul be rare ninon 's unrestrained freedom and the privilege she claim to enjoy all the rights which man assume do not give she the slightest uneasiness it be she lover who become anxious unless they regulate they love accord to the rule she establish for they to follow rule which it can not be deny be hold in as much esteem then as nowadays the follow anecdote will serve as a illustration : the marquis de la châtre have be one of she lover for a unconscionably long period but never seem to cool in he fidelity duty however call he away from ninon 's arm but he be distressed with the thought that he absence would be to he disadvantage he be afraid to leave she lest some rival should appear upon the scene and dispossess he in she affection ninon vainly endeavor to remove he suspicion no cruel one he say you will forget and betray I i know you heart it alarm I crush I it be still faithful to my love i know and i believe you be not deceive I at this moment but that be because i be with you and can personally talk of my love who will recall it to you when i be go the love you inspire in other ninon be very different from the love you feel you will always be in my heart and absence will be to I a new fire to consume I but to you absence be the end of affection every object i shall imagine i see around you will be odious to I but to you they will be interesting ninon could not deny that there be truth in the marquis ' logic but she be too tender to assassinate he heart which she know to be so loving be a woman she understand perfectly the art of dissimulation which be a necessary accomplishment a thousand circumstance require its exercise for the sake of she security peace and comfort moreover she do not at the moment dream of deceive he there be no present occasion nobody else she have in mind ninon think rapidly but could not find any reason for betray he and therefore assure he of she fidelity and constancy nevertheless the amorous marquis who might have rely upon the solemn promise of he mistress have it not be for the intense fear which be ever present in he mind and become more violent as the hour for he departure draw nearer require something more substantial than word but what could he exact ah a idea a novel expedient occur to he mind one which he imagine would restrain the most obstinate inconstancy listen ninon you be without contradiction a remarkable woman if you once do a thing you will stand to it what will tend to quiet my mind and remove my fear ought to be you duty to accept because my happiness be involve and that be more to you than love it be you own philosophy ninon now i wish you to put in write that you will remain faithful to I and maintain the most inviolable fidelity i will dictate it in the strongest form and in the most sacred term know to human promise i will not leave you until i have obtain such a pledge of you constancy which be necessary to relieve my anxiety and essential to my repose ninon vainly argue that this would be something too strange and novel foolish in fact the marquis be obstinate and finally overcome she remonstrance she write and sign a write pledge such as no woman have ever execute and fortify with this pledge the marquis hasten to respond to the call of duty two day have scarcely elapse before ninon be besiege by one of the most dangerous man of she acquaintance skilled in the art of love he have often press he suit but ninon have other engagement and would not listen to he but now he rival be out of the field he resume he entreaty and increase he ardor he be a man to inspire love but ninon resist though he plead touch she heart she eye at last betray she love and she be vanquish before she realize the outcome of the struggle what be the astonishment of the conqueror who be enjoy the fruit of he victory to hear ninon exclaim in a breathless voice repeat it three time : ah ah le bon billet qu'a la châtre -lrb- oh the fine bond that la châtre have -rrb- press for a explanation of the enigma ninon tell he the whole story which be too good to keep secret and soon the billet de la châtre become in the mouth of everybody a say apply to thing upon which it be not wise to rely voltaire to preserve so charming a incident have embalm it in he comedy of la prude act i scene iii ninon merely follow the rule establish by madame de sévigné : les femmes ont permission d'être faible et elles se servent san scrupule de ce privilège chapter ix ninon 's friendship mademoiselle de l'enclos never forget a friend in a lover indeed the trait that stand out clear and strong in she character be she whole hearted friendship for the man she love and she bestow it upon they as long as they live for she outlive nearly all of they and cherish they memory afterward as have be say ninon de l'enclo be epicurean in the strictest sense and do not rest she entire happiness on love alone but include a friendship which go to the extent of make sacrifice the man with whom she come in contact from time to time during she long life be nothing to she from a pecuniary point of view for she possess a income sufficiently large to satisfy she want and to maintain the social establishment she never neglect there be never either directly or indirectly any money consideration ask or expect in payment of she favor and the man who would have dare offer she money as a consideration for anything would have meet with scorn and contempt and be expel from she house and society without ever be permit to regain either the natural want of she heart and mind and what she be please to call the natural gratification of physical want be she mentor and to they she listen never dream of hold they at a pecuniary value one of she dearest friend be scarron once the husband of madame de maintenon the pious leader of a debased court and the saintly mistress of the king of france in he younger day scarron contribute largely to the pleasure of the oiseaux des tournelles the ecclesiastical collar he then wear not be sufficient to prevent he enjoy worldly pleasure in the course of time scarron fall ill and be reduce to a dreadful condition no one come to he succor but ninon like a tender compassionate friend she sympathize deeply with he when he be carry to the suburb saint germain to try the effect of the bath as a alleviation of he pain scarron do not complain on the contrary he be cheerful and always gay even when suffer torture there be little left of he however but a indomitable spirit burning in a crushed tenement of mortal clay not be able to come to she ninon go to he and pass entire day at he side not only that she bring she friend with she and establish a small court around he bed thus cheer he in he pain and do he a world of good which finally enable he spirit to triumph over he mortal shell instance might be multiply enough to fill a volume of she devotion to she friend whom she never abandon and whom she be always ready with purse and counsel to aid in they difficulty a curious instance be that of nicola vauquelin sieur de desyvetaux whom she miss from she circle for several day aware that he have be have some family trouble and that he fortune be menace she become alarmed thinking that perhaps some misfortune have come upon he for which reason she resolve to seek he and help he out of he difficulty but ninon be mistake in suppose that so wise and gay a epicurean could be crush by any sorrow or trouble desyvetaux be enjoy himself in so singular a fashion that it be worth tell this illustrious epicurean finding one night a young girl in a faint condition at he door bring she into he house to succor she move by a impulse of humanity but as soon as she have recover she sens the philosopher 's heart be touch by she beauty to please she benefactor the girl play several selection on a harp and accompany the instrument with a charming and seductive voice desyvetaux who be a passionate admirer of music be captivate by this accomplishment and suddenly conceive the desire to spend the rest of he day in the company of this charming singer it be not difficult for a girl who have be make it she business to frequent the wineshop of the suburb with a brother earn a precarious living by singing and playing on the harp to accept such a proposition and consent to bestow happiness upon a excessively amorous man who offer to share with she a luxurious and tranquil life in one of the finest residence in the suburb saint germain although most of he life have be pass at court as the governor of m de vendôme and tutor of loui xiii he have always desire to lead a life of peace and quiet in retirement the pleasure of a sylvan life which he have so often describe in he lecture end by lead he mind in that direction the young girl he find on he doorstep have offer he he first opportunity to have a phylli to he corydon and he eagerly embrace it both yield to the fancy she dress in the garb of a shepherdess he play the rôle of corydon at the age of seventy year sometimes stretch out on a carpet of verdure he listen to the enchanting music she draw from she instrument or drink in the sweet voice of he shepherdess singing melodious pastoral a flock of bird charm with this harmony leave they cage to caress with they wing dupui ' harp or intoxicate with joy flutter down into she bosom this little gallantry in which they have be train be a delicious spectacle to the shepherd philosopher and intoxicate he sens he fancy he be guide with he mistress innumerable band of intermingled sheep they conversation be in tender eclogue compose by they both extemporaneously the attractive surroundings inspiring they with poetry ninon be amaze when she find she bon homme as she call he in the startlingly original disguise of a shepherd a crook in he hand a wallet hanging by he side and a great flap straw hat trim with rise color silk on he head she first impression be that he have take leave of he sens and she be on the point of shed tear over the wreck of a once brilliant mind when desyvetaux suspend he antic long enough to look about he perceive she and rush to she side with the liveliest expression of joy he remove she suspicion of he sanity by explain he metamorphosis in a philosophical fashion : you know my dear ninon there be certain taste and pleasure which find they justification in a certain philosophy when they bear all the mark of moral innocence nothing can be say against they but they singularity there be no amusement less dangerous than those which do not resemble those generally indulge in by the multitude ninon be please with the amiable companion of she old friend

side of the couch she say to those who stand around : ` tout est perdu à ce coup et à bon escient ' all be lose this time sure ' chapter x some of ninon 's lover notwithstanding she love of pleasure and she admiration for the society of man ninon be never vulgar or common in the distribution of she favor but select those upon whom she decide to bestow they with the greatest care and discrimination as have be already say she discover in early life that woman be at a discount and she resolve to pursue the method of man in the acceptance or rejection of friendship and in distribute she favor and influence as she herself declare : i soon see that woman be put off with the most frivolous and unreal privilege while every solid advantage be retain by the stronger sex from that moment i determine on abandon my own sex and assume that of the man so well do she carry out this determination that she be regard by she masculine intimate as one of themselves and whatever pleasure they enjoy in she society be enjoy upon the same principle as they would have delight in a good dinner a agreeable theatrical performance or exquisite music to she and to all she associate love be a taste emanate from the sens a blind sentiment which assume no merit in the object which give it birth as be the case of hunger thirst and the like in a word it be merely a caprice the domination of which depend upon ourselves and be subject to the discomfort and regret attendant upon repletion or indulgence after she first experience with de coligny which be a abandonment of she cold philosophy for a passionate attachment she think would endure forever ninon cast aside all that element in love which be connect with passion and extravagant sentiment and adhere to she philosophical understanding of it and keep it in its proper place in the category of natural appetite to illustrate she freedom from passionate attachment in the distribution of she favor the case of she friend scarron will give a insight into she philosophy scarron have receive numerous favor from she and be one of she select bird who have always agree with la rochefoucauld that there be many good marriage but none that be delicious she assume that she friend would never entangle himself in the bond of matrimony but he do and to he sorrow when ninon have return to pari after a long sojourn with the marquis de villarceaux she find to she astonishment that scarron have marry the amiable but ignoble mademoiselle d'aubigne this young lady be in a situation which preclude all hope of she ever attain social eminence but aspire to rise notwithstanding she common origin she marry scarron as the first step upon the social ladder without realize that this woman be to become the celebrated madame de maintenon mistress of the king and the real power behind the throne ninon take she in charge and they soon become the closest and most affectionate friend always together even occupy the same bed ninon 's tender friendship for the husband continue in spite of he grave violation of the principle of he accept philosophy and when he be desert sick and helpless she go to he and bring he cheer and comfort ninon be so little imbued with jealousy that when she discover a liaison between she own lover marquis de villarceaux and she friend madame scarron she be not even angry the two be carry on they amour in secret and as they suppose without ninon 's knowledge whose presence indeed they deem a restraint upon they freedom of action the marquis consider himself a traitor to ninon and madame scarron stand in fear of she reproach for she betrayal but ninon instead of take either of they to task as she would have be justify in do gently remonstrate with they for they secrecy and by she kindness reassure both of they and relieve they from they embarrassment make they understand that she desire nothing so much as they happiness both the marquis and he mistress make ninon they confidante and thereafter live in perfect amity until the lover grow tired of each other madame scarron aim higher than a ordinary marquis now that she see she way clear to mount the social ladder it be perhaps due to ninon 's kindness in the villarceaux episode that enable she to retain the friendship of madame de maintenon when the latter have reach the step of the throne the mistress of royalty endeavor to persuade ninon to appear at court but there be too great a difference in temper and constitution between the two celebrated woman to admit of any close relation ninon make use of the passion of love for the purpose of pleasure only while she more exalted rival make it subservient to she ambitious project and do not hesitate with that view to cloak she licentious habit beneath the mantle of religion and add hypocrisy to frailty the income of ninon de l'enclo be agreeably and judiciously spend in the society of man of wit and letter but the revenue of the marchioness de maintenon be squander on the useless decoration of she own person or hoard for the purpose of elevate into rank and notice a insignificant family who have no other claim to such distinction than that derive from the easy honesty of a female relation and the dissolute extravagance of a vain and licentious sovereign while ninon de l'enclo be receive and encourage the attention of the most distinguished man of she time literati noble warrior statesman and sage in she house in the rue des tournelles the mistress of the sovereign the dear friend who have betray she to the marquis de villarceaux be swallow at versaille the adulation of degraded courtier of every rank and profession there be meet together there the vain and the ambitious the design and the foolish the humblest and the proudest of those who whether proud or humble or ambitious or vain or crafty be alike the devoted servant of the monarch or the monarch 's mistress -- prince cardinal bishop duke and every kind of nobility exciseman and priest keeper of the royal conscience and necessary -- all minister of filth each in he degree from the secretary of state to the lowest underling in office -- clerk of the ordnance victual stamp custom colony and postoffice farmer and receiver general judge and cook confessor and every other caterer to the royal appetite this be the order of thing that ninon de l'enclo be contend against and that she succeed by method that must be consider saintly compare with the other stand record in the page of history after ninon have suffer from the indiscretion of the lover who make public the story of the famous pledge give la châtre she lose she fancy for the recreant and though friendly refuse any closer tie he know that he have do ninon a injury and beg to be reinstate in she favor he be of charming manners and fascinating in he plead but he make no impression on she heart she agree to pardon he for he folly and decline to consider the matter further nor would she return to the conversation although he persist in refer to the matter as one he deeply regret when he be depart after ninon have assure he of she pardon she run after he and call out as he be descend the stair : at least marquis we have not be reconcile she good quality be embalm in the literature of the day very few venture to lampoon she those who do so be greet with so much derisive laughter that they be ashamed to appear in society until the storm have blow over m de tourielle a member of the french academy and a very learn man become enamored of she and he love-making assume a curious phase to show she that he be worthy of she consideration he deem it incumbent upon he to read she long dissertation on scientific subject and bore she incessantly with a translation of the oration of demosthene which he intend dedicate to she in a elaborate preface this be more than ninon could bear with equanimity -- a lover with so much erudition and he prosy essay appeal more to she sense of humor than to she sentiment of love and he be laugh out of she social circle this anger the academician and he think to revenge himself by means of a epigram in which he charge ninon with admiring figure of rhetoric more than a sensible academic discourse full of greek and latin quotation it would have prove the ruin of the poor man have ninon not come to he rescue and explain to he the difference between learning and love after which he become sensible and write some very good book it should be understand that ninon have no secret in which she merry and wise bird do not share she confide to they all she love affair give they the name of she suitor in fact every wooer be turn over to this critical select society as a committee of investigation into quality and merit both of mind and body in this way she be protect from the unworthy and when she make a selection they respect she freedom of choice carefully guard she lover and make he one of themselves after the fitful fever be over they be all graduate in she school good fellow and have accept ninon 's philosophy without question she lover be always man of rank and station or of high talent but she be catch once by the dazzle of a famous dancer name pécour who please she exceedingly and who become the fortunate rival of the duc de choiseul afterward a marshal of france it happen that choiseul be more remarkable for he valor than for he probity and solid virtue and could not inspire in ninon 's heart anything but the sterile sentiment of esteem and respect he be certainly worthy of these but he be too cold in he amorous desire to please ninon he be a very worthy gentleman say she but he never give I a chance to love he the frequent visit of pécour excite the jealousy of the warrior but he do not dare complain not know whether thing have reach a climax and fear that if he should mention the matter he might help they along instead of stop they one day however he attempt to goad he unworthy rival into some admission and receive a response that be enough to settle he doubt pécour be in the habit of wear a costume much resemble that of the military dandy of the period choiseul meeting he in this equivocal garb proceed to be funny at he expense by put to he all sort of ironical and embarrassing question but pécour feel all the vanity of a successful rival and be good natured then the duke begin to make sneering remark which rouse the dancer 's anger pray what flag be you fight under and what body do you command ask monseigneur with a sarcastic smile quick as a flash come the answer which give the duke a inkling into the situation je commande un corps où vous servez depuis longtemp reply pécour chapter xi ninon 's lover -- continue a counter attraction have be refer to in speaking of the hôtel rambouillet where a fashionable court be establish for the purpose of draw away from ninon the elite who flock to she standard mademoiselle de scudery give a fine description of this little court at rambouillet in she romance entitle cyrus there be not and could not be any rivalry between the court in the rue des tournelle and that at rambouillet for the reason that ninon 's coterie consist of man exclusively while that of rambouillet be throng with woman but this quite naturally occasion much envy and jealousy among the lady who devise all sort of entertainment to attract masculine society one of they performance be the famous julium garland so name in honor of mademoiselle de rambouillet who be know by the name of julie d'angenne each one select a favorite flower write a sonnet in its praise and when all be ready they stand around mademoiselle de rambouillet in a circle and alternately recite the poem the reward for the best one be the favor of some fair lady among those who be draw to the hôtel rambouillet by this pleasing entertainment be the duke d'enghien afterward know as the great condé a prince of the highest renown as a victorious warrior he be a great acquisition and the garland play be repeat every night in the expectation that he pleasure would continue and the constant attraction prove adequate to hold he once or twice however be sufficient for the duke its constant repetition become flat and tiresome he do not scruple to express he dissatisfaction with a society that could not originate something new he be a broad mind man with a comprehensive knowledge but have little taste for poetry and childish entertainment but the good lady of rambouillet unable to devise any other entertainment persist in they garland play until the duke 's human nature rebel at the monotony and he beg he friend de moissen and saint-evremond to suggest some relief they immediately bring he in touch with the bird of the tournelle with the result that he abandon the hôtel rambouillet and find scope for he social desire at ninon 's house and in she more attractive society the conquest of he heart follow that of he intelligence the hero of rocrous be unable to resist a tenderness which be the glory of a lover and the happiness of he mistress it be a curious fact know to some that all the hero of bellona be not expert in the war of venus the strongest and most valiant soul be weak in combat in which valor play a unimportant part the poet chaulieu say upon this point : pour avoir la valeur d'hercule on n'est pas obligé d'en avoir la vigueur -lrb- to have the valor of hercule one need not have he vigor -rrb- the young prince be bear to attain immortal glory on the field of mar to that all he training have tend but notwithstanding he robust physique and the indicium of great strength with which nature have endow he he be a weakling in the field of venus he come within the category of a latin proverb with which ninon be familiar : pilosus aut forti aut libidinosus -lrb- a hairy man be either strong or sensual -rrb- wherefore one day when ninon be enjoy he society she look at he narrowly and exclaim : ah monseigneur il faut que vous soyez bien fort -lrb- ah monseigneur you must be very strong -rrb- notwithstanding this the two dwell together for a long time in perfect harmony the intellectual benefit the duke derive from the close intimacy be no less than the pleasure he derive from she affection naturally incline to deserve the merit and esteem as well as the love of she admirer ninon use all the influence she possess to regulate they life and to inspire they with the true desire to perform faithfully the duty of they rank and station what power over she intimate do not possess a charming woman disembarrass of conventional prudery but vest with grace high sentiment and mental attainment it be through the gentle exercise of this power that the famous aspasium grave in the soul of pericle the seductive art of eloquent language and teach he the most solid maxim of politics maxim of which he make so noble a use the young duke penetrate with love and esteem for ninon pass at she side every moment he could steal away from the profound study and occupation require by he rank and position although he afterward become the prince de condé the lion of he time and the bulwark of france he never cease express for she the liveliest gratitude and friendship whenever he meet she equipage in the street of pari he never fail to descend from he own and go to pay she the most affectionate compliment the prince de marsillac afterward the duke de la rochefoucauld less philosophical then than later in life and who pride himself on he acquaintance with all the vice and folly of youth could not long withhold he admiration for the solid and estimable quality he perceive in ninon whom he often see in the company of the duke d'enghein the result of he admiration be that he form a tender attachment which last as long as he live it be ninon who continue the good work begin by madame de la fayette who confess that she social relation with la rochefoucauld have be the means of embellish she mind and that in compensation for this great service she have reform he heart whatever share madame de la fayette may have have in reform the heart of this great man it be certain that ninon de l'enclo have much to do with reform he moral and elevate he mind up to the point it be evident he reach to judge from he maxim in which the human heart be bare as with a scalpel in the most skilfully devise epigram that never cease to hold the interest of every reader chapelle the most celebrated voluptuary in pari do everything in he power to overcome ninon 's repugnance but without success there be nothing lack in he mental attainment for he be a poet of very high order inimitable in he style moreover he be presentable in he person yet he could not make the slightest impression on ninon 's heart he openly declare he love and receive constant rebuff resolve to have revenge and overcome she resistance by punish she this he attempt to do in a very singular manner without regard to consistency all paris know he verse in which he do not conceal he ardent love for ninon and in which be express the highest admiration for she estimable quality and the depth of she philosophy he now proceed to take back everything good he have say about she and make fun of she love she friendship and she attainment he ridicule she in every possible manner even charge up against she beauty she age a verse or so will enable the reader to understand he method : il ne faut pas qu'on s ' étonne si souvent elle raisonne de la sublime vertu dont platon fut revêtu : car à bien compter son âge elle peut avoir vécu avec ce grand personnage or substantially in the english language : let no one be surprise if she should be advise of the virtue most renowned in plato to be find : for count up she age she live ` tis reason sound with that great personage ninon have no rancor in she heart toward any one much less against a unsuccessful suitor hence she only laugh at chapelle 's effusion and all pari laugh with she the truth be la rochefoucauld have impress she mind with that famous saying of he : old age be the hell of woman and not fear any hell reference to she age neither alarm she nor cause the slightest flurry in she peaceful life she be too philosophical to regret the loss of what she do not esteem of any value and see chapelle slip away from she with tranquillity of mind it be only during moment of gayety when she abandon herself to the play of a imagination always laugh and fertile that she repeat the sacrilegious wish of the pious king of aragon who wish that he have be present at the moment of creation when among the suggestion he could have give providence he would have advise he to put the wrinkle of old age where the god of pagandom have locate the feeble spot in achille if ninon ever feel a pang on account of the ungenerous conduct of chapelle he disciple the illustrious abbé de chaulieu the anacreon of the age who be call when he make he entrée into the world of letter the poet of good fellowship more than compensate she for the injury do by he pastor the abbé be the prior of fontenay whither ninon frequently accompany madame the duchess de bouillon and the chevalier d'orléans the duchess love to joke at the expense of the abbé and twit he about he waste talent which be more adapt to love than to he present situation it may be that the worthy abbé after think over seriously what be intend to be a mere pleasantry conclude that madame the duchess be right and that he possess some talent in the direction of love however that might have be it be certain that he have cast a observant and critical eye on ninon and he now openly pay she court not unsuccessfully it should be know the abbé gedoyn be she last lover so far as there be any account of she amours the story be relate by remond surname the greek and must be take with a grain of salt as ninon be at that time seventy-nine year of age this remond notwithstanding she age have make violent love to ninon without meeting with any success perhaps he be try a experiment be a learn man anxious to ascertain when the fire of passion become extinct in the human breast ninon evidently suspect he ardent profession for she refuse to listen to he and forbid he visit altogether i be the dupe of he greek erudition she explain so i banish he from my school he be always wrong in he philosophy of the world and be unworthy of as sensible a society as mine she often add to this : after god have make man he repent he i feel the same about rémond but to return to the abbé gedoyn : he leave the jesuit with the abbé fraguier in 1694 that be to say when mademoiselle de l'enclos be seventy-eight year of age both of they immediately make the acquaintance of ninon and madame de la salière and astonish at the profound merit they discover deem it to they advantage to frequent they society for the purpose of add to they talent something which the study of the cloister and experience in the king 's cabinet itself have never offer they abbé gedoyn become particularly attach to mademoiselle de l'enclos whose good taste and intellectual light he consider such sure and safe guide he gratitude soon receive the addition of esteem and admiration and the young disciple feel the growth of desire which it be difficult to believe be real but which become so press that they revive in a heart nearly extinct a feeble spark of that fire with which it have formerly burn mademoiselle de l'enclos refuse to accede to the desire of she lover until she be fully eighty year of age a term which do not cool the ardor of the amorous abbé who wait impatiently and on she eightieth birthday compel he benefactress to keep she word this incident recall the testimony of a celebrated countess of salisbury who be call to testify as a expert upon the subject of love in a celebrated criminal case that be try over a hundred year ago in the english house of lord the woman correspondent be of a age when human passion be suppose to be extinct and she counsel be attempt to prove that fact to relieve she from the charge the testimony of the aged countess who be herself over seventy-five year of age be very unsatisfactory and the court put this question to she demand a explicit answer madame he inquire at what age do the sentiment passion or desire of love cease in the female heart she ladyship who have live long in high society and have be acquaint with all of the gallant and coquette of the english court for nearly two generation and who herself have sometimes be suspect of not have be averse to a little waywardness look down at she foot for a moment thoughtfully then raise she eye and lock squarely into those of the judge answer : my lord you will have to ask a woman older than i chapter xii the villarceaux affair party politics rage around ninon she bird be man of high rank and leader with a large follow they be all she dearest friend however and no matter how strong personal passion be beyond she immediate presence she circle be a neutral ground which no one thought of violate it require she utmost influence and tenderness however to prevent outbreak but she unvarying sweetness of temper and disposition to all win they heart into a truce for she sake there be continual plot hatch against the stern rule of richelieu cabal and conspiracy without number be enter upon but none of they result in anything richelieu know very well what be go on and he realize perfectly that ninon 's drawing-room be the center of every scheme concoct to drag he down and out of the dominant position he be hold against the combined nobility of france but he never take a step toward suppress she little court as a hot-bed of restlessness he rather encourage she by he silence and he indifference complaint of she grow coterie of uneasy spirit bring nothing from he but : as long as they find amusement they be not dangerous it be the forerunner of napoleon 's idea along the same line : we must amuse the people then they will not meddle with we management of the government it be preposterous to think of this minister of peace this restless prelate half soldier half pastor meddle in all these cabal and seditious scheme organize for he own undoing but nevertheless he be really the fomenter of all of they they be he device for prevent the nobility from combine against he he set one cabal to watch another and there be never a conspiracy enter into that he do not prepare a similar conspiracy through he numerous secret agent and thus split into harmless nothing and weak attempt what would have be fatal to a continuance of he power he trick be nothing but the ordinary everyday method of the modern ward politician make the dear people believe he be do one thing when he be do another the stern man pit one antagonist against another until both sue for peace and pardon the nobility be honest in they likes and dislike but they do not understand double dealings and therefore the craft of richelieu be not even suspect soon he corrupt by he secret intrigue the fidelity of the noble and destroy the integrity of the people then it be as cyrano say : the world see billow of scum vomit upon the royal purple and upon that of the church vile rhyming poet without merit or virtue sell they villainous production to the enemy of the state to be use in goad the people to riot obscene and filthy vaudeville defamatory libel and infamous slander be as common as bread and be hurl back and forth as evidence of a internecine strife which be rage around the wearer of the roman scarlet who be thereby justified in continue he ecclesiastical rule to prevent the wreck of the throne ninon have always be a ardent supporter of the throne and on that account imagine herself to be the enemy of richelieu there be many other who believe the same thing they do not know that should the great cardinal withdraw he hand for a single moment there would not be any more throne when the human hornet around he become annoying he be accustom to pretend to withdraw he sustain hand then the throne would tremble and totter but he always come to the rescue indeed there be no other man who could rescue it cabal plot and conspiracy become so thick around ninon at one period that she be frightened scarron 's house become a rendezvous for the factious and turbulent madame scarron be aim at the throne that be she be open the way to capture the heart of the king this be too much for ninon who be more modest in she ambition and she flee frightened the marquis de villarceaux receive she with open arm at he château some distance from pari and that be she home for three year there be loud protest at this desertion from she coterie of friend and numerous dark threat be utter against the gallant marquis who have thus capture the queen of the bird but ninon explain she reason in such a plausible manner that they complaint subside into good-natured growl she hope to prevent a political conflagration emanate from she social circle by scatter the firebrand and she succeed admirably the marquis be constantly with she permit nobody to intervene between they and provide she with a perpetual round of amusement that make the time pass very quickly moreover she be faithful to the marquis so wonderful a circumstance that she friend and admirer write a elegy upon that circumstance in which he draw a picture of the pleasure of the ancient in ruralize but reproach ninon for indulge in a passion for so long a period to the detriment of she other friend and admirer but ninon be happy in attain the summit of she desire which be to defeat madame scarron she rival in the affection of the marquis keep the latter by she side for three whole year as have already be say however delighted ninon may have be with this arrangement the marquis himself do not repose upon a bed of rose the jealousy of the bird give he no respite he be oblige in honor to respond to they demand for a explanation of he conduct in carry off they leader generally insist upon the so-called field of honor as the most appropriate place for give a satisfactory answer they even invade he premise until they force he to make they some concession in the way of permission to see the object of they admiration and to share in she society the marquis be proud of he conquest the very idea of a three year ' tête à tête with the most volatile heart in france be sufficient to justify he in boast of he prowess but whenever he venture to do so a champion on the part of ninon always stand ready to make he either eat he word or fight to maintain they madame scarron whom he so basely desert for the superior charm of she friend ninon often give he a bad quarter of a hour when she become the mistress of the king and as madame de maintenon really hold the rein of power vision of the bastile throng he brain he know perfectly well that he have scorn the charm of madame scarron who believe they irresistible and that he deserve whatever punishment she might inflict upon he she might have procure a lettre de cachet have he immure in a dungeon or he head remove from he shoulder as easily as order a dinner but she do nothing to gratify a spirit of revenge utterly ignore he existence add to these trifling circumstance trifle in comparison with what follow be the furious jealousy of he wife madame la marquise she be violently angry and do not conceal she hatred for the woman who have steal she husband 's affection the marquise be a trifle vulgar and common in she manner of manifest she displeasure but the marquis a very polite and affable gentleman do not pay the slightest attention to he wife 's daily recrimination but continue to amuse himself with the charming ninon under such circumstance each be compel to have a separate social circle the marquis entertaining he friend with the adorable ninon as the center of attraction and madame la marquise do she best to offer counter attraction somehow ninon draw around she all the most desirable parti among the flower of the nobility and wit leave the social circle manage by la marquise to languish for want of stamen it be a constant source of annoyance to the marquise to see she rival 's entertainment so much in repute and she own so poorly attend and she be at she wit ' end to devise something that would give they éclat one of she method and a impromptu scene at one of she drawing-room will serve to show the reason why madame la marquise be not in good repute and why she could not attract the élite of pari to she entertainment la marquise be a very vain moreover a very ignorant woman a nouvelle riche in fact or what might be term in modern parlance shoddy without tact sense or savoir faire one day at a grand reception some of she guest desire to see she young son of whom she be very proud and of whose talent and virtue she be always boast he be send for and come into the presence accompany by he tutor a italian savant who never leave he side from praise he beauty of person they pass to he mental quality madame la marquise enchant at the caress she son be receive and aim to create a sensation by show off he learn take it into she head to have he tutor put he through a examination in history interrogate my son upon some of he recent lesson in history say she to the tutor who be not at all loth to show he own attainment by the brilliancy of he pupil come now monsieur le marquis say the tutor with alacrity quem habuit successorem belus rex assiriorum -lrb- whom do belus king of the assyrian have for successor -rrb- it so happen that the tutor have teach the boy to pronounce the latin language after the italian fashion wherefore when the lad answer ninum who be really the successor of belus king of the assyrian he pronounce the last two letter um like the french nasal on which give the name of the assyrian king the same sound as that of ninon de l'enclos the terrible bête noir of the jealous marquise this be enough to set she off into a spasm of fury against the luckless tutor who could not understand why he should be so berate over a simple question and its correct answer the marquise not understand latin and guide only by the sound of the answer which be similar to the name of she hate rival jump at the conclusion that he be answer some question about ninon de l'enclos you be give my son a fine education she snap out before all she guest by entertain he with the folly of he father from the answer of the young marquis i judge of the impertinence of you question go leave my sight and never enter it again the unfortunate tutor vainly protest that he do not comprehend she anger that he mean no affront that there be no other answer to be make than ninum unfortunately again pronounce the word ninon which nearly send the lady into a fit of apoplexy with rage at hear the tabooed name repeat in she presence the incensed woman carry the scene to a ridiculous point refuse to listen to reason or explanation no he say ` ninon ' and ninon it be the story spread all over pari and when it reach ninon she laugh immoderately she friend dub she the successor of belus ninon tell molière the ridiculous story and he turn it to profit in one of he comedy in the character of countess d'escarbagna at the expiration of three year peace have come to france after a fashion the cabal be not so frequent and the rivalry between the faction not so bitter whatever difference there have be be patch up or smooth over ninon 's return to the house in the rue des tournelle be hail with joy by she bird who receive she as one return from the dead saint-evremond compose a elegy begin with these line : chère phili qu ' êtes vous devenue cet enchanteur quus vous a retenue depuis trois ans par un charme nouveau vous retient-il en quelque vieux château chapter xiii the marquis de sévigné it have be attempt to cast odium upon the memory of mademoiselle de l'enclos because of she connection with the second marquis de sévigné son of the celebrated madame de sévigné whose letter have be read far and wide by those who fancy they can find something in they with reference to the moral and practice of the court of versaille during she period the marquis de sévigné by a vitiated taste quite natural in man of weak power have fail to discover in a handsome woman spirited perhaps of too jealous a nature or disposition to be esteem the proper sentiment or sentiment strong enough to retain he affection he implore ninon to aid he in preserve she affection and to teach he how to secure she love ninon undertake to give he instruction in the art of captivating woman 's heart to show he the nature of love and its operation and to give he a insight into the nature of woman the marquis profit by these lesson to fall in love with ninon find she a thousand time more charming than he actress or he princess madame de sévigné 's letter refer to the love of she son for ninon testify by tell he plainly ninon spoil you father that this passion be not so much unknown to she as it be a matter of indifference the young chevalier de vassé often give brilliant reception in honor of ninon at saint cloud which the marquis de sévigné always attend as the mutual friend of both de vassé be well acquaint with ninon 's peculiarity and know that the gallantry of such a man as de sévigné be a feeble means of retain the affection of a heart that be the slave of nothing but its own fugitive desire but he be a man devote to he friend and be epicurean in he philosophy he do not attempt to interfere with the affection he perceive grow between ninon and he friend it never occur to the marquis that he be guilty of a betrayal of friendship by pay court to ninon and the latter take the marquis ' attention as a matter of course without consider the ingratitude of she conduct she rather flatter herself at have be sufficiently attractive to capture a man of de seine 's family distinction she have capture the heart of de soigné the father and have receive so many animadversion upon she conduct from madame de sévigné that it afford she great pleasure to spoil the son as she have the father but she satisfaction be short-lived for she have the chagrin to learn soon after she conquest that de sévigné have perish on the field

resolve to use a argument that be convince with the brightest mind with whom she have ever deal that be the power of she own love and if the marquis have live perhaps he might have become a ornament to society and a honor to he family to do this however she violate she compact with de vassé betray he confidence and open the way for the animadversion of madame de sévigné at that time de sévigné be in love with a actress mademoiselle champmêlé but desire to withdraw he affection or rather transfer they to a higher object a countess or a princess as the reader may infer from he mother 's hint in

marry he own mother le sage 's hero however mourn because he have not be able to commit the crime which give the case of ninon 's son a similar tinge he self-immolation be due not to the horror of have indulge in criminal love for he own mother but to the regret at not have be able to accomplish he purpose chapter xv she bohemian environment the daily and nightly doings at ninon 's house in the rue des tournelles if there be anything of a similar character in modern society that can be compare to they might be faintly represent by we bohemian circle where good cheer good fellowship and freedom from restraint be suppose to reign there be indeed numerous club at the present day style bohemian but except so far as the tendency to relaxation appear upon the surface they possess very few of the characteristic of that society of bird that assemble around mademoiselle de l'enclos they put aside all conventional restraint and the mental metal of those choice spirit clash and evolve brilliant spark bright ray of light the luster of which still glitter after a lapse of more than two century personally ninon be a enemy of pedantry in every form demand of she follower originality at all time on penalty of banishment from she circle the great writer mynard once related with tear in he eye that he daughter who afterward become the countess de feuquières have no memory whereat ninon laugh he out of he sorrow : you be too happy in have a daughter who have no memory she will not be able to make citation that she society be seek by very good man be evidence by the grave theologian who find she companionship pleasant perhaps salutary a celebrated jesuit who do not scruple to find entertainment in she social circle undertake to combat she philosophy and show she the truth from he point of view but she come so near convert he to she tenet that he abandon the contest remark with a laugh : well well mademoiselle while wait to be convince that you be in error offer up to god you unbelief rousseau have convert this incident into a epigram the grave and learn clergy of port royal also undertake the labor of convert she but they labor be in vain you know she tell fontenelle what use i make of my body well then it would be easier for I to obtain a good price for my soul for the jansenist and molinist be engage in a competition of bidding for it she be not bigote in the least as the follow incident will show : one of she friend refuse to send for a priest when in extremis but ninon bring one to he bedside and as the clergyman know the scepticism of the die sinner hesitate to exercise he function she encourage he to do he duty : do you duty sir she say i assure you that although we friend can argue he know no more about the truth than you and i the key to mademoiselle de l'enclos ' character be to be find in she toleration and liberality utterly unselfish she have no thought beyond the comfort and happiness of she friend for they she sacrifice she person a astounding sacrifice in a woman one for which a multitude have suffer martyrdom for refuse to make and be cite as model of virtue to be follow yet notwithstanding she strange misapplication or perversion of what the world call female honor she world have nothing but the most profound respect and admiration for she it require a extremely delicate pencil to sketch such a character and even then a hundred trial might result in fail to seize upon its most vivid light and shades and bring out its best point stand out clearly define through she whole life be a noble soul that never stoop to anything common low debasing or vulgar bring up from infancy in the society of man teach to consider they as she companion and equal and treat by they as one of themselves she acquire a grace and a polish that make she society desire by the proudest lady of the court there be no one in the annals of the nation of the earth that can be compare to she the aspasium of pericle have be regard by some as a sort of prototype but aspasium be a common woman of the town she thought be devote to the aggrandizement of one man she love affair be bestow upon a open market on the contrary mademoiselle de l'enclos never bestow she favor upon any but one she could ever after regard as a earnest unselfish friend they friendship be a source of delight to she and she be epicurean in the enjoyment of everything that go with friendship saint-evremond liken she to leontium the athenian woman celebrate for she philosophy and for have dare to write a book against the great theophrastus a literary venture which may have be the reason why saint-evremond give ninon the title ninon 's heart be weak it be true but she have early learn those philosophical principle which draw she sens away from that portion of she soul and she environment be those most conducive to the cultivation of the sens which be so easily lead away into seductive path but however far she love of pleasure may have lead she she philosophical idea and practice do not succeed in destroy or even weaken any other virtue the smallest fault of gallant woman say de la rochefoucauld be they gallantry the distinguished abbé châteauneuf express a trait in she character which draw to she side the most distinguished man of the period she reserve all she esteem all she confidence for friendship which she always regard as a respectable liaison say the abbé and to maintain that friendship she permit no diminution or relaxation in other word she be constant and true without whim or caprice the comte de segur in he work on woman they condition and influence in society say : while ninon de l'enclo be foster and patronize genius and give it opportunity to expand madame de sévigné be at the head of a cabal in opposition to genius unless it be measure upon she own standard in she self-love she work against racine and seek to diminish the literary luster of flèchier but with all she ability madame de sévigné possess very little genius or tact and she lack of discrimination be apparent in the fact that none of she protégés ever reach any distinction moreover she virtue must have be of a appalling character since they be not strong enough to save she husband and son from fall into the clutch of that horrid woman refer to ninon ninon certainly understand man she divine they at the first glance and provide for they bodily and intellectual want if they be deem worthy of she favor she bestow they freely and out of one animal desire gratify there be create a thousand intellectual aspiration she understand clearly that man can not be all animal or all spiritual and that the attempt to divert nature from its duality of be be to wreck humanity and make of man neither fish flesh nor fowl she constant prayer in she younger day for the truth of which voltaire vouch be : mon dieu faîtes de moi un honnête homme et n'en faîtes jamais une honnête femme -lrb- my god make I a honest man but never a honest woman -rrb- count segur in he book already refer to have this to say further concern ninon : ninon shone under the reign of loui xiv like a graceful plant in its proper soil splendor seem to be she element that ninon might appear in the sphere that become she it be necessary that turenne and condé should sigh at she foot that voltaire should receive from she he first lesson in a word that in she illustrious cabinet glory and genius should be see sport with love and the grace have it not be for the influence of ninon de l'enclos -- there be many who claim it as the truth -- the sombre tinge the veil of gloominess and hypocritical austerity which surround madame de maintenon and she court would have wreck the intellect of the most illustrious and brightest man in france in war literature science and statesmanship madame de maintenon resist that influence but the rue des tournelle strive against saint cyr the world fluctuate between these two system establish by woman both of they -- shall it be say -- courtesan the legality and morality of we modern common law marriage and the ease and frequency of trivial divorce forbid it ninon prevail however and not only govern heart but soul the difference between the two court be the royal salon be throng with woman of the most infamous character who have nothing but they infamy to bestow while the draw room of ninon de l'enclo be crowd with man almost exclusively and man of wit and genius the moral that the majority of writer draw from the three court that occupy society at that time the rue des tournelles madame de sévigné and versaille be that man demand human nature and will have it in preference to abnormal goodness and female debauchery ninon never hesitate to declaim against the fictitious beauty that pretend to inculcate virtue and morality while secretly engage in the most corrupt practice but molière come with he précieuses ridicule and pulverize the enemy of human nature ninon do not know molière personally at that time but she be so loud in he praise for cover she gross imitator with confusion that bachaumont and chapelle two of she intimate friend venture to introduce the young dramatist into she society the father of this bachaumont who be a twin say of he : my son who be only half a man want to do as if he be a whole one though only half a man and extremely feeble and delicate he become a voluptuary accord to the idea of chapelle and by devote himself to the doctrine of epicurus he manage to live until eighty year of age chapelle be a drunkard as have be intimate in a precede chapter and although he love ninon passionately she steadily refuse to favor he molière and ninon be mutually attract each recognize in the other not only a kindred spirit but something not apparent on the surface nature have give they the same eye and they see man and thing from the same view point molière be destine to enlighten he age by he pen and ninon through she wise counsel and sage reflection in speaking of molière to saint-evremond she declare with fervor : i thank god every night for find I a man of he spirit and i pray he every morning to preserve he from the folly of the heart there be a great opposition to molière 's comedy tartuffe it create a sensation in society and neither loui xiv the prelate of the kingdom and the roman legate be strong enough to withstand the torrent of invective that come from those who be unmask in the play they succeed in have it interdict and the comedy be on the point of be suppress altogether when molière take it to ninon read it over to she and ask she opinion as to what have better be do with she keen sense of the ridiculous and she knowledge of character ninon go over the play with molière to such good purpose that the edict of suppression be withdraw the opponent of the comedy finding themselves in a position where they could no longer take exception without confess the truth of the inuendo when the comedy be nearly complete molière begin try to think of a name to give the main character in the play who be a imposter one day while at dinner with the papal nuncio he notice two ecclesiastic whose air of pretended mortification fairly represent the character he have depict in the play while consider they closely a peddler come along with truffle to sell one of the pious ecclesiastic who know very little italian prick up he ear at the word truffle which seem to have a familiar sound suddenly come out of he devout silence he select several of the finest of the truffle and hold they out to the nuncio exclaim with a laugh : tartuffolus tartuffolus signor nuncio imagine that he be display he knowledge of the italian language by call out truffle truffle signor nuncio whereas what he do say be hypocrite hypocrite signor nuncio molière who be always a close and keen observer of everything that transpire around he seize upon the name tartuffe as suitable to the hypocritical imposter in he comedy ninon 's brilliancy be so animated particularly at table that she be say to be intoxicate at the soup although she rarely drink anything but water she table be always surround by the wittiest of she friend and she own flash keep they spirit up to the highest point the charm of she conversation be equal to the draught of nepenthe which helen lavish upon she guest accord to homer to charm and enchant they one story tell about ninon be not to she credit if true and it be dispute a great preacher arise in france the eagle of the pulpit as he be call or the great pan as madame de sévigné loved to designate he he renown for eloquence and piety reach ninon 's ear and she conceive a scheme so it be say to bring this great orator to she foot she have hold in she chain from time to time all the hero and illustrious man of france and she consider père bourdaloue worthy of a place on the list she accordingly array herself in she most fascinating costume feign illness and send for he but père bourdaloue be not a man to be captivate by any woman and moreover he be a man too deeply verse in human perversity to be easily deceive he come at she request however and to she question as to she condition he answer : i perceive that you malady exist only in you heart and mind as to you body it appear to I to be in perfect health i pray the great physician of soul that he will heal you say which he leave she without ceremony the story be probably untrue and grow out of a song of the time to ridicule the attempt of numerous preacher to convert ninon from she way of live they frequent she social reception but those be always public as she never trust herself to any one without the knowledge and presence of some of she bird take that precaution for she own safety and to avoid any appearance of partiality the song refer to compose by some unknown scribe begin as follow : ninon passe les jours au jeu : cours où l'amour te porte le prédicateur qui t ` exhorte s ` il était au coin de ton feu te parlerait d'un autre sorte chapter xvi a remarkable old age when ninon have reach the age of sixty-five year there be those among the beauty of the royal court who think she ought to retire from society and make way for they but there appear to be no diminution of she capacity for pleasure no weakening of she power of attraction the legend of the noctambule or the little black man who appear to ninon when she be at the age of twenty year and promise she perpetual beauty and the conquest of all heart be revive and there be enough probability in it to justify a strong belief in the story indeed the abbé servien spread it about again when ninon be seventy year of age and even then there be few who dispute the mysterious gift as ninon show little change as old age approach ninon cease to be regard with that familiarity show she by she intimate in she younger day and a respect and admiration take its place she be no longer ninon but mademoiselle de l'enclos she social circle widen and instead of be limit to man exclusively lady eagerly take advantage of the privilege accord they to frequent the charming circle that circle certainly become celebrated the beautiful woman have live the life of a earnest epicurean in she own way regardless of society 's conventionality and have apparently demonstrate that she way be the best she have certainly attain a long life and what be more to the purpose she have preserve she beauty and the attraction of she person be as strong as when she be in she prime reason enough why the woman of the age throng she apartment to learn the secret of she life moreover she long and intimate association with the most remarkable man of the century have not fail to impart to she in addition to she exquisite femininity the wisdom of a sage and the polish of a man of the world madame de la fayette that rich field so fertile in fruit as ninon say of she and madame de la sablière a lovely garden enamel with eye-charming flower another of ninon 's descriptive metaphor pass as many hour as they could in she society with the illustrious duke de la rochefoucauld who up to the time of he death honor ninon with he constant friendship and he devoted esteem even madame de sévigné put aside she envy and jealousy and never weary of the pleasure of listen to the conversation of this wise beauty in company with she haughty daughter madame de grignan madame de coulange madame de torp and strange to say the duchess de bouillon she friend watch over she health with the tenderest care and affection and even she slightest indisposition bring they around she with expression of the deepest solicitude they dread lose she for have have she so long among they they hope to keep she always and they do practically for she outlive the most of they as proof of the anxiety of she friend and the delight they experience at she recovery from the slightest ailment one illustration will suffice on one occasion she have withdraw from she friend for a single evening plead indisposition the next evening she reappear and she return be celebrate by a original poem write by no less a personage than the abbé regnier-desmarai who read it to the friend assemble around she chair : clusine quus dans tous les temps eut de tous les honnêtes gen l'amour et l'estime en partage : quus toujor pleine de bon sens sut de chaque saison de l'âge faire à propos un juste usage : qui dans son entretien dont on fut enchanté sut faire un aimable alliage de l'agreable badinage avec la politesse et la solidité et que le ciel doua d'un esprit droit et sage toujor d'intelligence avec la verité clusine est grâce au ciel en parfaite santé such a poem would not be accord much praise nowadays but the heart of she friend regard the sentiment more than the polish as a substantial translation into english will serve to show appear in the line : clusine who from we earliest ken have from all good and honest man love and esteem a generous share : who know so well the season when she heritage of sense so rare to use with justice and with care : who in she discourse friend enchant all-around could fashion out of playful ware a alloy of endure wear good breeding and with solid ground a heavenly spirit wise and fair with truth and intellect profound clusine thanks be to heaven she perfect health have find she salon be open to she friend in general from five o'clock in the evening until nine at which hour she beg they to permit she to retire and gain strength for the morrow in winter she occupy a large apartment decorate with portrait of she dearest male and female friend and numerous painting by celebrated artist in summer she occupy a apartment which overlook the boulevard its wall fresco with magnificent sketch from the life of psyche in one or the other of these salon she give she friend four hour every evening after that retire to rest or amusing herself with a few intimate she friendship find a apt illustration in the case of the comte de charleval he be always delicate and in feeble health and ninon when he become she admirer in he youth resolve to prolong he life through the application of the epicurian philosophy de marville speaking of the count whom no one imagine would survive to middle age say : nature which give he so delicate a body in such perfect form also give he a delicate and perfect intelligence this frail and delicate invalid live however until the age of eighty year and be always grateful to ninon for she tenderness he never miss a reception and sing she praise on every occasion write to saint-evremond to announce he death ninon herself very aged say : he mind have retain all the charm of he youth and he heart all the sweetness and tenderness of a true friend she feel the loss of this common friend for she again write of he afterward : he life and that i live have much in common it be like die oneself to meet with such a loss it be at this period of she life that ninon occupy she time more than ever in endearing herself to she friend as say saint-evremond : she contents herself with ease and rest after have enjoy the liveliest pleasure of life although she be never mistress of the invincible inclination toward the pleasure of the sens which nature have give she it appear that ninon make some effort to control they refer to the ash which be sprinkle on the head of the penitent faithful on ash Wednesday she insist that instead of the usual prayer of abnegation there should be substitute the word : we must avoid the movement of love what she write saint-evremond might give rise to the belief that she sometimes regret she weakness : everybody tell I that i have less to complain of in my time than many another however that may be if any one have propose to I such a life i would have hang myself one of she favorite maxim however be : we must provide a stock of provision and not of pleasure they should be take as they come that she philosophical principle do not change be certain from the fact that she retain all she friend and gain new one who flock to she reunion say madame de coulange in one of she letter : the woman be run after mademoiselle de l'enclos now as much as the man use to do how can any one hate old age after such a example this reflection do not originate with ninon who regret little she former pleasure and besides friendship with she have as many sacred rights as love from what madame de coulange say one might suppose that the man have desert ninon in she old age leave woman to take they place but madame de sévigné be of a different opinion she say : corbinellus ask I about the new marvel take place at mademoiselle de l'enclos ' house in the way of good company she assemble around she in she old age whatever madame de coulange may say to the contrary both man and woman but even if woman do not flock to she side she could console herself for have have man in she young day to please the celebrated english geometrician huygen visit ninon during a sojourn at paris in the capacity of ambassador he be so charm with the attraction of she person and with she singing that he fall into poetry to express he admiration french verse from a

philosophy as she say : i be content myself with what happen from day to day forget to-day what occur yesterday and hold on to a use up body as one that have be very agreeable she see the term of she life come to a end without any qualm or fear if i could only believe with madame de chevreuse that by die we can go and talk with all we friend in the other world it would be a sweet thought madame de maintenon then in the height of she power and influence have never forget the friend of she youth and now she offer she lodgings at versaille it be say that she intention be to enable the king to profit by a intimacy with a woman of eighty-five year who in spite of bodily infirmity possess the same vivacity of mind and delicacy of taste which have contribute to she great renown much more than she personal charm and frailty but ninon be bear for liberty and have never be willing to sacrifice she philosophical tranquility for the hope of greater fortune and position in the world accordingly she thank she old friend and as the only concession she would grant consent to stand in the chapel of versaille where loui the great could pass and satisfy he curiosity to see once at least the

leontium a name give she by le maréchal de saint-evremond and in he eulogy upon she character lay great stress on the genius display in she epistolary style after censure the affectation to be find in the letter of balzac and voiture the learn abbé say : the letter of leontium although novel in they form of expression although replete with philosophy and sparkling with wit and intelligence contain nothing stilted or overdrawn inasmuch as the moral to be draw from they be always seasoned with sprightliness and the spirit manifest in they display the characteristic of a liberal and natural imagination they differ in nothing from personal conversation with she choice circle of friend the impression convey to the mind of they reader be that she be actually converse with they personally mademoiselle de l'enclos write about the heart love and woman strange subject but no woman ever live who be better able to do justice to they in she frame of mind she could not see man without study they disposition and she know they thoroughly she experience extend over a period of seventy-five year of intimate association with man of every stamp from the royal prince to the marquis de sévigné the latter weary she to such a extent that she designate he as a man beyond definition with a soul of pulp a body of wet paper and a heart of pumpkin fricasseed in snow he own mother the renowned madame de sévigné admit that he be a heart fool ninon take this weak chevalier in charge and endeavor to make a man of he by expose he frailty and enter into a long correspondence to instruct he in the pathology of the female heart with which he be dispose to tamper on the slightest provocation she letter will show that she succeed finally in bring he to reason but that in do so she be compel to betray she own sex by expose the secret motive of woman in they relation with man that she know woman as well as man can not be dispute for begin with madame de maintenon and the queen of sweden

the most distinguished and prominent society woman of france they all be she particular friend as well as intimate and hold she in high esteem as they confidante in all affair of the heart no other woman ever hold so unique a position in the world of society as mademoiselle de l'enclo and she letter to the marquis de sévigné may therefore be consider as standard of the epistolary art upon the subject she treat as contain the most profound insight into the female heart where love be concerned and as form a study of the greatest value in everything that pertain to the relation between the sex there be a entire absence of mawkish sentimentality of effort to conceal the secret motive and desire of the heart beneath specious language and word of double meaning on the contrary they tear away from the heart the curtain of deceit artifice and treachery to expose the nature of the machinery behind the scene these letter must be read in the light of the opinion of the wisest philosopher of the seventeenth century upon she character inasmuch as the first use she -lrb- mademoiselle de l'enclo -rrb- make of she reason be to become enfranchise from vulgar error it be impossible to be further remove from the stupid mistake of those who under the name of passion elevate the sentiment of love to the height of a virtue ninon understand love to be what it really be a taste found upon the sens a blind sentiment which admit of no merit in the object which give it birth and which promise no recompense a caprice the duration of which do not depend upon we volition and which be subject to remorse and repentance letter of ninon de l'enclos to the marquis de sévigné i a hazardous undertaking what i marquis take charge of you education be you guide in the enterprise upon which you be about to enter you exact too much of my friendship for you you ought to be aware of the fact that when a woman have lose the freshness of she first youth and take a special interest in a young man everybody say she desire to make a worldling of he you know the malignity of this expression i do not care to expose myself to its application all the service i be willing to render you be to become you confidante you will tell I you trouble and i will tell you what be in my mind likewise aid you to know you own heart and that of woman it grieve I to say that whatever pleasure i may expect to find in this correspondence i can not conceal the difficulty i be liable to encounter the human heart which will be the subject of my letter present so many contrast that whoever lay it bare must fall into a flood of contradiction you think you have something stable in you grasp but find you have seize a shadow it be indeed a chameleon which view from different aspect present a variety of opposite color and even they be constantly shift you may expect to read many strange thing in what i shall say upon this subject i will however give you my idea though they may often seem strange however that shall be for you to determine i confess that i be not free from grave scruple of conscience foresee that i can scarcely be sincere without slander my own sex a little but at least you will know my view on the subject of love and particularly everything that relate to it and i have sufficient courage to talk to you frankly upon the subject i be to dine to-night with the marquis de la rochefoucauld madame de la sablière and la fontaine will also be guest if it please you to be one of we la fontaine will regale you with two new story which i be tell do not disparage he former one come marquis -- but again a scruple have i nothing to fear in the undertaking we contemplate love be so malicious and fickle still when i examine my heart i do not feel any apprehension for myself it be occupy elsewhere and the sentiment i possess toward you resemble love less than friendship if the worst should happen and i lose my head some day we shall know how to withdraw in the easiest possible manner we be go to take a course of moral together yes sir moral but do not be alarm at the mere word for there will be between we only the question of gallantry to discuss and that you know sway moral to so high a degree that it deserve to be the subject of a special study the very idea of such a project be to I infinitely risible however if i talk reason to you too often will you not grow weary this be my sole anxiety for you well know that i be a pitiless reasoner when i wish to be with any other heart than that which you misunderstand i could be a philosopher such as the world never know adieu i await you good pleasure ii why love be dangerous i assure you marquis i shall keep my word and on all occasion i shall speak the truth even though it be to my own detriment i have more stability in my disposition than you imagine and i fear exceedingly that the result of we intercourse may sometimes lead you to think that i carry this virtue into severity but you must remember that i have only the external appearance of a woman and that in mind and heart i be a man here be the method that i wish to follow with you as i ask only to acquire information for myself before communicate to you my idea my intention be to propound they to the excellent man with whom we sup yesterday it be true that he have none too good a opinion of poor humanity he believe neither in virtue nor in spiritual thing but this inflexibility mitigate by my indulgence for human frailty will give you i believe the kind and the quantity of philosophy which be require in all intercourse with woman let we come to the gist of you letter since you entrance into the world it have offer you nothing you say of what you have imagine you would find there disgust and weariness follow you everywhere you seek solitude and as soon as you be enjoy it it weary you in a word you do not know to what cause to attribute the restlessness which torment you i be go to save you the trouble i be for my burden be to speak my thought on everything that may perplex you and i do not know but you will often ask I question as embarrassing for I to answer as they may have be for you to ask the uneasiness which you experience be cause only by the void in you heart you heart be without love and it be try to make you comprehend its want you have really what one call the need of loving yes marquis nature in form we give we a allowance of sentiment which must expend themselves upon some object you age be the proper period for the agitation of love as long as this sentiment do not fill you heart something will always be want the restlessness of which you complain will never cease in a word love be the nourishment of the heart as food be of the body to love be to fulfill the desire of nature to satisfy a need but if possible manage it so that it will not become a passion to protect you from this misfortune i could almost be tempt to disprove the counsel give you to prefer to the company of woman capable of inspiring esteem rather than love the intercourse of those who pride themselves on be amusing rather than sedate and prim at you age be unable to think of enter into a serious engagement it be not necessary to find a friend in a woman one should seek to find only a amiable mistress the intercourse with woman of lofty principle or those whom the ravages of time force into put themselves forward only by virtue of great quality be excellent for a man who like themselves be on life 's decline for you these woman would be too good company if i dare so express myself riches be necessary to we only in proportion to we want and what you would better do i think be to frequent the society of those who combine with agreeable figure gentleness in conversation cheerfulness in disposition a taste for the pleasure of society and strong enough not to be frighten by one affair of the heart in the eye of a man of reason they appear too frivolous you will say : but do you think they should be judge with so much severity be persuade marquis that if unfortunately they should acquire more firmness of character they and you would lose much by it you require in woman stability of character well do you not find it in a friend -- shall i tell you what be in my mind it be not we virtue you need but we playfulness and we weakness the love which you could feel for a woman who would be estimable in every respect would become too dangerous for you until you can contemplate a contract of marriage you should seek only to amuse yourself with those who be beautiful a pass taste alone should attach you to one of they : be careful not to plunge in too deep with she there can nothing result but a bad end if you do not reflect more profoundly than the greater part of young people i should talk to you in a entirely different tone but i perceive that you be ready to give to excess a contrary meaning to they ridiculous frivolity it be only necessary then to attach yourself to a woman who like a agreeable child might amuse you with pleasant folly light caprice and all those pretty fault which make the charm of a gallant intercourse do you wish I to tell you what make love dangerous it be the sublime view that one sometimes take of it but the exact truth be it be only a blind instinct which one must know how to appreciate : a appetite which you have for one object in preference to another without be able to give the reason for you taste consider as a friendly intimacy when reason preside it be not a passion it be no longer love it be in truth a warm hearted esteem but tranquil incapable of draw you away from any fixed position if walk in the footstep of we ancient hero of romance you aim at great sentiment you will see that this pretended heroism make of love only a sad and sometimes fatal folly it be a veritable fanaticism but if you disengage it from all that opinion make it it will soon be you happiness and pleasure believe I if it be reason or enthusiasm which form affair of the heart love would become insipid or a frenzy the only means of avoid these two extreme be to follow the path i have indicate you need only to be amuse and you will find amusement only among the woman i mention to you as capable of it you heart wish occupation they be make to fill it try my recipe and you will find it good -- i make you a fair promise and it seem to I i be keep my word with you exactly adieu i have just receive a charming letter from m de saint-evremond and i must answer it i wish at the same time to propose to he the idea which i have communicate to you and i shall be very much mistaken if he do not approve of they to-morrow i shall have the abbé de châteauneuf and perhaps molière we shall read again the tartuffe in which some change should be make take notice marquis that those who do not conform to all i have just tell you have a little of the quality of that character iii why love grow cold in despite of everything i may say to you you still stick to you first sentiment you wish a respectable person for a mistress and one who can at the same time be you friend these sentiment would undoubtedly merit commendation if in reality they could bring you the happiness you expect they to but experience teach you that all those great expectation be pure illusion be serious quality the only question in pastime of the heart i might be tempt to believe that romance have impaired you mental power poor marquis he have allow himself to become fascinate by the sublime talk common in conversation but my dear child what do you mean to do with these chimera of reason i willingly tell you marquis : it be very fine coin but it be a pity that it can not enter into commercial transaction when you wish to begin housekeeping look for a reliable woman full of virtue and lofty principle all this be become to the dignity of the marriage tie i intend to say to its gravity but at present as you require nothing but a love affair beware of be serious and believe what i tell you i know you want better than you yourself know they man usually say that they seek essential quality in those they love blind fool that they be how they would complain could they find they what would they gain by be deify they need only amusement a mistress as reasonable as you require would be a wife for whom you would have a infinite respect i admit but not a particle of ardor a woman estimable in all respects be too subdue humiliate you too much for you to love she long force to esteem she and even sometimes to admire she you can not excuse yourself for cease to love she so many virtue be a reproach too discreet too tiresome a critic of we eccentricity not to arouse you pride at last and when that be humble farewell to love make a thorough analysis of you sentiment examine well you conscience and you will see that i speak the truth i have but a moment leave to say adieu iv the spice of love do you know marquis that you will end by put I in a temper heaven how very stupid you be sometimes i see it in you letter you have not understand I at all take heed i do not say that you should take for a mistress a despicable object that be not at all my idea but i say that in reality you need only a love affair and that to make it pleasant you should not attach yourself exclusively to substantial quality i repeat it when in love man need only to be amuse and i believe on this subject i be a authority trace of temper and caprice a senseless quarrel all this have more effect upon woman and retain they affection more than all the reason imaginable more than steadiness of character someone whom you esteem for the justice and strength of he idea say one day at my house that caprice in woman be too closely ally to beauty to be a antidote i oppose this opinion with so much animation that it could readily be see that the contrary maxim be my sentiment and i be in truth well persuade that caprice be not close to beauty except to animate its charm in order to make they more attractive to serve as a goad and to flavor they there be no colder sentiment and none which endure less than admiration one easily become accustomed to see the same feature however regular they may be and when a little malignity do not give they life or action they very regularity soon destroy the sentiment they excite a cloud of temper even can give to a beautiful countenance the necessary variety to prevent the weariness of see it always in the same state in a word woe to the woman of too monotonous a temperament she monotony satiate and disgust she be always the same statue with she a man be always right she be so good so gentle that she take away from people the privilege of quarrel with she and this be often such a great pleasure put in she place a vivacious woman capricious decide to a certain limit however and thing assume a different aspect the lover will find in the same person the pleasure of variety temper be the salt the quality which prevent it from become stale restlessness jealousy quarrel make friend again spitefulness all be the food of love enchanting variety which fill which occupy a sensitive heart much more deliciously than the regularity of behavior and the tiresome monotony which be call good disposition i know how you man must be govern a caprice put you in a uncertainty which you have as much trouble and grief in dispel as though it be a victory obtain over a new object roughness make you hold you breath you do not stop dispute but neither do you cease to conquer and to be conquer in vain do reason sigh you can not comprehend how such a imp manage to subjugate you so tyrannically everything tell you that the idol of you heart be a collection of caprice and folly but she be a spoil child whom you can not help but love the effort which reflection cause you to make to loosen they serve only to forge still tighter you chain for love be never so strong as when you believe it ready to break away in the heat of a quarrel it love it storm with it everything be convulsive would you reduce it to rule it languish it expire in a word this be what i want to say do not take for a mistress a woman who have only reliable quality but one who be sometimes dominate by temper and silence reason otherwise i shall say that it be not a love affair you want but to set up housekeeping v love and temper oh i agree with you marqui a woman who have only temper and caprice be very thorny for a acquaintance and in the end only repel i agree again that these irregularity must make of love a never end quarrel a continual storm therefore it be not for a person of this character that i advise you to form a attachment you always go beyond my idea i only depict to you in my last letter a amiable woman one who become still more so by a shade of diversity and you speak only of a unpleasant woman who have nothing but ungracious thing to say how we have drift away from the point when i speak of temper i only mean the kind which give a stronger relish anxiety and a little jealousy : that in a word which spring from love alone and not from natural brutality that roughness which one ordinarily call bad temper when it be love which make a woman rough when that alone be the cause of she liveliness what sort can the lover be who have so little delicacy as to complain of it do not these error prove the violence of passion for myself i have always think that he who know how to keep himself within proper bound be moderately amorous can one be so in effect without allow himself to be goad by the fire of a devour impetuosity without experience all the revolution which it necessarily occasion no undoubtedly well who can see all these disturbance in a beloved object without a secret pleasure while complain of its injustice and its transport one feel no less deliciously at heart that he be love and with passion and that these same aggravation be most convincing proof that it be voluntary there marquis be what constitute the secret charm of the trouble which lover sometimes suffer of the tear they shed but if you be go to believe that i wish to tell you that a woman of bad temper capricious can make you happy undeceive yourself i say and i shall always persist in my idea that diversity be necessary caprice bickering in a gallant intercourse to drive away weariness and to perpetuate the strength of it but consider that these spice do not produce that effect except when love itself be the source if temper be bear of a natural brusqueness or of a restless envious unjust disposition i be the first one to say that such a woman will become hateful she will be the cause of disheartening quarrel a connection of the heart become then a veritable torment from which it be desirable to free oneself as quickly as possible vi certain maxim concern love you think then marqui that you have bring up a invincible argument when you tell I that one be not the master of he own heart in dispose of it where he wish and that consequently you be not at liberty to choose the object of you attachment moral of the opera abandon this commonplace to woman who expect in say so to justify they weakness it be very necessary that they should have something to which to cling : like the gentleman of whom we friend montaigne speak who when the gout attack he would have be very angry if he have not be able to say : curse ham they say it be a sympathetic stroke that be too strong for I be anyone master of he heart he be no longer permit to reply when such good reason be give they have even so well sanction these maxim that they wish to attract everyone to they arm in order to try to overcome they but these same maxim find so much approbation only because everyone be interested in have they receive no one suspect that such excuse far from justify caprice may be a confession that one do not wish to correct they for myself i take the liberty of be of a different opinion from the multitude it be enough for I that it be not impossible to conquer one 's inclination to condemn all those who be unreasonable or dishonorable dear I have we not see woman succeed in destroy in they heart a weakness which have take they by surprise as soon as they have discover that the object of they affection be unworthy of they how often have they stifle the most tender affection and sacrifice it to the conventionality of a establishment rest time absence be remedy which passion however ardent one may have suppose it can never resist insensibly it weaken and die all at once i know that to withdraw honorably from such a liaison require all the strength of reason i comprehend still more that the difficulty you imagine stand in the way of maintain a victory do not leave you enough courage to undertake it so that although i may say that there be no invincible inclination in the speculation i will admit that there be few of they to be vanquish by practice and it happen so only because one do not like to attempt without success however that may be on the whole i imagine that there be here only a question of gallantry it would be folly to put you to the torture in order to destroy the inclination which have seize upon you for a woman more or less amiable but also because you be not smite with anyone i persist in say that i be right in describe to you the character which i believe would be the most capable of make you happy it be without doubt to be desire that delicate sentiment real merit should have more power over we heart and that they might be able to occupy they and find a permanent place there forever but experience prove that this be not so i do not reason from what you should be but from what you really be my intention be to give you a knowledge of the heart such as it be and not what it ought to be i be the first one to regret the depravity of you taste however indulgent i may be to you caprice but not be able to reform the vice of the heart i would at least teach you to draw out of they whatever good you can not be able to render you wise i try to make you happy it be a old saying : to wish to destroy the passion would be to undertake we annihilation it be only necessary to regulate they they be in we hand like the poison in a pharmacy compound by a skillful chemist they become beneficent remedy vii woman expect a quid pro quo from man oh who doubt marquis that it may be only by essential quality that you can succeed in please woman it be simply a question of know what meaning you attach to this expression do you call essential quality worth firmness of character precision of judgment extent of learn prudence discretion how can i tell the number of virtue which often embarrass you more than they make you happy we mind be not in accord upon this matter reserve all the quality i have specify for the intercourse you be oblige to have with man they be quite proper under such circumstance but when it come to gallantry you will have to change all such virtue for a equal number of charming trait those that captivate it be the only coin that pass current in this country it be the only merit and you must be on you guard against call it spurious money it may be that true merit consist less in real perfection than in that which the world require it be far more advantageous to possess the quality agreeable to those whom we desire to please than to have those we believe to be estimable in a word we must imitate the moral and even the caprice of those with whom we associate if we expect to live in peace with they what be the destiny of woman what be they rôle on earth it be to please now a charming figure personal grace in a word all the amiable and brilliant quality be the only means of succeed in that role woman possess they to a superlative degree and it be in these quality that they wish man to resemble they it will be vain for you to accuse they of frivolity for they be play the beauty rôle since they be destine to make you happy be it not indeed due to the charm of we companionship to the gentleness of we manners that you owe you most satisfying pleasure you social virtue in fact you whole happiness have some good faith in this matter be it possible for the science of themselves the love of glory valor nay even that friendship of which you boast so much to make you perfectly happy the pleasure you draw from any of they can it be keen enough to make you feel happy certainly not none of they have the power to relieve you from a wearisome monotony which crush you and make you a object of pity it be woman who have take upon themselves to dissipate these mortal languor by the vivacious gayety they inject into they society by the charm they know so well how to lavish where they will prove effectual a reckless joy a agreeable delirium a delicious intoxication be alone capable of awaken you attention and make you understand that you be really happy for marquis there be a vast difference between merely enjoy happiness and relish the sensation of enjoy it the possession of necessary thing do not make a man comfortable it be the superfluous which make he rich and which make he feel that he be rich it be not because you possess superior quality that you be a pleasant companion it may be a real defect which be essential to you to be receive with open arm you must be agreeable amusing necessary to the pleasure of other i warn you that you can not succeed in any other manner particularly with woman tell I what would you have I do with you learn the geometry of you mind with the precision of you memory etc if you have only such advantage marquis if you have no charming accomplishment to offset you crudity -- i can vouch for they opinion -- far from please woman you will seem to they like a critic of whom they will be afraid and you will place they under so much constraint that the enjoyment they might have permit themselves in you society will be banish why indeed try to be amiable toward a man who be a source of anxiety to you by he nonchalance who do not unbosom himself woman be not at they ease except with those who take chance with they and enter into they spirit in a word too much circumspection give other a chill like that feel by a man who go out of a warm room into a cold wind i intend to say that habitual reserve lock the door of the heart of those who associate with we they have no room to expand you must also bear this in mind marquis that in case of gallantry you first advance must be make under the most favorable circumstance you must have read somewhere that one please more by agreeable fault than by essential quality great virtue be like piece of gold of which one make less use than of ordinary currency this idea call to my mind those people who in place of we kind of money use shell as they medium of exchange well do you imagine that these people be not so rich as we with all the treasure of the new world we might at first blush take this sort of wealth as actual poverty but we should be quickly undeceived upon reflection for metal have no value except in opinion we gold would be false money to those people now the quality you call essential be not worth any more in case of gallantry where only pebble be sufficient what matter the conventional mark provide there be commerce now this be my conclusion : if it be true as you can not doubt that you ought not to expect happiness except from a interchange of agreeable quality in woman you may be sure that you will never please they unless you possess advantage similar to theirs i stick to the point you man be constantly boast about you science you firmness etc but tell I how weary would you not be how disgusted even with life if always logical you be condemn to be forever learn and sordid to live only in the company of philosopher i know you you would soon become weary of admiration for you good quality and the way you be make you would rather do without virtue than pleasure do not amuse yourself then by hold yourself out as a man with great quality in the sense you consider they true merit be that which be esteem by those we aim to please gallantry have its own law and marquis amiable man be the sage of this world viii the necessity for love and its primitive cause this time marqui you have not far to go you hour have come the diagnosis you give I of you condition tell I that you be in love the young widow you mention be certainly capable of rouse a inspiration in you heart the chevalier de -- have give I a very favorable portrait of she but scarcely do you begin to feel a few scruple than you turn into a crime the advice i have be give you the disorder which love bring to the soul and the other evil which follow in its train appear to you so you say more to be fear than the pleasure it give be to be desire it be true that some very good people be of the opinion that the sorrow of love be about equal to its pleasure but without enter upon a tiresome discussion to ascertain whether they be right or wrong if you would have my opinion here it be : love be a passion which be neither good nor bad of itself it be only those who be affect by it that determine whether it be good or bad all that i shall say in its favor be that it give we a advantage with which any of the discomfort of life can not enter into comparison it drag we out of the rut it stir we up and it be love which satisfy one of we most press want i think i have already tell you that we heart be make for emotion to excite it therefore be to satisfy a demand of nature what would vigorous youth be without love a long illness : it would not be existence it would be vegetate love be to we heart what wind be to the sea they grow into tempest true they be sometimes even the cause of shipwreck but the wind render the sea navigable they constant agitation of its surface be the cause of its preservation and if they be often dangerous it be for the pilot to know how to navigate in safety but i have wander from my text and return to it though i shock you sensitive delicacy by my frank speaking i shall add that besides the need of have we emotion stir we have in connection with they a physical machinery which be the primitive cause and necessity of love perhaps it be not too modest for a woman to use such language to you but you will understand that i would not talk to every one so plainly we be not engage in what may be call nice conversation we be philosophize if my discussion seem to you to be sometimes too analytical for a woman remember what i tell you in my last letter from the time i be first able to reason i make up my mind to investigate and ascertain which of the two sex be the more favored i see that man be not at all stint in the distribution of the role to be play and i therefore become a man if i be you i would not investigate whether it be a good or a bad thing to fall in love i would prefer to have you ask whether it be good or bad to be thirsty or that it be forbid to give one a drink because there be man who become intoxicated inasmuch as you be not at liberty to divest yourself of a appetite belong to the mechanical part of you nature as could we ancient romancer do not ruin yourself by speculate and meditate on the greater or less advantage in loving take love as i have advise you to take it only do not let it be to you a passion only a amusement i understand what you be go to say : you be go to overwhelm I again with you great principle and tell I that a man have not sufficient control over he feeling to stop when he would pooh i regard those who talk in that fashion in the same light as the man who believe he be in honor bind to show great sorrow on the occasion of a loss or accident which he friend consider great but which be nothing to he such a man feel less than any one the need of consolation but he find pleasure in show he tear he rejoice to know that he possess a heart capable of excessive emotion and this soften it still more he feed it with sorrow he make a idol of it and offer it incense so often that he acquire the habit all such admirer of great and noble sentiment spoil by romance or by prude make it a point of honor to spiritualize they passion by force of delicate treatment they become all the more infatuate with it as they deem it to be they own work and they fear nothing so much as the shame of return to common sense and resume they manhood let we take good care marquis not to make ourselves ridiculous in this way this fashion of strain we intelligence be nothing more in the age in which we be live than play the part of fool in former time people take it into they head that love should be something grave they consider it a serious matter and esteem it only in proportion to its dignity imagine exacting dignity from a child away would go all its grace and its youth would soon become convert into old age how i pity we good ancestor what with they be a mortal weariness a melancholy frenzy be with we a gay folly a delicious delirium fool that they be they prefer the horror of desert and rock to the pleasure of a garden strew with flower what prejudice the habit of reflection have bring upon we the proof that great sentiment be nothing but chimera of pride and prejudice be that in we day we no longer witness that taste for ancient mystic gallantry no more of those old fashion gigantic passion ridicule the most firmly establish opinion i will go further deride the feeling that be believe to be the most natural and soon both will disappear and man will stand amaze to see that idea for which they possess a sort of idolatry be in reality nothing but trifle which pass away like the ever change fashion you will understand then marqui that it be not necessary to acquire the habit of deify the fancy you entertain for the countess you will know at last that love to be worthy of the name and to make we happy far from be treat as a serious affair should be foster lightly and above all with gayety nothing can make you understand more clearly the truth of what i be tell you than the result of you adventure for i believe the countess to be the last woman in the world to harbor a sorrowful passion you with you high sentiment will give she the blues mark what i tell you my indisposition continue and i would feel like tell you that i never go out during the day but would not that be give you a rendezvous if however you should come and give I you opinion of the bajazet of racine you would be very kind they say that the champmesle have surpass herself i have read over this letter marquis and the lecture it contain put I out of humor with you i recognize the fact that truth be a contagious disease judge how much of it go into love since you bestow it even upon those who aim to undeceive you it be quite strange that in order to prove that love should be treat with levity it be necessary to assume a serious tone ix love be a natural inclination so you have take what i say about love in my last letter as a crime i have blaspheme love i have degrade it by call it a necessity you have such noble thought marqui what be pass in you mind be proof of it you can not realize or imagine anything less than the pure and delicate sentiment which fill you heart to see the countess hold sweet discourse with she listen to the sound of she gentle voice dance attendance upon she that be the height of you desire it be you supreme happiness far from you be those vulgar sentiment which i unworthily substitute for you sublime metaphysics sentiment create for worldly soul occupy solely with sensual pleasure what a mistake i make could i imagine that the countess be a woman to be capture by motive so little worthy of she to raise the suspicion in she mind that you possess such view would it not inevitably expose you to she hate she scorn etc be not these the inconvenience which my morality lead you to apprehend my poor marquis you be yourself deceive by you misunderstanding of the real cause of you sentiment give I all you attention : i wish to draw you away from error but in a manner that will best accord with the importance of what i be about to say i mount the tribune i feel the presence of the god who inspire I i rub my forehead with the air of a person who meditate on profound truth and who be go to utter great thought i be go to reason accord to rule man i know not by what caprice have attach shame to the indulgence of that reciprocal inclination which nature have bestow upon both sex they know however that they could not entirely stifle its voice so what do they do to relieve themselves of they embarrassment they attempt to substitute the mere shell of a affection wholly spiritual for the humiliating necessity of appear in good faith to satisfy a natural want insensibly they have grow accustomed to meddle with a thousand little sublime nothing connect with it and as if that be not enough they have at last succeed in establish the belief that all these frivolous accessory the work of a heated imagination constitute the essence of the inclination there you be love erect into a fine virtue at least they have give it the appearance of a virtue but let we break through this prestige and cite a example at the beginning of they intercourse lover fancy themselves inspire by the noblest and most delicate sentiment they exhaust they ingenuity exaggeration the enthusiasm of the most exquisite metaphysics they be intoxicate for a time with the idea that they love be a superior article but let we follow they in they liaison : nature quickly recover she rights and re-assume she sway soon vanity gorge with the display of a exaggerated purpose leave the heart at liberty to feel and express its sentiment without restraint and dissatisfied with the pleasure of love the day come when these people be very much surprised to find themselves after have travel around a long circuit at the very point where a peasant act accord to nature would have begin and thereby hang a tale a certain honesta to give she a fictitious name in whose presence i be one day uphold the theory i have just be maintain become furious what she exclaim in a transport of indignation do you pretend madame that a virtuous person one who possess only honest intention such as marriage be actuate by such vulgar motive you would believe in that case that i for instance who ` par vertu ' have be marry three time and who to subdue my husband have never wish to have a separate apartment that i only act thus to procure what you call pleasure truly you would be very much mistaken indeed never have i refuse to fulfill the duty of my state but i assure you that the greater part of the time i yield to they only through complaisance or as a distraction always with regret at the importunity of man we love man and marry they because they have certain quality of mind and heart and no woman with the exception of those perhaps whom i do not care to name even attach any importance to other advantage -- i interrupt she and more through malice than good taste carry the argument to its logical conclusion i make she see that what she say be a new proof of my contention : the reason you draw from the legitimate view of marriage say i prove that those who hold they fend to the same end as two ordinary lover perhaps even in better faith with this difference only that they wish a extra ceremony attach to it this shot rouse the indignation of my adversary you join impiety to libertinage say she move away from I i take the liberty of make some investigation and would you believe it marqui this prude so refine have such frequent ` distraction ' with she three husband who be all young and vigorous that she bury they in a very short time come now marqui retract you error abandon you chimera reserve delicacy of sentiment for friendship accept love for what it be the more dignity you give it the more dangerous you make it the more sublime the idea you form of it the less correct it be believe de la rochefoucauld a man who know the human heart well : if you expect to love a woman for love of herself say he you will be much mistaken x the sensation of love form a large part of a woman 's nature the commentary the countess have be make you about she virtue and the refinement she expect in a lover have certainly alarm you you think she will always be as severe as she now appear to you all i have tell you do not reassure you you even esteem it a favor to I that you stop with doubt my principle if you dare you would condemn they entirely when you talk to I in that fashion i feel at liberty to say that i believe you it be not you fault if you do not see clearly into you own affair but in proportion as you advance the cloud will disappear and you will perceive with surprise the truth of what i have be tell you the more cold blood you be or at least as long as passion have not yet reach that degree of boldness its progress will ultimately lead you to the mere hope of the smallest favor be a crime you tremble at the most innocent caress at first you ask for nothing or for so slight a favor that a woman conscientiously believe herself oblige to grant it delighted with you on account of you modesty to obtain this slight favor you protest never to ask another and yet even while make you protestation you be prepare to exact more she become accustomed to it and permit further trifling which seem to be of so little importance that she would endure it from any other man if she be on the slightest term of intimacy with he but to judge from the result what appear to be of so little consequence on one day when compare with the favor obtain the day before become very considerable when compare with that obtain on the first day a woman re-assure by you discretion do not perceive that she frailty be be graduate upon a certain scale she be so much mistress of herself and the little thing which be at first exact appear to she to be so much within she power of refusal that she expect to possess the same strength when something of a graver character be propose to she it be just this way : she flatter herself that she power of resistance will increase in the same proportion with the importance of the favor she will be call upon to grant she rely so entirely upon she virtue that she challenge danger by court it she experiment with she power of resistance she wish to see how far the grant of a few unimportant favor can lead she here be where she be imprudent for by she very rashness she accustom she imagination to contemplate suggestion which be the final cause of she seduction she travel a long way on the road without perceive that she have move a single step if upon look back along the route she be surprise at have yield so much she lover will be no less surprised at have obtain so much but i go still further i be persuade that love be not always necessary to bring about the downfall of a woman i know a woman who although amiable in she manner with everybody have never be suspect of any affair of the heart fifteen year of married life have not diminish she tenderness for she husband and they happy union could be cite as a example to imitate one day at she country place she friend amuse themselves so late that they be constrain to remain at she house all night in the morning she servant happen to be occupy with she guest she be alone in she apartment engage in make she toilet a man whom she know quite well but who be without social position drop in for a short visit and to pass the compliment of the day some perplexity in she toilette induce he to offer he service the neglige dress she wear naturally give he a opportunity to compliment she upon she undiminished charm of course she protest but laughingly claim they be unmerited however one thing follow another they become a trifle sentimental a few familiarity which they do not at first deem of any consequence develop into something more decide until finally unable to resist they be both overcome the woman be culpable for she regard he advance in the nature of a joke and let they run on what be they embarrassment after such a slip they have never since be able to understand how they could have venture so far without have have the slightest intention of so do i be tempt to exclaim here : oh you mortal who place too much reliance upon you virtue tremble at this example whatever may be you strength there be unfortunately moment when the most virtuous be the most feeble the reason for this strange phenomenon be that nature be always on the watch always aim to attain she end the desire for love be in a woman a large part of she nature she virtue be nothing but a piece of patchwork the homily of you estimable countess may be actually sincere although in such case a woman always exaggerate but she delude herself if she expect to maintain to the end sentiment so severe and so delicate fix this fact well in you mind marqui that these female metaphysician be not different in they nature from other woman they exterior be more impose they moral more austere but inquire into they act and you will discover that they heart affair always finish the same as those of woman less refine they be a species of the overnice form a class of they own as i tell queen christine of sweden one day : they be the jansenist of love -lrb- puritan -rrb- you should be on you guard marqui against everything woman have to say on the chapter of gallantry all the fine system of which they make such a pompous display be nothing but vain illusion which they utilize to astonish those who be easily deceive in the eye of a clear sighted man all this rubbish of stilted phrase be but a parade at which he mock and which do not prevent he from penetrate they real sentiment the evil they speak of love the resistance they oppose to it the little taste they pretend for its pleasure the measure they take against it the fear they have of it all that spring from love itself they very manner render it homage indicate that they harbor the thought of it love assume a thousand different form in they mind like pride it live and flourish upon its own defeat it be never overthrow that it do not spring up again with renew force what a letter good heaven to justify its length would be to lengthen it still more xi the distinction between love and friendship i be delighted with you letter marquis do you know why because it give I speak proof of the truth of what i have be preach to you these latter day ah for once you have forget all you metaphysics you picture to I the charm of the countess with a complacency which demonstrate that you sentiment be not altogether so high fly as you would have I believe and as you think down in you heart tell I frankly : if you love be not the work of the sens would you take so much pleasure in consider that form those eye which enchant you that mouth which you describe to I in such glowing color if the quality of heart and mind alone seduce you a woman of fifty be worth still more in that respect than the countess you see such a one every day it be she mother why not become enamored of she instead why neglect a hundred woman of she age of she plainness and of she merit who make advance to you and who would enact the same role with you that you play with the countess why do you desire with so much passion to be distinguish by she from other man why be you uneasy when she show they the least courtesy do she esteem for they diminish that which she pretend for you be rivalry and jealousy recognize in metaphysics i believe not i have friend and i do not observe such thing in they i feel none in my own heart when they love other woman friendship be a sentiment which have nothing to do with the sens the soul alone receive the impression of it and the soul lose nothing of its value by give itself up to several at the same time compare friendship with love and you will perceive the difference between a desire which govern a friend and that which offer itself to a lover you will confess that at heart i be not so unreasonable as you at first thought and that it might be very well if it should happen that in love you might have a soul as worldly as that of a good many people whom it please you to accuse of very little refinement i do not wish however to bring man alone to trial i be frank and i be quite sure that if woman would be honest they would soon confess that they be not a bit more refined than man indeed if they see in love only the pleasure of the soul if they hope to please only by they mental accomplishment and they good character honestly now would they apply themselves with such particular care to please by the charm of they person what be a beautiful skin to the soul a elegant figure a well shaped arm what contradiction between they real sentiment and those they exhibit on parade look at they and you will be convince that they have no intention of make themselves value except by they sensual attraction and that they count everything else as nothing listen to they : you will be tempt to believe that it be not worldly thing which they consider the least i think i deserve credit for try to dispel you error in this respect and ought i not to expect everything from the care they will take to undeceive you themselves perhaps they will succeed only too easily in express sentiment entirely contrary to those you have hear to-day from I i be due at mademoiselle de raymond 's this evening to hear the two camus and ytier who be go to sing mesdame de la sablière de salin and de monsoreau will also be there would you miss such a fine company xii a man in love be a amusing spectacle you take thing too much to heart marquis already two night that you have not sleep oh it be true love there be no mistaking that you have make you eye speak you yourself have speak quite plainly and not the slightest notice have be take of you condition such behavior call for revenge be it possible that after eight whole day of devoted attention she have not give you the least hope such a thing can not be easily imagine such a long resistance begin to pass beyond probability the countess be a heroine of the last century but if you be begin to lose patience you can imagine the length of time you would have have to suffer if you have continue to proclaim grand and noble sentiment you have already accomplish more in eight day than the late celadon could in eight month however to speak seriously be you complaint just you call the countess ungrateful insensible disdainful etc but by what right do you talk thus will you never believe what i have tell you a hundred time love be a veritable caprice involuntary even in one who experience its pang why should you say that the beloved object be bind to recompense a blind sentiment acquire without she connivance you be very queer you man you consider yourselve offend because a woman do not respond with eagerness to the languish look you deign to cast upon she you revolt pride immediately accuse she of injustice as if it be she fault that you head be turn as if she be oblige at a certain stage to be seize with the same disease as you tell I this : be the countess responsible if she be not afflict with the same delirium as soon as you begin to rave cease then to accuse she and to complain and to try to communicate you malady to she i know you you be seductive enough perhaps she will feel too soon for she peace of mind sentiment commensurate with you desire i believe she have in she everything to subjugate you and to inspire you with the taste i hope will be for you happiness but so far i do not think she be susceptible of a very serious attachment vivacious inconsistent positive decide she can not fail to give you plenty of exercise a attentive and caress woman would weary you you must be handle in a military fashion if you be to be amuse and retain as soon as the mistress assume the rôle of lover love begin to weaken it do more it rise like a tyrant and end in disdain which lead directly to disgust and inconstancy have you find perchance everything you require in the little mistress who be the cause of you dolorous martyrdom poor marquis what storm will blow over you what quarrel i foresee how many vexation how many threat to leave she but do not forget this : so much emotion will become you punishment if you treat love after the manner of a hero of romance and you will meet a fate entirely the contrary if you treat it like a reasonable man but ought i to continue to write you the moment you employ to read my letter will be so many steal from love great heaven how i should like to be a witness of you situation indeed for a sober-minded person be there a spectacle more amusing than the contortion of a man in love xiii vanity be a fertile soil for love you be not satisfied then marqui with what i so cavalierly say about you condition you wish I by all means to consider you adventure as a serious thing but i shall take good care not to do so do you not see that my way of treat you be consistent with my principle i speak lightly of a thing i believe to be frivolous or simply amusing when it come to a affair on which depend a lasting happiness you will see I take on a appropriate tone i do not want to pity you because it depend upon yourself whether you be to be pity or not by a trick of you imagination what now appear to be a pain to you may become a pleasure to succeed make use of my recipe and you will find it good but to refer to the second paragraph of you letter : you say you be all the more surprised at the coldness of the countess as you do not think it in earnest accord to what you say you conjecture be base on the indiscretion of she friend the good she speak about you to they be the main cause of you take a fancy to she i know man by this trait the smallest word that escape a woman 's lip lead they into the belief that she have design upon they everything have some reference to they merit they vanity seize upon everything and they turn everything into profit to examine they closely nearly all of they love through gratitude and on this point woman be not any more reasonable so that gallantry be a intercourse in which we want the other to go along with we always want to be they debtor and you know pride be much more active in pay back than in give if two lover would mutually explain without reservation the beginning and progress of they passion what confidence would they not exchange elise to whom valère utter a few general compliment respond perhaps without intend to in a more affectionate manner than be usual in the case of such insipidity it be enough valère be carry away with the idea that from a gallant he must become a lover the fire be insensibly kindle on both side finally it burst forth and there you be a bud passion if you should charge elise with have make the first advance nothing would appear more unjust to she and yet nothing could be more true i conclude from this that to take love for what it really be it be less the work of what be call invincible sympathy than that of we vanity notice the birth of all love affair they begin by the mutual praise we bestow upon each other it have be say that it be folly which conduct love i should say that it be flattery and that it can not be introduce into the heart of a belle until after pay tribute to she vanity add to all this the general desire and inclination we have to be love and we be bravely deceive like those enthusiast who by force of imagination believe they can really see the image they conjure up in they mind we fancy that we can see in other the sentiment we desire to find there be careful then marqui not to let yourself be blind by a false notion the countess may have speak well of you with the sole object of do you justice without carry she intention any farther and be sure you be wrong when you suspect she of insincerity in you regard after all why should you not prefer to have she dissemble she sentiment toward you if you be the source of they inspiration be not woman in the right to hide carefully they sentiment from you and do not the bad use you make of the certainty of they love justify they in so do xiv worth and merit be not consider in love no marquis the curiosity of madame de sévigné have not offend I on the contrary i be very glad that she wish to see the letter you receive from I without doubt she think that if it be a question of gallantry it could only be to my profit she now know the contrary she will also know that i be not so frivolous as she imagine and i believe she just enough to form hereafter another idea of ninon than the one she have heretofore have of she for i be not ignorant of the fact that she do not speak of I much to my advantage but she injustice will never influence my friendship for you i be philosophic enough to console myself for not secure the commendation of people who judge I without know I whatever may happen i shall continue to talk to you with my ordinary frankness and i be sure that madame de sévigné in spite of she refined mind will at heart be more of my opinion than she care to show now i come to what relate to you well marqui after infinite care and trouble you think you have at last soften that stony heart i be glad of it but i laugh at you interpretation of the countess ' sentiment you share with all man a common error which it be necessary to remove however flattering it may be to you to foster it you believe every one of you that it be you worth alone that kindle passion in the heart of woman and that quality of heart and mind be the cause of the love they feel toward you what a mistake you only think so it be true because you pride find satisfaction in the thought but if you can do so without prejudice inquire into the motive that actuate you and you will soon perceive that you be labor under a delusion and that we deceive you that everything well consider you be the dupe of you vanity and of ours that the worth of the person loved be only a excuse which give a occasion for love and be not the real cause finally that all this sublime by-play which be parade on both side be a mere preliminary which enter into the desire to satisfy the need i first indicate to you as the prime exciting cause of this passion i tell you this be a hard and humiliating truth but it be none the less certain we woman enter the world with this necessity of loving undefined and if we take one man in preference to another let we say so honestly we yield less to the knowledge of merit than to a mechanical instinct which be nearly always blind for proof of this i need only refer to the foolish passion with which we sometimes become intoxicate for stranger or at least for man with whom we be not sufficiently acquaint to relieve we selection of they from the odium of imprudence from the beginning in which case if there be a mutual response well it be pure chance we be always form attachment without sufficient circumspection hence i be not wrong in compare love to a appetite which one sometimes feel for one kind of food rather than for another without be able to give the reason i be very cruel to thus dissipate the phantom of you self love but i be tell you the truth you be flatter by the love of a woman because you believe it imply the worthiness of the object love you do she too much honor : let we say rather that you have too good a opinion of yourself understand that it be not for yourself that we love you to speak with sincerity it be we own happiness we seek caprice interest vanity disposition the uneasiness that affect we heart when they be unoccupied these be the source of the great sentiment we wish to deify it be not great quality that affect we if they enter for anything into the reason which determine we in you favor it be not the heart which receive the impression it be vanity and the greater part of the thing in you which please we very often make you ridiculous or contemptible but what will you have we need a admirer who can entertain we with idea of we perfection we need a oblige person who will submit to we caprice we need a man chance present we with one rather than another we accept he but we do not choose he in a word you believe yourselve to be the object of we disinterested affection i repeat : you think woman love you for yourselve poor dupe you be only the instrument of they pleasure the sport of they caprice i must however do woman justice it be not that you be what i have just enumerate with they consent for the sentiment which i develop here be not well define in they mind on the contrary with the best faith in the world woman imagine themselves influence and actuate only by the grand idea which you vanity and theirs have nourish it would be a cry injustice to accuse they of deceit in this respect but without be aware of it they deceive themselves and you be equally deceive you see that i be reveal the secret of the good goddess judge of my friendship since at the expense of my own sex i labor to enlighten you the better you know woman the fewer folly they will lead you to commit xv the hidden motive of love really marqui i do not understand how you can meekly submit to the serious language i sometimes write you it seem as if i have no other aim in my letter than to sweep away you agreeable illusion and substitute mortifying truth i must however get rid of my mania for say deeply consider thing i know better than any one else that pleasant lie be more agreeable than the most reasonable conversation but my disposition break through everything in spite of I i feel a fit of philosophy upon I again to-day and i must ask you to prepare to endure the broadside of morality i be make ready to give you hereafter i promise you more gayety so now to answer you letter no i will not take back anything you may make war on I as much as it please you because of the bad opinion of my sex i express in my last letter be it my fault if i be furnish with disagreeable truth to utter besides do you not know marquis that the be on earth who think the most evil of woman be a woman i wish however very seriously to justify the idea to my manner of express which you have take a exception i be neither envious nor unjust because i happen to mention my own sex rather than yours you must not imagine that it be my intention to underrate woman i hope to make you understand that without be more culpable than man they be more dangerous because they be accustom more successfully to hide they sentiment in effect you will confess the object of you love sooner than they will acknowledge theirs however when they assure you that they affection for you have no other source than a knowledge of you merit and of you good quality i be persuade that they be sincere i do not even doubt that when they realize that they style of thought be become less refine they do everything in they power to hide the fact from themselves but the motive about which i have be tell you be in the bottom of they heart just the same they be none the less the true cause of the liking they have for you and whatever effort they may make to persuade themselves that the cause be wholly spiritual they desire change nothing in the nature of thing they hide this deformity with as much care as they would conceal tooth that might disfigure a otherwise perfect face in such case even when alone they would be afraid to open they mouth and so by force of habit in hide this defect from other as well as from themselves they succeed in forget all about it or in consider that it be not much of a defect i agree with you that you would lose too much if man and woman be to show themselves in they true color the world have agree to play a comedy and to show real natural sentiment would not be act it would be substitute the real character for the one it have be agree to feign let we then enjoy the enchantment without seek to know the cause of the charm which amuse and seduce we to anatomize love would be to enter upon its cure psyche lose it for have be too curious and i be tempt to believe that this fable be a lesson for those who wish to analyze pleasure i wish to make some correction in what i have say to you : if i tell you that man be wrong in pride themselves on they choice of a woman and they sentiment for she if i say that the motive which actuate they be nothing less than glorious for the man i desire to add that they be equally deceive if they imagine that the sentiment which they show with so much pompous display be always create by force of female charm or by a abide impression of they merit how often do it happen that those man who make advance with such a respectful air who display such delicate and refined sentiment so flattering to vanity who in a word seem to breathe only through they only for they and have no other desire than they happiness how often i repeat be those man who adorn themselves with such beautiful sentiment influence by reason entirely the contrary study penetrate these good soul and you will see in the heart of this one instead of a love so disinterested only desire in that one it will be only a scheme to share you fortune the glory of have obtain a woman of you rank in a third you will discover motive still more humiliating to you he will use you to rouse the jealousy of some woman he really love and he will cultivate you friendship merely to distinguish himself in she eye by reject you i can not tell you how many motive there be so many the human heart be a insolvable enigma it be a whimsical combination of all the known contrariety we think we know its workings we see they effect we ignore the cause if it express its sentiment sincerely even that sincerity be not reassuring perhaps its movement spring from cause entirely contrary to those we imagine we feel to be the real one but after all people have adopt the best plan that be to explain everything to they advantage and to compensate themselves in imagination for they real misery and accustom themselves as i think i have already say to deify all they sentiment inasmuch as everybody find in that the summit of he vanity nobody have ever think of reform the custom or of examine it to see whether it be a mistake adieu if you desire to come this evening you will find I with those whose gayety will compensate you for this serious discourse xvi how to be victorious in love be what you write I possible marquis what the countess continue obdurate the flippant manner in which she receive you attention reveal a indifference which grieve you i think i have guess the secret of the riddle i know you you be gay playful conceited even with woman as long as they do not impress you but with those who have make a impression upon you heart i have notice that you be timid this quality might affect a bourgeoise but you must attack the heart of a woman of the world with other weapon the countess know the way of the world believe I and leave to the celadon such thing as sublime talk beautiful sentiment let they spin out perfection i tell you on behalf of woman : there be not one of we who do not prefer a little rough handle to too much consideration man lose through blunder more heart than virtue save the more timidity a lover show with we the more it concern we pride to goad he on the more respect he have for we resistance the more respect we demand of he we would willingly say to you man : ah in pity 's name do not suppose we to be so very virtuous you be force we to have too much of it do not put so high a price upon you conquest do not treat we defeat as if it be something difficult accustom we imagination by degree to see you doubt we indifference when we see a lover although he may be persuade of we gratitude treat we with the consideration demand by we vanity we shall conclude without be aware of it that he will always be the same although sure of we inclination for he from that moment what confidence will he not inspire what flattering progress may he not make but if he notify we to be always on we guard then it be not we heart we shall defend it will not be a battle to preserve we virtue but we pride and that be the worst enemy to be conquer in woman what more be there to tell you we be continually struggle to hide the fact that we have permit ourselves to be love put a woman in a position to say that she have yield only to a species of violence or to surprise persuade she that you do not undervalue she and i will answer for she heart you must manage the countess as she character require she be lively and playful and by trifling folly you must lead she to love do not even let she see that she distinguish you from other man and be as playful as she be light hearted fix yourself in she heart without give she any warning of you intention she will love you without know it and some day she will be very much astonished at have make so much headway without really suspect it xvii woman understand the difference between real love and flirtation perhaps marqui you will think I still more cruel than the countess she be the cause of you anxiety it be true but i be the cause of something worse i feel a great desire to laugh at they oh i enter into you trouble seriously enough i can not do more and you embarrassment appear great to I really why risk a declaration of love to a woman who take a wicked pleasure in avoid it on every occasion now she appear affect and then again she be the most unmindful woman in the world in spite of all you do to please she she listen willingly and reply gaily to the gallant speech and bold conversation of a certain chevalier a professional coxcomb but to you she speak seriously and with a preoccupy air if you take on a tender and affectionate tone she reply flippantly or perhaps change the subject all this intimidate you trouble you and drive you to despair poor marquis -- and i answer you that all this be love true and beautiful the absence of mind which she affect with you the nonchalance she put on for a mask ought to make you feel at heart that she be far from be indifferent but you lack of boldness the consequence which she feel must follow such a passion as yours the interest which she already take in you condition all this intimidate the countess herself and it be you who raise obstacle in she path a little more boldness on you part would put you both at you ease do you remember what m de la rochefoucauld tell you lately : a reasonable man in love may act like a madman but he should not and can not act like a idiot besides when you compare you respect and esteem with the free and almost indecent manner of the chevalier when you draw from it the conclusion that she should prefer you to he you do not know how incorrectly you argue the chevalier be nothing but a gallant and what he say be not worth consider or at least appear so frivolity alone the habit of romance to all the pretty woman he find in he way make he talk love count for nothing or at least for very little in all he liaison like the butterfly he hover only a moment over each flower a amusing episode be he only object so much frivolity be not capable of alarming a woman she be delighted at the trifling danger she incur in listen to such a man the countess know very well how to appreciate the discourse of the chevalier and to say everything in a word she know he to be a man whose heart be wear out woman who to hear they talk go in more for metaphysics know admirably how to tell the difference between a lover of he class and a man like you but you will always be more formidable and more to be dread by you manner of make yourself feel you boast to I of you respectful esteem but i reply that it be nothing of the kind and the countess know it well nothing end with so little respect as a passion like yours quite different from the chevalier you require recognition preference acknowledgment even sacrifice the countess see all these pretension at a glance or at least if in the cloud which still envelop they she do not distinguish they clearly nature give she a presentiment of what the cost will be if she allow you the least opportunity to instruct she in a passion which she doubtless already share woman rarely inquire into the reason which impel they to give themselves up or to resist they do not even amuse themselves by try to understand or explain they but they have feeling and sentiment with they be correct it take the place of intelligence and reflection it be a sort of instinct which warn they in case of danger and which lead they aright perhaps as surely as do the most enlighten reason you beautiful adelaide wish to enjoy a incognito as long as she can this plan be very congenial to she real interest and yet i be fully persuade that it be not the work of reflection she see it only from the point of view of a passion outwardly constrain make stronger impression and still greater progress inwardly let it have a opportunity to take deep root and give to this fire she try to hide time to consume the heart in which you wish to confine it you must also admit marquis that you deceive yourself in two way in you calculation you think you respect the countess more than the chevalier do on the contrary you see that the gallant speech of the chevalier be without effect while you begrudge they to the heart of you beauty on the other hand you figure that she preoccupy air indifferent and inattentive manner be proof or forewarning of you unhappiness undeceive yourself there be no more certain proof of a passion than the effort make to hide it in a word when the countess treat you kindly whatever proof you may give she of you affection when she see you without alarm on the point of confess you love i tell you that she heart be catch she love you on my word by the way i forget to reply to that part of you letter concern myself yes marquis i constantly follow the method which i prescribe at the commencement of we correspondence there be few matter in my letter that i have not use as subject of conversation in my social reunion i rarely suggest idea of any importance to you without have take the opinion of my friend on they verity sometimes it be monsieur de la bruyère sometimes monsieur de saint-evremond whom i consult another time it will be monsieur l'abbé de châteauneuf you must admire my good faith marquis for i might claim the credit of the good i write you but i frankly avow that you owe it only to the people whom i receive at my house apropo of man of distinguished merit m de la rochefoucauld have just send I word that he would like to call on I i fix to-morrow and you might do well to be present but do not forget how much he love you adieu xviii when a woman be love she need not be tell of it i have be engage in some new reflection on the condition you be in marquis and on the embarrassment in which you continue after all why do you deem it necessary to make a formal declaration of love can it be because you have read about such thing in we old romance in which the proceedings in courtship be as solemn as those of the tribunal that would be too technical believe I let it alone as i tell you in my last letter the fire light will acquire greater force every day and you will see that without have say you love you will be farther advanced than if you be frighten by avowal which we father insist should worry the woman avowal absolutely useless in themselves and which always incumber a passion with several nebulous day they retard its progress bear this well in mind marquis : a woman be much better persuade that she be love by what she guess than by what she be tell act as if you have make the declaration which be cost you so much anxiety or imitate the chevalier take thing easy the way the countess conduct herself with he in you presence seem to be a law in you estimation with you circumspection and pretend respect you present the appearance of a man who meditate a important design of a man in a word who contemplate a wrong step you exterior be disquieting to a woman who know the consequence of a passion such as yours remember that as long as you let it appear that you be make preparation for a attack you will find she on the defensive have you ever hear of a skillful general who intend to surprise a citadel announce he design to the enemy upon whom the storm be to descend in love as in war do any one ever ask the victor whether he owe he success to force or skill he have conquer he receive the crown he desire be gratify he be happy follow he example and you will meet the same fate hide you progress do not disclose the extent of you design until it be no longer possible to oppose you success until the combat be over and the victory gain before you have declare war in a word imitate those warlike people whose design be not know except by the ravage country through which they have pass xix why a lover 's vow be untrustworthy at last marquis you be listen to dispassionately when you protest you love and swear by everything lover hold sacred that you will always love will you believe my prediction another time however you would be better treat if you be more reasonable so you be tell and limit you sentiment to simple friendship the name of lover assume by you be revolt to the countess you should never quarrel over quality when it be the same under any name and follow the advice madame de la sablière give you in the follow madrigal : bélise ne veut point d'amant mai voudrait un amus fidèle quus pour elle eût des soins et de l'empressement et qui même la trouvât belle amants qui soupirez pour elle sur ma parole tenez bon bélise de l'amour ne hait que le nom -lrb- bélise for a lover sigh not but she want a faithful friend who would cuddle she up and care for she lot and even she beauty defend oh you lover whose sigh i commend ` pon my word hold fast to such game what of love bélise hate be only the name -rrb- but you be grieve by the injurious doubt cast upon you sincerity and constancy you be disbelieve because all man be false and perjured and because they be inconstant love be withhold how fortunate you be how little the countess know she own heart if she expect to persuade you of she indifference in that fashion do you wish I to place a true value on the talk she be give you she be very much affect by the passion you exhibit for she but the warning and sorrow of she friend have convince she that the protestation of man be generally false i do not conceive any injustice in this for i who do not flatter man willingly be persuade that they be usually sincere on such occasion they become amorous of a woman that be they experience the desire of possession the enchanting image of that possession bewitch they they calculate that the delight connect with it will never end they do not imagine that the fire which consume they can ever weaken or die out such a thing seem impossible to they hence they swear with the best faith in the world to love we always and to cast a doubt upon they sincerity would be inflict a mortal injury but the poor fellow make more promise than they can keep they do not perceive that they heart have not enough energy always to hold the same object they cease to love without know why they be good enough to be scrupulous over they grow coldness long after love have flee they continue to insist that they still love they exert themselves to no purpose and after have torment themselves as long as they can bear it they surrender to dissatisfaction and become inconstant with as much good faith as they possess when they protest that they would be forever constant nothing be simpler and easier to explain the fermentation of a bud love excite in they heart the charm that seduce they by and by the enchantment be dispel and nonchalance follow with what can they be charge they count upon keep they vow dear I how many woman be too happy with what be lack since man give they a free rein to they lightness however this may be the countess have charge up to you the inconstancy of you equal she apprehend that you be no better than all other lover ready to yield to you however little you may be able to reassure she she be try to find reason for believe you sincere the love you protest for she do not offend she what be i say it enchant she she be so much flatter by it that she sole fear be that it may not be true dissipate she alarm show she that the happiness you offer she and of which she know the price be not a imaginary happiness go farther persuade she that she will enjoy it forever and she resistance will disappear she doubt will vanish and she will seize upon everything that will destroy she suspicion and uncertainty she would have already believe you already she would have resolve to yield to the pleasure of be love if she have believe herself really love and that it would last forever how maladroit woman be if they imagine that by they fear and they doubt of the sincerity and constancy of man they can make any one believe they be flee from love or despise it as soon as they fear they will be deceive in the enjoyment of its pleasure when they fear they will not long enjoy it they already know the charm of it and the only source of anxiety then be that they will be deprive of its enjoyment too soon forever haunt by this fear and attack by the powerful inclination toward pleasure they hesitate they tremble with the apprehension that they will not be permit to enjoy it but just long enough to make the privation of it more painful hence marqui you may very easily conjecture a woman who talk to you as do the countess use this language : i can imagine all the delight of love the idea i have form of it be quite seductive do you think that deep in my heart i desire to enjoy its charm less than you but the more its image be ravishing to my imagination the more i fear it be not real and i refuse to yield to it lest my happiness be too soon destroy ah if i could only hope that my happiness might endure how feeble would be my resistance but will you not abuse my credulity will you not some day punish I for have have too much confidence in you at least be that day very far off ah if i could hope to gather perpetually the fruit of the sacrifice i be make of my repose for you sake i confess it frankly we would soon be in accord xx the half-way house to love the rival you have be give appear to I to be all the more redoubtable as he be the sort of a man i have be advise you to be i know the chevalier nobody be more competent than he to carry a seduction to a successful conclusion i be willing to wager anything that he heart have never be touch he make advance to the countess in cold blood you be lose a lover as passionate as you have appear to be make a thousand blunder the most favorable design would perish under you management he permit everybody to take the advantage of he on every occasion indeed such be he misfortune that he precipitation and he timidity injure he prospects by turn a man who make love for the pleasure he find in it profit by the smallest advantage he know the feeble place and make himself master of they everything lead he way everything be combine for he purpose even he imprudence be often the result of wise reflection they help he along the road to success they finally acquire so superior a position that from they begin so to speak date the hour of he triumph you must be careful marquis not to go to extreme you must not show the countess enough love to lead she to understand the excess of you passion give she something to be anxious about compel she to take heed lest she lose you by give she opportunity to think that she may there be no woman on earth who will treat you more cavalierly than one who be absolutely certain that you love will not fail she like a merchant for whose goods you have manifest too great a anxiety to acquire she will overcharge you with as little regard to consequence moderate therefore you imprudent vivacity manifest less passion and you will excite more in she heart we do not appreciate the worth of a prize more than when we be on the point of lose it some regulation in matter of love be indispensable for the happiness of both party i think i be even justify in advise you on certain occasion to be a trifle unprincipled on all other occasion though it be better to be a dupe than a knave but in affair of gallantry it be only the fool who be the dupe and knave always have the laugh on they side adieu i have not the conscience to leave you without a word of consolation do not be discourage however redoubtable may be the chevalier let you heart rest in peace i suspect that the cunning countess be make a play with he to worry you i have no desire to flatter you but it give I pleasure to say that you be worth more than he you be young you be make you debut in the world and you be regard as a man who have never yet have any love affair the chevalier have live what woman will not appreciate these difference xxi the comedy of contrariness probity in love marquis how can you think of such a thing ah you be like a drowned man i shall take good care not to show you letter to any one it would dishonor you you do not know how to undertake the maneuver i have advise you to make you say you candor you high sentiment make you fortune formerly well love be then treat like a affair of honor but nowadays the corruption of the age have change all that love be now nothing more than a play of the humor and of vanity you inexperience still leave you virtue in a inflexible condition that will inevitably cause you ruin if you have not enough intelligence to bring they into accord with the moral of the time one can not now wear he sentiment on he sleeve everything be show payment be make in air demonstration sign everybody be play a comedy and man have have excellent reason for keep up the farce they have discover the fact that nobody can gain anything by tell the actual truth about woman there be a general agreement to substitute for this sincerity a collection of contrary phrase and this custom have prove contagious in case of gallantry in spite of you high principle you will agree with I that unless that custom call politeness be not push so far as irony or treason it be a sociable virtue to follow and of all the relation among man the true meaning of gallantry have more need of be conceal than that of any other social affair how many occasion do you not find where a lover gain more by dissimulate the excess of he passion than another who pretend to have more than he really have i think i understand the countess she be more skillful than you i be certain she dissimulate she affection for you with greater care than you take to multiply proof of yours for she i repeat the less you expose yourself the better you will be treat let she worry in she turn inspire she with the fear that she will lose you and see she come around it be the surest way of find out the true position you occupy in she heart adieu xxii vanity and self-esteem obstacle to love a silence of ten day marqui you begin to worry I in earnest the application you make of my counsel have then be successful i congratulate you what i do not approve however be you dissatisfaction with she for refuse to make the confession you desire the word : i love you seem to be something precious in you estimation for fifteen day you have be try to penetrate the sentiment of the countess and you have succeed you know she affection for you what more can you possibly want what further right over she heart would a confession give you truly i consider you a strange character you ought to know that nothing be more calculate to cause a reasonable woman to revolt than the obstinacy with which ordinary man insist upon a declaration of they love i fail to understand you ought not she refusal to be a thousand time more precious to a delicate mind lover than a positive declaration will you ever know you real interest instead of persecute a woman on such a point expend you energy in conceal from she the extent of she affection act so that she will love you before you call she attention to the fact before compelling she to resort to the necessity of proclaim it be it possible to experience a situation more delicious than that of see a heart interested in you without suspicion grow toward you by degree finally become affectionate what a pleasure to enjoy secretly all she movement to direct she sentiment augment they hasten they and glory in the victory even before she have suspect that you have essay she defeat that be what i call pleasure believe I marqui you conduct toward the countess must be as if the open avowal of she love for you have escape she of a truth she have not say in word : i love you but it be because she really love you that she have refrain from say it otherwise she have do everything to convince you of it woman be under no ordinary embarrassment they desire for the very least as much to confess they affection as you be anxious to ascertain it but what do you expect marquis woman ingenious at raise obstacle have attach a certain shame to any avowal of they passion and whatever idea you man may have form of we way of think such a avowal always humiliate we for however small may be we experience we comprehend all the consequence the word i love you be not criminal that be true but they sequel frighten we hence we find mean to dissimulate and close we eye to the liability they carry with they besides this be on you guard you persistence in require a open avowal from the countess be less the work of love than a persevere vanity i defy you to find a mistake in the true motive behind you insistence nature have give woman a wonderful instinct it enable she to discern without mistake whatever grow out of a passion in one who be a stranger to she always indulgent toward the effect produce by a love we have inspire we will pardon you many imprudence many transport how can i enumerate they all all the folly of which you lover be capable we pardon but you will always find we intractable when we self-esteem meet you own who would believe it you inspire we to revolt at thing that have nothing to do with you happiness you vanity stick at trifle and prevent you from enjoy actual advantage will you believe I when i say it you will drop you idle fancy to delight in the certainty that you be beloved by a adorable woman to taste the pleasure of hide the extent of she love from herself to rejoice in its security suppose by force of importunity you should extract a i love you what would you gain by it would you uncertainty reach a end would you know whether you owe the avowal to love or complaisance i think i know woman i ought to they can deceive you by a study confession which the lip only pronounce but you will never be the involuntary witness of a passion you force from they the true flattering avowal we make be not those we utter but those that escape we without we knowledge xxiii two irreconcilable passion in woman will you pardon I marquis for laugh at you affliction you take thing too much to heart some imprudence you say have draw upon you the anger of the countess and you anxiety be extreme you kiss she hand with a ecstasy that attract the attention of everybody present she publicly reprimand you for you indiscretion and you marked preference for she always offensive to other woman have expose you to the raillery of the marquise she sister-in-law dear I these be without contradiction terrible calamity what be you simple enough to believe that you be lose beyond salvation because of a outward manifestation of anger and you do not even suspect that inwardly you be justified you impose upon I the burden of convince you of the fact and in do so i be force to reveal some strange mystery concern woman but i do not intend in write you to be always apologize for my sex i owe you frankness however and have promise it i acquit myself of the promise a woman be always balance between two irreconcilable passion which continually agitate she mind : the desire to please and the fear of dishonor you can judge of we embarrassment on the one hand we be consume with the desire to have a audience to notice the effect of we charm ever engage in scheme to bring we into notoriety ravish whenever we be fortunate enough to humiliate other woman we would make the whole world witness of the preference we encounter and the homage bestow upon we do you know the measure of we satisfaction in such case the despair of we rival the indiscretion that betray the sentiment we inspire this enchant we proportionately to the misery they suffer similar imprudence persuade we much more that we be love than that we charm be incapable of give we a reputation but what bitterness poison such sweet pleasure beside so many advantage march the malignity of rival competitor and sometimes you disdain a fatality which be mournful the world make no distinction between woman who permit you to love they and those whom you compensate for so do uninfluenced and sober-minded a reasonable woman always prefer a good reputation to celebrity put she beside she rival who contest with she the prize for beauty and though she may lose that reputation of which she appear so jealous though she compromise herself a thousand time nothing be equal in she opinion to see herself prefer to other by and by she will recompense you by preference she will at first fancy that she grant they out of gratitude but they will be proof of she attachment in she fear of appear ungrateful she become tender can you not draw from this that it be not you indiscretion which vex we if they wind we we must pay tribute to appearance and you would be the first to censure a excessive indulgence see that you do not misunderstand we not to vex we on such occasion would be really to offend we recommend you to practice discretion and prudence that be the rôle we enact be it not be it necessary for I to tell you the part you be to play i be often remind that accept the letter of the law be to fail to understand it you may be sure that you will be in accord with we intention as soon as you be able to interpret they properly xxiv a abuse of credulity be intolerable the countess no longer retreat you think she have no other object in view than to put you love to the proof whatever preference you have manifest for she however little precaution you have take to testify to you passion she find nothing in you but cause for scold the least excuse however and the reproach die upon she lip and she anger be so delightful that you do everything to deserve it permit I to share in you joy with all my heart but although this behavior flatter you if you consider that such act be not intend to be of long duration how badly reasonable woman who value they reputation misunderstand they true interest by thus multiply through a affected incredulity occasion for slander they do they not understand and feel that it be not always the moment when they be tender which give a blow to they reputation the doubt they cast upon the sincerity of the affection they have inspire do they more harm in the eye of the world than even they defeat as long as they continue incredulous the slightest imprudence compromise they they dispose of they reputation at retail whenever a lover find a woman incredulous of the truth of he sentiment he go full length every time he have a opportunity to furnish proof of he sincerity the most indiscreet eagerness the most marked preference the most assiduous attention seem to he the best means of succeed can he make use of they without call the attention of the whole world to the fact without offend every other woman and give they occasion to be revenge by they sharpest arrow as soon as the preliminary be settle that be to say as soon as we commence to believe ourselves sincerely love nothing appear on the surface nothing happen and if outsider perceive we liaison if they put a malicious construction upon it it will only be by the recollection of what pass during a time when love be not in question i would for the good of everybody concern that as soon as a woman cease to find any pleasure in the society of a man who wish to please she that she could tell he so clearly and dismiss he without abuse he credulity or give he ground for vain hope but i would also that as soon as a woman be persuade that a man love she she could consent to it in good faith reserve to herself however the right to be further entreat to such a point as she may deem apropo before make a avowal that she feel as tenderly dispose toward she lover as he be toward she for a woman can not pretend to doubt without put she lover to the necessity of dissipate she doubt and he can not do that successfully without take the whole world into he confidence by a too marked homage i know very well that these idea would not have be probable in time when the ignorance of man render so many woman intractable but in these time when the audacity of we assailant leave we so few resource in these time i say when since the invention of powder there be few impregnable place why undertake a prolonged formal siege when it be certain that after much labor and many disaster it will be necessary to capitulate bring you amiable countess to reason show she the inconvenience of a prolonged disregard of you sentiment you will convince she of you passion you will compel she to believe you through regard for she reputation and still better perhaps you will furnish she with a additional reason for give you a confidence she doubtless now find it difficult to withhold from you xxv why virtue be so often overcome my last letter have apparently scandalize you marquis you insist that it be not impossible to find virtuous woman in we age of the world well have i ever say anything to the contrary compare woman to besiege castle have i ever advance the idea that there be some that have not be take how could i have say such a thing there be some that have never be besiege so you perceive that i be of you opinion i will explain however so that there will be no more chicanery about the question here be my profession of faith in this matter : i firmly believe that there be good woman who have never be attack or who have be wrongly attack i further firmly believe that there be good woman who have be attack and well attack when they have have neither disposition violent passion liberty nor a hate husband i have a mind at this point to put you in possession of a rather lively conversation on this particular point while i be still very young with a prude whom a adventure of some brilliancy unmask i be inexperienced then and i be in the habit of judge other with that severity which every one be dispose to manifest until some personal fault have make we more indulgent toward we neighbor i have consider it proper to blame the conduct of this woman without mercy she hear of it i sometimes see she at a aunt 's and make preparation to attack she moral before i have a opportunity she take the matter into she own hand by take I aside one day and compel I to submit to the follow harangue which i confess make a deep impression in my memory : it be not for the purpose of reproach you for the talk you have be make on my account that i wish to converse with you in the absence of witness she explain it be to give you some advice the truth and solidity of which you will one day appreciate you have see fit to censure my conduct with a severity you have actually treat I with a disdain which tell I how proud you be of the fact that you have never be take advantage of you believe in you own virtue and that it will never abandon you this be a pure illusion of you amour propre my dear child and i feel impel to enlighten you inexperience and to make you understand that far from be sure of that virtue which render you so severe you be not even sure that you have any at all this prologue astonish you eh well listen with attention and you will soon be convince of the truth whereof i speak up to the present time nobody have ever speak to you of love you mirror alone have tell you that you be beautiful you heart i can see by the appearance of indifference that envelop you like a mantle have not yet be develop as long as you remain as you be as long as you can be keep in sight as you be i will be you guarantee but when you heart have speak when you enchanting eye shall have receive life and expression from sentiment when they shall speak the language of love when a internal unrest shall agitate you breast when in fine desire half stifle by the scruple of a good education shall have make you blush more than once in secret then you sensibility through the combat by which you will attempt to vanquish it will diminish you severity toward other and they fault will appear more excusable the knowledge of you weakness will no longer permit you to regard you virtue as infallible you astonishment will carry you still farther the little help it will be to you against too impetuous inclination will make you doubt whether you ever have any virtue can you say a man be brave before he have ever fight it be the same with we the attack make upon we be alone the parent of we virtue as danger give birth to valor as long as one have not be in the presence of the enemy it be impossible to say whether he be to be fear and what degree of resistance it will be necessary to bear against he hence to justify a woman in flattering herself that she be essentially virtuous and good by force of she own strength she must be in a position where no danger however great it may be no motive no matter how press no pretext whatever shall be powerful enough to triumph over she she must meet with the most favorable opportunity the most tender love the certainty of secrecy the esteem and the most perfect confidence in he who attack she in a word all these circumstance combine should not be able to make a impression upon she courage so that to know whether a woman be virtuous in the true meaning of the word one must imagine she as have escape unscathed all these unite danger for it would not be virtue but only resistance where there should be love without the disposition or disposition without the occasion she virtue would always be uncertain as long as she have never be attack by all the weapon which might vanquish she one might always say of she : if she have be possess of a different constitution she might not have resist love or if a favorable occasion have present itself she virtue would have play the fool accord to this say i it would be impossible to find a single virtuous woman for no one have ever have so many enemy to combat that may be she reply but do you know the reason because it be not necessary to have so many to overcome we one alone be sufficient to obtain the victory but i stick to my proposition : you pretend then that we virtue do not depend upon ourselves since you make it the puppet of occasion and of other cause foreign to we own will there be no doubt about it she answer answer I this : can you give yourself a lively or sedate disposition be you free to defend yourself against a violent passion do it depend upon you to arrange all the circumstance of you life so that you will never find yourself alone with a lover who adore you who know he advantage and how to profit by they do it depend upon you to prevent he pleading i assume they to be innocent at first from make upon you sens the impression they must necessarily make certainly not to insist upon such a anomaly would be to deny that the magnet be master of the needle and you pretend that you virtue be you own work that you can personally claim the glory of a advantage that be liable to be take from you at any moment virtue in woman like all the other blessing we enjoy be a gift from heaven it be a favor which heaven may refuse to grant we reflect then how unreasonable you be in glorify in you virtue : consider you injustice when you so cruelly abuse those who have have the misfortune to be bear with a ungovernable inclination toward love whom a sudden violent passion have surprise or who have find themselves in the midst of circumstance out of which you would not have emerge with any greater glory shall i give you another proof of the justice of my idea i will take it from you own conduct be you not dominate by that deep persuasion that every woman who wish to preserve she virtue need never allow herself to be catch that she must watch over the smallest trifle because they lead to thing of greater importance it be much easier for you to take from man the desire to make a attack upon you virtue by assume a severe exterior than to defend against they attack the proof of this be in the fact that we give young girl in they education as little liberty as be possible in order to restrain they we do more : a prudent mother do not rely upon she fear of dishonor nor upon the bad opinion she have of man she keep she daughter out of sight she put it out of she power to succumb to temptation what be the excuse for so many precaution because the mother fear the frailty of she pupil if she be expose for a instant to danger in spite of all these obstacle with which she be curb how often do it not happen that love overcome they all a girl well trained or better well guard laugh at she virtue because she imagine it be all she own whereas it be generally a slave rigorously chained down who think everybody be satisfy with he as long as he do not run away let we inquire further into this : in what class do you find abandon female in that where they have not sufficient wealth or happiness constantly to provide themselves with the obstacle which have save you in that where man have attack they virtue with more audacity more facility more frequency and more impunity and consequently with more advantage of every sort in that where the impression of education of example of pride the desire of a satisfactory establishment could not sustain they two door below there be a woman whom you hate and despise and in spite of the outside aid which sustain that virtue of which you be so proud in two day you might be more despicable than she because you will have have greater help to guarantee you against misfortune i be not seek to deprive you of the merit of you virtue nor be i endeavor to prevent you from attach too much importance to it by convince you of its fragility i wish to obtain from you only a trifle of indulgence for those whom a too impetuous inclination or the misfortune of circumstance have precipitate into a position so humiliating in they own eye my sole object be to make you understand that you ought to glorify yourself less in the possession of a advantage which you do not owe to yourself and of which you may be deprive to-morrow she be go to continue but some one interrupted we soon afterward i learn by my own experience that i should not have have so good a opinion of many virtue which have be formerly impose upon I begin with my own xxvi love demand freedom of action i have be of the same opinion as you marquis although the idea i communicate to you yesterday appear to be true speculatively that it would be dangerous if all woman be to be guide by they it be not by a knowledge of they frailty that woman will remain virtuous but by the conviction that they be free and mistress of themselves when it come to yield or to resist be it by persuade a soldier that he will be vanquish that he be goad into fight with courage do you not notice that the woman who do the talk as i have relate in my last letter have a personal interest in maintain she system it be true that when we examine she reasoning accord to the rule of philosophy it do seem to be a trifle specious but it be to be fear that in permit ourselves to reason in that fashion on what virtue be we may succeed in convert into a problem the rule we should receive and observe as a law which it be a crime to construe moreover to persuade woman that it be not to themselves they be indebted for the virtue they possess might it mot deprive they of the most powerful motive to induce they to preserve it i mean by that the persuasion that it be they own work they defend the consequence of such morality would be discourage and tend to diminish in the eye of a guilty woman the importance of she error but let we turn to matter of more interest to you at last after so many uncertainty after so many revolution in you imagination you be sure you be love you have finally succeed in exciting the countess to divulge she secret during a moment of tenderness the word you burn to hear have be pronounce more she have allow to escape she a thousand involuntary proof of the passion you have inspire far from diminish you love the certainty that you be beloved in return have increase it in a word you be the happiest of man if you know with how much pleasure i share you happiness you would be still happier the first sacrifice she desire to make be to refuse to receive the chevalier : you be oppose to she make it and you be quite right it would have compromise the countess for nothing which call to my mind the fact that woman generally lose more by imprudence than by actual fault the confidence you so nobly manifest in she ought to have greatly impressed she everything be now as it should be however shall i tell you something the way this matter have turn out alarm I we agree if you remember that we be to treat the subject of love without glove you be not to have at the most but a light and fleeting taste of it and not a regulate passion now i perceive that thing become more serious every day you be begin to treat love with a dignity which worry I the knowledge of true merit solid quality and good character be creep into the motive of you liaison and combine with the personal charm which render you so blindly amorous i do not like to have so much esteem mix with a affair of pure gallantry it leave no freedom of action it be work instead of amusement i be afraid in the beginning that you relation would assume a grave and measure turn but perhaps you will only too soon have new pretension and the countess by new dispute will doubtless re-animate you liaison too constant a peace be productive of a deadly ennui uniformity kill love for as soon as the spirit of method mingle in a affair of the heart the passion disappear languor supervene weariness begin to wear and disgust end the chapter xxvii the heart need constant employment madame de sévigné do not agree with I upon the cause of love as i give they she pretend that many woman know it only from its refined side and that the sens never count for anything in they heart affair accord to she although what she call my system should be well found it would always be unbecome in the mouth of a woman and might become a precedent in moral these be assuredly very serious exception marquis but be they well ground i do not think so i see with pain that madame de sévigné have not read my letter in the spirit i write they what i the founder of system truly she do I too much honor i have never be serious enough to devise any system besides accord to my notion a system be nothing but a philosophic dream and therefore do she consider all i have tell you as a play of the imagination in that case we be very far out of we reckoning i do not imagine i depict real object i would have one truth acknowledge and to accomplish that my purpose be not to surprise the mind i consult the sentiment perhaps she have be strike by the singularity of some of my proposition which appear to I so evident that i do not think it worth while to maintain they but be it necessary to make use of a mariner 's compass to develop the greater or less amount of truth in a maxim of gallantry moreover i have such a horror of formal discussion that i would prefer to agree to anything rather than engage in they madame de sévigné you say be acquaint with a number of female metaphysician -- there there i will grant she these exception provide she leave I the general thesis i will even admit if you so desire that there be certain soul usually style privileged for i have never hear anybody deny the virtue of temperament so i have nothing to say about woman of that species i do not criticise they nor have i any reproach to make they neither do i believe it my duty to praise they it be sufficient to congratulate they however if you investigate they you will discover the truth of what i have be say since the commencement of we correspondence : the heart must be occupy with some object if nature do not incline they in that direction no one can lead they in the direction of gallantry they affection merely change its object such a one to-day appear to be insensible to the emotion of love only because she have dispose of all that portion of the sentiment she have to give the count de lude it be say be not always indifferent to madame de sévigné she extreme tenderness for madame grignan -lrb- she daughter -rrb- however occupy she entire time at present accord to she i be very much at fault concern woman in all charity i should have disguise the defect which i have discover in my sex or if you prefer to have it that way which my sex have discover in I but do you really believe marquis that if everything i have say on this subject be make public the woman would be offend know they better marquis all of they would find there what be they due indeed to tell they that it be purely a mechanical instinct which incline they to flirt would not that put they at they ease do it not seem to be restore to favor that fatality those expression of sympathy which they be so delighted to give as excuse for they mistake and in which i have so little faith grant that love be the result of reflection do you not see what a blow you be give they vanity you place upon they shoulder the responsibility far they good or bad choice one more thrust marquis : i be not mistake when i say that all woman would be satisfy with my letter the female metaphysician that be those woman whom heaven have favor with a fortunate constitution would take pleasure in recognize in they they superiority over other woman they would not fail to congratulate themselves upon the delicacy of they own sentiment and to consider they as work of they own creation those whom nature build of less refined material would without doubt owe I some gratitude for reveal a secret which be weigh upon they they have make it a duty to disguise they inclination and they be as anxious not to fail in this duty as they be careful not to lose anything on the pleasure side of the question they interest therefore be to have they secret guess without be compromise whoever shall develop they heart will not fail to render they a essential service i be even fully convince that those woman who at heart profess sentiment more comformable to mine would be the first to consider it a honor to dispute they hence i would be pay my court to woman in two fashion which would be equally agreeable : in adopt the maxim which flatter they inclination and in furnish they with a occasion to appear refine after all marquis do you think it would betray a deep knowledge of woman to believe that they could be offend with the malicious talk i have be give you about they somebody say a long time ago that woman would rather have a little evil say of they than not be talk about at all you see therefore that even suppose that i have write you in the intention with which i be charge they would be very far from be able to reproach I in the slightest degree finally madame de sévigné pretend that my system might become a precedent truly marquis i do not understand how with the justice for which she be note she be able to surrender to such a idea in strip love as i have of everything liable to seduce you in make it out to be the effect of temperament caprice and vanity in a word in undeceive you concern the metaphysics that lend it grandeur and nobility be it not evident that i have render it less dangerous would it not be more dangerous if as pretend madame de sévigné it be to be transform into a virtue i would willingly compare my sentiment with those of the celebrated legislator of antiquity who believe the best means of weaken the power of woman over he fellow citizen be to expose they nakedness but i wish to make one more effort in you favor since i be regard as a woman with a system it will be better for I to submit to whatever such a fine title exact let we reason therefore for a moment upon gallantry accord to the method which appertain only to serious matter be love not a passion do not very strict mind people pretend that the passion and vice mean the same thing be vice ever more seductive than when it wear the cloak of virtue wherefore in order to corrupt virtuous soul it be sufficient for it to appear in a potential form this be the form in which the platonician deify it in all age in order to justify the passion it be necessary to apotheosize they what be i say be i so bold as to play the iconoclast with a accredit superstition what temerity do i not deserve to be persecute by all woman for attack they favorite cult i be sorry for they it be so lovely when they feel the movement of love to be exempt from blush to be able even to congratulate themselves and lay the blame upon the operation of a god but what have poor humanity do to they why misunderstand it and seek for the cause of its weakness in the heaven let we remain on earth we shall find it there and it be its proper home in truth i have never in my letter openly declaim against love i have never advise you not to take the blame of it i be too well persuade of the uselessness of such advice but i tell you what love be and i therefore diminish the illusion it would not have fail to create in you mind i weaken its power over you and experience will justify I i be perfectly well aware that a very different use be make of it in the education of female and what sort of profit be there in the method employ the very first step be to deceive they they teacher strive to inspire they with as much fear of love as of evil spirit man be depict as monster of infidelity and perfidy now suppose a gentleman appear who express delicate sentiment whose bearing be modest and respectful the young woman with whom he converse will believe she have be impose upon and as soon as she discover how much exaggeration there have be she adviser will lose all credit so far as she be concerned interrogate such a young woman and if she be sincere you will find that the sentiment the alleged monster have excite in she heart be far from be the sentiment of horror they be deceive in another manner also and the misery of it be it be almost impossible to avoid it infinite care be take to keep from they the knowledge to prevent they from have even a idea that they be liable to be attack by the sens and that such attack be the most dangerous of all for they they be drill in the idea that they be immaculate spirit and what happen then inasmuch as they have never be forewarn of the species of attack they must encounter they be leave without defense they have never mistrust that they most redoubtable enemy be the one that have never be mention : how then can they be on they guard against he it be not man they should be teach to fear but themselves what could a lover do if the woman he attack be not seduce by she own desire so marquis when i say to woman that the principal cause of they weakness be physical i be far from advise they to follow they inclination on the contrary it be for the purpose of put they on they guard in that respect it be say to the governor of the citadel that he will not be attack at the spot which up to then have be the best fortify that the most redoubtable assault will not be make by the besieger but that he will be betray by he own in a word in reduce to they just value the sentiment to which woman attach such high and noble idea in enlighten they upon the real object of a lover who pretend to great delicacy and refinement do you not see that i be interesting they vanity to draw less glory out of the fact of be love and they heart to take less pleasure in loving depend upon it that if it be possible to enlist they vanity in opposition to they inclination to gallantry they virtue would most assuredly suffer very little i have have lover but none of they deceive I by any illusion i could penetrate they motive astonishingly well i be always persuade that if whatever be of value from the standpoint of intellect and character be consider as anything among the reason that lead they to love I it be only because those quality stimulate they vanity they be amorous of I because i have a beautiful figure and they possess the desire so it come about that they never obtain more than the second place in my heart i have always conserve for friendship the deference the constancy and the respect even which a sentiment so noble so worthy deserve in a elevated soul it have never be possible for I to overcome my distrust for heart in which love be the principal actor this weakness degrade they in my eye i consider they incompetent to raise they mind up to sentiment of true esteem for a woman for whom they have feel a desire you see therefore marquis that the precedent i draw from my principle be far from be dangerous all that enlighten mind can find with which to reproach I will be perhaps because i have take the trouble to demonstrate a truth which they do not consider problematic but do not you inexperience and you curiosity justify whatever i have write so far and whatever i may yet write you on this subject xxviii mere beauty be often of trifling importance you be not mistaken marquis the taste and talent of the countess for the clavecin -lrb- piano -rrb- will tend to increase you love and happiness i have always say that woman do not fully realize the advantage they might draw from they talent indeed there be not a moment when they be not of supreme utility most woman always calculate on the presence of a beloved object as the only thing to be fear in such case they have two enemy to combat they love and they lover but when the lover depart love remains and although the progress it make in solitude be not so rapid it be no less dangerous it be then that the execution of a sonata the sketch of a flower the reading of a good book will distract the attention from a too seductive remembrance and fix the mind on something useful all occupation which employ the mind be so many theft from love suppose he inclination bring a lover to we knee what can he accomplish with a woman who be only tender and pretty with what can he employ he time if he do not find in she society something agreeable some variety love be a active sentiment it be a consuming fire always demand additional fuel and if it can find only sensible object upon which to feed it will keep to that diet i mean to say that when the mind be not occupy the sens find something to do there be too many gesticulation while talk sometimes i think we shall be compel to use sign language with a person we know to be unable to understand a more refined language it be not in resist advance nor in take offense at too bold a caress that a woman be enable to maintain she virtue when she be attack in that fashion even while defend herself she sens be excite and the very agitation which impel she to resist hasten she defeat but it be by distract the attention of the man to other object that the woman be relieve of the necessity of resist he advance or take offense at he liberty to which she herself have open the way for there be one thing certain which be that a man will never disappoint a woman who be anxious for he you will not find a single woman unless you can suppose one absolutely ignorant who be not able to gauge exactly the degree of familiarity she ought to permit those who complain that they lover do not come up to the mark do not affect I in the least inquire into the reason and you will perceive that they stupidity they imprudence be the cause it be they desire to be find want defect in culture may expose we to the same inconvenience for with a woman without mind and without talent what else be there to do but undertake she conquest when in she company the only way to kill time be to annoy she there be nothing to talk about but she beauty and of the impression she have make upon the sens and sensual language be the only one that can be employ for that purpose she herself be not convince that you love she and she do not respond she do not recompense you but by the assistance of the sens and exhibit a agitation equal to yours or else she decency go she have nothing but bad humor with which to oppose you this be the last ditch of a woman without mind and what a culmination on the contrary what be not the advantage of a intelligent resourceful woman a lively repartee piquant raillery a quarrel seasoned with a trifle of malice a happy citation a graceful recitation be not these so many distraction for she and the time thus employ be it not so much gain for virtue the great misfortune with woman be without doubt the inability to find occupation worthy of they attention and this be the reason why love with they be a more violent passion than with man but they have a characteristic which properly direct may serve as a antidote all woman to say the least be as vain as they be sensitive whence the cure for sensitiveness be vanity while a woman be occupy in please in other way than by the beauty of she figure she lose sight of the sentiment which inspire she to act in truth this sentiment will not cease to be the determine motive -lrb- you must permit I to use some technical term of art -rrb- but it will not be the actual object present to she attention and that be something gain wholly devote to the care of become perfect in the species of glory to which she aspire this same desire of which love will be the source will turn against love by divide the attention of the mind and the affection of the heart in a word it will create a diversion but perhaps you will tell I that there be woman of spirit and talent beyond the reach of attack whence you infer that man who do not dislike freedom will avoid they but that fool and man of intelligence cultivate they that be true but the fool take to they because they do not perceive the difficulty in they way and man of intelligence do not avoid they because they aspire to surmount it now ought not you who be a military man to appreciate everything i say to you about talent i will suppose a campaign upon which you have enter you have be give charge of conduct the siege of a city would you be satisfy if the governor persuade that the city be not impregnable should open to you the gate without have give you the least occasion to distinguish yourself i venture to say not he should resist and the more he seek to cover himself with glory the more glory he give you well marqui in love as in war the pleasure of obtain a victory be measure accord to the obstacle in the way of it shall i say it i be tempt to push the parallel farther see what it be to take a first step the true glory of a woman consist less perhaps in yield than in put in a good defense so that she will merit the honor of war i shall go still farther let a woman become feeble enough to be at the point of yield what be leave she to retain a satisfactory lover if she intelligence and talent do not come to she aid i be well aware that they do not give themselves these advantage but if we investigate the matter we shall find that there be very few woman who may not acquire a few accomplishment if they really set about it the difference would only be the more at least but woman be generally bear too indolent to be able to make such a effort they have discover that there be nothing so convenient as be pretty this manner of pleasing do not require any labor they would be glad not to have any other blind that they be they do not see that beauty and talent equally attract the attention of man but beauty merely expose she who possess it whereas talent furnish she with the means of defend it in a word to appreciate it at its full value beauty store up regret and a mortal weariness for the day when it shall cease to exist would you know the reason it be because it drown out all other resource as long as beauty last a woman be regard as something she be celebrate a crowd sigh at she foot she flatter herself that this will go on forever what a desolate solitude when age come to ravish she of the only merit she possess i would like therefore -lrb- my expression be not elevated but it interpret my thought -rrb- i would like that in a woman beauty could be a sign of other advantage let we agree marquis that in love the mind be make more use of than the heart a liaison of the heart be a drama in which the act be the shortest and the between act the longest with what then would you fill the interlude if not with accomplishment possession put every woman on the same level and expose all of they equally to infidelity the elegant and the beautiful when they be nothing else have not in that respect any advantage over she who be plain the mind in that case make all the difference that alone can bestow upon the same person the variety necessary to prevent satiety moreover it be only accomplishment that can fill the vacuum of a passion that have be satisfied and we can always have they in any situation we may imagine either to postpone defeat and render it more flattering or to assure we of we conquest lover themselves profit by they how many thing they cherish although they set they face against they wherefore let the countess while cultivate she decide talent for the clavecin understand she interest and yours i have read over my letter my dear marquis and i tremble lest you find it a trifle serious you see what happen when one be in bad company i sup last night with m de la rochefoucauld and i never see he that he do not spoil I in this fashion at least for three or four day xxix the misfortune of too sudden a avowal i think as you do marqui the countess punish you too severely for have surprise a avowal of she love be it you fault if she secret escape she have go too far to retreat a woman can experience a return to reason but to go so far as to refuse to see you for three day give out that she have go into the country for a month return you tender letter without open they be in my opinion a veritable caprice of virtue after all however do not despair whatever may happen if she be really indifferent she would be less severe do not make any mistake about this : there be occasion when a woman be less out of humor with you than with herself she feel with vexation that she weakness be ready to betray she at any moment she punish you for it and she punish herself by be unkind to you but you may be sure that one day of such caprice advance the progress of a lover more than a year of care and assiduity a woman soon begin to regret she unkindness she deem herself unjust she desire to repair she fault and she become benevolent what surprise I the most be the marked passage in you letter which state that since the countess have appear to love you she character have totally change i have no particular information on that point all i know be that she make she debut in society as a lady of elegance and she debut be all the more marked because during the life of she husband she conduct be entirely the contrary do you not remember when you first make she acquaintance that she be lively even to giddiness heedless bold even coquettish and appear to be incapable of a reasonable attachment however to-day you tell I she have become a serious melancholic pre-occupied timid affected sentiment have take the place of mince air at least she appear to so fit in with the character she assume to-day that you imagine it to be she true one and she former one borrow all my philosophy would be at fault in such a case if i do not recognize in this metamorphosis the effect of love i be very much mistaken if the storm rage around you to-day do not end in the most complete victory and one all the more assure because she have do everything in she power to prevent it but if you steadily pursue you object carry you pursuit even as far as importunity follow she wherever she go and where you can see she if you take it upon yourself not to allude to you passion and treat she with all the mannerism of a attentive follower respectful but impressed what will happen she will be unable to refuse you the courtesy due any indifferent acquaintance woman possess a inexhaustible fund of kindness for those who love they you know this well you man and it be what always reassure you when you be treat unkindly you know that you presence you attention the sorrow that affect you have they effect and end by disarm we pride you be persuade that those whom we virtue keep at a distance through pride be precisely those whom it fear the most and unfortunately you guess be only too just it keep they off indeed because it be not sure of its ability to resist they it do more sometimes it go to the length of brave a enemy whose attack it dare not anticipate in a word the courage of a reasonable woman be nearly always equal to a first effort but rarely be that effort last the very excess of its violence be the cause of its weaken the soul have only one degree of force and exhaust by the constraint that effort cost it it abandon itself to lassitude by and by the knowledge of its weakness throw it into discouragement a woman of that disposition bear the first shock of a redoubtable enemy with courage but the danger better understand she fear a second attack a woman persuade that she have do everything possible to defend herself against a inclination which be urge she on satisfy with the combat in which she have be engage finally reach the opinion that she resistance can not prevail against the power of love if she still resist it be not by she own strength she derive no help except from the idea of the intrepidity she at first display to he who attack or from the timidity she inspire in he in the beginning of she resistance thus it be that however reasonable she may be she nearly always start out with a fine defense she only need pride to resolve upon that but unfortunately you divine the means of overcome she you persevere in you attack she be not indefatigable and you have so little delicacy that provide you obtain she heart it be of no consequence to you whether you have obtain it through you importunity or with she consent besides that marqui the excess of precaution a woman take against you be strong evidence of how much you be fear if you be a object of indifference would a woman take the trouble to avoid you i declare to you that she would not honor you by be afraid of you but i know how unreasonable lover be always ingenious in torment themselves the habit of never have but one object in view be so powerful that they prefer be pester with one that be disagreeable than with none at all however i feel sorry for you smite as you be you situation can not fail to be a sad one the poor marquis how badly he be treat xxx when resistance be only a pretense i be delighted to learn before my departure for the country that you mind be more at rest i feel free to say that if the countess have persevere in treat you with the same severity i should have suspect not that she be insensible to you love but that you have a fortunate rival the resistance manifest by she would have be beyond she strength in a single combat for you should be well advise marquis that a woman be never more intractable than when she assume a haughtiness toward all other man for the sake of she favorite lover i see in everything you have tell I proof that you be love and that you be the only one i will be able to give you constant news on that score for i be go to investigate the countess for myself this will surprise you no doubt you astonishment will cease however when you call to mind that madame de la sablière 's house where i be go to spend a week adjoin the grounds of you amiable widow you tell I that she be at home and add to the neighborhood the unmeasured longing i have to make she acquaintance you will not be surprise at the promise i have just make you i have not the time to finish this letter nor the opportunity to send it i must depart immediately and my travel companion be tease I in a strange fashion pretend that i be write a love letter i be let she think what she please and carry the letter with I to the country adieu what madame de grignan 's illness will not permit you to visit we in we solitude du château de -- i be write you from the country house of the countess my dear marqui this be the third day i have be with she which will enable you to understand that i be not in bad favor with the mistress of the house she be a adorable woman i be delighted with she i sometimes doubt whether you deserve a heart like hers here i be she confidante she have tell I all she think about you and i do not despair of discover before i return to the city the reason for the change in she character which you have remark i dare not write you more now i may be interrupted and i do not wish any one to know that i be write you from this place adieu xxxi the opinion and advice of monsieur de la sablière how many thing i have to tell you marquis i be prepare to keep my word with you and have arrange to use strategy upon the countess to worm she secret from she when chance come to my aid you be not ignorant of she confidence in monsieur de la sablière she be with he just now in a arbor of the garden and i be pass through a bushy path intend to join they when the mention of you name arrest my step i be not notice and hear all the conversation which i hasten to communicate to you word for word i have not be able to conceal from you penetration my inclination for m de sévigné say the countess and you can not reconcile the serious nature of so decide a passion with the frivolity attribute to I in society you will be still more astonished when i tell you that my exterior character be not my true one that the seriousness you notice in I now be a return to my former disposition i be never giddy except through design perhaps you may have imagine that woman can only conceal they fault but they sometimes go much farther sir and i be a instance they even disguise they virtue and since the word have escape I i be tempt at the risk of weary you to explain by what strange gradation i reach that point during my married life i live retire from the world you know the count and he taste for solitude when i become a widow there be the question of return to society and my embarrassment as to how i be to present myself be not small i interrogate my own heart in vain i seek to hide it from my own knowledge i have a strong taste for the pleasure of society but at the same time i be determine to add to it purity of moral but how to reconcile all this it seem to I a difficult task to establish a system of conduct which without compromise I would not at the same time deprive I of the pleasure of life this be the way i reason : destine to live among man form to please they and to share in they happiness we be oblige to suffer from they caprice and above all fear they malignity it seem that they have no other object in we education than that of fitting we for love indeed it be the only passion permit we and by a strange and cruel contrariety they have leave we only one glory to obtain which be that of gain a victory over the very inclination impose upon we i therefore endeavor to ascertain the best means of reconcile in use and custom two such glaring extreme and i find predicament on all side we be i say to myself simple enough when we enter society to imagine that the greatest happiness of a woman should be to love and be love we then be under the impression that love be base on esteem uphold by the knowledge of amiable quality purify by delicacy of sentiment divest of all the insipidity which disfigure it in a word foster by confidence and the effusion of the heart but unfortunately a sentiment so flattering for a woman without experience be everything less than that in practice she be always disabuse when too late i be so good in the beginning as to be scandalize at two imperfection i perceive in man they inconstancy and they untruthfulness the reflection i make on the first of these defect lead I to the opinion that they be more unfortunate than guilty from the manner in which the human heart be constitute be it possible for it to be occupy with only one object no but do the treachery of man deserve the same indulgence most man attack a woman 's virtue in cold blood in the design to use she for they amusement to sacrifice she to they vanity to fill a void in a idle life or to acquire a sort of reputation base upon the loss of ours there be a large number of man in this class how to distinguish true lover they all look alike on the surface and the man who pretend to be amorous be often more seductive than one who really be we be moreover dupe enough to make love a capital affair you man on the contrary consider it merely a play we rarely surrender to it without a inclination for the person of the lover you be coarse enough to yield to it without taste constancy with we be a duty you give way to the slightest distaste without scruple you be scarcely decent in leave a mistress the possession of whom six month before be you glory and happiness she may consider herself well off if she be not punish by the most cruel indiscretion hence i regard thing from they tragical side and say to myself : ` if love draw with it so many misfortune a woman who cherish she peace of mind and reputation should never love ' however everything tell I that we have a heart that this heart be make for love and that love be involuntary why then venture to destroy a inclination that be part of we be would it not be wiser to rectify it let we see how it will be possible to succeed in such a enterprise what be a dangerous love i have observe that kind of love it be a love which occupy the whole soul to the exclusion of every other sentiment and which impel we to sacrifice everything to the object love what character be susceptible of such a sentiment they be the most solid those who show little on the outside those who unite reason with a elevated nobility of character in they fashion of think finally who be the man the most reasonable for woman of that kind it be those who possess just sufficient brilliant quality to fix a value on they essential merit it must be confess though that such man be not good companion for woman who think it be true they be rare at present and there have never be a period so favorable as this to guarantee we against great passion but misfortune will have it that we meet one of they in the crowd the moralist pretend that every woman possess a fund of sensibility destine to be apply to some object or another a sensible woman be not affect by the thousand trifling advantage so agreeable to man in ordinary woman when she meet a object worthy of she attention it be quite natural that she should estimate the value of it she affection be measure accord to she light she can not go half way it be these character that should not be imitate and all acquaintance with the man of whom i have just be speak should be avoid if a woman value she peace of mind let we create a character which can procure for we two advantage at one and the same time : one to guard we from immoderate impression the other to ward off man who cause they let we give they a outside which will at least prevent they from display quality they do not possess let we force they to please we by they frivolity by they absurdity however much they may practice affectation they visible fault would furnish we with weapon against they what happy state can a woman occupy to procure such safeguard it be undoubtedly that of a professional society woman you be doubtless astonished at the strange conclusion to which my serious reasoning have lead I you will be still more astonished when you shall have hear the logic i employ to prove that i be right : listen to the end i know the justice of you mind and i be not lack in it however frivolous i may appear to be and you will finish by be of my opinion do you believe that the outward appearance of virtue guarantee the heart against the assault of love a poor resource when a woman descend to a weakness be not she humiliation proportionately as great as the esteem she hope to secure the brighter she virtue the easier mark for malice what be the world 's idea of a virtuous woman be not man so unjust as to believe that the wisest woman be she who best conceal she weakness or who by a forced retreat put herself beyond the possibility of have any rather than accord we a single perfection they carry wickedness to the point of attribute to we a perpetual state of violence every time we undertake to resist they advance one of we friend say : ` there be not a honest woman who be not tire of be so ' and what recompense do they offer we for the cruel torment to which they have condemn we do they raise up a altar to we heroism no the most honest woman they say be she who be not talk about that be to say a perfect indifference on the part of a woman a general oblivion be the price of we virtue must woman not have much of it to preserve it at such a price who would not be tempt to abandon it but there be grave matter which can not be overlook dishonor closely follow upon weakness old age be dreadful in itself what must it not be when it be pass in remorse i feel the necessity of avoid such a misfortune i calculate at first that i could not succeed in do so without condemn myself to a life of austerity and i have not the courage to undertake it but it gradually dawn upon I that the condition of a society woman be alone competent to reconcile virtue with pleasure from the smile on you face i suspect such a idea appear to be a paradox to you but it be more reasonable than you imagine tell I this : be a society woman oblige to have a attachment be she not exempt from tenderness it be sufficient for she to be amiable and courteous everything on the surface as soon as she become expert in the role she have undertake then the only mistrust the world have of she be that she have no heart a fine figure haughty air caprice fashionable jargon fantasy and fad that be all that be require of she she can be essentially virtuous with impunity do any one presume to make advance if he meet with resistance he quickly give over worry she he think she heart be already capture and he patiently await he turn he perseverance would be out of place for she would notify a man who fail to pay she deference that it be owe to arrangement make before he offer himself in this way a woman be protect by the bad opinion have of she i read in you eye that you be about to say to I : the state of a professional society woman may injure my reputation and plunge I into difficulty i seek to avoid be not that you thought but do you not know monsieur that the most austere conduct do not guard a woman from the shaft of malice the opinion man give of woman 's reputation and the good and wrong idea they acquire of we be always equally false it be prejudice it be a species of fatality which govern they judgment so that we glory depend less upon a real virtue than upon auspicious circumstance the hope of fill a honorable place in they imagination ought not to be the sole incentive to the practice of virtue it should be the desire to have a good opinion of ourselves and to be able to say whatever may be the opinion of the public : i have nothing with which to reproach myself but what matter it to what we owe we virtue provide we have it i be therefore convince that i could not do better when i reappear in the world than to don the mask i deem the most favorable to my peace of mind and to my glory i become closely attach to the friend who aid I with she counsel she be the marquise de -- a relative we sentiment be in perfect accord we frequent the same society charity for we neighbor be truly not we favorite virtue we make we appearance in a social circle as into a ball room where we be the only mask we indulge in all sort of folly we goad the absurd into show themselves in they true character after have amuse ourselves in this comedy we have not yet reach the limit of we pleasure it be renew in private interview how absolutely idiotic the woman appear to we and the man how vacuous fatuous and impertinent if we find any who could inspire fear in a woman 's heart that be esteem we break they heart by we air by affect utter indifference for they and by the allurement we heap upon those who deserve they the least by force of we experience we come near believe that in order to be virtuous it be necessary to frequent bad company this course of conduct guarantee we for a long time against the snare of love and save we from the dreadful weariness a sad and more mournful virtue would have spread over we life frivolous imperious bold even coquettish if you will in the presence of man but solid reasonable and virtuous in we own eye we be happy in this character we never meet a man we be afraid of those who might have be redoubtable be oblige to make themselves ridiculous before be permit to enjoy we society but what finally lead I to doubt the truth of my principle be they do not always guard I from the danger i wish to avoid i have learn through my own experience that love be a traitor with whom it will not do to trifle i do not know by what fatality the marquis de sévigné be able to render my project futile in spite of all my precaution he have find the way to my heart however much i resist he i be impel to love he and my reason be of no more use to I except to justify in my own eye the inclination i feel for he i would be happy if he never give I a occasion to change my sentiment i have be unable to hide from he my true thought i be afraid at first that he might deem I actually as ridiculous as i seem to be and when my sincerity shall render I less amiable in he eye -lrb- for i know that frivolity capture man more than real merit -rrb- i wish to show myself to he in my true color i should blush to owe nothing to he heart but a perpetual lie of my whole be i be still less surprised madame say monsieur de la sablière at the novelty of you project than at the skill with which you have succeed in render such a singular idea plausible permit I to say that it be not possible to go astray with more spirit have you experiment with everybody accord to you system man go a long way around to avoid the beaten track but they all fall over the same obstacle to make use of the privilege you grant I to tell you plainly my thought believe I countess that the only way for you to preserve you peace of mind be to resume openly you position as a

redoubtable be a lover who combine with so much knowledge of the heart the talent to express himself in such noble and delicate language what advantage can he not have of woman who reason i have remark it it be by he power of reasoning that he have overcome they he possess the art of employ the intelligence he find in a woman to justify in the eye of he reason the error into which he draw she besides a woman in love think she be oblige to proportion she sacrifice to the good quality of the man she love to a ordinary man a weakness be a weakness he blush at it to a man of intelligence it be a tribute pay to he merit it be even a proof of we discernment he eulogize we good taste and take the credit of it it be thus by turn it to the profit of the vanity which he rescue from virtue that

indifference be in she favor and what be worth still more you lack of skill to-day you have the experience and she have she reason the less after that to combine with you against she to betray the confidence she repose in I to refuse she the succor she have the right to expect from I if you be sincere you will avow it yourself would be a cry wrong henceforth i purpose to repair the evil i have

she have just confess to I that you be never so redoubtable now i can respond for she since she courage do not fail she on a occasion of so much peril i see still farther and i judge from she well sustain ironical conversation that she be only moderately smite a woman really wound by the shaft of love would not have play with sentiment in such a flippant manner this give birth to a strange idea

you will soon see that the best thing you can do be to come down to the quality of friend a position which we have so generously offer you you ought to consider yourself very fortunate you dismissal might be make absolute but do not make this out to be much of a victory you will be more harshly treat if we consider you more to be fear adieu marqui the countess who be sit at the head of my bed send you a thousand tender thing she be edify by the discretion with which you have treat we not to insist when two lady seem to be so contrary to you that be the height of gallantry so much modesty will certainly disarm they and may some day move they to pity hope that be permit you from the countess although you may be inspire by the most flattering hope marquis i will add a few word to this letter i have not read it but i suspect that it refer to I i wish however to write you with my own hand that we shall be alone here all day i wish to tell you that i love you moderately well at

this marquis begin to pass the bound of pleasantry explain yourself i pray you do you pretend to speak seriously in you letter in make it understand that i be act on this occasion through jealousy and that i be try to separate you and the countess to profit by it myself you be either the wickedest of man or the most adroit the wickedest if you ever could suspect I guilty of such baseness the most adroit if you have throw out that idea to make my friend suspect I i see very clearly in all this that the alternative be equally injurious to I since the countess have take the matter to heart i find that my relation with she be very embarrassing criminal that you be how well you know you ascendency over she heart you could not better attack she than by the appearance of indifference you affect not deign to answer my last letter not come to the rendezvous give you remain away from we three day and after all that to write we the coldest letter possible oh i confess it frankly that be to act like a perfect man that be what i call a master stroke and the most complete success have respond to you hope the countess have not be able to stand against so much coolness the fear that this indifference may become real have cause she a mortal anxiety great heaven what be the most reasonable woman when love have turn she head why be you not the witness of the reproach i have just hear how be that to hear the countess to-day give I a injurious opinion of she virtue a false idea of you pretension and i consider you design criminal because you take so much pleasure in punish she i be hard unjust cruel i can not remember all the epithet with which i be cover what outburst oh i protest to you this will be the last storm i will undergo for be mix up in you affair and i very cordially renounce the confidence with which you have both honor I adviser do not play a very agreeable part in such case so it seem to I always charge with what be disagreeable in quarrel and the lover only profit by a reconciliation however after due reflection i think i should be very silly to take offence at this you be two child whose folly will amuse I i ought to look upon they with the eye of a philosopher and finish by be the friend of both come then at once and assure I if that resolution will suit you now do not play the petty cruel role any more come and make peace these poor child one of they have such innocent motive the other be so sure of she virtue that to stand in the way of they inclination be surely to afflict they without reason xxxv the heart should be play upon like the key of a piano i be begin to understand marquis that the only way to live with the most reasonable woman be never to meddle with she heart affair i have therefore make up my mind henceforward i shall never mention you name to the countess unless she insist upon my do so i do not like bickering but this resolution will change nothing of my sentiment for you nor my friendship for she and although i still stand she friend i shall not scruple to make use of my friendship so far as you be concern as i have in the past i shall continue since you so wish it to give you my idea on the situation in which you may become involve on condition however that you permit I sometimes to laugh at you expense a liberty i shall not take to-day because if the countess follow up the plan she have form that be if she persist in refuse to see you alone i do not see that you affair will advance very rapidly she remember what i tell she she know she heart and have reason to fear it it be only a imprudent woman who rely upon she own strength and expose herself without anxiety to the advance of the man she love the agitation which animate he the fire with which he whole person appear to be burn excite we sens fire we imagination appeal to we desire i say to the countess one day : we resemble you clavecin however well disposed it may be to respond to the hand which should play upon it until it feel the impression of that hand it remain silent touch its key and sound be hear finish the parallel and draw you conclusion but after all why should you complain monsieur the metaphysician to see the countess hear the soft tone of she voice render she little attention carry the delicacy of sentiment beyond the range of mortal vision feel edify at she discourse on virtue be not these supreme felicity for you leave for earthy soul the gross sentiment which be begin to develop in you to look at you to-day it might be say that i be not so far out of the way when i declare love to be the work of the sens you own experience will compel you to avow that i have some good reason for say so for which i be not at all sorry consider yourself punish for you injustice adieu you old rival the chevalier have revenge himself for the rigor of the countess by tie himself up with the marquise she relative this choice be assuredly a eulogy on he good taste they be make for each other i shall be very much charm to know whither they fine passion will lead they xxxvi mistaken impression common to all woman do you think marquis that i have not feel all the sarcasm you have deign to turn against I on account of my pretended reconciliation with the countess know this sir that we have never be at out it be true she beg I to forget she vivacity which she claim be due to she love and she insist that i should continue to give she good counsel but good heaven of what use be my counsel except to provide you with a additional triumph the best advice i can give she be to break off she relation with you for whatever confidence she may have in she pride she only preservative against you be flight she believe for example that she use she reason with good effect in the conversation you have relate to I but every reasonable woman do not fail to use the same language as soon as a lover show she some respectful pretension i only want you heart they say you sentiment you esteem be all i desire alas you will find only too many woman with so little delicacy as to believe themselves very happy in accept what i refuse i will never envy they a happiness of that kind be on you guard marquis and do not openly combat such fine sentiment to doubt a woman 's sincerity on such occasion be to do more than offend they it be to be maladroit you must applaud they mistaken idea if you would profit by it they wish to appear high-minded and sensible only of the pleasure of the soul it be they system they esprit du corps if some woman be in good faith on this point how many be there who treat it as a illusion and wish to impose it upon you but whatever may be the reason which impel they to put you on a false scent ought you not to be delighted that they be willing to take the trouble to deceive you what obligation be you not under they give in this manner a high value to those who without it would be very undesirable admire we strategy when we feign indifference to what you call the pleasure of love pretend even to be far remove from its sweetness we augment the grandeur of the sacrifice we make for you by it we even inspire the gratitude of the author of the very benefit we receive from they you be satisfy with the good you do we and since it be say that we make it a duty to deceive you what obligation do you not owe we we have choose the most obliging way to do it you be the first to gain by this deceit for we can not multiply obstacle without enhance the price of you victory trouble care be not these the money with which lover pay for they pleasure what a satisfaction for you vanity to be able to say within yourselve : this woman so refine so insensible to the impression of the sens this woman who fear disdain so much come to I nevertheless and sacrifice she repugnance she fear she pride my own merit the charm of my person my skill have surmount invincible object for something quite different how satisfied i be with my prowess if woman act in good faith if they be in as much haste to show you they desire as you be to penetrate they you could not talk that way how many pleasure lose but you can not impute wrong to this artifice it give birth to so many advantage pretend to be deceive and it will become a pleasure to you if the countess know what i have write how she would reproach I xxxvii the allurement of stage woman i know too well that a man in you position particularly a military man be often expose to bad company consequently he be attract by the divinity you mention in spite of that you be not deceive and i would probably censure you if i be not so sure that in the present state of you heart the heroine of the theater be not dangerous to you but the countess be less indulgent you say she jealousy do not astonish I she confirm my idea concern female metaphysician i know how much credit be due they sincerity she complaint be very singular for what be she deprive of the woman in question be nothing but woman of sentiment and it be to sentiment that the countess be attach how little woman be in accord they pretend to despise woman of the stage they fear they too much to despise they but after all be they wrong to consider they rival be you not more captivate with they free and easy style than with that of a sensible woman who have nothing to offer but order decency and uniformity with the former man be at they ease they appear to be in they element with the latter man be keep within bound oblige to stand on they dignity and to be very circumspect from the portrait of several of they i should judge that there be some of they very capable of make many man unfaithful to the most beloved mistress but with a sensible man this infidelity if it be one can not be of long duration these woman may create a sudden lively desire but never a veritable passion the fairy of the operatic stage would be too dangerous if they have the wit or the humor always to amuse you as much as they do the first time you be throw on they company however little jargon habit and decency they have on the surface it be possible that they may please you at first you man have so little refinement sometimes the freedom of they conversation the vivacity of they sally of alleged wit they giddy way all this afford you a situation that charm a lively and silly joy seize upon you the hour you pass with they seem to be only moment but happily for you they seldom possess sufficient resource to maintain a role so amusing inasmuch as they lack education and culture they soon travel around the small circle of they accomplishment they feed you with the same pleasantry the same story the same antic and it be seldom one laugh twice at the same thing when one have no esteem for the fun maker the countess need not worry for i know you well enough to assure she that it be not that class of woman she may apprehend there be in the world other more redoubtable they be the gallant woman those equivocal woman in society they occupy a middle position between good woman and those i have be talk about they associate with the former and be not different from the latter except on the surface more voluptuous than tender they seduce by lend to the least refined sentiment a air of passion which be mistake for love they understand how to convey a impression of tenderness to what be only a taste for pleasure they make you believe that it be by choice by a knowledge of you merit that they yield if you do not know they to be gallant woman the shade of difference which distinguish the true motive which actuate they from the sensibility of the heart be impossible to seize you accept for excess of passion what be only a intoxication of the sens you imagine you be love because you be lovable but it be only because you be a man these be the woman i should fear if i be in the place of the countess the financial woman who have lately appear in society belong to this class but i have already warn the countess i call to mind here that in you precede letter you mention the allurement which the countess think proper to manifest she be right in take umbrage you passion for she be truly too great to prevent you from sacrifice everything but i fear you will not always be so honest madame de -- possess bloom and cheerfulness she be at a age when woman assume charge of young man who desire to be fit for society and to learn they first lesson in gallantry the interesting and affectionate disposition you find in she will have its effect but be careful it be i who warn you although i despise such woman it happen that they have the power to create attachment they often find the secret of make you commit more folly than any of the other woman xxxviii variety of resistance be essential i hasten to tell you marqui that i have just maintain a thesis against monsieur de la bruyère no doubt you admire my temerity however it be true he pretend that corneille describe man as they should be and racine as they be i hold the contrary we have some illustrious spectator of the dispute and i ought to be very proud of the suffrage in my favor but all the detail would be too long to write you so come and we will talk they over every one have he own fashion of describe thing i have mine i know i represent woman as they be and i be very sorry not to be able to represent they as they should be now i shall reply to you letter the species of languor which affect you do not surprise I the malady which afflict the marquise have deprive you of the pleasure of see the countess and you heart remain in the same condition for three day it be not surprising that ennui should have gain upon it neither do you present indifference for the countess alarm I in the greatest passion there be always moment of lukewarmness which astonish the heart that feel the sensation whether the heart constantly agitate by the same emotion finally tire or whether it be absolutely impossible for it to be always employ with the same object there be moment of indifference the cause of which can not be ascertain the livelier the emotion of the heart the more profound the calm that be sure to follow and it be this calm that be always more fateful to the object loved than storm and agitation love be extinguish by a resistance too severe or constant but a intelligent woman go beyond that she vary she manner of resist this be the sublimity of the art now with the countess the duty of friendship be preferable to the claim of love and that be another reason for you indifference toward she love be a jealous and tyrannical sentiment which be never satiate until the object loved have sacrifice upon its altar all desire and passion you do nothing for it unless you do everything whenever you prefer duty friendship etc it claim the right to complain it demand revenge the small courtesy you deem it necessary to show madame de -- be proof of it i would have much preferred though you have not carry they so far as accompany she home the length of time you pass in she company the pleasure you experience in converse with she the question she put to you on the state of you heart all go to prove the truth of what i say in my last letter it be vain for you to protest that you come away more amorous than ever of the countess you embarrassment when she inquire whether you have remain long with you fermière générale the attempt you make to deceive she by a evasive answer the extreme care you take to disarm she slightest suspicion be indication to I that you be far more guilty than you pretend or than you be aware of yourself the countess suffer the consequence of all that do you not see how she affect to rouse you jealousy by praise the chevalier you ancient rival for once i can assure you that you will not so soon be affect by the languor we mention a short time ago jealousy will give you something to think about do you count for nothing the suffering of the marquise you will soon see she the ravages of the smallpox will not alone disfigure she face for she disposition will be very different as soon as she learn the extent of she misfortune how i pity she how i pity other woman with what cordiality she will hate they and tear they to tatters the countess be she best friend will she be so very long she be so handsome she complexion cast the other in the shade what storm i foresee i have forget to quarrel with you about you treatment of I you have be so indiscreet as to show my recent letter to m de la rochefoucauld i will cease write you if you continue to divulge my secret i be willing to talk personally with he about my idea but i be far from flattering myself that i write well enough to withstand the criticism of a reader like he xxxix the true value of compliment among woman the mark leave by the smallpox on the marquise 's face have set she wild she resolution not to show herself for a long time do not surprise I how could she appear in public in such a state if the accident which humiliate she have not happen how she would have make the poor chevalier suffer do not this prove that female virtue depend upon circumstance and diminish with pride how i fear a similar example in the case of the countess nothing be more dangerous for a woman than the weakness of she friend love already too seductive in itself become more so through the contagion of example if i may so speak it be not only in we heart that it gather strength it acquire new weapon against reason from its environment a woman who have fall under its ban deem herself interested for she own justification in conduct she friend to the edge of the same precipice and i be not therefore surprise at what the marquise say in you favor up to the present moment they have be guide by the same principle what a shame then for she that the countess could not have be guarantee against the effect of it now the marquise have a strong reason the more for contribute to the defeat of she friend she have become positively ugly and consequently oblige to be more complaisant in retain a lover will she suffer another woman to keep hers at a less cost that would be to recognize too humiliating a superiority and i can assure you that she will do the most singular thing to bring she amiable widower up to the point if she succeed how much i fear everything will be change to have be as beautiful as another woman and to be so no longer although she embellish herself every day and to suffer she presence every day be i vow a effort beyond the strength of the most reasonable woman greater than the most determine philosophy among woman friendship cease where rivalry begin by rivalry i mean that of beauty only it would be too much to add that of sentiment i foresee this with regret but it be my duty to forewarn you whatever precaution the countess may take to control the amour propre of the marquise she will never make anything else out of she than a ingrate i do not know by what fatality everything a beautiful woman tell one who be no longer beautiful assume in the mouth a impression of a commiseration which break down the most carefully devise management and humiliate she whom it be think to console the more a woman strive to efface the superiority she possess over a unfortunate sister woman the more she make that superiority apparent until the latter reach the opinion that it be only through generosity that she be permit to occupy the subordinate position leave she you may depend upon it marqui that woman be never mislead when it come to mutual praise they fully appreciate the eulogy interchange among themselves and as they speak without sincerity so they listen with little gratitude and although she who speak in praise the beauty of another may do so in good faith she who listen to the eulogy consider less what the other say than she style of beauty be she ugly we believe and love she but if she be as handsome as we we thank she coldly and disdain she handsomer we hate she more than before she speak you must understand this marquis that as much as two beautiful woman may have something between they to explain it be impossible for they to form a solid friendship can two merchant who have the same goods to sell become good neighbor man do not penetrate the true cause of the lack of cordiality among woman those who be the most intimate friend often quarrel over nothing but do you suppose this nothing be the real occasion of they quarrel it be only the pretext we hide the motive of we action when to reveal it would be a humiliation we do not care to make public the fact that it be jealousy for the beauty of we friend that be the real cause to give that as the reason for estrangement would be to charge we with envy a pleasure one woman will not give another she prefer injustice whenever it happen that two beautiful woman be so happy as to find a pretext to get rid of each other they seize upon it with vivacity and hate each other with a cordiality which prove how much they love each other before the rupture well marqui be i talk to you with sufficient frankness you see to what length my sincerity go i try to give you just idea of everything even at my own expense for i be assuredly not more exempt than another woman from the fault i sometimes criticise but as i be sure that what pass between we will be bury in oblivion i do not fear embroil myself in a quarrel with all my sex they might perhaps claim the right to blame my ingenuity but the countess be above all such petty thing she agree however with everything i have just say be there many woman like she xl oratory and fine phrase do not breed love the example of the marquise have not yet have any effect on the heart of she friend it appear on the contrary that she be more on guard against you and that you have draw upon yourself she reproach through some slight favor you have deprive she of i have be think that she would not fail on this occasion to recall to you recollection the protestation of respect and disinterestedness you make when you declare you passion for she it be customary in similar case but what seem strange about it be that the same eagerness that a woman accept as a proof of disrespect before she be in perfect accord with she lover become in she imagination a proof of love and esteem as soon as they meet on a common ground listen to married woman and to all those who be unmarried permit the same prerogative hear they i say in they secret complaint against unfaithful husband and cool lover they be despise and that be the sole reason they can imagine but with we what they consider a mark of esteem and sincerity be it anything else than the contrary i tell you some time ago that woman themselves when they be act in good faith go farther than man in make love consist in a effervescence of the blood study a lover at the commencement of she passion : with she then love be purely a metaphysical sentiment with which the sens have not the least relation similar to those philosopher who in the midst of grievous torment would not confess that they be suffer pain she be a martyr to she own system but at last while combat this chimera the poor thing become affect by a change she lover vainly repeat that love be a divine metaphysical sentiment that it live on fine phrase on spiritual discourse that it would be degrade to mingle with it anything material and human he vainly boast of he respect and refinement i tell you marqui on the part of all woman that such a orator will never make he fortune he respect will be take as a insult he refinement for derision and he fine discourse for ridiculous pretext all the grace that will be accord he be that she will find a pretext to quarrel with he because he have be less refine with some other woman and that he will be put to the sorrowful necessity of display he high fly sentiment to he titular mistress and what be admirable about this be that the excuse for it arise out of the same principle p -- you have so much deference for my demand you not only show my letter to m de la rochefoucauld but you read they before the whole assembly of my friend it be true that the indulgence with which my friend judge they console I somewhat for you indiscretion and i see very well that the best thing for I to do be to continue on in my own way as i have in the past but at least be discreet when i mention matter relate to the glory of the countess otherwise no letter xli discretion be sometimes the better part of valor no marquis i can not pardon in you the species of fury with which you desire what you be pleased to call the supreme happiness how blind you be not to know that when you be sure of a woman 's heart it be in you interest to enjoy she defeat a long time before it become entire will you never understand that of all there be good on earth it be the sweetness of love that must be use with the greatest economy if i be a man and be so fortunate as to have capture the heart of a woman like the countess with what discretion i would use my advantage how many gradation there would be in the law i should impose upon myself to overlook they successively and even leisurely of how many amiable pleasure unknown to man would not i be the creator like a miser i would contemplate my treasure unceasingly learn its precious value feel that in it consist all my felicity base all my happiness upon the possession of it reflect that it be all mine that i may dispose of it and yet maintain my resolution not to deprive myself of its use what a satisfaction to read in the eye of a adorable woman the power you have over she to see she slightest act give birth to a impression of tenderness whenever they relate to you to hear she voice soften when it be to you or of you she speak to enjoy she confusion at you slightest eagerness she anxiety at you most innocent caress be there a more delicious condition than that of a lover who be sure of be love and can there be any sweeter than at such moment what a charm for a lover to be expect with a impatience that be not conceal to be receive with a eagerness all the more flattering from the effort make to hide the half of it she dress in a fashion to please she assume the deportment the style the pose that may flatter she lover the most in former time woman dress to please in general now they entire toilette be to please man for he sake she wear bangle jewelry ribbon bracelet ring he be the object of it all the woman be transform into the man it be he she love in she own person can you find anything in love more enchanting than the resistance of a woman who implore you not to take advantage of she weakness be there anything in a word more seductive than a voice almost stifle with emotion than a refusal for which she reproach herself and the rigor of which she attempt to soften by tender look before a complaint be make i can not conceive any but it be certain that as soon as she yield to you eagerness all these pleasure weaken in proportion to the facility meet you alone may prolong they even increase they by take the time to know all the sweetness and its taste however you be not satisfy unless the possession be entire easy and continuous and after that you be surprise to find indifference coolness and inconstancy in you heart have you not do everything to satiate you passion for the beloved object i have always contend that love never die from desire but often from indigestion and i will sometime tell you in confidence my feeling for count -- you will understand from that how to manage a passion to render happiness endure you will see whether i know the human heart and true felicity you will learn from my example that the economy of the sentiment be in the question of love the only reasonable metaphysics in fine you will know how little you understand you true interest in you conduct toward the countess to interfere with you project i shall be with she as often as it be possible now do not be formal and tell I that i be a advocate on both side for i be persuade that i be act for the good of the party interested xlii surface indication in woman be not always guide what i censure you marquis i will take good care not to do so i assure you you have not be willing to follow my advice and hence i be not at all sorry for have ill-use you you think you have nothing to do but to treat the countess roughly she easy fashion of treat love she accessibility she indulgence for you numerous fault the freedom with which she mock the platonician all this encouraged you to hope that she be not very severe but you have just discover you mistake all this outward show be nothing but deceitful and perfidious allurement to take advantage thus of the good faith of any one -- i must confess that it be a conduct which cry for vengeance she deserve all the name you give she but do you wish I to talk to you with my customary frankness you have fall into a error which be common among man they judge woman from the surface they imagine that a woman whose virtue be not always on the qui vive will be easier to overcome than a prude even experience do not undeceive they how often be they expose to a severity all the keener that it be unexpected they custom then be to accuse woman of caprice and oddity all of you use the same language and say : why such equivocal conduct when a woman have decide to remain intractable why surprise the credulity of a lover why not possess a exterior conformable to she sentiment in a word why permit a man to love she when she do not care ever to see he again be this not be odd and false be it not trifle with sentiment you be in error gentleman you be impose upon you vanity it be in vain you try to put we on a false scent that of itself be offensive and you talk of sentiment as ennoble a thing that resemble it very little be not you yourselve to blame if we treat you thus however little intelligence a woman may have she know that the strongest tie to bind you to she be anticipation wherefore you must let she lay the blame on you if she be to arm herself from the first with a severity that would indicate that she be invincible from that time no lover for she what a solitude would be hers what shame even for a woman of the most pronounced virtue be no less sensible of the desire to please she make she glory consist in secure homage and adoration but without ignore the fact that those she expect attention from be induce to bestow they only for reason that wind she pride unable to reform this defect the only part she can take be to use it to she advantage to keep they by she side she know how to keep they and not destroy the very hope which however she be determine never to gratify with care and skill she succeed hence as soon as a woman understand she real interest she do not fail to say to herself what the countess confess to I at we last interview : i can well appreciate the ' i love you ' of the man i do not disguise the fact that i know what it signify at bottom therefore upon I rest the burden of be offend at hear they but when woman have penetrate they motive they have need of they vanity to disconcert they design we anger when they have offend we be not the best weapon to use in oppose they whoever must go outside herself and become angry to resist they expose she weakness a fine irony a piquant raillery a humiliating coolness these be what discourage they never a quarrel with they consequently no reconciliation what advantage do not this mode of procedure take from they the prude it be true follow a quite different method if she be expose to the least danger she do not imagine herself to be reasonable but in proportion to the resentment she experience but upon whom do such conduct impose every man who know the card say to himself : ' i be ill use because the opportunity be unfavorable it be my awkwardness that be punish and not my temerity another time that will be well receive which be a crime to-day this severity be a notice to redouble my effort to merit more indulgence and disarm pride she wish to be appease ' and the only means in such case to make she forget the offense be that in make a apology to repeat it a second time with my recipe i be certain that a man will never reason that way the marquis for example have sometimes permit I to read in he eye he respectful intention i never know but one way to punish he i have feign not to understand he insensibly i have divert he mind to other object and this recipe have work well up to the moment i last see he at my house there be no way to dissimulate with he he wish to honor I with some familiarity and i stop he immediately but not in anger i deem it more prudent to arm myself with reason than with anger i appear to be more afflict than irritated and i be sure my grief touch he heart more than bitter reproach which might have alarm he he go away very much dissatisfied and just see what the heart be : at first i be afraid i have drive he away forever i be tempt to reproach myself for my cruelty but upon reflection i feel reassure have severity ever produce inconstancy to go on : we talk until we be out of breath and everything the countess tell I give I to understand that she have make up she mind it will be in vain for you to cry out against she injustice consider she as odd and inhuman she will not accept any of the sweetness of love unless it cost she pride nothing and i observe that she be follow that resolution with more firmness than i imagine she capable of the loss of you heart would undoubtedly be a misfortune for which she could never be console but on the other hand the condition you place upon you perseverance appear too hard to be accept she be willing to compromise with you she hope to be able to hold you without betray she duty a project worthy of she courage and i hope it will succeed better than the plan she have form to guarantee she heart against love let we await the outcome shall we see you to-morrow at madame la presidente 's if you should desire to have a occasion to speak to she i do not doubt that you will make you peace xliii woman demand respect i should never have expect it marqui what my zeal in you behalf have draw you reproach down upon I i share with the countess the bad humor she severity have cause you do you know if what you say be well found nothing could be more piquant for I than the ironical tone in which you laud my principle but to render I responsible for you success as you attempt have you dare think for a instant that my object in write you be ever for the purpose of give you lesson in seduction do you not perceive any difference in teaching you to please and exciting you toward seduction i have tell you the motive which incline woman to love it be true but have i ever say that they be easier to vanquish have i ever tell you to attack they by sensuality and that in attack they to suppose they without delicacy i do not believe it when you inexperience and you timidity might cause you to play the role of a ridiculous personage among woman i explain the harm these defect might cause you in the world i advise you to have more confidence in order to lead you insensibly in the direction of that noble and respectful boldness you should have when with woman but as soon as i see that you pretension be go too far and that they might wind the reputation of the countess i do not dissimulate i take side against you and nothing be more reasonable i have become she friend you see then how unjust you be in my regard and you be no less so in regard to she you treat she as if she be a equivocal character accord to you idea she have neither decide for nor against gallantry and what you clearly see in she conduct be that she be a more logical coquette than other woman what a opinion but there be much to pardon in you situation however a man without prejudice would see in the countess only a lover as reasonable as she be tender a woman who without have a ostentatious virtue nevertheless remain constantly attach to it a woman in a word who seek in good faith the proper means of reconcile love and duty the difficulty in ally these two contrary be not slight and it be the source of the inequality that wind you figure to yourself the combat she must sustain the revolution she suffer she embarrassment in endeavor to preserve a lover whom too uniform a resistance might repel if she be sure of keep you by resist you advance but you carry you odd conduct to the extent of leave she when she resistance be too prolonged while praise we virtue you abandon we and then what shame for we but since in both case it be not certain that she lover will be hold it be preferable to accept the inconvenient rather than cause you to lose she heart and she esteem that be we advice for the countess and i think precisely alike on the subject be more equitable marquis complain of she rather than criticise she if she character be more decide perhaps you would be better satisfied with she but even in that case would you be satisfied very long i doubt it adieu we count on see you this evening at madame de la fayette 's and that you will prove more reasonable the abbé gedoyn will be present I the assembly will be brilliant but you will doubtless be bore for you will not see the only object that can attract you and you will say of my apartment what malherbe so well say of the garden of the louvre : mais quoi que vous ayez vous n'avez point caliste et moi je ne vois rien quand je ne la vois pas -lrb- whatever you may have caliste you have not get and i i can see nothing when i see she not -rrb- xliv why love grow weak -- marshal de saint-evremond 's opinion a calm have succeed the storm marquis and i see by you letter that you be more satisfied with the countess and with yourself how powerful logic be come from the mouth of a woman we adore you see how the conduct of we friend have produce a opposite effect from that of the marquise the severity of the former increase you esteem and love for she and the kindness of the marquise make a unfaithful lover out of the chevalier so it generally happen among man ingratitude be commonly the price of benefit this misfortune however be not always beyond the reach of remedy and in this connection i wish to give you the contents of a letter i receive from monsieur de saint-evremond a few day ago you be not ignorant of the intimate relation that have always exist between we the young count de -- have just espouse mademoiselle -- of whom he be passionately amorous he complain one day to I that hymen and the possession of the beloved object weaken every day and often destroy the most tender love we discuss the subject for a long time and as i happen to write to saint-evremond that day i submit the question to he this be he reply : saint-evremond to mademoiselle de l'enclos my opinion be exactly in line with yours mademoiselle it be not always as some think hymen or the possession of the loved object which of itself destroy love the true source of the dissatisfaction that follow love be in the unintelligent manner of economize the sentiment a possession too easy complete and prolonged when we have yield to the transport of a passion without reserve the tremendous shock to the soul can not fail quickly to leave it in a profound solitude the heart find itself in a void which alarm and chill it we vainly seek outside of ourselves the cause of the calm which follow we fit of passion we do not perceive that a equal and more enduring happiness would have be the fruit of moderation make a exact analysis of what take place within you when you desire anything you will find that you desire be nothing but curiosity and this curiosity which be one of the force of the heart satisfied we desire vanish whoever therefore would hold a spouse or a lover should leave he something to be desire something new should be expect every day for the morrow diversify he pleasure procure for he the charm of variety in the same object and i will vouch for he perseverance in fidelity i confess however that hymen or what you call you defeat be in a ordinary woman the grave of love but then it be less upon the lover that the blame fall than upon she who complain of the cooling of the passion she cast upon the depravity of the heart what be due to she own unskillfulness and she lack of economy she have expend in a single day everything that might keep alive the inclination she have excite she have nothing more to offer to the curiosity of she lover she become always the same statue no variety to be hope for and she lover know it well but in the woman i have in mind it be the aurora of a lovelier day it be the beginning of the most satisfying pleasure i understand by effusion of the heart those mutual confidence those ingenuity those unexpected avowal and those transport which excite in we the certainty of create a absolute happiness and merit all the esteem of the person we love that day be in a word the epoch when a man of refinement discover inexhaustible treasure which have always be hide from he the freedom a woman acquire who bring into play all the sentiment which constraint have hold in reserve she heart take a lofty flight but one well under control time far from lead to loathing will furnish new reason for a greater love but to repeat i assume sufficient intelligence in she to be able to control she inclination for to hold a lover it be not enough -lrb- perhaps it be too much -rrb- to love passionately she must love with prudence with restraint and modesty be for that reason the most ingenious virtue refine person have ever imagine to yield to the impetuosity of a inclination to be annihilate so to speak in the object loved be the method of a woman without discernment that be not love it be a liking for a moment it be to transform a lover into a spoil child i would have a woman behave with more reserve and economy a excess of ardor be not justifiable in my opinion the heart be always a impetuous charger which must be steadily curb if you do not use you strength with economy you vivacity will be nothing but a pass transport the same indifference you perceive in a lover after those convulsive emotion you yourself will experience and soon both of you will feel the necessity of separate to sum up there be more intelligence require to love than be generally suppose and to be happy in love up to the moment of the fatal yes or if you prefer up to the time of she defeat a woman do not need artifice to hold she lover curiosity excite he desire sustain he hope encourage he but once he reach the summit of he desire it be for the woman to take as much care to retain he as he exhibit in overcome she the desire to keep he should render she fertile in expedient the heart be similar to a high position easier to obtain than to keep charm be sufficient to make a man amorous to render he constant something more be necessary skill be require a little management a great deal of intelligence and even a touch of ill humor and fickleness unfortunately however as soon as woman have yield they become too tender too complaisant it would be better for the common good if they be to resist less in the beginning and more afterward i maintain that they never can forestall loathing without leave the heart something to wish for and the time to consider i hear they continually complain that we indifference be always the fruit of they complaisance for we they be ever recall the time when goad by love and sentiment we spend whole day by they side how blind they be they do not perceive that it be still in they power to bring we back to a allegiance the memory of which be so dear if they forget what they have already do for we they will not be tempt to do more but if they make we forget then we shall become more exact let they awaken we heart by oppose new difficulty arouse we anxiety in fine force we to desire new proof of a inclination the certainty of which diminish its value in we estimation they will then find less cause of complaint in we and will be better satisfied with themselves shall i frankly avow it thing would indeed change if woman would remember at the right time that they role be always that of the party to be entreat ours that of he who beg for new favor that create to grant they should never offer reserve even in a excess of passion they should guard against surrender at discretion the lover should always have something to ask and consequently he would be always submissive so as to obtain it favor without limit degrade the most seductive charm and be in the end revolt even to he who exact they society put all woman on the same level the handsome and the ugly after they defeat be indistinguishable except from they art to maintain they authority but what commonly happen a woman imagine she have nothing further to do than to be affectionate caress sweet of even temper and faithful she be right in one sense for these quality should be the foundation of she character they will not fail to draw esteem but these quality however estimable they may be if they be not offset by a shade of contrariety will not fail to extinguish love and bring on languor and weariness mortal poison for the best constitute heart do you know why lover become nauseated so easily when enjoy prosperity why they be so little pleased after have have so much pleasure it be because both party interested have a identically erroneous opinion one imagine there be nothing more to obtain the other fancy she have nothing more to give it follow as a necessary consequence that one slacken in he pursuit and the other neglect to be worthy of further advance or think she become so by the practice of solid quality reason be substitute for love and henceforward no more seasoning in they relation no more of those trifling quarrel so necessary to prevent dissatisfaction by forestall it but when i exact that evenness of temper should be animated by occasional storm do not be under the impression that i pretend lover should always be quarrel to preserve they happiness i only desire to impress it upon you that all they misunderstanding should emanate from love itself that the woman should not forget -lrb- by a species of pusillanimous kindness -rrb- the respect and attention due she that by a excessive sensitiveness she do not convert she love into a source of anxiety capable of poisoning every moment of she existence that by a scrupulous fidelity she may not render she lover too sure that he have nothing to fear on that score neither should a woman by a sweetness a unalterable evenness of temper be weak enough to pardon everything lack in she lover experience demonstrate that woman too often sacrifice the heart of they spouse or they lover by too many indulgence and facility what recklessness they martyrize themselves by sacrifice everything they spoil they and convert they into ungrateful lover so much generosity finally turn against themselves and they soon become accustomed to demand as a right what be grant they as a favor you see woman every day -lrb- even among those we despise with so much reason -rrb- who reign with a scepter of iron treat as slave man who be attach to they debase they by force of control they well these be the woman who be love longer than the other i be persuade that a woman of refinement well bring up would never think of follow such a example that military manner be repugnant to gentleness and moral and lack that decency which constitute the charm in thing even remote from virtue but let the reasonable woman soften the cloud a trifle there will always remain precisely what be necessary to hold a lover we be slave whom too much kindness often render insolent we often demand to be treat like those of the new world but we have in the bottom of we heart a comprehension of justice which tell we that the govern hand bear down upon we sometimes for very good reason and we take kindly to it now for my last word : in everything relate to the force and energy of love woman should be the sovereign it be from they we hope for happiness and they will never fail to grant we that as soon as they can govern we heart with intelligence moderate they own inclination and maintain they own authority without compromise it and without abuse it xlv what favor man consider fault to explain in two word to you satisfaction marquis this be what i think of the letter i send you yesterday : for a woman to profit by the advice of monsieur de saint-evremond it be requisite that she should be affect with only a mediocre fancy and have excite the passion of love however we shall talk about that more at large whenever it may please you now i will take up what concern you the sacrifice the countess have exact of you be well worth the price you put upon it to renounce for she sake a woman whose exterior proclaim she readiness to accord you whatever favor you might be willing to ask to renounce she publicly in the presence of she rival and with so little regard for she vanity be a effort which naturally will not pass without a proportionate recompense the countess could not have find a happier pretext for give you she portrait but to take a solemn day when the marquise receive at she home for the first time since she illness to select a moment when the moneyed woman be take up arm to make a assault of beauty upon a woman of rank to speak to she merely in pass to pretend to surrender yourself entirely to the pleasure of see she rival to entertain the latter and become one of she party be a outrage for which you will never be pardon revenge will come quickly and be as cruel as possible you will see it be i who guarantee it now for the second paragraph of you letter : you ask I whether the last favor or rather the last fault we can commit be a certain proof that a woman love you yes and no yes if you love the woman for whom you have you first passion and she be refine and virtuous but even in such a case this proof will not be any more certain or more flattering for you than all the other she may have give you of she inclination whatever a woman may do when she love even thing of the slightest essential nature in appearance be as much certain mark of she passion as those greater thing of which man be so proud i will even add that if this virtuous woman be of a certain disposition the last favor will prove less than a thousand other small sacrifice you count for nothing for then on she own behalf less than on yours she be too much interested in listen to you for you to claim the glory of have persuade she although every one else would have be accord the same favor i know a woman who permit herself to be vanquish two or three time by man she do not love and the man she really love never obtain a single favor it may happen then that the last favor prove nothing to he to whom it be grant whereas on the contrary it may happen that he owe the grant of it to the little regard have for he woman never respect themselves more than with those they esteem and you may be quite sure that it require a very imperious inclination to cause a reasonable woman to forget herself in the presence of one whose disdain she dread you pretended triumph therefore may originate in cause which so far from be glorious for you would humiliate you if you be aware of they we see for example a lover who may be repel the woman who love he fear he will escape she to pay he address to another woman more accommodate she do not wish to lose he for it be always humiliating to be abandon she yield because she be not aware of any other means of hold he they say there be nothing to reproach in this if he leave she after that at least he will be put in the wrong for since a woman become attach more by the favor she grant she imagine the man will be force into gratitude what folly woman be actuate by different motive in yield curiosity impel some they desire to know what love be another woman with few advantage of person or figure would hold she lover by the attraction of pleasure one woman be determine to make a conquest flattering to she vanity still another one surrender to pity opportunity importunity to the pleasure of take revenge on a rival or a unfaithful lover how can i enumerate they all the heart be so very strange in its vagary and the reason and cause which actuate it be so curious and vary that it be impossible to discover all the hidden spring that set it in motion but if we delude ourselves as to the means of hold you how often do man deceive themselves as to the proof of we love if they possess any delicacy of discernment they would find a thousand sign that prove more than the most signal favor grant tell I marqui what have i do to monsieur de coulange it be a month since he have set foot in my house but i will not reproach he i shall be very pleasant with he when he do come he be one of the most amiable man i be acquaint with i shall be very angry with you if you fail to bring he to I on my return from versaille i want he to sing I the last couplet he have compose i be tell they be charming xlvi why inconstancy be not injustice it be too kind of you marqui to have notice my absence if i do not write you during my sojourn in the country it be because i know you be happy and that tranquilize I i feel too that it be necessary for love to be accord some rights as its reign be usually very short and besides that friendship not have any quarrel with love i wait patiently a interval in you pleasure which would enable you to read my letter do you know what i be do while away i amuse myself by piece out all the event liable to happen in the condition you society be now in i foresee the bickering between the countess and she rival and i predict they would end in a open rupture i also guess that the marquise would not espouse the cause of the countess but would take up the other 's quarrel the moneyed woman be not quite so handsome as she rival a decisive reason for declare for she and back she up without danger what will be the upshot of all this quarrel among these woman how many revolution good heaven in so short a time you happiness seem to be the only thing that have escape you discover new reason every day for loving and esteeming this amiable countess you believe that a woman of so much real merit and with so interesting a figure will become know more and more let nothing weaken the esteem you have always have for she you have it be true obtain a avowal of she love for you but be she less estimable for that on the contrary ought not she heart to augment in price in you eye in proportion to the certainty you have acquire that you be its sole possessor even if you shall have obtain proof of she inclination we speak about recently do you think that give you any right to underrate she i can not avoid say it man like you arouse my indignation every time they imagine they claim the right to lack in courtesy for my sex and punish we for we weakness be it not the height of injustice and the depth of depravity to continue to insult the grief which be the cause of they change can not woman be inconstant without be unjust be they distaste always to be follow by some injurious act if we be guilty be it the right of he who have profit by we fault who be the cause of they to punish we always maintain for the countess the sentiment you have express in she regard do not permit a false opinion to interfere with the progress which they can still make in you heart it be not we defeat alone which should render we despicable in you eye the manner in which we have be defend deliver and guard ought to be the only measure of you disdain so madame de la fayette be of the opinion that my last letter be base upon rather a liberal foundation you see where you indiscretion lead I but she do not consider that i be no more guilty than a demonstrator of anatomy i analyze the metaphysical man as he dissect the physical one do you believe that out of regard to scruple he should omit in he operation those portion of he subject which might offer corrupted mind occasion to draw sally out of a ill regulated imagination it be not the essence of thing that cause indecency it be not the word or even the idea it be the intent of he who utter they and the depravity of he who listen madame de la fayette be certainly the last woman in the world whom i would have suspect of reproach I in that manner and to-morrow at the countess ' i will make she confess she injustice xlvii cause of quarrel among rival what i marquis astonish at the new bickering of you moneyed woman do not doubt for a instant that she employ all the refinement of coquetry to take you away from the countess she may have a liking for you but moderate you amour propre so far as that be concern for the most powerful motive of she conduct be without contradiction the desire for revenge she vanity be interested in punish she rival for have obtain the preference woman never pardon such a thing as that and if he who become the subject of the quarrel be not the first object of they anger it be because they need he to display they resentment you have encounter in the rival of the countess precisely what you exact from she to strengthen you attachment you be offer in advance the price of the attention you devote to she and from which you will soon be dispense and i think you will have so little delicacy as to accept they it be write across the heart of every man : to the easiest you should blush to deserve the least reproach from the countess what sort of a woman be it you seem to prefer to she a woman without delicacy and without love a woman who be guide only by the attraction of pleasure more vain than sensible more voluptuous than tender more passionate than affectionate she seek she cherish in you nothing but you youth and all the advantage that accompany it you know what she rival be worth you know all you wrong do with she you agree that you be a monster of ingratitude yet you be unwilling to take it upon yourself to merit she pardon truly marquis i do not understand you i be begin to believe that madame de sévigné be right when she say that she son know he duty very well and could reason like a philosopher on the subject but that he be carry away by he passion so that he be not a head fool but a heart fool -lrb- ce n'est pas par la tête qu'il est fou mais par le coeur -rrb- you recall in vain what i say to you long ago about make love in a free and easy manner you will remember that i be then enjoy myself with some jocular reflection which be not intend to be formal advice do not forget either that the question then be about a mere passing fancy and not of a ordinary mistress but the case to-day be very different you can not find among all the woman of pari a single one who can be compare with she you be so cruelly abandon and for what reason because she resistance wound you vanity what resource be leave we to hold you i agree with you nevertheless that when a passion be extinguish it can not be relight without difficulty no one be more the master of loving than he be of not loving i feel the truth of all these maxim i do homage to they with regret as soon as with a knowledge of the cause i consider that you reject what be excellent and accept the worse you renounce a solid happiness durable pleasure and yield to depraved taste and pure caprice but i can see that all my reflection will not reform you i be begin to fear that i be weary you with moral and to tell you the truth it be very ridiculous in I to preach constancy when it be certain that you do not love and that you be a heart fool i therefore abandon you to you destiny without however give up my desire to follow you into new folly why : should i be afflict would it be of any moment to assume with you the tone of a pedagogue assuredly not both of we would lose too much thereby i should become weary and you would not be reform xlviii friendship must be firm i do not conceal it marqui you conduct in regard to the countess have put I out of patience with you and i be tempt to break off all my relation with so wicked a man as you my good nature in yield to you entreaty incline I to the belief that my friendship for you border on a weakness you be right though to be you friend only so long as you follow my advice would not be true friendship the more you be to be censure the stronger ought to be my hold on you but you will understand that one be not master of he first thought whatever effort i may make to find you less guilty the sympathy i have for the misfortune of my friend be of still greater importance to I there be moment when i could not believe in you innocence and they be when so charming a woman complain of you now that she situation be improve every day i consider my harshness in my last letter almost as a crime i shall hereafter content myself with pity she without importune you any longer about she so let we resume we ordinary gait if it please you you need no longer fear my reproach i see they would be useless as well as out of place xlix constancy be a virtue among the narrow mind you do not then know marquis that it be often more difficult to get rid of a mistress than to acquire one you be learn by experience you disgust for the moneyed woman do not surprise I except that it do not happen sooner what know she character so well you could imagine that the despair she pretend at the sight of you indifference increase every day could be the effect of a veritable passion you could also be the dupe of she management i admire and i pity you blindness but be it not also vanity which aid a trifle in fortify you illusion in truth it would be a strange sort of vanity that of be love by such a woman but man be so vain that they be flatter by the love of the most confirm courtesan in any case undeceive yourself a woman who be desert when she be a woman like you beauty have nothing in view in she sorrow but she own interest she endeavor by she tear and she despair to persuade you that you person and you merit be all she regret that the loss of you heart be the summit of misfortune that she know nobody who can indemnify she for the loss of it all these sentiment be false it be not a afflict lover who speak it be a vain woman desperate at be anticipate exasperated at the lack of power in she charm worry over a plan to replace you promptly anxious to give herself a appearance of sensibility and to appear worthy of a better fate she justify this thought of monsieur de la rochefoucauld : woman do not shed tear over the lover they have have so much because they love they as to appear more worthy of be love it be for d -- to enjoy the sentiment she must indeed have a very singular idea of you to hope that she can impose upon you do you wish to know what she be the chevalier be actually without a affair of the heart on hand engage he to take you place i have not receive two letter from you that do not speak of the facility with which she will be console for have lose you a woman of she age begin to fear that she will not recover what she have lose and so she be oblige to degrade she charm by take the first new comer perhaps she sorrow be true but she deceive you as to the motive she give for it break these chain without scruple in pride yourself on you constancy and delicacy for such a object you appear to I to be as ridiculous as you be when you lack the same quality on another occasion do you remember marquis what monsieur de coulange say to we one day constancy be the virtue of people of limited merit have they profit by the caprice of a amiable woman to establish themselves in she heart the sentiment of medicrioty fix they there it intimidate they they dare not make a effort to please other too happy at have surprise she heart they be afraid of abandon a good which they may not find elsewhere and as a instant 's attention to they little worth might undeceive this woman what do they then do they elevate constancy up among the virtue they transform love into a superstition they know how to interest reason in the preservation of a heart which they owe only to caprice occasion or surprise be on you guard against imitate these shallow personage heart be the money of gallantry amiable people be the asset of society whose destiny be to circulate in it and make many happy a constant man be therefore as guilty as a miser who impede the circulation in commerce he possess a treasure which he do not utilize and of which there be so many who would make good use of it what sort of a mistress be that who be retain by force of reason what languor reign in she society what violence must one not employ to say there be love when it have cease to exist it be seldom that passion cease in both party at the same time and then constancy be a veritable tyrant i compare it to the tyrant of antiquity who put people to death by tie they to dead body constancy condemn we to the same punishment discard such a baleful precedent to the liberty of association believe I follow you taste for the court lady you mention she may weary you at time it be true but at least she will not degrade you if as you say she be as little intelligent as she be beautiful she reign will soon be over you place in she heart will soon be vacant and i do not doubt that another or even several other gallantry will follow yours perhaps you will not wait for the end for i see by you letter that you be become a man of fashion the new system you have adopt make it certain nothing can be better arrange never finish one affair without have commence another never withdraw from the first except in proportion as the second one progress nothing can be better but in spite of such wise precaution you may find yourself destitute of any as for example some event beyond the reach of human foresight may interfere with these arrangement may have for principle always to finish with all the mistress at once before enable you to find any one to keep you busy during the interregnum i feel free to confess marquis that such a arrangement be as prudent as can be imagine and i do not doubt that you will be well please with a plan so wisely conceive adieu i do not know where i obtain the courage to write you such long and foolish letter i find a secret charm in entertaining you which i should suspect if i do not know my heart so well i have be reflect that it be now without any affair and i must henceforth be on my guard against you for you have very often think proper to say very tender thing to I and i might think proper to believe in they sincerity l some woman be very cunning you may derive as much amusement out of it as you wish marquis but i shall continue to tell you that you be not fascinate by madame la presidente believe I when i say that i see more clearly into you affair than you do yourself i have know a hundred good man who like you pretend with the best faith in the world that they be amorous but who in truth be not in any manner whatsoever there be malady of the heart as well as malady of the body some be real and some be imaginary not everything that attract you toward a woman be love the habit of be together the convenience of see each other to get away from one 's self the necessity for a little gallantry the desire to please in a word a thousand other reason which do not resemble a passion in the least these be what you generally take to be love and the woman be the first to fortify this error always flatter by the homage render they provide they vanity profit by it they rarely inquire into the motive to which they owe it but after all be they not right they would nearly always lose by it to all the motive of which i have just speak you can add still another quite as capable of create a illusion in the nature of you sentiment madame la presidente be without contradiction the most beautiful woman of we time she be newly marry she refuse the homage of the most amiable man of we acquaintance perhaps nothing could be more flattering to you vanity than to make a conquest which would not fail to give you the kind of celebrity to which you aspire that my dear marquis be what you call love and it will be difficult for you to disabuse yourself of the impression for by force of persuade yourself that it be love you will in a short time firmly believe that the inclination be real it will be a very singular thing some day to see with what dignity you will speak of you pretended sentiment with what good faith you will believe that they deserve recognition and what will be still more agreeable will be the deference you will believe should be they due but unfortunately the result will undeceive you and you will then be the first to laugh at the importance with which you treat so silly a affair shall i tell you how far injustice reach i be fully persuade that you will not become more amorous henceforth you will have nothing but a pass taste frivolous relation engagement caprice all the arrow of love will glance from you it be true you will not experience its pang but will you enjoy in the least its sweetness can you hope ever to recover from the fantasy to which you surrender yourself those moment of delight which be formerly you supreme felicity i have no desire to flatter you but i believe it my duty to do you this much justice : you heart be intend for refined pleasure it be not i who hold you responsible for the dissipation in which you be plunge it be the young fool around you they call enjoyment the abuse they make of pleasure they example carry you away but this intoxication will be dissipate sooner or later and you will soon see at least i hope so that you have be deceive in two way in the state of you heart you think it be fascinate by madame la presidente you will recognize you mistake you think she have cease to have a inclination for -- but i hold to the word i have utter perhaps there will come a time when i shall be at liberty to express my thought more freely now i reply to the remainder of you letter confess it marqui that you have little else to do this morning when you re-read my letter i add that you must have be in a bad humor to undertake they criticism some brilliant engagement some flattering rendezvous be want but i do not care to elude the difficulty so i seem to contradict myself sometimes if i be to admit that it might very well be if i be to give you the same answer that monsieur de la bruyère give he critic the other day : it be not i who contradict myself it be the heart upon which i reason could you reasonably conclude from it that everything i have say to you be false i do not believe it but how do i know in effect if lead away by the various situation in which you be place i may not have appear to destroy what i have advance on different occasion how do i know if see you ready to yield to a whim i may not have carry too far truth which feebly utter would not perhaps have bring you back how do i know in a word if be interested in the happiness of a friend the desire to serve she may not have sometimes diminish my sincerity i think i be very good natured to reply seriously to the worry you have cause I ought i not first to take cognizance of the fact that there be more malice in you letter than criticism this will be the last time you will have a opportunity to abuse my simplicity i be go to console myself for you perfidy with some one who be assuredly not so wicked as you what a pity it be that you be not a woman it would give I so much pleasure to discuss the new coiffure with you i never see anything so extravagant as they height at least marquis remember that if madame la presidente do not wear one of they incessantly you can no longer remain attach to she with decency li the part man and woman play so the affair have be decide whatever i may say of it you be the master of madame la presidente a beloved rival have be sacrifice for you and you triumph how prompt you vanity be to make profit out of everything i would laugh heartily if you pretended triumph should end by you receive notice to quit some fine morning for it may well be that this sacrifice of which you boast so much be nothing but a stratagem ever since you have be associate with woman have you not establish as a principle that you must be on you guard against the sentiment they affect if you beauty have accept you merely for the purpose of re-awaken a languish love in the heart of she celadon if you be only the instrument of jealousy on the part of one and artifice on the other would that be a miracle you say that madame la presidente be not very shrewd and consequently incapable of such a ruse my dear marqui love be a great tutor and the most stupid woman -lrb- in other respects -rrb- have often a acute discernment more accurate and more certain than any other when it come to a affair of the heart but let we leave this particular thesis and examine man in general who be in the same situation as you they all believe as you do that the sacrifice of a rival suppose some superiority over he but how often do it happen that this same sacrifice be only a by play if it be sincere the woman either love the rival or she do not if she love he then as soon as she leave he it be a sure proof that she love he no longer in which case what glory be there for you in such a preference if she do not love he what can you infer to you advantage from a pretended victory over a man who be indifferent to she there be also another case where you may be prefer without that preference be any more flattering it be when the vanity of the woman you attack be stronger than she inclination for the disgraced lover you rank you figure you reputation you fortune may determine she in you favor it be very rare -lrb- i say it to the shame of woman and man be no less ridiculous in that respect -rrb- it be rare i repeat that a lover who have nothing but noble sentiment to offer can long hold he own against a man distinguish for he rank or he position who have servant a livery a equipage etc when the most tender lover make a woman blush for he appearance when she dare not acknowledge he as she conqueror when she do not even consider he as a object she can sacrifice with eclat i predict that he reign will be short she reason for get rid of he will be to she a embarrassment of choice thus the defunct of la presidente be a counsellor of state without doubt as dull and as stiff as he wig what a figure to set up against a courtier against a warrior like you well will you believe in my prediction another time what do i tell you do the chevalier find it difficult to persuade you penelope this desolate woman ready to break she heart give you a successor in less than fifteen day love he prove it and be flout be this lose too much time what be you opinion lii love be a traitor with sharp claw yes indeed marqui it be due to my friendship it be due to my counsel that the countess owe the tranquillity she begin to enjoy and i can not conceive the chagrin which cause the indifference she manifest for you i be very far however from desire to complain of you you grief spring from a wounded vanity man be very unjust they expect a woman always to consider they as object interesting to they while they in abandon a woman do not ordinarily omit anything that will express they disdain of what importance to you be the hatred or love of a person whom you do not love tell I that you jealousy of the little duke be so unreasonable that i burst out laugh when i learn it be it not quite simple altogether natural that a woman should console herself for you loss by listen to a man who know the value of she heart better than you by what right if you please do you venture to take exception to it you must admit that madame de sévigné be right : you have a foolish heart my poor marquis in spite of all that the part you wish I to play in the matter appear to I to be exceedingly agreeable i can understand how nice it would be to aid you in you plan of vengeance against a unfaithful woman though it should be only through rancor or the oddity of the thing we must love each other but all such comedy turn out badly generally love be a traitor who scratch we when we play with he so marquis keep you heart i be very scrupulous about interfere with so precious a association moreover i be so disgusted with the staleness of man that henceforth i desire they only as friend there be always a bone to pick with a lover i be begin to understand the value of rest and i wish to enjoy it i will return to this however it would be very strange if you take the notion that you need consolation and that my situation exact the same succor because the marquis de -- have depart on he embassy undeceive yourself my friend suffice I and if you wish to remain among they number at least do not think of say any more gallant thing to I otherwise -- adieu marquis liii old age not a preventive against attack oh i shall certainly abandon you interest if you persist in talk to I in such fashion what demon inspire you with the idea of take the place of the absent could any one tease another as you do I last evening i do not know how you begin it but however much i desire to be angry with you it be impossible for I to do so i do not know how this will end what be certain however be it will be useless for you to go on for i have decide not to love you and what be worse i shall never love you yes sir never eh truly but this be a strange thing to attempt to persuade a woman that she be afflict that she need consolation when she assure you that it be not the fact and that she want for nothing this be drive thing with a tight hand i entreat you reflect a little on the folly that have seize upon you would it be decent tell I that if i be to take the place of my friend that a woman who have serve you as a mentor who have play the role of mother to you should aspire to that of lover unprincipled wretch that you be if you so promptly abandon a young and lovely woman what would you do with a old girl like I perhaps you wish to attempt my conquest to see whether love be for I the same in practice as in theory do not go to the trouble of attempt such a seduction i will satisfy you curiosity on that point immediately you know that whatever we be woman seldom follow any give principle well that be what you would discover in any gallant association you aspire to form with I all i have say about woman and love have not give you any information as to my line of conduct on such a occasion there be a vast difference between feeling and thinking between talk for one 's own account and plead the cause of another you would therefore find in I many singularity that might strike you unfavorably i do not feel as other woman you might know they all without know ninon and believe I the novelty you would discover would not compensate you for the trouble you might take to please I it be useless to exaggerate the value you put upon my conquest that i tell you plainly you be expend too much on hope i be not able to respond remain where you be in a brilliant career the court offer you a thousand beautiful woman with whom you do not risk as you would with I become weary of philosophy of too much intelligence i do not disguise the fact however that i would have be glad to see you to-day my head be split all the afternoon over a dispute on the ancient and modern i be still out of humor on the subject and feel tempt to agree with you that i be not so far along on the decline of life as to confine myself to science and especially to the gentleman of antiquity if you could only restrain yourself and pay I fewer compliment it be not to be doubt that i would prefer to have you come and enliven my serious occupation rather than any one else but you be such a unmanageable man so wicked that i be afraid to invite you to come and sup with I to-morrow i be mistaken for it be now two hour after midnight and i recollect that my letter will not be hand you before noon so it be to-day i shall expect you have you any fault to find it be a formal rendezvous to be sure but let the fearlessness in appoint it be a proof that i be not very much afraid of you and that i shall believe in as much of you soft talk as i deem proper you understand that it will not be i who can be impose upon by that i know man so well -- liv a shrewd but not a unusual scheme this be not the time marquis to hide from you the true sentiment of the countess in you regard however much i have be able to keep she secret without betray she friendship and i have always do so if i conceal from you what i be go to communicate you may one day justly reproach I whatever infidelity you may have be guilty of whatever care i have be able to take to persuade she that you have be entirely forget she have never cease to love you tenderly although she have seek to punish you by a assume indifference she have never think of deprive herself of the pleasure of see you and it have be through the complaisance of the countess that i have sometimes worry you it be to goad you into visit I more frequently but all these scheme have not be able to satisfy a heart so deeply wounded and she be on the point of execute a design i have all along be oppose to you will learn all about it by read the letter she write I yesterday and which i inclose in this from the countess to mademoiselle de l'enclos if you wish to remain my friend my dear ninon cease to combat my resolution you know it be not the inspiration of the moment it be not the fruit of a momentary mortification a imprudent vexation nor despair i have never conceal it from you the possession of the heart of the marquis de sévigné might have be my supreme felicity if i could have flatter myself with have it forever i be certain of lose it if i have grant he the favor he exact of I he inconstancy have teach I that a different conduct would not be a sure means of retain a lover i must renounce love forever since man be incapable of have a liaison with a woman as tender but as pure as that of simple friendship you yourself well know that i be not sufficiently cure to see the marquis without always suffer flight be the only remedy for my malady and that be what i be about to take i do not fear moreover what the world may say about my withdrawal to the country i have caution those who might be surprise it be know that i have win in a considerable action against the heir of my late husband i have give out that i be go to take possession of the estate award I i will thus deprive the public of the satisfaction of misinterpret my taste for solitude and the marquis of all suspicion that he be in any manner to blame for it i inclose he letter and he portrait good heaven how weak i be why should it cost my heart so much to get rid of a evil so fatal to my repose but it be do and my determination can not be shake pity I however and remember my dear friend the promise you give I to make he understand that i have for he the most profound indifference whoever break off relation with a lover in too public a manner suggest resentment and regret at be force to do so it be a honest way of say that one would ask nothing better than to be appease as i have no desire to resume my relation with the marquis return he what i send but in the manner agree upon and pray he to make a similar restitution you may tell he that the management of my property oblige I to leave paris for a time but do not speak of I first i should be inconsolable at leave you my dear ninon if i do not hope that you would visit I in my solitude you write willingly to you friend if you judge they by the tenderness and esteem they have for you in that case you have none more worthy of that title than i i rely therefore upon you letter until you come to share my retreat you know my sentiment for you i have no advice to give you marqui on what you have just read the sole favor i expect from you be never to compromise I for the indiscretion i commit and that the countess shall never have any reason for not forgive I all i can say to justify myself in my own eye be that you have love the countess too much for she resolution to be a matter of absolute indifference to you have i be just i would have betray both by leave you in ignorance of she design lv a happy end i be delighted with everything you have do and you be charming do not doubt it you behavior my entreaty and better than all love will overcome the resistance of the countess everything should conspire to determine she to accept the offer you have make of you hand i could even from this time on assure you that pride alone will resist we effort and she own inclination this morning i press she earnestly to decide in you favor she last entrenchment be the fear of new infidelity on you part reassure yourself say i in proof that the marquis will be faithful to you be the fact that he have be undeceived about the other woman by compare they with she he be leave honest people permit themselves only a certain number of caprice and the marquis have have those which he age and position in society seem to justify he yield to they at a time when they be pardonable he pay tribute to the fashion by tasting of all the ridiculous thing go henceforth he can be reasonable with impunity a man can not be expect to be amorous of he wife but should he be it will be pardon he as soon as people see you you risk nothing therefore countess you yourself have put on the air of a society woman but you be too sensible not to abandon such a role you renounce it the marquis imitate you wherefore forget he mistake could you bear the reproach of have cause the death of so amiable a man it would be a act that would cry out for vengeance in a word i besought and press she but she be still irresolute still i do not doubt that you will finish by overcome a resistance which she herself already deem very embarrassing well marquis if the anxiety all this have cause you give you the time to review what i have be say to you for several day past might you not be tempt to believe that i have contradict myself at first i advise you to treat love lightly and to take only so much of it as might amuse you you be to be nothing but a gallant and have no relation with woman except those in which you could easily break the tie i then speak to you in a general way and relative to ordinary woman could i imagine that you would be so fortunate as to meet a woman like the countess who would unite the charm of she sex to the quality of honest man what must be you felicity you be go to possess in one and the same person the most estimable friend and a most charming mistress deign to admit I to share a third portion of you friendship and my happiness will equal you own can one be

saint-evremond and be very curious inasmuch as they be write when ninon and saint-evremond be in they eighty saint-evremond always claim that he extremely long and vigorous life be due to the same cause which ninon de l'enclo attribute to she great age that be to a unflagging zeal in observe the doctrine of the epicurean philosophy these idea appear in he letter to mademoiselle de l'enclos

believe that you mind would last as long as yourself but we be not so sure of the health of the body without which nothing be leave but sorrowful reflection i insensibly begin make they on all occasion here be another chapter it relate to a handsome youth whose desire to see honest people in the different country of the world induce he to surreptitiously abandon a opulent home perhaps you will censure he curiosity but the thing be do he know many thing but he be ignorant of other which one of he age should ignore i deem he worthy of pay you a visit to make he begin to feel that he have not lose he time by journey to england treat he well for love of I i begged he elder brother who be my particular friend to obtain news of madame la duchesse mazarin and of madame harvey both of whom wish to remember I x saint-evremond to ninon de l'enclos why do love diminish after marriage translator 's note -- two of ninon 's friend whom she idolize be very much surprised to discover after they marriage that the great passion they feel for each other before marriage become feebler every day and that even they affection be grow colder it trouble they and in they anxiety they consult mademoiselle de l'enclos beg she to find some reason in she philosophy why the possession of the object love should weaken the strength of ante-nuptial passion and even destroy the most ardent affection the question be discuss by ninon and she bird for several day without reach a opinion that be in any manner satisfactory it be therefore resolve to consult saint-evremond who be live in exile in england after write he all the particulars and the discussion that have be hold with opinion pro and con he send the following letter in reply which be unanswerable upon the subject moreover it contain lesson that should be carefully study and well learn by all loving heart who desire to maintain they early affection for each other during life the letter be a masterpiece of the philosophy of love and it be remarkable in that it develop trait in human nature upon the subject of love and marriage which be overlook in question applicable to the relation between the sex and that be so often strain to the breaking point indeed it give clue to a remedy which can not fail to effect a cure \* \* \* \* \* my opinion be exactly in line with yours mademoiselle it be not always as some think hymen or the possession of the loved object which of itself destroy love the true source of the dissatisfaction that follow exist in the unintelligent manner of economize the sentiment a too complete too easy and too prolonged possession when we have yield to the transport of a passion without reserve the tremendous shock to the soul can not fail quickly to leave it in a profound solitude the heart find itself in a void which alarm and chill it we vainly seek outside of ourselves the cause of the calm which follow we fit of passion we do not perceive that a equal and more enduring happiness would have be the fruit of moderation make a exact analysis of what take place within you when you desire anything you will find that you desire be nothing but curiosity and this curiosity which be one of the force of the heart satisfied we desire vanish whoever therefore would hold a spouse or a lover should leave he something to be desire something new should be expect every day for the morrow diversify he pleasure procure for he the charm of variety in the same object and i will vouch for he perseverance in fidelity i confess however that hymen or what you call you defeat be in a ordinary woman the grave of love but then it be less upon the lover that the blame fall than upon she who complain of the cooling of the passion she cast upon the depravity of the heart what be due to she own unskillfulness and she lack of economy she have expend in a single day everything that might keep alive the inclination she have excite she have nothing more to offer to the curiosity of she lover she become always the same statue no variety to be hope for and she lover know it well but in the woman i have in mind it be the aurora of a lovelier day it be the beginning of the most satisfying pleasure i understand by effusion of the heart those mutual confidence those ingenuity those unexpected avowal and those transport which excite in we the certainty of create a absolute happiness and merit all the esteem of the person we love that day be in a word the epoch when a man of refinement discover inexhaustible treasure which have always be hide from he the freedom a woman acquire bring into play all the sentiment which constraint have hold in reserve she heart take a lofty flight but one well under control time far from lead to loathing will furnish new reason for a greater love but to repeat i assume sufficient intelligence in she to be able to control she inclination for to hold a lover it be not enough -lrb- perhaps it be too much -rrb- to love passionately she must love with prudence with restraint and modesty be for that reason the most ingenious virtue refine person have ever imagine to yield to the impetuosity of a inclination to be annihilate so to speak in the object loved be the method of a woman without discernment that be not love it be a liking for a moment it be to transform a lover into a spoil child i would have a woman behave with more reserve and economy a excess of ardor be not justifiable in my opinion the heart be always a impetuous charger which must be steadily curb if you do not use you strength with economy you vivacity will be nothing but a pass transport the same indifference you perceive in a lover after those convulsive emotion you yourself will experience and soon both of you will feel the necessity of separate to sum up : there be more intelligence require to love than be generally suppose and to be happy in love up to the moment of the fatal yes or if you prefer up to the time of she defeat a woman do not need artifice to hold she lover curiosity excite he desire sustain he hope encourage he but once he reach the summit of he desire it be for the woman to take as much care to retain he as he exhibit to overcome she the desire to keep he should render she fertile in expedient the heart be similar to a high position easier to obtain than to keep charm be sufficient to make a man amorous to render he constant something more be necessary skill be require a little management a great deal of intelligence and even a touch of ill humor and inequality unfortunately however as soon as woman have yield they become too tender too complaisant it would be better for the common good if they be to resist less in the beginning and more afterward i maintain that they never can forestall loathing without leave the heart something to wish for and the time to consider i hear they continually complain that we indifference be always the fruit of they complaisance for we they be ever recall the time when goad by love and sentiment we spend whole day by they side how blind they be they do not perceive that it be still in they power to bring we back to a allegiance the memory of which be so dear if they forget what they have already do for we they will not be tempt to do more but if they make we forget then we shall become more exact let they awaken we heart by oppose new difficulty arouse we anxiety in fine force we to desire new proof of a inclination the certainty of which diminish the value in we estimation they will then find less cause of complaint in we and will be better satisfied with themselves shall i frankly avow it thing would indeed change if woman would remember at the right time that they role be always that of the party to be entreat ours that of he who beg for new favor that create to grant they should never offer reserve even in a excess of passion they should guard against surrender at discretion the lover should always have something to ask and consequently he would be always submissive so as to obtain it favor without limit degrade the most seductive charm and be in the end revolt even to he who exact they society put all woman on the same level the handsome and the ugly after they defeat be indistinguishable except from they art to maintain they authority but what commonly happen a woman imagine she have nothing more to do than to be affectionate caress sweet of even temper and faithful she be right in one sense for these quality should be the foundation of she character they will not fail to draw esteem but these quality however estimable they may be if they be not offset by a shade of contrariety will not fail to extinguish love and bring on languor and weariness mortal poison for the best constitute heart do you know why lover become nauseated so easily when enjoy prosperity why they be so little pleased after have have so much pleasure it be because both party interested have a identically erroneous opinion one imagine there be nothing more to obtain the other fancy she have nothing more to give it follow as a necessary consequence that one slacken in he pursuit and the other neglect to be worthy of further advance or think she become so by the practice of solid quality reason be substitute for love and hence-forward no more spicy seasoning in they relation no more of those trifling quarrel so necessary to prevent dissatisfaction by forestall it but when i exact that evenness of temper should be animated by occasional storm do not be under the impression that i pretend lover should always be quarrel to preserve they happiness i only desire to impress it upon you that all they misunderstanding should emanate from love itself that the woman should not forget -lrb- by a species of pusillanimous kindness -rrb- the respect and attention due she that by a excessive sensitiveness she do not convert she love into a source of anxiety capable of poisoning every moment of she existence that by a scrupulous fidelity she may not render she lover too sure that he have nothing to fear on that score neither should a woman by a sweetness a unalterable evenness of temper be weak enough to pardon everything lack in she lover experience demonstrate that woman too often sacrifice the heart of they spouse or they lover by too many indulgence and facility what recklessness they martyrize themselves by sacrifice everything they spoil they and convert they into ungrateful lover so much generosity finally turn against themselves and they soon become accustomed to demand as a right what be grant they as a favor you see woman every day -lrb- even among those we despise with so much reason -rrb- who reign with a scepter of iron treat as slave man who be attach to they debase they by force of control they well these be the woman who be love longer than the other i be persuade that a woman of refinement well bring up would never think of follow such a example that military manner be repugnant to gentleness and moral and lack that decency which constitute the charm in thing even remote from virtue but let the reasonable woman soften the cloud a trifle there will always remain precisely what be necessary to hold a lover we be slave whom too much kindness often render insolent we often demand to be treat like those of the new world but we have in the bottom of we heart a comprehension of justice which tell we that the govern hand bear down upon we sometimes for very good reason and we take kindly to it now for my last word in everything relate to the force and energy of love woman should be the sovereign it be from they we hope for happiness and they will never fail to grant we that as soon as they can govern we heart with intelligence moderate they own inclination and maintain they own authority without compromise it and without abuse it xi ninon de l'enclo to saint-evremond few people resist age a sprightly mind be dangerous to friendship you

be worth remember and we hear little advice that be worth follow however degenerate may be the sens of the age at which i be live the impression which agreeable object make upon they appear to I to be

which sustain it and render it sensible of the memory of a friend whose absence have not efface he image i often tell the old story in which d'elbène de charleval and the chevalier de riviere cheer up

I long ago that i should die of reflection i try not to make any more and to forget on the morrow the thing i live through today everybody tell I that i have less to complain of at one time than at another be that as it may have i be propose such a life i should have hang myself we hold on to a ugly body however as something agreeable we love to feel comfort and ease appetite be something i still enjoy would to heaven i could try my stomach with yours and talk of the old friend we have know the memory of whom give I more pleasure than the presence of many people i now meet there be something good in all that but to tell you the truth there be no comparison m de clerambault often ask I if he resemble he father in mental attainment no i always answer he but i hope from he presumption that he believe this no to be of advantage to he and perhaps there be some who would have so consider it what a comparison between the present epoch and that through which we have pass you be go to write madame sandwich but i believe she have go to the country she know all about you sentiment for she she will tell you more news about this country than i have gauge and comprehend everything she know all my haunt and have find means of make herself perfectly at home xviii saint-evremond to ninon de l'enclos life be joyous when it be without sorrow the very last letter i receive from mademoiselle de l'enclos always seem to I to be better than the precede one it be not because the sentiment of present pleasure dim the memory of the past but the true reason be you mind be become stronger and more fortified every day if it be the same with the body as with the mind i should badly sustain this stomach combat of which you speak i want to make a trial of mine against that of madame sandwich at a banquet give by lord jersey i be not the vanquish everybody know the spirit of madame sandwich i see she good taste in the extraordinary esteem she have for you i be not overcome by the praise she shower upon you any more than i be by my appetite you belong to every nation esteem alike in london as in paris you belong to every age of the world and when i say that you be a honor to mine youth will immediately name you to give luster to theirs there you be mistress of the present and of the past may you have you share of the right to be so consider in the future i have not reputation in view for that be assure to all time the one thing i regard as the most essential be life of which eight day be worth more than century of post mortem glory if any one have formerly propose to you to live as you be now live you would have hang yourself -lrb- the expression please I -rrb- however you be satisfy with ease and comfort after have enjoy the liveliest emotion l'esprit vous satisfait ou du moin vous console : mai on préférerait de vivre jeune et folle et laisser aux vieillard exempt de passion la triste gravité de leurs reflexion -lrb- mental joy satisfy you at least they console but a young jolly life we prefer on the whole and to old chap exempt from passion 's sharp sting leave the sad recollection of former good thing -rrb- nobody can make more of youth than i and as i be hold to it by memory i be follow you example and fit in with the present as well as i know how would to heaven madame mazarin have be of you opinion she would still be live but she desire to die the beauty of the world madame sandwich be leave for the country and depart admire in london as she be in paris live ninon life be joyous when it be without sorrow i pray you to forward this note to m l'abbé de hautefeuille who be with madame la duchesse de bouillon i sometimes meet the friend of m l'abbé duboi who complain that they be forget assure he of my humble regard translator 's note -- the above be the last letter saint-evremond ever write mademoiselle de l'enclo and with the exception of one more letter to he friend count magalottus councillor of state to he royal highness the grand duke of tuscany he never write any other die shortly afterward at the age of about ninety he last letter end with this peculiar epicurean thought in poetry : je vis éloigné de la france sans besoins et sans abondance content d'un vulgaire destin j' aime la vertu sans rudesse j' aime le plaisir sans mollesse j' aime la vie et n'en crain pas la fin -lrb- i be live far away from france no want indeed no abundance content to dwell in humble sphere virtue i love without roughness pleasure i love without softness life too whose end i do not fear -rrb- doctrine of epicurus explain by marshal de saint-evremond in a letter to the modern leontium -lrb- ninon de l'enclo -rrb- to the modern leontium -lrb- ninon de l'enclo -rrb- be the moral doctrine of the philosopher epicurus as applicable to modern time it be a elucidation of the principle advocate by that philosopher by charle de saint-evremond maréchal of france a great philosopher scholar poet warrior and profound admirer of mademoiselle de l'enclos he die in exile in england and he tomb may be find in westminster abbey in a conspicuous part of the nave where he remains be deposit by englishman who regard he as illustrious for he virtue learn and philosophy he give the name leontium to mademoiselle de l'enclo and the letter be write to she under that sobriquet the reasoning in it will enable the reader to understand the life and character of ninon inasmuch as it be the foundation of she education and form she character during a extraordinarily long career it be intend to bring down to its date the true philosophical principle of epicurus who appear to have be grossly misunderstand and he doctrine foully misinterpret leontium be a athenian woman who become celebrated for she taste for philosophy particularly for that of epicurus and for she close intimacy with the great man of athen she live during the third century before the christian era and she mode of life be similar to that of mademoiselle de l'enclos she add to great personal beauty intellectual brilliancy of the highest degree and dare to write a learn treatise against the eloquent theophrastus thereby incur the dislike of cicero the distinguished orator and pliny the philosopher the latter intimate that it might be well for she to select a tree upon which to hang herself pliny and other philosopher heap abuse upon she for daring as a woman to do such a unheard of thing as to write a treatise on philosophy and particularly for have the assurance to contradict theophrastus the letter you wish to know whether i have fully consider the doctrine of epicurus which be attribute to I i can claim the honor of have do so but i do not care to claim a merit i do not possess and which you will say ingenuously do not belong to I i labor under a great disadvantage on account of the numerous spurious treatise which be print in my name as though i be the author of they some though well write i do not claim because they be not of my write moreover among the thing i have write there be many stupidity i do not care to take the trouble of repudiate such thing for the reason that at my age one hour of well regulate life be of more interest and benefit to I than a mediocre reputation how difficult it be you see to rid one 's self of amour propre i quit it as a author and reassume it as a philosopher feel a secret pleasure in manipulate what other be anxious about the word pleasure recall to mind the name of epicurus and i confess that of all the opinion of the philosopher concern the supreme good there be none which appear to I to be so reasonable as he it would be useless to urge reason a hundred time repeat by the epicurean that the love of pleasure and the extinction of pain be the first and most natural inclination remark in all man that riches power honor and virtue contribute to we happiness but that the enjoyment of pleasure let we say voluptuousness to include everything in a word be the veritable aim and end whither tend all human act this be very clear to I in fact self-evident and i be fully persuade of its truth however i do not know very well in what the pleasure or voluptuousness of epicurus consist for i never see so many different opinion of any one as those of the moral of this philosopher philosopher and even he own disciple have condemn he as sensual and indolent magistrate have regard he doctrine as pernicious to the public cicero so just and so wise in he opinion plutarch so much esteem for he fair judgment be not favorable to he and so far as christianity be concern the father have represent he to be the greatest and the most dangerous of all impious man so much for he enemy now for he partisan : metrodorus hermachus meneceus and numerous other who philosophize accord to he school have as much veneration as friendship for he personally diogene laerte could not have write he life to better advantage for he reputation lucretius adore he seneca as much of a enemy of the sect as he be speak of he in the highest term if some city hold he in horror other erect statue in he honor and if among the christian the father have condemn he gassendus and bernier approve he principle in view of all these contrary authority how can the question be decide shall i say that epicurus be a corruptor of good moral on the faith of a jealous philosopher of a disgruntled disciple who would have be delight in he resentment to go to the length of inflict a personal injury moreover have epicurus intend to destroy the idea of providence and the immortality of the soul be it not reasonable to suppose that the world would have revolt against so scandalous a doctrine and that the life of the philosopher would have be attack to discredit he opinion more easily if therefore i find it difficult to believe what he enemy and the envious have publish against he i should also easily credit what he partisan have urge in he defense i do not believe that epicurus desire to broach a voluptuousness harsher than the virtue of the stoic such a jealousy of austerity would appear to I extraordinary in a voluptuary philosopher from whatever point of view that word may be consider a fine secret that to declaim against a virtue which destroy sentiment in a sage and establish one that admit of no operation the sage accord to the stoic be a man of insensible virtue that of the epicurean a immovable voluptuary the former suffer pain without have any pain the latter enjoy voluptuousness without be voluptuous -- a pleasure without pleasure with what object in view could a philosopher who deny the immortality of the soul mortify the sens why divorce the two party compose of the same element whose sole advantage be in a concert of union for they mutual pleasure i pardon we religious devotee who diet on herb in the hope that they will obtain a eternal felicity but that a philosopher who know no other good than that to be find in this world that a doctor of voluptuousness should diet on bread and water to reach sovereign happiness in this life be something my intelligence refuse to contemplate i be surprise that the voluptuousness of such a epicurean be not found upon the idea of death for consider the misery of life he sovereign good must be at the end of it believe I if horace and petronius have view it as paint they would never have accept epicurus as they master in the science of pleasure the piety for the god attribute to he be no less ridiculous than the mortification of the sens these slothful god of whom there be nothing to be hope or fear these impotent god who do not deserve the labor and fatigue attendant upon they worship let no one say that worshiper go to the temple through fear of displease the magistrate and of scandalize the people for they would have scandalize they less by refuse to assist in they worship than shock they by writings which destroy the established god or at least ruin the confidence of the people in they protection but you ask I : what be you opinion of epicurus you believe neither he friend nor he enemy neither he adversary nor he partisan what be the judgment you have form i believe epicurus be a very wise philosopher who at time and on certain occasion love the pleasure of repose or the pleasure of movement from this difference in the grade of voluptuousness have spring all the reputation accord he timocrate and he other opponent attack he on account of he sensual pleasure those who defend he do not go beyond he spiritual voluptuousness when the former denounce he for the expense he be at in he repast i be persuade that the accusation be well found when the latter expatiate upon the small quantity of cheese he require to have better cheer than usual i believe they do not lack reason when they say he philosophize with leontium they say well when they say that epicurus divert himself with she they do not lie accord to solomon there be a time to laugh and a time to weep accord to epicurus there be a time to be sober and a time to be sensual to go still further than that be a man uniformly voluptuous all he life religiously speak the greatest libertine be sometimes the most devout in the study of wisdom the most indulgent in pleasure sometimes become the most austere for my own part i view epicurus from a different standpoint in youth and health than when old and infirm ease and tranquillity these comfort of the infirm and slothful can not be better express than in he writings sensual voluptuousness be not less well explain by cicero i know that nothing be omit either to destroy or elude it but can conjecture be compare with the testimony of cicero who be intimately acquaint with the greek philosopher and they philosophy it would be better to reject the inequality of mind as a inconstancy of human nature where exist the man so uniform of temperament that he do not manifest contrariety in he conversation and action solomon merit the name of sage as much as epicure for less and he belie himself equally in he sentiment and conduct montaigne when still young believe it necessary to always think of death in order to be always ready for it approach old age however he recant so he say be willing to permit nature to gently guide he and teach he how to die m bernier the great partisan of epicurus avow to-day that after philosophize for fifty year i doubt thing of which i be once most assure all object have different phase and the mind which be in perpetual motion view they from different aspect as they revolve before it hence it may be say that we see the same thing under different aspect think at the same time that we have discover something new moreover age bring great change in we inclination and with a change of inclination often come a change of opinion add that the pleasure of the sens sometimes give rise to contempt for mental gratification as too dry and unproductive and that the delicate and refined pleasure of the mind in they turn scorn the voluptuousness of the sens as gross so no one should be surprise that in so great a diversity of aspect and movement epicurus who write more than any other philosopher should have treat the same subject in a different manner accord as he have perceive they from different point of view what avail this general reasoning to show that he might have be sensible to all kind of pleasure let he be consider accord to he relation with the other sex and nobody will believe that he spend so much time with leontium and with themista for the sole purpose of philosophize but if he love the enjoyment of voluptuousness he conduct himself like a wise man indulgent to the movement of nature oppose to its struggle never mistake chastity for a virtue always consider luxury as a vice he insist upon sobriety as a economy of the appetite and that the repast in which one indulge should never injure he who partake he motto be : sic praesentibus voluptatibus utari ut futuri non nocea he disentangle pleasure from the anxiety which precede and the disgust which follow they when he become infirm and suffer pain he place the sovereign good in ease and rest and wisely to my notion from the condition he be in for the cessation of pain be the felicity of those who suffer it as to tranquillity of mind which constitute another part of happiness it be nothing but a simple exemption from anxiety or worry but whoso can not enjoy agreeable movement be happy in be guarantee from the sensation of pain after say this much i be of the opinion that ease and tranquillity constitute the sovereign good for epicurus when he be infirm and feeble for a man who be in a condition to enjoy pleasure i believe that health make itself feel by something more active than ease or indolence as a good disposition of the soul demand something more animated than will permit a state of tranquillity we be all live in the midst of a infinity of good and evil thing with sens capable of be agreeably affect by the former and injure by the latter without so much philosophy a little reason will enable we to enjoy the good as deliciously as possible and accommodate ourselves to the evil as patiently as we can end of the project gutenberg ebook of life letter and epicurean philosophy of ninon de l'enclos the celebrated beauty of the seventeenth century by
