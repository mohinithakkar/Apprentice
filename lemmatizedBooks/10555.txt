consummate by the deposition and murder of the sovereign of the country it be equally undeniable that during its first period the person who most attract and rivet attention be the queen one of the moat brilliant of modern french writer -lrb- 1 -rrb- have recently remark that in spite of the number of year which have elapse since the grave close over the sorrow of marie antoinette and of the almost unbroken series of exciting event which have mark the annals of france in the interval the interest excite by she story be as fresh and engrossing as ever that such as hecuba and andromache be to the ancient object never name to inattentive ear never contemplate without lively sympathy such still be they hapless queen to all honest and intelligent frenchman it may even be say that that interest have increase of late year the respectful and remorseful pity which she fate could not fail to awaken have be quicken by the publication of she correspondence with she family and intimate friend which have lay bare without disguise all she inmost thought and feeling she error as well as she good deed she weakness equally with she virtue few indeed even of those whom the world regard with its highest favor and esteem could endure such a ordeal without some diminution of they fame yet it be but record the general verdict of all whose judgment be of value to affirm that marie antoinette have triumphantly surmount it and that the result of a scrutiny as minute and severe as any to which a human being have ever be subject have be greatly to raise she reputation not that she be one of those paragon whom painter of model heroine have delight to imagine to themselves one who from childhood give manifest indication of excellence and greatness and whose whole life be but a steady progressive development of its early promise she be rather one in whom adversity bring forth great quality she possession of which have she life be one of that unbroken sunshine which be regard by many as the natural and inseparable attendant of royalty might never have be even suspect we meet with she first at a age scarcely advance beyond childhood transport from she school-room to a foreign court as wife to the heir of one of the noblest kingdom of europe and in that situation we see she for a while a light-hearted merry girl annoy rather than elate by she new magnificence thoughtless if not frivolous in she pursuit fond of dress eager in she appetite for amusement temper only by a innate purity of feeling which never desert she the brightest feature of she character be apparently a frank affability and a genuine and active kindness and humanity which be display to all class and on all occasion we see she presently as queen hardly yet arrive at womanhood little change in disposition or in outward demeanor though profit to the utmost by the opportunity which she increase power afford she of prove the genuine tenderness of she heart by munificent and judicious work of charity and benevolence and exert she authority if possible still more beneficially by protect virtue discountenancing vice and purify a court whose shameless profligacy have for many generation be the scandal of christendom it be probable indeed that much of she early levity be prompt by a desire to drive from she mind disappointment and mortification of which few suspect the existence but which be only the more keenly feel because she be compel to keep they to herself but it be certain that during the first eight or ten year of she residence in france there be little in she habit and conduct however amiable and attractive which could have lead she warmest friend to discern in she the high quality which she be destine to exhibit before its close presently however she become a mother and in this new relation we begin to perceive glimpse of a loftier nature from the moment of the birth of she first child she perform those new duty which perhaps more than any other call forth all the best and most peculiar virtue of the female heart in such a manner as to add esteem and respect to the good-will which she affability and courtesy have already inspire recognize to the full the claim which the nation have upon she that she should in person superintend the education of she child and especially of she son as its future ruler and discharging that sacred duty not only with the most affectionate solicitude but also with the most admirable judgment but year so spend be year of happiness and though such may suffice to display the amiable virtue it be by adversity that the grander quality of the head and heart be more strikingly draw forth to the trial of that stern inquisitress marie antoinette be fully expose in she later year and not only do she rise above they but the more terrible and unexampled they be the more conspicuous be the superiority of she mind to fortune it be no exaggeration to say that the history of the whole world have preserve no record of greater heroism in either sex than be show by marie antoinette during the closing year of she life no courage be ever put to the proof by such a variety and such a accumulation of danger and misery and no one ever come out of a encounter with even far inferior calamity with greater glory she moral courage and she physical courage be equally try it be not only that she own life and live far dearer to she than she own be expose to daily and hourly peril or that to this danger be add repeat vexation of hope baffle and trust betray but these grief be largely aggravate by the character and conduct of those nearest to she instead of meeting with counsel and support from she husband and he brother she have to guide and support loui himself and even to find he so incurably weak as to be incapable of be keep in the path of wisdom by she sagacity or of derive vigor from she fortitude while the prince be act in selfish and disloyal opposition to he and so in a great degree sacrifice he and she to they perverse conceit if we may not say to they faithless ambition she have to think for all to act for all to struggle for all and to beat up against the conviction that she thought and action and struggle be be balk of they effect by the very persona for whom she be exert herself that she be but labor to save those who would not be save yet throughout that protracted agony of more than four year she bear herself with a unswerving righteousness of purpose and a unfaltering fearlessness of resolution which could not have be exceed have she be encourage by the most constant success and in the last terrible hour when the monster who have already murder she husband be prepare the same fate for herself she meet they hatred and ferocity with a loftiness of spirit which even hopelessness could not subdue long before she have declare that she have learn from the example of she mother not to fear death and she show that this be no empty boast when she rise in the last scene of she life as much even above she earlier display of courage and magnanimity as she also rise above the utmost malice of she vile enemy \* \* \* \* \* marie antoinette josèphe jeanne be the youngest daughter of franci originally duke of lorraine afterward grand duke of tuscany and eventually emperor of germany and of marium teresa archduchess of austrium queen of hungary and bohemia more

nine year old be the first sorrow which ever bring a tear into she eye the superintendence of she vast empire occupy a greater share of marium teresa 's attention than the management of she family but as marie antoinette grow up the empress-queen 's ambition ever on the watch to maintain and augment the prosperity of she country perceive in she child 's increase attraction a prospect of cement more closely a alliance which she have contract some year before and on which she pride herself the more because it have terminate a enmity of two century and a half from the day on which charle v prevail

have be greatly in favor of the latter country the very first year of marium teresa 's own reign have be imbitter by the union of france with prussium in a war which have deprive she of a extensive

tutor a french ecclesiastic the abbé de vermond a man of extensive learning of excellent judgment and of most conscientious integrity the appointment would have be in every respect a most fortunate one have it not be suggest by loménie de brienne archbishop of toulouse who thus lay the abbé under a obligation which be requite to the great injury of france nearly twenty year afterward when m de vermond who still remain about the person of he royal mistress have a opportunity of exert he influence to make the archbishop prime minister not that she study be confine to french metastasio teach she italian gluck whose recently publish opera of orfeo have establish for he a reputation as one of the greatest musician of the age give she lesson on the harpsichord but we fear it can not be say that she obtain any high degree of excellence in these or in any other accomplishment she be not incline to study and with the exception of the abbé she master and mistress be too courtly to be peremptory with a archduchess they favorable report to the empress-queen be indeed neutralize by the frankness with which they pupil herself confess she idleness and failure to improve but maria teresa be too much absorb in politics to give much heed to the confession or to insist on greater diligence though at a later day marie antoinette herself repent of she neglect and do she best to repair it take lesson in more than one accomplishment with great perseverance during the first year of she residence at versaille because as she express herself the dauphiness be bind to take care of the character of the archduchess there be however lesson of greater importance to a child than any which be give by even the most accomplished master -- those which flow from the example of a virtuous and sensible mother and those the young archduchess show a greater aptitude for learn marium teresa have set a example not only to she own family but to all sovereign among whom principle and practice such as hers have hitherto be little recognize of regard a attention to the personal welfare of all she subject even of those of the lowest class as among the most imperative of she duty she have be accessible to all she have accustom the peasantry to accost she in she walk she have visit they cottage to inquire into and relieve they want and the little antoinette who more than any other of she child seem to have take she for a especial model have thus from she very earliest childhood learn to feel a friendly interest in the well-doing of the people in general to think no one too lowly for she notice to sympathize with sorrow to be indignant at injustice and ingratitude to succor misfortune and distress and these be habit which as be implant in she heart she be not likely to forget but which might be expect rather to gain strength by indulgence and to make she both welcome and useful to any people among whom she lot might be cast chapter ii proposal for the marriage of marie antoinette to the dauphin -- early education of the dauphin -- the archduchess leave vienna in April 1770 -- she reception at strasburg -- she meet the king at compiègne -- the marriage take place may 16th 1770 royal marriage have be so constantly regard as affair of state to be arrange for political reason that it have become usual on the continent to betroth prince and princess to each other at a very early age and it be therefore not consider as denote any premature impatience on the part of either the empress-queen or the king of france loui xv when at the beginning of 1769 when marie antoinette have but just complete she thirteenth year the duc de choiseul the french minister for foreign affair who be himself a native of lorraine instruct the marquis de durfort the french

have several daughter but only one son that son bear in 1729 have be marry at the age of fifteen to a spanish infanta who within a year of she marriage die in she confinement and whom he replace in a few month by a daughter of augustus iii king of saxony he second wife bear he four son and two daughter the eldest son the duc de bourgogne who be bear in 1750 and be generally regard as a child of great promise die in he eleventh year and when he himself die in 1765 he second son previously know as the duc de berri succeed he in he title of dauphin this prince now the suitor of the archduchess have be bear on the 23d of August 1754 and be therefore not quite fifteen as yet but little be know of he very little pain have be take with he education he governor the duc de la vauguyon be a man who have be appoint to that most important post by the cabal of the infamous mistress and parasite who form the court of loui xv without one qualification for the discharge of its duty a servile intriguing spirit have alone recommend he to he patron while he frivolous indolence be in harmony with the inclination of the king himself who wear out with a long course of profligacy have no longer sufficient energy even for vice under such a governor the young prince have but little chance of receive a wholesome education even if there be not a settle design to enfeeble he mind by neglect he father have be a man of a character very different from that of the king by a sort of natural reaction or silent protest against the infamy which he see around he he have cherish a serious and devout disposition and have observe a conduct of the most rigorous virtue he be even suspect of regard the jesuit with especial favor and be believe to have form plan for the reformation of moral and perhaps of the state it be not strange that on the first news of the illness which prove fatal to he the people flock to the church with prayer for he recovery and that he death be regard by all the right - think portion of the community as a national calamity but the courtier who have regard he approach reign with not unnatural alarm hail he removal with joy and be above all thing anxious to prevent he son who have now become the heir to the crown from follow such a path as the father have mark out for himself the negligence of some thus combine with the deliberate malice of other and aid by peculiarity in the constitution and disposition of the young prince himself which become more and more marked as he grow up exercise a pernicious influence on he boyhood not only be he education in the ordinary branch of youthful knowledge neglect but no care be even take to cultivate he taste or to polish he manners though a certain delicacy of taste and refinement of manners be regard by the courtier and by loui xv himself as the pre-eminent distinction of he reign he be keep studiously in the background discountenance and depress till he contract a awkward timidity and reserve which throughout he life he could never shake off while a still more unfortunate defect which be another result of this system be a inability to think or decide for himself or even to act steadily on the advice of other after he have profess to adopt it but these deficiency in he character have as yet hardly have time to display themselves and have they be ever so notorious they be not of a nature to divert marium teresa from she purpose for she political object it would not perhaps have seem to she altogether undesirable that the future sovereign of france should be likely to rely on the judgment and to submit to the influence of another so long as the person who should have the best opportunity of influence he be she own daughter a negotiation for the success of which both party be equally anxious do not require a long time for its conclusion and by the beginning of July 1769 all the preliminary be arrange the french newspaper be authorize to allude to the marriage and to speak of the diligence with which preparation for it be be make in both country those in which the french king take the greatest interest be the building of some carriage of extraordinary magnificence to receive the archduchess as soon as she should have arrive on french ground while those which be be make in germany indicate a more elementary state of civilization as the first requisite appear to be to put the road between vienna and the frontier in a state of repair to prevent the journey from be too fatiguing by the spring of the next year all the necessary preparation have be complete and on the

acceptable to the majority of the people of either nation there be still a strong anti-french party at vienna -lrb- 1 -rrb- and -lrb- a circumstance of far greater influence on the fortune of the young couple -rrb- there be a strong anti-austrian party in france which be not without its supporter even in the king 's palace that the marriage should have be so earnestly desire at the imperial court be a strange instance of the extent to which political motive overpower every other consideration in the mind of the great empress-queen for she be not ignorant of the real character of the french court of the degree in which it be divide by faction of the base and unworthy intrigue which be its sole business and of the sagacity and address which be requisite for any one who would steer he way with safety and honor through its complicated maze judgment and prudence be not the quality most naturally to be expect in a young princess not yet fifteen year old the best prospect which marie antoinette have of surmount the numerous and vary difficulty which beset she lay in the affection which she speedily conceive for she husband and in the sincerity we can hardly say warmth with which he return she love marium teresa have bespeak he tenderness for she in a letter which she write to he on the day on which she daughter leave vienna and which have often be quote as a composition worthy of she alike as a mother and as a christian sovereign and as admirably calculate to impress the heart of she new son-in-law by claim he attachment for he bride on the ground of the pain which she have take to make she worthy of she fortune you bride my dear dauphin have just leave I i do hope that she will cause you happiness i have bring she up with the design that she should do so because i have for some time forseen that she would share you destiny i have inspire she with a eager desire to do she duty to you with a tender attachment to you person with a resolution to be attentive to think and do every thing which may please you i have also be most careful to enjoin she a tender devotion toward the master of all sovereign be thoroughly persuade that we be but badly provide for the welfare of the nation which be intrust to we when we fail in we duty to he who break sceptre and overthrow throne accord to he pleasure i say then to you my dear dauphin as i say to my daughter : ` cultivate you duty toward god seek to cause the happiness of the people over whom you will reign -lrb- it will be too soon come when it may -rrb- love the king you grandfather be humane

more that i answer to you for she affection and for she anxiety to please you the more earnestly do i entreat you to vow to she the most sincere attachment farewell my dear dauphin may you be happy i be bath in tear -lrb- 2 -rrb- the dauphin do not falsify the hope thus express by the empress-queen but he be not the character to afford he wife either the advice or support which she need while strange to say he be the only member of the royal family to whom she could look for either the king be not only utterly worthless and shameless but weak and irresolute in the most ordinary matter even when in the flower and vigor of he age he have never be able to summon courage to give verbal order or reproof to he own child -lrb- 3 -rrb- but have intimate he pleasure or displeasure by letter he have be gradually fall lower and lower both in he own vice and in the estimation of the world and be now still more than when lord chesterfield first draw he picture -lrb- 4 -rrb- both hate and despise the dauphin 's brother for such mere boy be singularly selfish and unamiable and the only female relation of she husband he aunt to whom as such it would have be natural that a young foreigner should look for friendship and advice be not only narrow-minded intriguing and malicious but be predispose to regard she with jealousy as likely to interfere with the influence which they have hope to exert over they nephew when he should become they sovereign marie antoinette have therefore difficulty and enemy to contend with from the very first commencement of she residence in france and many even of she own virtue be unfavorable to she chance of happiness calculate as they be to lay she at the mercy of she ill-wisher and to deprive she of some of the defens which might have be find in a different temperament full of health and spirit she be naturally eager in the pursuit of enjoyment and anxious to please every one from feel nothing but kindness toward every one she be frank open and sincere and be perfectly guileless herself she be as through she whole life she continue to be entirely unsuspicious of unfriendliness much more of treachery in other she affability and condescension combine with this trustful disposition to make she too often the tool of design and grasp courtier who seek to gain they own end at she expense and who presume on she good-nature and inexperience to make request which as they well know should never have be make but which they also reckon that she would be unwilling to refuse but lest this general amiability and desire to give pleasure to those around she might seem to impart a prevail tinge of weakness to she character it be fair to add that she unite to these softer feeling robuster virtue calculate to deserve and to win universal admiration though some of they never have yet be call forth by circumstance be for a long time unsuspected by the world at large she have pride -- pride of birth pride of rank -- though never do that feeling show itself more nobly or more beneficially it never lead she to think herself above the very meanest of she subject it never make she indifferent to the interest to the joy or sorrow of a single individual the idea with which it inspire she be that a princess of she race be never to commit a unworthy act be never to fail in purity of virtue in truth in courage that she be to be careful to set a example of these virtue to those who would naturally look up to she and that she herself be to keep constantly in she mind the example of she illustrious mother and never by act or word or think to discredit she mother 's name and as she thus regard courage as she birthright so she possess it in abundance and in variety she have courage to plan and courage to act courage to resolve and courage to adhere to the resolution once deliberately form and above all courage to endure and to suffer and in the very extremity of misery to animate and support other less royally endowed such then as she be with both she manifest and she latent excellency as well as with those more mixed quality which have some defect mingle with they sweetness marie antoinette at the age of fourteen year and a half be throw into a world wholly new to she to guide herself so far by she own discretion that there be no one who have both judgment and authority to control she in she line of conduct or in any single action she have indeed a adviser whom she mother have provide for she though without allow she to suspect the nature or full extent of the duty which she have impose upon he maria teresa have be in some respects a strict mother one whom she child in general fear almost as much as they love she and the rigorous superintendence on some point of conduct which she have exercise over marie antoinette while at home she be not inclined wholly to resign even after she have make she apparently independent at the moment of she departure from vienna she give she a letter of advice which she entreat she to read over every month and in which the most affectionate and judicious counsel be more than once couch in a tone of very authoritative command the whole letter show not only the most experienced wisdom and the most affectionate interest in she daughter 's happiness but likewise a thorough insight into she character so precisely be some of the error against which the letter most emphatically warn she those into which she most frequently fall and she appoint a statesman in whom she deservedly place great confidence the count de mercy-argenteau she embassador to the court at versaille with the express design that he should always be at hand to afford the dauphiness he advice in all the difficulty which she could not avoid foresee for she and who should also keep the empress-queen herself fully inform of every particular of she conduct and of every transaction by which she be in any way affect this part of he commission be wholly unsuspected by the young princess but the count discharge such portion of the delicate duty thus impose upon he with rare discretion contrive in its performance to combine the strictest fidelity to he imperial mistress with the most entire devotion to the interest of he pupil and to preserve the unqualified regard and esteem of both mother and daughter to the end of they life toward the latter as dauphiness and even as queen he stand for some year in a position very similar to that which baron stockmar fill in the history of the late prince consort of england be however more frequent in he admonition and occasionally more severe in he reproof as the youth and inexperience of marie antoinette not unnaturally lead she into greater mistake than the scrupulous conscientiousness and almost premature prudence of the prince consort ever suffer he to commit and he diligent report to the empress-queen amounting at time to a diary of the proceedings of the french court have a lasting and inestimable value since they furnish we with so trustworthy a record of the whole life of marie antoinette for the first ten year of she residence in france -lrb- 5 -rrb- of she action she language and she very thought -lrb- for she ever scorn to give a reason or to make a excuse which be not absolutely and strictly true -rrb- that there be perhaps no person of historical importance whose conduct in every transaction of gravity or interest be more minutely know or whose character there be fuller material for appreciate the very day of she marriage do not pass without she receive a strange specimen of the factious spirit which prevail at the court and of the hollowness of the welcome with which the chief noble have greet she arrival a state ball be give at the palace to celebrate the wedding and as the princess of lorraine a cousin of the emperor franci be the only blood-relation of marie antoinette who be at versaille at the time the king assign she a place in the first quadrille give she precedence for that occasion next to the prince of the blood it do not seem a great stretch of courtesy to show to a foreigner even have she not be relate to the princess in whose honor the ball be give but the duke and peer fire up at the arrangement as if a insult have be offer they they hold a meeting at which they resolve that no member of they family should attend and carry out they resolution so obstinately that at five o'clock when the dancing be to commence except the royal princess there be only three lady in the room the king who follow the example of loui xiv act on these occasion as he own master of ceremony be force to send special and personal order to some of those who have absent themselves to attend without delay and so by seven o'clock twelve or fourteen couple be collect -lrb- 6 -rrb- -lrb- the number of person admit to such entertainment be always extremely small -rrb- and the rude disloyalty of the protest be to outward appearance efface by the submission of the recusant but all the trouble which arise out of the wedding festivity be not so easily terminate little as be the good-will which subsist between loui xv and the parisian the civic authority think they own credit at stake in do appropriate honor to a occasion so important as the marriage of the heir of the monarchy and on the 30th of may they close a succession of ball and banquet by a display of fire-works in which the ingenuity of the most celebrated artist have be exhaust to outshine all previous display of the sort three side of the place loui xv be fill up with pyramid and colonnade here dolphin dart out many-colored flame from they ever-open mouth there river of fire pour forth cascade spangle with all the variegate brilliancy with which the chemist 's art can embellish the work of the pyrotechnist the center be occupy with a gorgeous temple of hymen which seem to lean for support on the well-known statue of the king in front of which it be construct and which be as it be to be carry up to the sky by above three thousand rocket and fire-ball into which it be intend to dissolve the whole square be pack with spectator the pedestrian in front the carriage in the rear when one of the explosion set fire to a portion of the platform on which the different figure have be construct at first the increase of the blaze be regard only as a ingenious surprise on the part of the artist but soon it become clear that the conflagration be undesigned and real panic-succeeded to delight and the terror-stricken crowd see themselves surround with flame begin to make frantic effort to escape from the danger but there be only one side of the square uninclosed and that be block up by carriage the uproar and the glare make the horse unmanageable and in a few moment the whole mass human being and animal be mingle in helpless confusion make flight impossible by they very eagerness to fly and trample one another underfoot in bewildered misery of those who do succeed in extricate themselves from the square half make they way to the road which run along the bank of the river and find that they have only exchange one danger for another which though of a opposite character be equally destructive still overwhelm with terror though the first peril be over the fugitive push one another into the stream in which great number be drown the number of the kill could never be accurately ascertain : but no calculation estimate the number of those who perish at less than six hundred while those who be grievously injure be at least as many more the dauphin and dauphiness be deeply shock by a disaster so painfully at variance with they own happiness which in one sense have cause it they first thought be as far as they might be able to mitigate it most of the victim be of the poorer class the grief of whose survive relative be in many instance aggravate by the loss of the means of livelihood which the labor of those who have be cut off have hitherto supply and to give temporary succor to this distress the dauphin and dauphiness at once draw out from the royal treasury the sum allow to they for they private expense for the month and send the money to the municipal authority to be apply to the relief of the sufferer but marie antoinette do more she feel that to give money only be but cold benevolence and she make personal visit to many of those family which have be most grievously afflict show the sincerity of she sympathy by the touching kindness of she language and by the tear which she mingle with those of the widow and the orphan -lrb- 7 -rrb- such unmerited kindness make a deep impression on the citizen since the time of henry iv no prince have ever show the slightest interest in the happiness or misery of the lower class and the feeling of affectionate gratitude which this unprecedented recognition of they claim to be sympathize with as fellow-creature awaken be fix still more deeply in they heart a short time afterward when at one of the hunting-party which take

month after she marriage mercy could report to maria teresa that she have have complete success and be a universal favorite that besides the king who openly express he satisfaction she have win the

herself be incline to be delighted with all that befall she and to make light of what she could hardly regard as pleasant or become and two of she first letter to she mother write in the early part of July -lrb- 1 -rrb- give we a insight into the feeling with which she regard she new family and she own position as well as a picture of she daily occupation and of the singular custom of the french court strangely inconsistent in what it permit and in what it disallow and in the publicity in which its prince live curiously incompatible with ordinary idea of comfort and even delicacy the king she say be full of kindness toward I and i love he tenderly but it be pitiable to see he weakness for madame du barri who be the silliest and most impertinent creature that it be possible to conceive she have play with we every evening at marly -lrb- 2 -rrb- and she have twice be seat next to I but she have not speak to I and i have not attempt to engage in conversation with she but when it be necessary i have say a word or two to she as for my dear husband he be greatly change and in a most advantageous manner he show a great deal of affection for I and be even begin to treat I with great confidence he certainly do not like m de la vauguyon but he be afraid of he a curious thing happen about the duke the other day i be alone with my husband when m de la vauguyon steal hurriedly up to

inconvenience that there be in have people listen at the door and he take my remark very well she do not tell the empress the whole of this occurrence she have be too indignant at the duke 's meanness to suppress she feeling and she reprove the duke himself with a severity which can hardly be say to have be misplace duke de la vauguyon she say my lord the dauphin be now of a age to dispense with a governor and i have no need of a spy i beg you not to appear again in my presence -lrb- 3 -rrb- between the writing of she first and second letter she have hear from marium teresa and she can not describe how the affection she mother express for she have go to she heart every letter which she have receive have fill she eye with tear of regret at be separate from so tender and love a mother and happy as she be in france she would give the world to see she family again if it be but for a moment as she mother wish to know how the day be pass she get up between nine and ten and have dress herself and say she morning prayer she breakfast and then she go to the apartment of she aunt whose she usually find the king that last till half-past ten then at eleven she have she hair dress at twelve she proceed to say what be call the chamber be hold and there every one who do not belong to the common people may enter i put on my rouge and wash my hand before all the world the man go out and the woman remain and then i dress myself in they presence then come mass if the king be at versaille i go to mass with he my husband and my aunt if he be not there i go alone with the dauphin but always at the same hour after mass we two dine by ourselves in the presence of all the world but dinner be over by half-past one as we both eat very fast from the dinner-table i go to the dauphin 's apartment and if he have business i return to my own room where i read write or work for i be make a waistcoat for the king which get on but slowly though i trust with god 's grace it will be finish before many year be over at three o'clock i go again to visit my aunt and the king come to they at the same hour at four the abbé -lrb- 4 -rrb- come to I and at five i have every day either my harpsichord-master or my singing-master till six at half-past six i go almost every day to my aunt except when i go out walk and you must understand that when i go to visit my aunt my husband almost always go with I at seven we play card till nine o'clock but when the weather be fine i go out walk and then there be no play in my apartment but it be hold at my aunt ' at nine we sup and when the king be not there my aunt come to sup with we but when the king be there we go after supper to they room wait there for the king who usually come about a quarter to eleven and i lie down on a grand sofa and go to sleep till he come but when he be not there we go to bed at eleven o'clock the play-table which be allude to in these letter be one of the most curious and mischievous institution of the court gambling have be one of its established vice ever since the time of henry iv whose enormous loss at play have form the subject of sully 's most incessant remonstrance and from the beginning of the reign of loui xiv a gaming-table have form a regular part of the evening 's amusement it be the one thing which be allow to break down the barrier of etiquette on all other occasion the rule which regulate who might and who might not be admit to the royal presence be as precise and strict as in many case they be unreasonable and unintelligible but at the gaming-table every one who could make the slightest pretension to gentle birth be allow to present himself and stake he money -lrb- 5 -rrb- and the level influence of play be almost as fully exemplify in the king 's palace as in the ordinary gaming-house since though the presence of royalty so far act as a restraint on the gambler as to prevent any open explosion accusation of foul play and dishonest trick be as rife as in the most vulgar company marie antoinette be win many heart by she loveliness and affability but she could not scatter she kind speech and friendly smile among all with whom she come into contact without run counter to the prejudice of some of the old courtier who have be form on a different system to whom the maintenance of a rigid etiquette be as the very breath of they nostril and in whose eye its very first rule and principle be that prince should keep all the world at a distance foremost among these stickler for old idea be the countess de noaille she principal lady of honor whose uneasiness on the subject speedily become so notorious as to give rise to numerous court squib and satirical ode the author of which seem glad to compliment the dauphin and to vex she ladyship at the same time but who could not be deter by these effusion from lecture marie antoinette on she disregard of she rank and on the danger of make herself too familiar till she provoke the young princess into give she the nickname of madame etiquette and no doubt in she childish playfulness to utter many a speech and do many a act whose principle object be to excite the astonishment or provoke the frown of the too prim lady of honor there can be no doubt that though she often push she strictness too far madame de noailles to some extent have reason on she side and that a certain degree of ceremony and stately reserve be indispensable in court life it be a penalty which those bear in the purple must pay for they dignity that they can have no friend on a perfect equality with themselves and those who in different age and country have try to emancipate themselves from this law of they rank have not generally win even the respect of those to whom they have condescend and still less the approbation of the outer world whose member have perhaps a secret dislike to see those whom they regard as they own equal lift above they by the familiarity of prince this however be a matter of comparatively slight importance a excess of condescension be at the worst a venial and a amiable error but even at the early period plot be be contrived against the young princess which if successful would have be wholly destructive of she happiness and which though she be fully aware of they she have not mean by herself to disconcert or defeat they be the more formidable because they be partly political embrace a scheme for the removal of a minister and consequently conciliate more supporter and insure greater perseverance than if they have merely aim at secure a preponderance of court favor for the plotter like all the other mistress who have successfully reign in the french court madame du barri have a party of adherent who hope to rise by she patronage the duc de choiseul himself have owe he promotion to she predecessor madame de pompadour and those who hope to supplant he see in a similar influence the best prospect of attain they end one of the least respectable of the french noble be the duc d'aiguillon as governor of brittany he have behave with notorious cowardice in the seven year ' war he have since be if possible still more dishonor by charge of oppression peculation and subornation on which the authority of the province have prosecute he and which the parisian parliament have pronounce to be establish but no kind of infamy be a barrier to the favor of loui xv he cancel the resolution of the parliament and show such countenance to the culprit that d'aiguillon who be both ambitious and covetous conceive the idea of supplant choiseul in the government as one of choiseul 's principal measure have be the negotiation of the dauphin 's marriage marie antoinette be know to regard he with a good-will which be found on gratitude but unfortunately she feeling on this point be not share by she husband for choiseul have have notorious difference with he father the late dauphin and though it be perfectly certain that that prince have die of natural disease people have be find to whisper in he son 's ear suspicion that he have be poison and that the minister to whom he be unfriendly have be concern in he death the two plot therefore to overthrow the minister and to weaken the influence of the dauphiness go hand-in-hand and as might have be expect from the character of the patroness of both no means be too vile or wicked for the intriguer who have set they on foot madame du barri be indeed seriously alarmed for the maintenance of she own ascendency the king take such undisguised pleasure in he new granddaughter 's company that some of the most experienced courtier begin to anticipate that she would soon gain entire influence over he -lrb- 6 -rrb- the mistress begin therefore to disparage she personal charm never speak of she to loui -lrb- france as she generally call he -rrb- except as the little blowsy -lrb- 7 -rrb- while she ally de la vauguyon endeavor to further she view by exert the influence which he mistakenly flatter himself that he still retain over the dauphin to surround she with he own creature he try to procure the dismissal of the abbé de vermond who have be as we have see the tutor of marie antoinette at vienna still remain attach to she person as she reader and whose complete knowledge of all the way of the court join to a thorough honesty and devoted fidelity to she best interest render he service most valuable to he mistress in she new sphere he seek to recommend a creature of he own as she confessor to obtain for he own daughter the appointment of one of she chief lady and with a wickedness peculiar to the french court he even endeavor to imitate the vile art by which the duc de richelieu have deprive marie leczinska of the affection of the king to alienate the dauphin from he young wife and to induce he to commit himself to the guidance of madame du barri but this part of the scheme fail the dauphin be strangely insensible to the personal charm of marie antoinette herself and be wholly inaccessible to any inferior temptation and as far as the arrangement of the court be concern the success of the mistress 's cabal be limit to procure the dismissal of the mistress of the robe the countess de grammont for refuse to cede to madame du barri and some of she friend the place which belong to she office at some private theatricals which be hold in the palace loui xiv have teach he noble the pernicious notion that a order to withdraw from the court be a penal banishment and he successor now banish madame de grammont fourteen league from versaille and for some time refuse to recall he sentence though marie antoinette herself write to he to complain of one of she servant be so treat for such a cause she have not as she report to she mother be very willing to write know that madame du barri read all the king 's letter but mercy have urge she to take the step think it very important that she should establish the practice of communicate directly with loui on all matter relate to she own household and that she should avoid the blunder of he daughter she aunt whose conduct toward they father have in he opinion be mischievously timid and to follow whose example would be prejudicial both to she dignity and to she comfort the aunt too and especially the eldest madame adelaide have scheme of they own which they also seek to carry out by underhand method the more conscious they be that they themselves have no influence over they father the less could they endure the chance of they niece acquire any though it could not have be say to have be establish at they expense on the other hand they have before he marriage have considerable power with the dauphin which they have now but little hope of retain they see also that marie antoinette have in a few week gain a general popularity such as they have never win in they whole life and on all these account they be painfully jealous of she they put idea and plan into she head which they expect to grate upon they father 's taste or indolence and then contrived to have they represent or misrepresent to he though he disappoint they malice by regard such thing as childish ebullition natural to a girl of she age and be far more inclined to humor than to reprove she with the same object they try to induce she to interfere in appointment in which she have no concern but she remember she mother 's advice and on this point keep steadily in the path which that affectionate adviser have mark out for she they even venture to make disparage observation on she manners as inexperienced and unformed to the dauphin himself till he silence they by the warmth of he praise alike of she beauty and of she disposition and they be so afraid of any addition to she popularity with the nation at large that when the city of pari and the state of languedoc present she with a address they recommend she to make no reply assure she that on similar occasion they themselves have never give any answer luckily she have a better adviser who on this occasion be the abbé de vermond he tell she truly that in this matter the conduct which the older princess have pursue be a warning not a pattern : that they have make all france discontented and at he suggestion marie antoinette give to each address a answer full of graciousness with which the public be enchanted thus in the first year of she marriage by she kindness of heart guide by the advice of mercy and the abbé to which she listen with the greatest docility she have win general affection and have make no enemy but those whose enmity be a honor she be as she write to she mother perfectly happy though have she not wish to make the best of matter she be not in fact wholly free from disappointment and vexation some of which continue for year to cause she uneasiness and anxiety though other be comparatively trivial or temporary while one be of a almost comical nature she have conceive a great desire to learn to ride she mother have be a great horsewoman and as the dauphin like the king be passionately addict to hunting which hitherto she have only witness from a carriage marie antoinette not unnaturally desire to be mistress of a accomplishment which would enable she to give he more of she companionship unluckily mercy disapprove of the idea it be impossible to read he correspondence with the empress and in subsequent year with marie antoinette herself without be forcibly impressed with respect for he consummate prudence he sound judgment in matter of public policy and he unswerving fidelity to the interest of both mother and daughter but at the same time it be difficult to avoid see that he be too little inclined to make allowance for the youthful eagerness for amusement which be natural to she age and that at time he carry he supervision into matter on which he statesman-like experience and sagacity have hardly qualify he to form a opinion he be proud of he princess 's beauty and consider himself in charge of she figure as well as of she conduct he have make himself very uneasy by the fancied discovery that she be become crooked he be sure that one shoulder be grow higher than the other he earnestly recommend stay and be very much displeased with she aunt for set she against they because they be not fashionable in pari and when the horse exercise be propose he set he face against it he write to maria teresa who agree with he in think it ruinous to the complexion injurious to the shape and not to be safely indulge in under thirty year of age -lrb- 8 -rrb- and lest distance should weaken the authority of the empress he enlist madame de noailles and choiseul on he side and choiseul persuade the king that it be a very objectionable pastime for a young bride there be not as yet the slightest prospect of the dauphiness become a mother -lrb- a circumstance which be in fact the most serious of she vexation and that which last longest -rrb- : but the king on this point agree with he minister and after some discussion a compromise be hit upon and it be decide that she might ride a donkey the whole country be immediately ransack for a stud of quiet donkey -lrb- 9 -rrb- in September the court move to compiègne and day after day while the king and the dauphin be shoot in one part of the wood on the other side a cavalcade of donkey-rider the aunt and the king 's brother all swell marie antoinette 's train trot up and down the glade and seek out shady spot for rural luncheon out-of-door and though even this pastime be occasionally find liable to as much danger as a expedition on nobler steed the merry dauphiness contrived to extract amusement for herself and she follower from she very disaster it be long a standing joke that on one occasion when she donkey and herself come down in a soft place she royal highness before she would allow she attendant to extricate she from the mud bid they go to madame de noailles and ask she what the rule of etiquette prescribe when a dauphiness of france fail to keep she seat upon a donkey she have also another annoyance which be even of a less royal character than be doom to ride on a donkey she have absolutely no pocket-money for many generation the prince of the country have be accustom to dip they hand so unrestrainedly into the national treasury that they legitimate appointment have be fix on a very moderate if not scanty scale so that any one who like the dauphin and dauphiness might be scrupulous not to exceed they income -lrb- though that scruple have probably affect no one before -rrb- could not fail to be greatly straiten the allowance of marie antoinette be fix at no higher amount than six thousand franc a month and of this small sum accord to a report which in the course of the autumn mercy make to the empress not a single crown really reach the princess for she private use -lrb- 10 -rrb- nearly half of the money be stop to pay some pension grant marie leczinska with which the dauphiness could by no possibility have the slightest concern almost as much more be intrust to the gentleman of she chamber for the expense of the play table at which she be expect to preside since there be no queen to discharge that duty and whether she royal highness 's card win or lose the money equally disappear -lrb- 11 -rrb- and the remainder be distribute in present to she lady at the discretion of madame de noailles have not marium teresa when she first quit vienna intrusted mercy with a thousand pound for she use and have she not herself be singularly economical in she idea she would have be in the humiliating position of be unable to provide for she own most ordinary want and a matter about which she be even more anxious for she constant charity yet so inveterate be the mismanagement in both the court and the government that it be some time before mercy could succeed by the strongest remonstrance support by clear proof of the real situation of she royal highness in get she affair and she resource place upon a proper footing in spite of all the effort of the cabal the king 's regard for she increase daily he have not for many year be use to be treat with respect and she not from any artfulness but from she native propriety of feeling which forbid she ever to forget that he be she husband 's grandfather and she king unite a tone of the most loyal respect with she filial caress she call he papa and even pay he the tacit compliment of ground occasional request on consideration of humanity and justice little as such motive have ever influence loui and rarely as they name have of late be hear in the precinct of the palace she even induce he to pardon madame de grammont insist on such a concession as due to herself when she demand it for one of she own retinue till he laugh and reply madame you order shall be execute and the steadiness she thus show in protect she own servant win she many heart among the courtier at the same time that it fill she aunt with astonishment who while commend she firmness could not avoid add that it be easy to see that she do not belong to they race -lrb- 12 -rrb- and how strong as well as how general be of respect and good-will which she have thus diffuse be see in a remarkable manner at some of the private theatricals which be a frequent diversion of the king when the actor at the end of one of he song introduce some verse which he have compose in she honor and the whole body of courtier who be present show they approbation by a vehement clapping of they hand in defiance of a standing order of the court which prohibit any such demonstration be make in the sovereign 's presence -lrb- 13 -rrb- it however more than counterbalance these triumph that before the end of the year the cabal of the mistress succeed in procure the dismissal of the choiseul and the appointment of the duc d'aiguillon as minister for choiseul have be not only a faithful but a most judicious friend to she if other show too often that they regard she as a foreigner he only remember it as a reason for give she hint as to the feeling of the nation or of individual which a native would not have require and she thankfully acknowledge that he suggestion have always be both kind and useful and express she sense of she obligation to he and she concern at he dismissal to she mother who fully share she feeling on the subject and encourage by this victory over she most powerful adherent the cabal begin to venture to attack marie antoinette herself they surround she with spy they even spread a report that loui have begin to see through and to distrust she in the hope that when it should reach the king 's own ear it might perhaps lay the foundation of the alienation which it pretend to assert and they grow the bolder because the king 's next brother be about to be marry to a savoyard princess of whose favor de la vauguyon flatter himself that he be already assure under these circumstance marie antoinette behave with consummate prudence as far at least as she enemy be concern she despise the effort make to lower she in the general estimation so completely that she seem wholly unconscious of they she do not even allow herself to be provoke into treat the author of the calumny with additional coldness but give no handle to any of they to complain of she so that the critical and anxious eye of mercy himself find nothing to wish altered in she conduct toward they -lrb- 14 -rrb- and throughout the winter she pursue the even tenor of she way make herself chiefly remarkable by almost countless act of charity which she dispense with such judgment as show that they proceed not from a heedless disregard of money but from a thoughtful and vigilant kindness which do not think the feeling any more than the necessity of the poor beneath she notice circumstance to which she contribute only indirectly enhance she popularity and weaken the effect of the mistress 's hostility versaille have not be so gay for many winter and the votary of mere amusement always a strong party at every court rejoice at the addition to the royal family to whom the gayety be owe loui rouse himself to gratify the young princess who enliven he place with the first respectable pleasure which it or he have know for year when he see that she like dramatic performance he open the private theater of the palace twice a week because she be fond of dance he encourage she to have a weekly ball in she own apartment at which she herself be the principal attraction not solely by the elegance of she every movement but still more by the graciousness with which she receive and treat she guest have a kind smile and a affable word for all apparently forget she rank in the frankness of she condescension yet at the same time bear herself with a innate dignity which prevent the most forward from presume on she kindness or venture on any undue familiarity -lrb- 15 -rrb- the winter of 1770 be one of unusual severity and she find resource for a further enlivenment of the court in the frost itself sledge on the snow be a habitual pastime at vienna where the cold be more severe than at paris nor in former year have sledge be wholly unknown in the bois de boulogne and now marie antoinette whose hardy habit make exercise in the fresh air almost a necessity for she have sledge build for herself and she attendant and the inhabitant of versaille and the neighborhood as fond of novelty as all they countryman be delight at the merry sledging-party which as long as the snow last explore the surrounding country while the wood ring with the horse ' bell and almost as loudly and still more cheerfully with the laughter of the company she liveliness have as it be give a new tone to the whole court and though the dauphin hold out longer against the genial influence of he wife 's disposition than most people it at last in some degree thaw even he frigidity she ascribe he apathy and apparent dislike to female society rather to the neglect or malice of he early tutor than to any natural defect of capacity or perversity of disposition and often lecture he on he deficiency and even on some of he favorite pursuit which she look upon as contribute to strengthen he shyness with lady she be not unacquainted with english literature in which the rusticity and coarseness of the fox-hunting squire form a piquant subject for the mirth of dramatist and novelist and if squire western have be the type of sportsman in all country she could not have inveigh more vigorously than she do against she husband 's addiction to hunting one evening when he do not return from the field till the play in the theater be half over she not only frowned upon he all the rest of the entertainment but when after the company have retire he begin to enter into a explanation of the cause of he delay a scene ensue which it will be best to give in the very word of mercy 's report to the empress the dauphiness make he a short but very energetic sermon in which she represent to he with vivacity all the evil of the uncivilized kind of life he be lead she show he that no one of he attendant could stand that kind of life and that they would like it the less that he own air and rude manners make no amends to those who be attach to he train and that by follow this plan of life he would end by ruin he health and make himself detest the dauphin receive this lecture with gentleness and submission confess that he be wrong promise to amend and formally beg she pardon this circumstance be certainly very remarkable and the more so because the next day people observe that he pay the dauphiness much more attention and behave toward she with a much more lively affection than usual -lrb- 16 -rrb- we do not however find in reality that the severity of she admonition produce any permanent diminution of he fondness for hunting and shooting but the gentleness of she general manners and the delight which he see that all around she take in she graciousness so far excite he admiration that he begin to follow she example he say that she have such native grace that every thing which she do succeed to perfection that it must be admit that she be charming and before the end of the winter he have come to take a active part both in she Monday ball and in those which she lady occasionally give in she honor dancing himself the whole of the evening and converse with all the company with a air of cheerfulness and good-nature of which no one before have ever think he capable -lrb- 17 -rrb- the happy change in he demeanor be universally attribute to the dauphiness and as the character of they future king be naturally watch with anxiety as a matter of the highest importance it greatly increase the attachment of all who have the welfare of the nation at heart to the princess whose general example have produce so beneficial a effect chapter v mercy 's correspondence with empress -- distress and discontent pervade france -- goldsmith predict a revolution -- apathy of the king -- the aunt mislead marie antoinette -- marium teresa hear that the dauphiness neglect she german visitor -- marriage of the count de provence -- grow preference of loui xv for the dauphiness -- the dauphiness apply herself to study -- marie antoinette become a horsewoman -- she kindness to all beneath she -- cabal of the adherent of the mistress -- the royal family become unite -- concert in the apartment of the dauphiness marie antoinette be not a very zealous or copious letter-writer she only correspondent in she earlier year be she mother and even to she she letter be less effusive and less full of detail than might have be expect one reason for they brevity arise out of the intrigue of the court since she have cause to believe herself so watch and spy upon that she very desk be not safe and consequently she never venture to begin a letter to the empress before the morning on which it be to be send lest it should be read by those for whose eye it be not intend for we knowledge therefore of she act and feeling at this period of she life we still have to rely principally on mercy 's correspondence which be however a sufficiently trustworthy guide so accurate be he information and so entire the frankness with which she open herself to he on all occasion and on all subject the spring of 1771 open very unfavorably for the new administration omen of impend danger be to be see on all side ten or twelve year before goldsmith whose occasional silliness of manner prevent he from always obtain the attention to which he sagacity entitle he have name the grow audacity of the french parliament as not only a indication of the approach of great change in that country but as likely also to be they move cause -lrb- 1 -rrb- and they have recently show such determine resistance to the royal authority that though in the most conspicuous instance of it they assertion of they right to pronounce a independent judgment on the charge bring against the duc d'aiguillon they be unquestionably in the right and though they pretension be support by almost the whole body of the prince of the blood some of whom be immediately banish for they contumacy loui have be persuade to abolish they altogether and marie antoinette though she carefully avoid mix herself up with politics be as she report to she mother -lrb- 2 -rrb- astonish beyond measure at they conduct which she look upon as arise out of the grossest disloyalty and which certainly indicate the existence of a feeling very dangerous to the maintenance of the royal authority on the part of those very man who be most bind to uphold it there be also great and general distress for a moment in the autumn it have be relieve by a fall in the price of bread which the unreasoning gratitude of the populace have attribute to the benevolence of the dauphiness but the severity of the winter have bring it back with aggravate intensity till it reach even to the palace and compel a curtailment of some of the festivity with which it have be intend to celebrate the marriage of the count de provence which be fix for the approach may distress be the sure parent of discontent unless the people have a very complete confidence in they government and this be so far from be the case in france at this time that the distrust of and contempt for those in the highest place increase daily more and more the influence which madame du barri exert over the king become more root as he become more use to submit to it and more notorious as he grow more shameless in he avowal of it she feel she power and she intrigue become in the same proportion more busy and more diversified in they object in the vigorous description of mercy versaille be wholly occupy by treachery hatred and vengeance not one feeling of honesty or decency remain while the people ever quick-witted to perceive the vice of they ruler especially when they be indulge at they expense revenge themselves by bitter and seditious language and by satire and pasquinade in which neither respect nor mercy be show even to the sacred person of the sovereign himself he be callous to all mark of contempt display for himself but be or be induce to profess himself deeply annoy at the conduct of the dauphin who show a fix aversion for the mistress which however he grandfather do not regard as dictate by he own feeling loui rather believe that it be foster by marie antoinette and that she in encourage she husband be but follow the advice of she aunt and he threaten to remonstrate with the dauphiness on the subject though as mercy correctly divine he could not nerve himself to the necessary resolution it be true that marie antoinette do often allow herself to be far too much influence by those princess she confess to mercy that she be afraid to displease or thwart they a feeling which he regard as the more unfortunate because when she be not actuate by that consideration she own judgment and she own impulse would always guide she aright and because too the elder princess be the most unsafe of all adviser they be notoriously jealous of one another and each at time try to inspire she niece with she feeling toward the other two and they often without mean it play into the hand of the mistress 's cabal intriguing for selfish object of they own with as much malice and meanness as could be practice by madame du barri herself still in spite of these drawback it be almost inevitable that they should have great influence over they niece they experience might well be presume by she to have give they a correct insight into the way of the court and the best mode of behave to they own father and she a foreigner and almost a child be not only in need of counsel and guidance but have no one else of she own sex to whom she could so naturally look for information or advice they be as she explain to mercy she only society and though she be too clear-sighted not to see they fault and not at time to be aware that she be suffer from they perverseness she like other people be often compel to tolerate what she could not mend and to shut she eye to disagreeable quality when force to live on term of intimacy with the possessor on this point marium teresa be perhaps hardly incline to make sufficient allowance for she difficulty and insist over and over again on the mischief which would arise to she from the habit of surrender she judgment to these princess she tell she that though far from be devoid of virtue and real merit they have never succeed in make themselves love or esteem by either they father or the public -lrb- 3 -rrb- and she add other admonition which as they be avowedly suggest by report that have reach she may be take as indicate some error into which she daughter 's lightness of heart have occasionally betray she she entreat she not to show a exclusive preference for the more youthful portion of she society to the neglect of those who be older and commonly of higher consideration never to laugh at people or turn they into ridicule -- no habit could be more injurious to herself and indulgence in it would give reason to doubt she good-nature it might gain she the applause of a few young people but it would alienate a much greater number and those the people of the most real weight and respectability this be not say the experienced and wise empress a trivial matter in a princess we live on the stage of the great world and it be above all thing essential that people should entertain a high idea of we if you will only not allow other to lead you astray you be sure of success a kind providence have endow you so liberally with beauty and with so many charm that all heart be yours if you be but prudent -lrb- 4 -rrb- the empress would have have she exhibit this prudence in she conduct also to madame du barri she press upon she that she be justify in appear ignorant of that lady 's real position and character that she need only be aware that she be receive at court and that respect for the king should prevent she from suspect he of countenance undeserving people one other detail in the account of marie antoinette 's conduct which from time to time reach vienna have also vex the empress and it should be keep in mind by any one who would fairly estimate the truth of the charge bring against she and urge with such rancor after she have become queen -- of postpone the interest of france to those of she native land of be austrian at heart marium teresa have hear on the contrary that she have give those austrian who have present themselves at versaille but a cold reception and she do not attempt to conceal she discontent with a natural and become pride in and jealousy for she own loyal and devoted subject she entreat she daughter never to feel ashamed of they or ashamed of be german herself even if comparatively speak the name should imply some deficiency in polish the french themselves would esteem she more if they see in she something of german solidity and frankness -lrb- 5 -rrb- the daughter answer the mother with some adroitness she take no notice of the advice about she behavior to madame du barri it be the one topic on which she own feeling of propriety as well as those of the dauphin coincide with the suggestion of the aunt and she do not desire to vex or provoke the empress by a prolonged discussion of the question but the charge of coldness to she own countryman she deny earnestly she should always glory in be a german some of those noble whom the empress have expressly name she have treat with careful distinction and have even dance with they though they be not man of the very highest character she well know that the german have many good quality which she could wish that the french share with they and she promise that whenever any of she mother 's subject of such standing and merit as to be worthy of she attention come to the court they should have no cause to complain of she reception of they she language on the subject be so measure and careful as to lead we almost inevitably to the inference that the report which have excite such dissatisfaction at vienna be not without foundation but that the french gayety even if often descend to frivolity be more to she taste than the german solidity which she mother so highly esteemed and that she have be at no great pain to hide a preference which must naturally he acceptable to those among whom she future life be to be spend in the middle of may the count de provence be marry to the princess joséphine louise of savoy and the court go to fontainebleau to receive the bride the necessity for leave madame du barri behind throw the king more into the company of the dauphiness than he have be on any previous occasion and she unaffected grace seem for the moment to have make a complete conquest of he he come in he dressing-gown to she apartment for breakfast and spend a great portion of the day there the courtier again begin to speculate on she break down the ascendency of the favorite remark that though loui be careful to pay he new relative the honor which be she due as a stranger and a bride he return as speedily as he could with decency to the dauphiness as if for relief and that though she herself take care to put she new sister-in-law forward on all occasion and treat she with the most marked cordiality and affection every one else make the dauphiness the principal object of homage even in the festivity which be celebrate in honor of the countess indeed it be evident from the very first that any attempt of the mistress 's cabal to establish a rivalry between the two princess must be out of the question the countess de provence have no beauty nor accomplishment nor graciousness horace walpole who be meditate a visit to pari where he have some diligent correspondent be tell that he would lose he sens when he see the dauphiness but would be disenchant by she sister and the say though that of a blind old lady express the opinion of all frenchman who could see -lrb- 6 -rrb- indeed so obvious be the king 's partiality for she that even madame du barri more than once seek to propitiate she by speak in praise of she to mercy and profess a eager desire to aid in procure the gratification of any of she wish but he be too shrewd and too well-informed to place the least confidence in she sincerity though he do not fear half as much harm to he pupil from she enmity as from the pretended affection of the aunt who from a mixture of folly and treachery be unwearied in they attempt to keep she at a distance from the king by inspiring she with a fear of he for which he disposition which have as much good-nature in it as be compatible with weakness give no ground whatever indeed the mischief they do be not confine to they influence over she if mercy be correct in he belief that it be they disagreeable temper and manners which at this time and for the remainder of the reign prevent loui from associate more with he family which have all be like the dauphiness he would have prefer to do it would probably have be in vain that mercy remonstrate against she submit as she do to the aunt have he not be at all time able to secure the co-operation of the empress who place the most implicit confidence in he judgment in all matter relate to the french court and remonstrate with she daughter energetically on the want of proper self-respect which be imply in she surrender she own judgment to that of the aunt as if she be a slave or a child and marie antoinette reply to she mother in a tone of such mingled submissiveness and affection as show how sincere be she desire to remove every shade of annoyance from the empress 's mind and which may perhaps lead to a suspicion that even she subservience to the aunt proceed in a great degree from she anxiety to win the good-will of every one and from the kindness which could not endure to thwart those with whom she be much associate though at the same time she complain to the ambassador that she mother write without sufficient knowledge of the difficulty with which she be surround but she have too deep a affection and reverence for she mother to allow she word to fall to the ground and gradually mercy begin to see a difference in she conduct and a greater inclination to assert she own independence which be the feeling that above all other he think most desirable to foster in she another topic which we find constantly urge in the empress 's letter would seem strangely inconsistent with marie antoinette 's position if we do not remember how very young she still be for she mother write to she in many respects as if she be still at school and continually inculcate on she the necessity of profit by de vermond 's instruction and apply herself to a course of solid reading in theology and history and here though she natural appetite for amusement interfere with she study somewhat more than the empress prompt by mercy be willing to make allowance for she profit much more willingly by she mother 's advice have indeed a natural inclination for the work of history and biography and a decide distaste for novel and romance she could not have have a better guide in such matter than de vermond who be a man of extensive information and of a very correct taste and under he guidance and with he assistance she study sully 's memoirs madame de sévigné 's letter and any other book which he recommend to she and which give she a idea of the past history of the country as well as the masterpiece of the great french dramatist -lrb- 7 -rrb- the latter part of the year 1771 be mark by no very striking occurrence marie antoinette have carry she point and have begin to ride on horseback without either she figure or she complexion suffer from the exercise on the contrary she be admit to have improve in beauty she send she measure to vienna to show marium teresa how much she have grow add that she husband have grow as much and have become stronger and more healthy-looking and that she have make use of she saddle-horse to accompany he in he hunting and shooting excursion like a true wife she boast to she mother of he skill as a shot : the very day that she write he have kill forty head of game -lrb- she do not mention that a french sportsman 's bag be not confine to the larger game but that thrush blackbird and even red-breast be admit to swell the list -rrb- and the increase facility for companionship with he that she ride afford increase he tenderness for she so that she be happier than ever except that as yet she see no prospect of present the empress with a grandchild she have hardly a wish ungratify she taste for open-air exercise of this kind add also to the attachment feel for she by the lower class from the opportunity which arise out of it for show she unvarying and considerate kindness the contrast which she conduct afford to that of previous prince and indeed to that of all the present race except she husband cause she action of this sort to be estimate rather above they real importance but how great be the impression which they do make on those who witness they may be see in the unanimity with which the chronicler of the time record she forbid she postilion to drive over a field of corn which lay between she and the stag because she would rather miss the sight of the chase than injure the farmer and relate how on one occasion she give up ride for a week or two and send she horse back from compiègne to versaille because the wife of she head-groom be on the point of she confinement and she wish she to have she husband near she at such a moment and on another when the horse of one of she attendant kick she and inflict a severe bruise on she foot she abstain from mention the hurt lest it should bring the rider into disgrace by be attribute to he awkward management not that the intrigue of the mistress and she adherent be at all diminish they be even more active than ever since the marriage of the count de provence who in a underhanded way instigate he wife to show countenance to madame du barri and who allow if he do not encourage the mistress and she friend to speak slightingly of the dauphiness in he presence but as marie antoinette feel firmer in she own position she could afford to disregard the malice of these caballer more than she have feel that she could do at first and even to defy they on one occasion that the count de provence be imprudent enough to discuss some of he scheme with the door open while she be in the next room she tell he frankly that she have hear all that he say and reproach he for he duplicity and the dauphin come in at the moment she fly to he throw she arm round he neck and tell he how she appreciate he honesty and candor and how the more she compare he with the other the more she see he superiority indeed she soon begin to find that the countess de provence be as little to be trust as she husband and the only member of the family whom she really like or of whom she have at all a favorable opinion be the count d'artoi who though not yet out of the school-room show as she tell she mother sentiment of honesty which he could never have learn of he governor -lrb- 8 -rrb- she indefatigable guardian mercy report to the empress that she improve every day he have learn to conceive a very high idea of she ability and he dilate with especial satisfaction on the power of conversation which she be develop on she wit and readiness in repartee on she originality as well as facility of expression and on she perfect possession of the royal art of speak to a whole company with such notice of each member of it that each think himself the person to whom she remark be principally address she possess another accomplishment also of great value to prince -- a tenacious recollection of face and name and she have make herself acquaint with the history of all the chief noble so as to be able to make graceful allusion to fact in they family annals of which they be proud and what be perhaps even more important to avoid unpleasant or dangerous topic the king himself be not insensible to the increase of attraction which she charm both of person and manner confer on the royal palace he be perfectly satisfy with the civility of she behavior to madame du barri who admit that she have nothing to complain of and the only point in which even mercy the most critical of judge see any room for alteration in she conduct be a certain remissness in bestow she notice on man of real eminence and on foreign visitor if they be not of the very highest rank the remark as to the latter class be perhaps dictate by a somewhat excessive natural susceptibility and by a laudable desire that any german who return from france to they own country should sing she praise in she native land perhaps one of the strongest proof of the regard in which at this time she be hold by all party in the court be find in the circumstance that the count de provence himself very soon find it impossible to continue he countenance to the intrigue against she which he have previously favor he prefer ingratiate himself and the countess with she marie antoinette be always placable and from the first have be eager as the head of the family to place she sister-in-law at she ease so that when the count evince he desire to stand on a friendly footing with she she show every disposition to meet he wish and the spring and summer of 1772 exhibit to the courtier who be little accustomed to such scene a happy example of a intimate family union marie antoinette have always be fond of music and as we have see before ever since she arrival in france have devote fixed hour to she music-master and now on almost every evening which be not otherwise preoccupy she give little concert in she apartment to the royal family they principal attendant and a few of the chief noble of the court be herself occasionally one of the performer and maintain she character as a hostess by a combined affability and dignity which make all she guest please with themselves as with she and set all imitation and all detraction alike at defiance chapter vi marie antoinette wish to see paris -- intrigue of madame adelaide -- character of the dauphin and the count de provence -- grand review at fontainebleau -- marie antoinette ill the hunting field -- letter from she to the empress -- mischievous influence of the dauphin 's aunt on she character -- letter of marie antoinette to the empress -- she affection for she old house -- the prince be recall from exile -- lord stormont -- great fire at the hôtel-dieu -- liberality and charity of marie antoinette -- she go to the bal d'opéra -- she feeling about the partition of poland -- the king discuss politics with she and think highly of she ability it be a curious proof of the mischievousness as well as of the extent of the influence which madame adelaide and she sister be able to exert over the indolence and apathy of they father that when marie antoinette have for more than two year be marry and live within twelve mile of paris she have never yet see it by daylight although the universal and natural expectation of the citizen have be that the royal pair would pay the city a state visit immediately after they marriage she own wish have not be consult in the matter for she be naturally anxious to see the beautiful city of which she have hear so much and the delay which have take place be equally at variance with madame de noailles ' notion of propriety but when the countess suggest a plan for visit the capital _ incognito _ propose that the dauphiness should drive as far as the entrance to the suburb and then have send on she saddle-horse should ride along the boulevard madame adelaide profess a desire to join the party raise so many difficulty on the subject of the retinue which be to follow and be so successful in create jealousy between she own lady and those in attendance on marie antoinette that madame de noailles be force to recommend the abandonment of the project mercy be far more annoyed than he young mistress he see that the secret object of madame adelaide be to throw as many hindrance as possible in the way of the dauphiness win popularity by appear in public while he also correctly judge hat it would be consistent both with propriety and with she interest as the future queen of the country rather to seek and even make opportunity for enable the people to become acquaint with she but to marie antoinette any disappointment of that kind be a very trifling matter she have vexation which as she tell the embassador she could not explain even to he and they keep alive in she a feeling of homesickness which in all person of amiable and affectionate disposition must require some time to subdue even when she brother the archduke ferdinand have quit vienna in the precede autumn to enter on the honorable post of governor of lombardy she have not congratulate but condole with he feel by she own experience how much it cost to be separate from one 's family and what she have find in she own home do not as yet make up to she for all she have leave behind even she husband though uniformly kind in language and behavior be of a singularly cold and undemonstrative disposition and it almost seem as if the gayety which he exhibit at she ball be a effort so foreign to he nature that he indemnify himself by unpardonable boorishness on other occasion the count de provence have but little more polish and a far worse temper squabble often take place between the two brother though both married man they be still in age only boy and on more than one occasion they proceed to act of personal violence to each other in she presence luckily no one else be by and she be able to pacify and reconcile they but she could hardly avoid feeling ashamed of have be call on to exert herself in such a cause or contrast the undignified boisterousness -lrb- to give it no worse name -rrb- of such scene with the decorous self-respect which with all they simplicity of character have always govern the conduct of she own relation not but that in the opinion of mercy -lrb- 1 -rrb- the dauphin be endow by nature with a more than ordinary share of good quality he fault be only such as proceed from a excessively bad education he have many most essential virtue he be a young man of perfect integrity and straightforwardness he be desirous to hear the truth and it be never necessary to beat about the bush or to have recourse to roundabout way of bring it before he on the contrary to speak to he with perfect frankness be the surest way both to win he esteem and to convince he reason on one or two occasion in which he have consult the embassador mercy have express he opinion without the least reserve and have perceive that the young prince have like he better for he candor the king still keep up the habit of spend the greater part of the autumn at compiègne and fontainebleau visit which marie antoinette welcome as a holiday from the etiquette of versaille she write word to she mother that she be grow very fast and take ass ' milk to keep up she strength that that regimen with constant exercise be do she great good and that she have gain great praise for the excellence of she ride on one occasion when they be at fontainebleau she especially delight the officer of she husband 's regiment of cuirassier when the king review it in person the dauphin himself take the command of he man and put they through they evolution while she ride by he side he then present each of the officer to she separately and she distribute cockade to the whole body the first she give to the dauphin himself -lrb- 2 -rrb- who place it in he hat each officer as he receive he do the same and after the king have take he departure she with she husband remain on the field for a hour converse freely with the soldier and show the greatest interest in all that concern the regiment throughout the day the young prince have exhibit a knowledge of the profession and a readiness as well as a ease of manner which have surprise all the spectator and mercy have the satisfaction of hearing every one attribute the admirable appearance which he have make on so important a occasion -lrb- for it be the first time of he appear in such a position -rrb- to the example and hint of the dauphiness it be scarcely less of a public appearance while it be one in which the king himself probably take more interest when a few day afterward on the occasion of a grand stag-hunt in the forest she join in the chase in a hunting uniform of she own devise the king be so delighted that he scarcely leave she side and extol she taste in dress as well as she skill in horsemanship to all whom he honor with he conversation but the empress be not quite so well pleased she disapproval of horse exercise for young married woman be as strong as ever she have also interpret some of she daughter 's submissive reply to she admonition on the subject as a promise that she would not ride and she scold she severely -lrb- no weaker word can express the asperity of she language -rrb- for neglect of she engagement as well as for the risk of accident which be incur by those who follow the hound and some of which as she hear have befall the dauphiness herself she daughter 's explanation be as frank as it deserve to be account sufficient while she letter be interesting also as show she constant eagerness to exculpate herself from the charge of indifference to she german countryman a eagerness which prove how firmly she believe the notion to be fix in the empress 's mind i expect my dear mamma that people must have tell you more about my ride than there really be to be tell i will tell you the exact truth the king and the dauphin both like to see I on horseback i only say this because all the world perceive it and especially while we be absent from versaille they be delighted to see I in my riding-habit but though i own it be no great effort for I to conform myself to they desire i can assure you that i never once let myself he carry away by too much eagerness to keep close to the hound and i hope that in spite of all my giddiness i shall always allow myself to be restrain by the experienced hunter who constantly accompany I and i shall never thrust myself into the crowd i should never have suppose any one could have report to you as a accident what happen to I in fontainebleau every now and then one find in the forest large step stone and as we be go on very gently my horse stumble on one cover with sand which he do not see but i easily hold he up and we go on esterhazy be at we ball yesterday every one be greatly please with he dignified manner and with he style of dancing i ought to have speak to he when he be present to I and my silence only proceed from embarrassment as i do not know he it would be do I great injustice to think that i have any feeling of indifference to my country i have more reason than any one to feel every day of my life the value of the blood which flow in my vein and it be only from prudence that at time i abstain from show how proud i be of it i never neglect any mode of pay attention to the king and of anticipate he wish as far as i can i hope that he be please with I it be my duty to please he my duty and also my glory if by such means i can contribute to maintain the alliance of the two house -lrb- 3 -rrb- the empress be but half pacify about the ride and hunting she own that if both the king and the dauphin approve of it she have nothing more to say though she still blame the dauphiness for forget a promise which she understand to have be make to herself at the same time no language could be kinder than that in which she ask whether she daughter could believe that she would wish to deprive she of so innocent a pleasure she who would give she very life to procure she one if she be not apprehensive of mischievous consequence she apprehension be solely dictate by she anxiety to see she daughter bear a heir to the throne but she would by no means admit she excuse for give the hungarian prince a cold reception how she say could she forget that she little antoinette when not above twelve or thirteen year old know how to receive people publicly and say something polite and gracious to every one and how could she suppose that the same daughter now that she be dauphiness could feel embarrassment embarrassment be a mere chimera but the truth be that it be not a mere chimera mercy have more than once deplore as one among the mischievous effect of madame adelaide 's constant interference and domineering influence that it have breed in marie antoinette a timidity which be wholly foreign to she nature and indeed it be hardly possible for one still so young to be aware that she be surround by unfriendly intriguer and spy and to preserve that uniform presence of mind which she rank and position make so desirable for she and which be in truth so natural to she that she at once recover it the moment that she circumstance change and a probability of a early change be already apparent during the last month of 1772 there be a general idea that the king 's health and mental faculty be both give away and all the different party about versaille begin to show they sense of she approach authority it be remark that both the minister and the mistress have become very guard in they language and in they behavior to she and she husband the count de provence take a curious way of show he expectation of a change by deliver she a long paper of counsel for she guidance the chief object of which be to warn she against hold such frequent conversation with mercy she apparently think that the writer 's desire be to remove the embassador from she confidence that he himself might occupy the vacant place and she show she opinion of the value of the advice by read it to mercy and then put it into the fire some extract from the first letter which she write to she mother in 1773 will serve to give we a fair idea of she feeling at this time both from what it do and from what it do not mention the intelligence which have reach she about she sister recall to she mind she own anxiety to become a mother she disappointment in this matter be indeed one of the most constant topic of lamentation in the letter of both daughter and mother till it be remove by the birth of the princess royal but that be she only vexation in every other respect she seem perfectly contented with the course which affair be take while we see how thoroughly unspoiled she be both in the warmth of the affection with which she speak of she family and greet the little memorial of home which have be send she and still more in the continuance of she act of charity and in she design that she benevolence should be unknown i hear that the queen -lrb- 4 -rrb- be expect to be confine i hope she child will be a son when shall i be able to say the same of myself they tell I too that the grand duke -lrb- 5 -rrb- and he wife be go into spain i greatly wish that they would conceive a dread of the sea-voyage and take this place in they way the journey would be a little longer but they would be well receive here for my brother be very highly think of and besides i be somewhat jealous at be the only one of my family unacquainted with my sister-in-law the picture of my little brother which you have send I have give I great pleasure i have have they set in a ring and wear it every day those who have see my brother at vienna pronounce the picture very like and every one think they very good-looking new-year 's - day here be a day of a great crowd and grand ceremony there be nothing either to blame or to praise in the degree in which i adopt my dear mamma 's advice the favorite come to pay she respects to I at a moment when my apartment be very full it be impossible for I to address myself to every one separately so i speak to the whole company in a body and i have reason to believe that both the favorite and she sister who be she principal adviser be pleased though i have also reason to believe that two day afterward m d'aiguillon try to persuade they that they have be ill-treated as for the minister himself he have never complain of I and indeed i have always be careful to treat he equally well with the rest of he colleague you will have learn my dear mamma that the duc d'orléans and the duc de chartre be return from banishment i be glad of it for the sake of peace and for that of the tranquillity and comfort of the king but if she have be in the king 's place i do not think my dear mamma would have accept the letter which they have dare to write and which they have get print in foreign newspaper -lrb- 6 -rrb- i be glad to see m de stormont -lrb- 7 -rrb- i ask he all the news about my dear family and it be a pleasure to he to inform I he seem to I to have overcome he prejudice and every one here think he a man of thorough high-breeding i have desire m de mercy to invite he to one of my Monday ball we be go to have one at madame de noailles ' they will last till ash-wednesday they will begin a hour or two later than they use to that we may not be so tired as we be last year when we come to lend in spite of the amusement of the carnival i be always faithful to my poor harp and they say that i make great progress with it i sing too every week at the concert give by my sister of provence although there be very few people there they be very well amuse and my singing give great pleasure to my two sister -lrb- 8 -rrb- i also find time to read a little i have begin the ` history of england ' by mr hume it seem to I very interesting though it be necessary to recollect that it be a protestant who have write it all the newspaper have speak of the terrible fire at the hotel-dieu -lrb- 9 -rrb- they be oblige to remove the patient into the cathedral and the archbishop 's palace there be generally from five to six thousand patient in the hospital in spite of all the exertion that be make it be impossible to prevent the destruction of a great part of the building and though it be now a fortnight since the accident happen the tire be still smolder in the cellar the archbishop have enjoin a collection to be make for the sufferer and i have send he a thousand crown i say nothing of my have do so to any one and the compliment which they have pay I on it have be embarrass to I but they have say it be right to let it be know that i have send this money for the sake of the example she be on this as on many other occasion one of those who do good by stealth and blush to find it fame one of she saying with which she more than once repress the panegyric of those who as it seem to she extol she benevolence too loudly be that it be not worth while to say a great deal about give a little assistance and on this occasion so secret have she intend to keep she benevolence that she have not mention it to de vermond or even to mercy but she judge rightly that the empress would enter into the feeling which have prompt both the act and also the silence and she be amply reward by she mother 's praise i have be enchant the empress write in instant reply with the thousand crown that you have send to the hôtel-dieu and you speak very properly in say that you have be vex at people speak to you about it such action ought to be know to god alone and i be certain that you act in that spirit still those who publish you act have good reason for what they do as you say yourself think of the influence of you example my dear little girl we owe this example to the world and to set such be one of the most essential and most delicate duty of we condition the more frequently you can perform act of benevolence and generosity without crippling you means too much the better and what would be ostentation and prodigality in another be become and necessary for those of we rank we have no other resource but those of confer benefit and show kindness and this be even more the case with a dauphiness or a queen consort which i myself have not be there could hardly be a better specimen of the principle on which the empress herself have govern she extensive dominion or of the value of she example and instruction to she daughter than that which be contain in these few line but it be not always that such lesson be so closely follow as they be by the virtuous and beneficent dauphiness the winter pass on cheerfully the ordinary amusement of the palace be vary by she go with the dauphin and the count and countess of provence to one of the public mask ball of the opera-house a diversion which consider the unavoidably mixed character of the company it be hard to avoid think somewhat unsuited to so August a party but one which have be too frequently countenance by different member of the royal family for several year for such a visit to cause remark though the mask of the prince and princess could not long preserve they secret another favorite amusement of the court at this time be the representation of proverb in which marie antoinette act with the little elizabeth and we have a special account of one such performance which be give in she honor by one of she lady have be originally devise for the day of saint anthony as she saint 's day -lrb- 10 -rrb- though it be postpone on account of she be confine to she room with a cold the proverb be better late than never and as the most acceptable compliment to the dauphiness the manager introduce a number of character attire in a diversity of costume intend to represent the native of all the country rule over by the empress-queen each of whom make a speech in which the praise of marium teresa and marie antoinette be happily combine the king get better and intrigue of all kind be revive but aid by mercy 's counsel and support by the dauphin 's unalterable affection marie antoinette disconcert all that be aim at she by the uniform prudence of she conduct happily for she with all he defect she husband be still one in whom she could feel perfect confidence as she tell mercy under any conceivable circumstance she be sure of he view and intention be always right the only difficulty be to engage he in a sufficiently decide course of action which he timid and sluggish disposition render almost painful to he and just at this moment she be more anxious than usual to inspire he with she own feeling and spirit because she could not avoid fear that the discontent with which the few people in france who deserve the name of statesman regard the recent partition of poland might create a coolness between france and austrium calculate to endanger the alliance the continuance of which be so indispensable to she happiness and as she be firmly convince to the welfare of both country she converse more than once with mercy on the subject and she reflection both on the partition and on the degree in which the mutual interest of the two nation be concern in they remain unite give he a very good idea of she political capacity he also report to he imperial mistress that he have find out that king loui have conceive the same opinion of she and have begin to discuss affair of importance with she he trust that he majesty would get a habit of do so since if he life should be spare she would thus in time become able to exert a very useful influence over he and as at all event it be absolutely certain that some day or other she would govern the kingdom it be of the very greatest consequence to the success of the great and brilliant career which she have before she that she should previously accustom herself to regard affair with such principle and view as be suitable to the position which she must occupy chapter vii marie antoinette be anxious for the maintenance of the alliance between france and austrium -- she with the dauphin make a state entry into paris -- the dames de la halle -- she praise the courtesy of the dauphin -- she delight at the enthusiasm of the citizen -- she with the dauphin go to the theater and to the fair of st ovide and to st cloud -- be enthusiastically receive everywhere -- she learn to drive -- she make some relaxation in etiquette -- marriage of the comte d'artoi -- the king 's health grow bad -- visit of marshal lacy to versaille -- the king catch the small-pox -- madame du barri quit versaille -- the king die politics be indeed take such a hold over marie antoinette that they begin to furnish some topic for she letter to she mother one of which show that she have already form that opinion of french fickleness which she have afterward too abundant cause to maintain i do hope she say that the good intelligence between we two nation will last one good thing in this country be that if ill-natured feeling be quick to arise they disappear with equal rapidity the king of prussium be innately a bad neighbor but the english will also always be bad neighbor to france and the sea have never prevent they from do she great mischief we might firstly demur to any action of we statesman be class with the treacherous aggression of frederick of prussium nor do many year of she husband 's reign pass over before the greatest of english minister propose and conclude a treaty between the two country which he fondly and wisely hope would lay the foundation of a better understanding if not of a lasting peace between the two country but even before that treaty be frame and before pitt 's voice have become predominant in the state marie antoinette 's complaint that the sea have never disarm we of power to injure france have receive the strongest exemplification that as yet the history of the two nation afford in rodney 's great victory however she soon turn to more agreeable subject and proceed to speak of a pleasure to which she be look forward and which as we have already see have be unaccountably defer till this time in defiance of all propriety and of all precedent i hope that the dauphin and i shall make we entry into paris next month which will be a great delight to I i do not venture to speak of it yet though i have the king 's promise : it would not be the first time that they have make he change he mind the most elaborate exposure of the cabal and intrigue which ever since she marriage have be persistently direct against marie antoinette could not paint they so forcibly as the simple fact that three year have now elapse since she marriage and that though the state entrance of the heir of the crown and he bride into the metropolis of the kingdom ought to have be a prominent part of the marriage festivity it have never yet take place nor though loui have at last give he formal promise that it should be no longer delay do the young pair even yet feel sure that a influence superior to theirs might not induce he to recall it however at last the intrigue be baffle and on the 8th of June the visit which have be expect by the parisian with a eagerness exceed that of the dauphiness herself be make it be in every respect successful and it be due to marie antoinette to let the outline of the proceeding be describe by herself versaille June 14th my dearest mother -- i absolutely blush for you kindness to I the day before yesterday mercy send I you precious letter and yesterday i receive a

comparison with the cordial welcome give to they by the poorer citizen while they on they part must have be equally gratify at perceive the sincere pleasure with which she and the dauphin accept they salutation a feeling how different from that which have animated any of they prince for many year we may judge from the order give to the guard to forbear beat the crowd which gather round they as no doubt without such a order the soldier would have think it usual and natural to do not that the proceedings of the day have not be magnificent and impose enough to attract the admiration of any who think less of the heart of the citizen than of pomp and splendor the royal train convey from versaille in six state carriage be receive at the city gate by the governor the marshal duc de brissac accompany by the head of the police the provost of the merchant and all the other municipal authority the marshal himself be the heir of the comte de brissac who nearly two century before be also governor of pari have tender to the victorious henry iv the submission of the city but henry be as yet only the chief of a party not the accept sovereign of the whole nation and the enthusiasm with which half the citizen rain they shout of exultation in he honor have its drawback in the sullen silence of the other half who regard the great bourbon as they conqueror rather than they king and he triumphant entrance as they defeat and humiliation to-day all the citizen be but one party as but one voice be hear so but one heart give utterance to it the joy be as unanimous as it be loud from the city gate the royal party pass on to the great national cathedral of notre dame and from thence to the church dedicate by clovi the first christian king to st geneviève whose recent restoration be the most creditable work of the present reign and which subsequently under the new name of the pantheon be destine to become the resting-place of many of the worthy whose memory the nation cherish with endure pride at last they reach the tuilery they progress have be arrest at different point by deputation of all kind with loyal and congratulatory address at the hôtel-dieu by the prioress with a company of nun on the quaus contus by the provost of the mint with he officer before the college bear the name of its founder loui le grand the rector of the university at the head of he student greet they in a latin speech at the close of which he secure the re-doubling of the acclamation of the pupil by promise they a holiday not that the cheer require any increase the citizen in they ecstasy do not even think they voice sufficient as the royal couple move slowly through the garden of the tuilery arm-in-arm every hand be employ in clap hat be throw up and every token of joy which enthusiasm ever devise be display to the equally delighted visitor good heaven what a crowd say marie antoinette to de brissac who have some difficulty in keep he place at she side madame say the old warrior as courtly as he be valiant if i may say so without offend my lord the dauphin they be all so many lover when they have make the circuit of the garden and return to the palace the most curious part of the day 's ceremony await they a banqueting-table be arrange for six hundred guest and those guest be not the noble of the nation nor the clergy nor the must renowned warrior nor the municipal officer but the fish-woman of the city market a custom so old that its origin can not be trace have establish the right of these dame to bear a especial part in such festivity in the course of the morning they have make they future queen free of they market with a offering of fruit and flower and now as accord to a singular usage of the court no male subject be ever allow to sit at table with a queen or dauphiness of france the dinner party over which the youthful pair sit side by side preside consist wholly of these dame whose profession be not generally consider as impart any great refinement to the manners and who before the close of the entertainment show in more case than one that they have import some of the notion and fashion of they more ordinary place of resort into the royal palace it be characteristic of marie antoinette that in she description of the day to she mother she have dwell with special emphasis on the gracious deportment of she husband it be equally natural for mercy to assure the empress -lrb- 2 -rrb- that it have be the grace and elegance of the dauphiness herself which have attract general admiration and that it be to she example and instruction that every one attribute the courteous demeanor which as he do not deny the young prince have unquestionably exhibit it be she whom the king as he affirm have compliment on the result of the day a success which she have gracefully attribute to himself say that he must be greatly beloved by the parisian to induce they to give he child so splendid a reception -lrb- 3 -rrb- to whomsoever it be owe the embassador certainly do not exaggerate the opinion of the world around he when he affirm that in the memory of man no one recollect any ceremony which have make so great a sensation and have be attend by so complete a success and it be follow up as she expect by several visit to the different parisian theater which in compliance with the king 's express direction be make in all the state which would have be observe have he himself be present salute be fire from the bastile and the hotel des invalides company of royal guard line the vestibule and the passage of the theater sentinel stand even on the stage but fond as the french are of martial finery and parade the spectator pay little attention to the soldier or even to the actor all eye be fix on the dauphiness alone at mercy 's suggestion the dauphin and she have previously obtain the king 's permission to allow the violation of the rule which forbid any clapping of hand in the presence of royalty this relaxation of etiquette be hail as a great condescension by the play-goer and throughout the evening of they appearance at the italian comedy the spectator have already make abundant use of they new privilege when the enthusiasm be bring to a height by a chorus which end with the loyal burden of vive le rous clerval the performer of the principal part add et ses cher enfant and the compliment be re-echoed from every part of the house with continued clapping and cheer till it remind marie antoinette of a somewhat similar scene which as a child she have witness in the theater of vienna -lrb- 4 -rrb- when the empress from she box have announce to the audience that a son -lrb- the heir to the empire -rrb- have just be bear to the archduke leopold the ice be thus as it be once break the dauphin and dauphiness take many opportunity of appear in public during the follow month visit the great pari fair of st ovide as it be call walk up and down the alley and make purchase at the stall the whole place loui xv to which the fair have recently be remove be illuminate and the crowd greet they with repeat and enthusiastic cheer they also go in state to the exhibition of picture at the louvre and drive to st cloud to walk about the park attach to that palace which be one of the most favorite place of resort for the parisian on the fine summer evening so that while the court be at versaille scarcely a week elapse without she give they a opportunity of see she in which it be evident that she fully share they pleasure to be loved be with she a necessity of she very nature and as she be constantly refer with pride to the attachment feel by the austrian for she mother she fix she own chief wish on inspiring with a similar feeling those who be to become she and she husband 's subject she be at least for the time reward as she desire this be indeed say they the best of innovation the best of revolution -lrb- 5 -rrb- to see the prince mingle with the people and interesting themselves in they amusement this be really to unite all class to attach the country to the palace and the palace to the country and it be to the dauphiness that the credit of this new state of thing be universally attribute she be look forward to a greater pleasure in a visit from she brother the emperor which the empress hope might be attend with consequence more important than those of pass pleasure since she trust to he influence and if opportunity should occur to he remonstrance to induce the dauphin to break through the unaccountable coldness with which in some respects he still treat he beautiful wife but joseph be force to postpone he visit and the fulfillment of the empress 's anticipation be also postpone for some year however marie antoinette never allow disappointment to dwell in she mind longer than she could help she rather strive to dispel the recollection of they by such amusement as be within she reach she learn to drive and find great diversion in be she own charioteer through the glade of the forest she begin to make further inroad in the court etiquette give ball in which she break through the custom which prescribe that special place should be mark out for the royal family and direct that the prince and princess should sit with the rest of the company during the interval between the dance a arrangement which enable she to talk to every one and which gain she general good-will from the graciousness of she manner she do not greatly trouble herself at the jealousy of she popularity openly display by she aunt and she sister-in-law who could not bear to hear she call la bellissima -lrb- 6 -rrb- nor be she influence weaken when in November a fresh princess the sister of madame de provence arrive from italy to be marry to the comte d'artoi for the bride be even less attractive than she sister accord to mercy she be pale and thin have a long nose and a wide mouth dance badly and be very awkward in manner so that loui himself though usually very punctilious in he courtesy to those in she position could not forbear show how little he admire she a incident occur on the evening of the marriage which be worth remark from the change which subsequently take place in the taste of the dauphiness who a few year afterward provoke unfavorable comment by the ardor with which she surrender herself to the excitement of the gaming-table as a matter of course a grand party be invite to the palace to celebrate the event of the morning and as a invariable part of such entertainment a table be set out for the then fashionable game of lansquenet at which the king himself play with the royal family and all the principal person of the court in the course of the evening marie antoinette win more than seven hundred pound but she be rather embarrassed than gratify by she good fortune she have try to lose the money back but as she have be unable to succeed the next morning she send the greater part of it to the curate of versaille to be distribute among the poor and give the rest to some of she own attendant who seem to she to need it be determine as she say to keep none of it for herself the winter revive the apprehension concern the king 's health he be manifestly sink into the grave while that which should accompany old age as love obedience honor troops of friend he might not look to have he very mistress begin with great zeal than ever though with no better taste to seek to conciliate the dauphiness she try to purchase she good-will by a bribe she be aware that the princess greatly admire diamond and learn that a jeweler of pari have a pair of ear-ring of a size and brilliancy so extraordinary that the price which he ask for they be 700000 franc she persuade the comte de noaille to carry they to marie antoinette to show they with a message from herself that if the dauphiness like to keep they she would induce the king to make she a present of they -lrb- 7 -rrb- whether marie antoinette admire they or not she have far too proper a sense of dignity to allow herself to be entrap into the acceptance of a obligation by one whom she so deservedly despise she reply coldly that she have jewel enough and do not desire to increase the number but the overture thus make by madame du barri could not be keep secret and more than one of she partisan follow the hint afford by she example and show a desire to make they peace with they future queen the duc d'aiguillon himself be among the foremost of she courtier and entreat the mediation of mercy in he favor make the ambassador he messenger to assure she that he should impose it upon himself as a law to comply with she wish in every thing and only desire that he might be allow to know which of the request that she might make be dictate by she own judgment and which merely proceed from she indulgent favor to the importunity of other for marie antoinette have of late often break through the rule which in compliance with she mother 's advice she have at first lay down for herself to abstain from recommend person for preferment and have press many a petition on the minister 's notice as to which it be self-evident that she could know nothing of they merit nor feel any personal interest in they success in the spring of 1774 she have a opportunity of convince she mother that any imputation of neglect of she countryman when visit the court be unfounded by the marked honor which she pay to marshal lacy one of the most honor veteran of the seven year ' war know how highly he be esteem by she mother she take care to be inform beforehand of the day of he arrival she give order that he should find invitation to she party await he she make arrangement to give he a private audience even before he see the king where she reception of he show how deep and ineffaceable be she love for she family and she old home even while fairly recognize the fact that she first duty and she first affection now belong to france the old warrior avow that he have be greatly move by the touching affection with which she speak to he of she love and veneration for she mother and by the tear which he see in she eye when she say that the one thing want to she happiness be the hope of be allow one day to see that dear mother once more she show he some of the last present which the empress have send she and dwell with fond minuteness of observation on some view of schönbrunn and other spot in the neighborhood of vienna which be endear to she by she early recollection the return of mild weather seem to be bring with it same return of strength to the king when on the 28th of April he be suddenly seize with illness which be presently pronounce by the physician to be the small-pox all be consternation at versaille for it be soon perceive to be a severe if not a malignant attack and at the same time all be perplexity thirty year before when loui have be suppose to be on he deathb at metz bishop peer and minister have find in the loss of royal favor reason to repent the precipitation with which they have insist on the withdrawal of madame de châteauroux and now should he again recover it be likely that madame du barri would he equally resentful and that the confessor who should make she removal a necessary condition of he administer the sacrament of the church to the king and the courtier who should support or act upon they requisition would surely find reason to repent it accordingly for the first few day of loui 's illness she remain at versaille but he grow visibly worse he daughter who though they have not have the disease themselves tend he sick-bed with the most devoted and fearless affection consult the physician who declare it dangerous to admit of any further delay in the ministration of the rite of the church he himself give he sanction to the lady ' departure and then the royal confessor administer the sacrament and draw up a declaration to be publish in the royal name that though he owe no account of he conduct to any but god alone he nevertheless declare that he repent have give rise to scandal among he subject and only desire to live for the support of religion and the welfare of he people even this avowal the cardinal de roche-aymer promise madame du barri to suppress but the royal confessor the abbé mandoux overrule he and compel its publication in spite of the duc de richelieu the chief confidant of the mistress and long the chief minister and promoter of the king 's debauchery who insult the cardinal with the grossest abuse for he breach of promise -lrb- 8 -rrb- it may be doubt whether such a compromise with profligacy and such a profanation of the most solemn rite of the church by its minister be not the greatest scandal of all but it be in too complete harmony with they conduct throughout the whole of the reign and as it be impossible but that religion itself should suffer in the estimation of worldly man from such a open disregard of all but its mere outward form it can hardly be deny that the french cardinal and prelate about the court have almost as great a share in bring about that general feeling of contempt for all religion which lead to that formal disavowal of god himself which be witness twenty year later as the scoffer who be now unite against it or the profess infidel who then renounce it such as it be the king 's act of penitence be not perform too soon at the end of the first week of may all prospect of he recovery vanish mortification set in and on the 10th of may he die chapter viii the court leave versaille for la muette -- feeling of the new sovereign -- madame du barri be send to a convent -- marie antoinette write to maria teresa -- the good intention of the new sovereign -- madame adelaide have the small-pox -- anxiety of marium teresa -- mischievous influence of the aunt -- position and influence of the count de mercy -- loui consult the queen on matter of policy -- she prudence -- she begin to purify the court and to relax the rule of etiquette -- she care of she page -- the king and the renounce the gift of le joyeux avénement and la ceinture de la reine -- she procure the pardon of the due de choiseul throughout the morning of the 10th of may there be great confusion and agitation at versaille the physician declare that the king could not live out the day and the dauphin have decide on remove he household to the smaller palace of la muette at choisy to spend in that comparative retirement the first week or two after he grandfather 's death during which it would hardly be decorous for the royal family to be see in public but as it be not think seemly to appear to anticipate the event by quit versaille while loui be still alive a light candle be place in the window of the sick-room which the moment that the king have expire be to be extinguish as a signal to the equerry to prepare the carriage the dauphin and dauphiness be in a adjoining room await the intelligence when at about three o'clock in the afternoon a sudden trampling of foot be hear and madame de noailles enter the apartment to entreat they to advance into the saloon to receive the homage of the prince and principal officer of the court who be wait to pay they respects to they new sovereign they come forward arm-in-arm and in tear in which sincere sorrow be mingle with not unnatural nervousness receive the salutation of the courtier and immediately afterward leave versaille with all the family loui xvi and marie antoinette have now reach the pinnacle of human greatness as sovereign of one of the noblest empire in the world yet the first feeling which they elevation have excite in both and especially in the queen be rather those of dismay and perplexity than of exultation in the precede autumn mercy -lrb- 1 -rrb- have remark to the empress with surprise and vexation that though the dauphiness exhibit singular readiness and acuteness in comprehend political question she be very unwilling and as it seem to he afraid of deal with they and that she shrink from the thought that the day would come when she must possess power and authority and the continuance of this feeling be visible in she first letter to she mother some passage of which show a sobriety of mind under such a change of circumstance which almost as much as the benevolence which the letter also display augured well for the happiness of the people over whom she be to reign so far at least as that happiness depend on the virtue of the sovereign choisy may 14th my dearest mother -- mercy will have inform you of the circumstance of we misfortune happily he cruel disease leave the king in possession of he sens till the last moment and he end be very edifying the new king seem to have the affection of he people two day before the death of he grandfather he send two hundred thousand -lrb- 2 -rrb- franc to the poor which have produce a great effect since he have be here he have be work unceasingly answer with he own hand the letter of the minister whom as yet he can not see and many other likewise one thing be certain and that be that he have a taste for economy and the greatest desire possible to make he people happy in every thing he have as great a desire to be rightly instruct as he have need to be i trust that god will bless he good intention the public expect great change in a moment the king have limit himself to send away the creature -lrb- 3 -rrb- to a convent and to drive from the court every thing which be connect with that scandal the king even owe this example to the people of versaille who at the very moment of he grandfather 's death insult madame do mazarin -lrb- 4 -rrb- one of the humblest servant of the favorite i be earnestly entreat to exhort the king to mercy toward a number of corrupt soul who have do much mischief for many year and i be strongly incline to comply with the request \* \* \* \* \* a messenger have just arrive to forbid my go to see my aunt adelaide who have a great deal of fever they be afraid of the small-pox for she i be horrify and can not bring myself to think of the consequence it be a terrible thing for she to pay so immediately for the sacrifice which she make i be very glad that marshal lacy be please with I i confess my dear mamma that i be greatly affect when he take leave of I at think how rarely it happen to I to see any of my countryman and especially of those who have the happiness to approach you a little time back i see madame de marmier which be a great pleasure to I since i know how highly you value she the king have allow I myself to name the lady who be to have place in my household now that i be queen and i have have the satisfaction of give the lorrainer -lrb- 5 -rrb- a proof of my regard in take for my chief almoner the abbé de sabran a man of excellent character of noble birth and already name for the bishopric about to be establish at nancy although it pleased god that i should be bear in the rank which i this day occupy still i can not forbear admire the bounty of providence in choose I the youngest of you daughter for the noblest kingdom in europe i feel more than ever what i owe to the tenderness of my August mother who expend such pain and labor in procure for I this splendid establishment i have never so greatly long to throw myself at she foot to embrace she to lay open my whole soul to she and to show she how entirely it be fill with respect and tenderness and gratitude it be impossible to read these glowing word so full of the joy and hope of youth and breathe a confidence of happiness apparently so well-founded since it be build on a resolution to use the power place in the writer 's hand for the welfare of the people over whom it be to be exert without reflect how painful a contrast to the hope now express be present by the reality of the destiny in store for she and she husband at the moment he be as little disturbed by foreboding of evil as he queen and willingly yield to she request to add a few line with he own hand to the empress that on so momentous a occasion as he accession she might not be leave to gather he feeling solely from she report of they the postscript of the letter be accordingly they joint performance he evidently desire to gratify marium teresa by praise of she daughter and she while pleased at he acquiescence not conceal she amusement at the clumsiness or to say the least the rusticity of some of he expression p in the king 's hand : i be very glad my dear mamma to find a occasion to prove to you my tenderness and my attachment i should be very glad to have you advice at this time which be so embarrassing i should be enchant to be able to please you and to show by my conduct all my attachment and the gratitude which i feel for you kindness in give I you daughter with whom i be as well satisfied as possible p by the queen : the king would not let my letter go without add a word from himself i be quite aware that it would not have be too much for he to do to write a entire letter but i must beg my dear mamma to excuse he in consideration of the mass of business with which he be occupy and also a little on account of he timidity and the embarrassed manner which be natural to he you see my dear mamma by he compliment at the end that though he have great affection for I he do not spoil I by insipid flattery it be almost equally remarkable that the empress herself though thus to see she favorite daughter on the throne of france have be she most ardent wish be far from regard the consummation of she desire with unalloyed pleasure she be so completely a politician above all thing that though she be well aware that loui xv have be one of the most infamous king that ever dishonor a throne she look upon he solely as a ally describe he to she daughter as that good and tender prince declare that she should never cease to regret he and that she would wear mourning for he all the rest of she life at the same time she do not conceal from herself that he have leave he kingdom in a most deplorable condition she have as she declare herself experience how heavy be the burden of a empire she reflect how young she daughter be and express a sad fear that she day of happiness be over she be now in a position in which there be no half-way between complete greatness and great misery -lrb- 6 -rrb- the best hope for she future the empress see in the character for purity and kindness which marie antoinette have already establish and in the esteem and affection of the people which those quality have win for she and she entreat she take it for grant that in advise she she be advise the king also to be prudent and cautious to avoid make any sudden change and above all thing to maintain the alliance between the two country and to listen to the experienced and faithful advice of she embassador marium teresa be mistake when she think that she daughter would at all time be able to lead she husband though slow in action loui be not deficient in perception on many subject he have view of he own which in some case be clear and sound enough and to which even when they be not so he adhere with considerable tenacity at the same time though he have but little affection for he aunt and still less respect for they judgment he have be so long accustom to listen to they advice while he have no authority that he could not as yet wholly shake off all feeling of deference for it and they influence be exert with most mischievous effect in the first week of he reign indeed it have be exhibit even before the reign begin though the form which it take greatly interfere with the personal comfort of the young sovereign it have be settle that the king and queen should go by themselves to la muette and that the rest of the royal family should remove to the trianon but madame adelaide have no inclination for a plan which would separate she from she nephew at a moment when so many matter of importance would come before she for decision at the last moment she prevail upon he to consent that the whole family should go to choisy together and the very next day she induce he to dismiss he minister and to place the comte de maurepa at the head of the government though loui himself have select another-statesman for the office m machault who as finance minister twenty-five year before have show both ability and integrity and who have enjoy the confidence of the king 's father and though maurepa have never be suppose to be either able or honest and might well have be regard as superannuated since he have begin he official life under loui xiv with the change in the position of marie antoinette mercy 's position have also be change and likewise he view of the line of conduct which it be desirable for she to adopt hitherto he have be the counselor of a princess who without wary walking be liable every moment to be overwhelm by the intrigue with which she be surround and he chief object have be to enable he royal pupil to escape the snare and danger which encompass she now as far as he duty could be determine by the wish of the empress in which she daughter fully acquiesce he be elevated to the post of confidential adviser to a great queen who in he opinion be inevitably destine to be the real ruler of the kingdom it be a strange position for so experienced a politician as the empress to desire for he and for so prudent a statesman to accept yet anomalous as it be and dangerous as it would usually be for a foreign embassador to interfere in the internal politics of the kingdom to which he be send he correspondence bear ample testimony to both he sagacity and he disinterestedness and it would have be well for both he royal pupil and she adopted country have he advice more frequently and more steadily guide the course of both on one point of primary importance he advice to the queen differ from that which he have be wont to give to the dauphiness while dauphiness he have urge she to abstain from any interference in public affair he now on the contrary desire to see she take a active part in they explain to the empress that the reason which actuate he be the character of the new king who as he regard he be never likely to exert the authority which belong to he with independence or steadiness but be certain to be lead by some one or other while it would in the highest degree endanger the maintenance of the alliance between france and austrium -lrb- which coincide with the judgment of he imperial mistress he regard as the most important of all political object -rrb- and be most injurious to the welfare of france and to she own personal comfort if that leader should be any one but the queen -lrb- 7 -rrb- but as we have see he could not prevent loui from yield at time to other influence take the same view of the situation as the empress if indeed marium teresa have not adopt it from he he have urge marie antoinette to prevent any change in the ministry be make at first in which it be highly probable that she do not coincide with he though equally likely that maurepa be not the minister whom she would have prefer another piece of advice which he give be however take and with the happiest effect the poorer class in pari and its neighborhood be suffer from a scarcity which almost amount to a famine and before the death of loui xv mercy have recommend that the first measure of the new reign should be one which should lower the price of bread that counsel be too entirely in harmony with the active benevolence of the new monarch to be neglect the necessary edict be issue in twenty-four hour the price of the loaf be reduce by two-fifth and mercy have the satisfaction of hear the relief generally attribute to the influence of the new queen it can not he suppose that the king know either the opinion which the empress and the embassador have form of he capacity and disposition or the advice which they have consequently give to the queen but he very early begin to show that he himself also appreciate he wife 's quickness of intelligence and correctness of judgment marium teresa in press on she daughter she opinion of the general character of the policy which the interest of france require explain she view of she daughter 's position to be that she be the friend and confidante of the king -lrb- 8 -rrb- and June have hardly arrive before he begin to discuss all he plan and difficulty with she while she spare he pride and win he further confidence by avoid all appearance of press for it as if she advice be necessary to he but at the same time show with what satisfaction she receive it to those who solicit she intervention she language be most carefully guard she do not she say interfere in any affair of state she only coincide in all the wish and intention of the king there be however matter which be strictly and exclusively within she own province and in they she at once begin to exert she authority most beneficially she first desire be to purify the court where licentiousness in either sex have long be the surest road to royal favor she begin by make a regulation that she would receive no lady who be separate from she husband and she abolish a senseless and inexplicable rule of etiquette which have hitherto prohibit the queen and princess from dining or supping in company with they husband -lrb- 9 -rrb- such a exclusion from the king 's table of those who be its most natural and become ornament have notoriously facilitate and augment the disorder of the last reign and it be obvious that its maintenance must at least have a tendency to lead to a repetition of the old irregularity fortunately the king be as little inclined to approve of it as the queen all he taste be domestic and he gladly assent to she proposal to abolish the custom throughout the reign at all ordinary meal at he supper when he come in late from hunting when he have perhaps invite some of he fellow-sportsmen to share he repast and at state banquet marie antoinette take she seat at he side not only add grace and liveliness to the entertainment but effectually prevent license and even the suspicion of scandal and as she desire that she household as well as she family should set a example of regularity and propriety to the nation she exercise a careful superintendence over the behavior of those who have hitherto be among the least-considered member of the royal establishment even the king 's confessor have think the moral of the royal page either beneath he notice or beyond he control but marie antoinette take a higher view of she duty she consider she page -lrb- 10 -rrb- as place under she charge and herself as bind to extend what one of themselves call a maternal care and kindness to they restrain as far as she could and when she could not restrain reprove they boyish excess soften they heart and win they affection by the gentle dignity of she admonition and by the condescending and hopeful indulgence with which she accept they expression of contrition and they promise of amendment in one matter too which if not exactly political be at all event of public interest she act in a manner of which none of she predecessor have set a example by a custom of immemorial antiquity at the accession of a new sovereign a tax have be levy on the whole kingdom as a offering to the king know as the gift of the happy accession -lrb- 11 -rrb- when there be a queen a similar tax be impose upon the parisian to provide what be call the girdle of the queen -lrb- 12 -rrb- it have already be mention that the distress which exist in pari at this time be so severe that just before the death of the late king loui and marie antoinette have relieve it by a munificent gift from they private purse and to lay additional burden on the people at such a time be not only repugnant to they feeling but seem especially inconsistent with they recent generosity accordingly the very first edict of the new reign announce that neither tax would be impose the people feel the kindness which dictate such a relief more than even the relief itself and repay it with expression of gratitude such as no french sovereign have hear for above a century but marie antoinette with the humility natural to she on such subject make light of she own share in the act of benevolence turn off the compliment which be pay to she with a playful jest that it be impossible for a queen to affix a purse to she girdle now that girdle have go out of fashion -lrb- 13 -rrb- on another subject also not wholly unconnected with politics since the nobleman concern have once be the chief minister but in which marie antoinette 's interest be personal she break through she usual rule of not begin the discussion with the king and request the recall from banishment of the due de choiseul a unfounded prejudice base upon calumny set on foot by the cabal of madame du barri have envenom loui 's mind against the duke he bad be lead to suspect that he own father the late dauphin have be poison and that choiseul have be accessory to the crime there be nothing more certain than that the dauphin 's death have be natural but a dislike of the accuse duke linger in the king 's mind and he elude compliance with he wife 's request till she put it on entirely personal grounds by declare it to be humiliating to herself that one to whom she be under the deepest obligation as the negotiator of she own happy marriage should be under the king 's displeasure without she be able to procure he pardon loui feel the force of the appeal thus make to he if she use that argument he could deny she nothing and the duke 's sentence be remit though he royal patroness be unable to procure he re-admission to office nor do marium teresa regret that she fail in that object since she fear he restless character and feel the alliance between the two country safer in the hand of the new foreign secretary the count de vergenne chapter ix the comte de provence intrigue against the queen -- the king give she the little trianon -- she lay out a english garden -- marium teresa caution she against expense -- the king and queen abolish some of the old form -- the queen endeavor to establish friendship with some of she younger lady -- they abuse she favor -- she eagerness for amusement -- loui enter into she view -- etiquette be abridged -- private party at choisy -- supper party -- opposition of the princess -- some of the courtier be dissatisfy at the relaxation of etiquette -- marie antoinette be accuse of austrian preference she accession to the throne however have not entirely deliver marie antoinette from intrigue it have only change they direction and object and also the persona of the intriguer she chief enemy now be the prince who ought to have be she best friend the next brother of she husband the comte de provence among the papers of loui xv the king have find proof in letter from both count and countess that they have both be actively employ in try to make mischief and to poison the mind of they grandfather against the dauphiness they become still more busy now since each day seem to diminish the probability of marie antoinette become a mother while if she should leave no child the comte de provence would be heir to the throne he scarcely make any secret that he be already contemplate the probability of he succession and as there be not want courtier to speculate also on the chance it soon become know that there be no such sure road to the favor of monsieur -lrb- 1 -rrb- as that of disparage and vilify the queen there might have be some safety for she in be put on she guard against she enemy and the king himself who call he brother tartuffe do in consequence of he discovery use great caution and circumspection in he behavior toward he but marie antoinette be of a temper as singularly forgiving as it be open : she could not bear to regard with suspicion even those of whose unfriendliness and treachery she have have proof and after a few day she resume she old familiarity with the pair as if she have no reason to distrust they slight on this subject the remonstrance of mercy who point out to she in vain that she be put weapon into they hand which they would be sure to turn against herself at this moment she be especially happy with a new pastime amidst the stately hall of versaille she have often long for a villa on a smaller scale which she might call she own and the wish be now gratify on one side of the park of versaille and about a mile from the palace the late king have build a exquisite little pavilion for he mistress which be know as the little trianon there have be a building of one kind or another on the same spot for above a century loui xiv have erect there a cottage of porcelain for he imperious favorite madame de montespan and it be the more sumptuous palace with which after she death he replace it that give rise to the strange quarrel between the haughty monarch and he equally haughty minister louvoi of which st simon have leave we so curious a account -lrb- 2 -rrb- this have be allow to fall into a state of decay and a few year before he death loui xv have pull down what remain of it and have build a third on its foundation which have be the most favorite abode of madame du barri during he life but which be now render vacant by she dismissal the house be decorate with a exquisite delicacy of taste in which loui xv have far surpass he predecessor but the chief charm of the place be generally account to be the garden which have be lay out by le notre a artist whose original genius as a landscape gardener be regard by many of he contemporary as greatly superior to he more technical skill as a architect -lrb- 3 -rrb- a few hundred yard off be another palace the great trianon but it be the little trianon which catch the queen 's fancy and on she expression of a wish to have it for she own the king at once make it over to she and pleased with she new toy marie antoinette still a girl in she impulsive eagerness for a fresh pleasure -lrb- she be not yet nineteen -rrb- begin to busy herself with remodel the pleasure-grounds with which it be surround before the time of le notre the finest garden in the country have be lay out on what be call the italian plan he be too good a patriot to copy the foreigner : he drive out the italian and introduce a new arrangement know as the french style which be in fact but a imitation of the stiff formal dutch mode but of late the english gardener have establish that supremacy in the art which they have ever since maintain and the present aim of every fashionable horticulturist in france be to copy the effect produce on the bank of the thame by wise and browne marie antoinette fall in with the prevail taste she import english drawing and hire english gardener she visit in person the count de caraman and one or two other noble who have already do something by they example to inoculate the parisian with the new fashion and presently lawn and shrubbery widen invariably simple flower-bed supplant the stately uniformity of terrace alley converge on central fountain or on alcove as solid and stiff as the palace itself and tree cut into all kind of fantastic shape which have previously be regard as the masterpiece of the gardener ' invention she happiness be at its height when at the end of a few month all be complete to she liking and she could invite she husband to a entertainment in a retreat which be wholly she own and the chief beauty of which be she own work as yet therefore all be happiness and prospect of happiness even maria teresa whose unceasing anxiety for she daughter often induce she to see the worst side of thing be render for a moment almost playful by the report which reach vienna of the universal popularity of loui xvi and he little queen she blush she say to think that in thirty-three year of she reign she have not do as much as loui have do in thirty-three day -lrb- 4 -rrb- but she still warn she daughter that every thing depend on keep up the happy impression already make that much still remain to be do and the queen 's answer show that she new authority have bring with it some care it be true she write that the praise of the king resound everywhere he deserve it well by the uprightness of he heart and the desire which he have to act rightly but this french enthusiasm disquiet I for the future the little that i understand of business show I that some matter be full of difficulty and embarrassment all agree that the late king have leave he affair in a very bad state man 's mind be divide and it will be impossible to please all the world in a country where the vivacity of the people want every thing to be do in a moment my dear mamma be quite right when she say we must lay down principle and not depart from they the king will not have the same weakness as he grandfather i hope that he will have no favorite but i be afraid that he be too mild and too easy you may depend upon it that i will not draw the king into any great expense -lrb- the empress have express a fear lest the trianon might prove a cause of extravagance -rrb- on the contrary i of my own accord have refuse to make demand on he for money which some have recommend I to make some relaxation too of the formality which have previously be maintain between the sovereign and the subordinate member of the royal family and especially a order of the king that he brother and sister be not in private intercourse to address he as he majesty have grate on the empress 's sense of the distance always to be preserve between a monarch and the very highest of he subject and she have complain that report have reach she that there be no distinction between the queen and the other princess and that the familiarity subsist in the court be extreme but marie antoinette reply in defense of the king and herself that there be great exaggeration in these report as indeed there be about every thing that go on at the court that the familiarity speak of be see but by very few it be not for I she say to judge but it seem to I that what exist among we be only the air of kindly affection and gayety which be suitable to we age it be true that the count d'artoi -lrb- who have be the special subject of some of the empress 's unfavorable comment -rrb- be very lively and very giddy but i can always keep he in order as for my aunt no one can any longer say that they lead I and as for monsieur and madame i be very far from place entire confidence in they i must confess that i be fond of amusement and be not very greatly incline to grave subject i hope however to improve by degree and without ever mix myself up in intrigue to qualify myself gradually to be of service to the king when he make I he confidante since he treat I at all time with the most perfect affection she reflection on the impulsiveness and impatience of the french character and of the difficulty which those quality place in the path of they ruler justify the praise which mercy have lavish on she sagacity for it be evident that to they the chief trouble of she later year may be clearly trace and it be difficult to avoid agree with she rather than with she mother and think the most entire freedom of intercourse between the king and he nearest relation as desirable as it be natural royalty be as the empress herself describe it a burden sufficiently heavy without its weight be augment by observance and restriction which would leave the ruler without a single friend even among the member of they own family and probably the empress herself might have see less reason for she admonition on the subject have it not be for the circumstance which be no doubt unfortunate that the royal family at this time contain no member of a graver age and a settle respectability of character who might by he example have temper the exuberance natural to the extreme youth of the sovereign and they brother not that marie antoinette be content to limit the number of those whom she admit to familiarity to she husband 's kinsman and kinswoman still fret in secret over the want of any object on whom to lavish a mother 's tenderness she seek for friendship as a substitute shut she eye to the fact that person in she rank as have no equal can have no friend in the true sense of the word nor have such a thing be possible anywhere be france the country in which to find it there disinterestedness and integrity have long be banish from she own sex almost as completely as from the other and most of those whom she take into favor make it they first object to render that favor profitable to themselves if she profess in they society to forget for a few hour that she be queen they never forget it they never lose sight of the fact that she could confer place and pension and they often discard moderation and decency in the extravagance of they solicitation while she frequently with a overamiable facility surrender she own judgment to they importunity not only grant they request but at time even adopt they prejudice and yield herself as a instrument to gratify they antipathy or resentment and the same feeling of vacancy in she heart of which she be ever painfully conscious produce in she also a constant restlessness and a craving for excitement which exhibit itself in a insatiable appetite for amusement -lrb- as she confess to she mother -rrb- and lead she to seek distraction even in pastime for which naturally she have but little inclination in these respects it can not be say that during the first year of she reign she be as uniformly prudent as she have be while dauphiness the restraint in which she have live for those four year have not be unwholesome for one so young but it have no doubt be irksome to she and the feeling of complete liberty and independence which have succeed it have by a sort of natural reaction sharpen the energy with which she now pursue she various diversion it be possible too that the zest with which she indulge herself may have derive additional keenness from the knowledge that she ill-wisher find in it pretext for misconstruction and calumny and that be conscious of entire purity in think word and deed she look on it as due to she own character to show that she set all such detraction and detractor at defiance to all caviler as also to she mother whose uneasiness be frequently arouse by gossip which reach vienna from paris she invariable reply be that she way of life have the king she husband 's entire approbation and while he feel a conjugal satisfaction in the contemplation of he queen 's attraction and grace the quality in which as he be well aware he himself be most deficient loui might well also cherish the most absolute reliance on she unswerving rectitude know the pride with which she be wont to refer to she mother 's example and to boast that the lesson which above all other she have learn from it be that to prince of she birth and rank wickedness and baseness be unpardonable indeed many of the amusement loui not only approve but share with she while she associate herself with those in which he delight as far as she could join he hunting party twice a week either on horseback or in she carriage and at all time exhibit a pattern of domestic union of which the whole previous history of the nation afford no similar example the citizen of pari could hardly believe they eye when they see they king and queen walk arm-in-arm along the boulevard and the courtier receive a lesson if they have be dispose to profit by it when on each Sunday morning they see the royal pair repair to the parish church for divine service the day be close by they public supper in the queen 's apartment and this appearance of domestic felicity be augment by the introduction of what may be call private party with which at the queen 's instigation loui consent to vary the cold formality of the ordinary entertainment of the court in the autumn they follow the example of loui xv by exchange for a few week the grandeur of versaille for the comparative quiet of some of they smaller palace and while they be at choisy they issue invitation once or twice a week to several of the parisian lady to come out and spend the day at the palace when as the principal officer of the household be not on duty they themselves do the honor to they guest the queen converse with every one with she habitual graciousness while the king also throw off he ordinary reserve and seem to enter into the pleasure of the day with a gayety and cordiality which surprise the party and which from the contrast that it present to he manner when he be by himself be very generally attribute to the influence of the queen 's example and these quiet festivity be so much to he taste that afterward when the court move to fontainebleau and when they settle at versaille for the winter he cheerfully agree to a proposal of marie antoinette to have a weekly supper party adopt also another suggestion of hers which be indispensable to render such reunion agreeable or even it may be say practicable at she request he abolish the ridiculous rule which under the last two king have forbid gentleman to be admit to sit at table with any princess of the royal family but natural as the idea seem it be not carry out without opposition on the part of madame adelaide and she sister who remonstrate against it as a infraction of all the old observance of the court till it become a contest for superiority between the queen and themselves marie antoinette take counsel with mercy and by he advice point out to she husband that to abandon the plan after it have be announce in submission to a opposition which the princess have no right to make would be to humiliate she in the eye of the whole court loui have not yet shake off all fear of he aunt but they be luckily absent so he yield to the influence which be nearest the supper take place he and the queen themselves make out the list of the guest to be invite the man be name by he and the lady be select by the queen they be a great success and as the history of the affair become know the court and the parisian generally rejoice in the queen 's triumph and be grateful to she for this as for every other innovation which have a tendency to break down the haughty barrier which during the last two reign have be establish between the sovereign and he subject nor be these pleasant informal party the only instance in which great inroad be make on the old etiquette the comte de mirabeau a man fatally connect in subsequent year with some of the most terrible of the insult which be offer to the royal family about this time describe etiquette as a system invent for the express purpose of blunt the capacity of the french prince and fix they in position of complete dependence and marie antoinette seem to have regard it with similar eye she dislike of it be quicken by the expectation which its partisan and champion entertain that she every movement be to be regulate by it and its requirement be sufficiently burdensome to tax a far better-trained patience that be natural to one who though a queen be not yet nineteen not only be no guest of the male sex except the king allow to sit at table with she but no man-servant no male officer of she household might be present when the king and she dine together as indeed usually happen even he presence could not sanction the introduction of any other man the lady of honor on she knee though in full dress present he the napkin to wipe he finger and fill he glass lady in wait in the same grand attire change the plate of the royal pair and after dinner as indeed throughout the day the queen could not quit one room in the palace for another unless some of she lady be at hand in complete court dress to attend upon she -lrb- 5 -rrb- these usage which be in reality so many chain to restrain all freedom and to render comfort impossible be abolish in the first few month of the new reign but little as be the foundation which they have in common sense and equally little as be the addition which they make to the royal dignity it be certain that many of the courtier besides madame de noailles be greatly disconcert at they extinction they regard the queen 's order on the subject as a proof of a settled preference for austrian over french fashion they begin to speak of she as the austrian a name which though madame adelaide have more than once choose it to describe she during the first year of she marriage have since that time be almost forget but which be now revive and be continually reproduce by a certain party to cast odium on many of she most simple taste and most innocent action she enemy oven affirm that in private she be wont to call the trianon she little vienna -lrb- 6 -rrb- as if the garden which she be lay out with a taste that long make it the admiration of all the visitor to versaille be dear to she not as afford a healthful and become occupation nor for the sale of the giver but only because it recall to she memory the garden of schönbrunn to which as they malice suggest she never cease to look back with unpatriotic regret in one point of view they be unquestionably correct the queen do undoubtedly desire to establish in the french court the custom and the feeling which during she childhood have prevail at vienna but they be wholly wrong in think they austrian usage they be lorrainese in they origin they have be import to vienna for the first time by she own father the emperor franci when she refer to they it be as the patriarchal manners of the house of lorraine -lrb- 7 -rrb- that she speak of they and she preference for they be found on the conviction that it be to they that she mother and she mother 's family be indebted for the love and reverence of the people which all the trial and distress of the struggle against frederic have never be able to impair nor be it only the old stiffness and formality which have be compatible with the grossest license that be now discountenance a wholly new spirit be introduce to animate the conversation with which those royal entertainment be enliven under loui xv and indeed before he reign intrigue and faction have be the real ruler of the court spiteful detraction and scandal have be its sole language but to the disposition as benevolent as they be pure of the young queen and she husband malice and calumny be almost as hateful as profligacy itself she hold with the great english dramatist she contemporary that true wit be nearly ally to good-nature -lrb- 8 -rrb- and she show herself more decide in nothing than in discourage and check every tendency to disparagement of the absent and diffuse a tone of friendly kindness over society on one occasion when she hear some of she lady laugh over a spiteful story she reprove they plainly for they mirth as bad taste on another she ask some who be thus amusing themselves how they would like any one to speak thus of themselves in they absence and before she and she precept fortify by example -lrb- for no unkind comment on any one be ever hear to pass she lip -rrb- so effectually extinguish the habit of detraction that in a very short time it be remark that no courtier venture on a ill-natured word in she presence and that even the comte de provence who especially aim at the reputation of a sayer of good thing and affect a character for cynical sharpness learn at last to restrain he sarcastic tongue and at least to pretend a disposition to look at people 's character and action with as much indulgence as herself chapter x settlement of the

other of the french prince who be accustom to treat the national treasury as a fund intend to supply the means for they utmost profusion but which certainly coincide with the view of marie antoinette herself who as we have see vindicate herself from the charge of prodigality and declare that she take great care that she improvement at the trianon should not be beyond she means yet it would not have be surprising if they have be find to be so since even after she become queen she income continue to be far too narrow for she rank the nominal allowance of all former king and queen have be fix at a unreasonably low rate from the pernicious custom of draw on the treasury for all deficiency but this mode of proceeding be inconsistent with the notion of propriety entertain by the new sovereign and with those of the new finance minister maurepa himself have never be distinguish for ability but he be sufficiently clear-sighted to be aware that the principal difficulty of the state arise from the disorder into which the profligacy and prodigality of the late reign ever since the death of the wise fleury have throw its finances and he have make a most happy choice for the office of comptroller-general of finance appoint to it a man name turgot who as intendant of the limousin have bring that province into a condition of prosperity which have make it a model for the rest of the kingdom in he new and more enlarged sphere of action turgot 's ability expand or perhaps it should rather be say have a fairer field for they display he show himself equally capable in every department of he duty as a financial reformer as a administrator and as a legislator no minister in the history of the nation have ever so united large-minded genius with disinterested integrity he have not accept office without a full perception of its difficulty he see all that have to be do and apply himself to put the finances of the nation on a healthy footing as a indispensable preface to other reform equally necessary he easily secure the co-operation of the king and queen loui cheerfully adopt the retrenchment which he recommend though some of they such as the reduction in the hunting establishment touch he personal taste but at the same time as there be no illiberality in he economy or rather as he see that real economy could only be practice if the sovereign have a fixed income really adequate to the call upon it he place they allowance on a more satisfactory footing than have ever be fix for they before the queen 's privy purse be settle at a sum which mercy agree with he would prove sufficient for all she expense though it be but 200000 franc a year and so it be generally find to be for with the exception of a occasional fancy for some splendid jewel marie antoinette have no expensive taste she economy be even far greater than she attendant approve extend to detail which they would have wish she to regard as beneath the dignity of a sovereign -lrb- 1 -rrb- and so judiciously do she manage she resource that she be able to defray out of she privy purse the pension which she occasionally confer on man eminent in art or literature whom she rightly judge it a royal duty to encourage one of she first act of liberality of this kind be exercise in favor of a countryman of she own the celebrated gluck music be one of she most favorite accomplishment she still devote a portion of almost every day in take lesson on the harp but the french music be not to she taste while since the death of handel gluck 's superiority to all he other musical contemporary have be generally acknowledge in all country she now by the gift of a pension of 6000 franc induce he to visit paris it be at the french opera that many of he most celebrated work be first give to the world and a incident which take place at the performance of one of they show that if the frequenter of versaille be dissatisfy at the inroad lately make on the old etiquette the queen have a compensation in the warm attachment with which she have inspire the parisian instead of convey the performer to versaille as have be the extravagant practice of the late reign loui and marie antoinette go into pari when they desire to visit the theater the citizen delight at the contrast which they frequent visit to the capital afford to the marked dislike of it show by the late king crowd the theater on every night on which they be expect and on one of these occasion gluck 's iphigénie be the opera select for performance it contain a chorus in which accord to the design of the dramatist achille be direct to turn to he follower with the word chantez célébrez votre reine but the french opera-singer be a courtly race the french opera have be establish a century before as a royal academy of music by loui xiv who have issue letter patent which declare the profession of a opera-singer one that might be follow even by a nobleman and it seem therefore quite consistent with the rank thus confer on they that they should take the lead in pay loyal compliment to they prince accordingly when the performer who represent the invincible son of thetis the popular tenor singer le

tear by the enthusiastic affection display toward she nor at such a moment do she suffer she feeling of the evanescent character of popularity among so light-minded a people to dwell in she mind or to mar the pleasure which such a reception be well calculate to impart popularity at this moment seem doubly valuable to she because she be not ignorant that the feeling of disappointment at the unproductiveness of she marriage have recently be increase by the knowledge that the young countess d'artoi be about to become a mother and the attachment which she inspire be not confine to the play-goer it be share by a body so little inclined to exhibition of impulsive loyalty as the parliament it have be see that loui xv have abolish that body but one of the first proposal make by maurepa to the new king have have its re-establishment for its object the question have be discuss in the king 's council and also in the royal family with great eagerness the ablest of the minister protest against the restoration of a assembly which have invariably show itself turbulent and usurp and the king himself be generally understand to share they view but marie antoinette lead by the advice of choiseul be eager in she support of maurepa and it be believe that she influence decide loui if it be so it be a exertion of she power that she have ample cause to repent at a subsequent period but at the time she think of nothing but show she sense of the general superiority of choiseul and so requite some of the obligation under which she consider that she lay to he for arrange she marriage and she receive a deputation from the re-established parliament with marked pleasure and reply to they address with a graciousness which seem intend to show that she sincerely rejoice at the event which

already inaugurate he reign contrived to extract a compliment to he even out of the severe prose of the multiplication-table publishing a joint portrait of the three king loui xii henry iv and loui xvi with a inscription beneath to testify that 12 and 4 make 16 in the spring of 1775 marie antoinette receive a great pleasure in a visit from she younger brother maximilian he be the only member of she family whom she have see in the five year that have elapse since she leave vienna but eagerly as she have look forward to he visit it do not bring she unmixed satisfaction be mar by the ill-breeding of the prince of the blood and still more by the approval of they conduct display by the citizen of pari which seem to afford a convincing evidence of the small effect which even the queen 's virtue and grace have produce in soften the old national feeling of enmity to the house of austrium the archduke who be still but a youth do not assert he royal rank while on he travels but preserve such a _ incognito _ as prince on such occasion be wont to assume and take the title of count de burgau the king 's brother however like the king himself pay no regard to he disguise but visit he at the first instant of he arrival but the prince of the blood stand on they dignity refuse to acknowledge a rank which be not publicly avowed or to recollect that the visitor be a foreigner and brother to they queen and insist on receive the attention of the first visit from he the excitement which the question cause in the palace and the queen 's indignation at the slight thus offer as she conceive to she brother be great high word pass between she and the duc d'orléans the chief of the recusant on the subject and one part of she remonstrance throw a curious additional light on the strange distance which as have be already point out the etiquette of the french court have establish between the sovereign and the very highest of they subject even the nearest of they relation the duke have insist on the _ incognito _ as debar maximilian from all claim to attention from a prince like himself whose rank be not conceal she urge that the king and he brother have not regard it in that light the duke know she say that the king have treat maximilian as a brother that he even invite he to sup in private with himself and she a honor to which no prince of the blood have ever pretended and finally warm with she subject she tell he that though she brother would be sorry not to make the acquaintance of the prince of the blood he have many other thing in pari to see and would manage to do without it -lrb- 2 -rrb- she expostulation be fruitless the prince adhere to they resolution and she to hers they be not admit to any of the festivity of the palace during the archduke 's stay and be even exclude from all the private entertainment which be give in he honor since she make it know that the king and she would refuse to attend any to which they be invite but though they conduct be surely both discourteous to a foreigner and disrespectful to they sovereign the parisian populace take they part and some of they who show themselves ostentatiously in the street of the city on day on which there be party at versaille be loudly applaud by a crowd which be not entirely draw from the lower class it be notice that the duc de chartre the son of the duc d'orléans be one of the foremost in exciting this anti-austrian feeling the outbreak of which be especially remarkable as the first instance in which the enthusiasm of the citizen for marie antoinette seem to have cool or at least to have be interrupted and this change in they feeling produce so painful a impression on she mind that after she brother 's departure she abandon she intention of go to the opera though gluck 's orfeo be to be perform lest she should meet with a reception less cordial than that to which she have hitherto be accustom this ebullition against the house of austrium however be at the moment dictate rather by discontent with the home government than by any settle feeling on the subject of foreign politics corn have be at a rather high price in pari and its neighborhood throughout the winter and the dearness be take advantage of by the enemy of turgot and employ by they as a argument to prove the impolicy of he measure to introduce freedom of trade they even organize -lrb- 3 -rrb- formidable riot at pari and versaille which however turgot whose resolution be equal to he capacity prevail on the king to repress by act of vigor very unusual to he and very foreign to he disposition the troops be call out the parliament be summon to a bed of justice and enjoin to put the law in force against the guilty two of the most violent revolter be execute order be restore and the wholly factitious character of the outbreak be prove by the tranquillity which ensue though the price of bread remain unaltered till the commencement of the harvest the citizen themselves presently make a jest of they sedition and nickname it the war of the grain -lrb- 4 -rrb- in france one excitement soon drive out another and the whole attention of the nation be now fix on the coronation which have be appoint to take place in June after some discussion it have be settle that loui should be crown alone there have not be many precedent for the coronation of a queen in france and the last instance that of marie de medicis as have be follow by the assassination of she husband be regard by many as a bad omen if marie antoinette have herself express any wish to be she husband 's partner in the solemnity it would certainly have be comply with and they subsequent fate would have be regard as a confirmation of the evil augury but she be indifferent on the subject and quite contented to behold it as a spectator it take place on Sunday the 11th of June in the grand cathedral at rheim the progress of the royal family which have quit versaille for that city on the precede Monday have resemble a triumphant procession so enthusiastic have be the acclamation which have greet the king and queen at each town through which they have pass and all the previous display of joy be outdo by the demonstration afford by the citizen of rheim itself it be midnight on the 8th of June when the queen reach the gate but the road outside and the street inside be throng with a crowd as dense as midday could have produce which follow she to the archbishop 's palace make the whole city resound with they loyal cheer and which the next morning await she coming-forth after hold a grand reception of all the noble of the province to meet the king when he make he solemn entry in the afternoon the ceremony in the cathedral be one of great magnificence but in the account of the day which after she return to versaille she write to she mother she do not enter into detail as be necessarily know to the empress in they general character confine herself rather to a description of the impression which the manifest cordiality with which the whole people have enter into the spirit of the solemnity have make upon she own mind and heart -lrb- 5 -rrb- the coronation be perfect in every respect it be make plain that every one be highly delighted with the king and so he deserve that all he subject should be great and small all display the greatest interest in he and at the moment of place the crown on he head the ceremony of the church be interrupt by the most touching acclamation i could not restrain myself my tear flow in spite of all my effort and the people be please to see they during the whole time of we journey i do my best to correspond to the earnestness of the people and although the heat be great and the crowd immense i do not regret my fatigue which moreover have not injure my health it be a very astonishing circumstance but at the same time a very pleasant one to be so well receive only two month after the revolt and in spite of the high price of bread which unhappily still continue it be a strange peculiarity in the french character to allow themselves to be so easily lead away by mischievous suggestion and then immediately to return to good behavior it be very certain that when we see people even in time of distress treat we so well we be the more bind to labor for they happiness the king seem to I penetrate with this truth as for I i feel that all my life even if i be to live a hundred year i shall never forget the coronation day but all the tumultuous pomp and exultation only make she return with renewed pleasure to she quiet retreat of the trianon which with the assistance of the illustrious buffon then superintendent of the king 's garden and of bernard de jussieu director of the jardin des plante and celebrate as one of the first botanist of europe she be lay out with a delicate taste that long render it one of the chief attraction to all the inhabitant of the district for the sentiment which she express in the letter to the empress which have just be quote be not the mere formal utterance of a barren philanthropy but be dictate and carry out by a active benevolence she feel in she inmost heart the duty which she there profess of exert herself to promote the happiness of the people and be far too unselfish to desire to keep to herself the whole of the delight she garden be calculate to afford the trianon be a possession exactly calculate to gratify she taste for innocent rural pleasure as she say herself at versaille she be a queen here she be a plain country lady superintend not only she flower but she farm-yard and she dairy take pride in she stock and she produce she would invite the king and the rest of the royal family to garden party where at a table set out under a bower of honeysuckle she would pour out they coffee with she own hand boast of the thickness of she cream the freshness of she egg the ruddiness and flavor of she strawberry as so many proof of she skill in manage she establishment and would not fear to shock she aunt by tempting one of she sister-in-law to a game at ball or battledoor and shuttlecock but she probably enjoy still more the power of gratify the inhabitant of versaille and the neighborhood the moment that she improvement be complete she open the garden to the public to walk in and give out-of-door party and child 's dance to which all the inhabitant of versaille who present themselves in decent apparel be admit she would even open the dance herself with some well-conducted boy and afterward stroll among the crowd talk affably to all the company even to the governess and nurse and delight the parent with the interest which she exhibit in the character the growth and even the name of the child there be some who startle at the unwonted sight of a sovereign so treat she subject as fellow-creature confess a fear that such familiarity be not without its danger -lrb- 6 -rrb- but the object of she condescension worship she for it and for a time at least the great majority of the nation forget that she be austrian she be now nearly twenty year of age she form have develop into a rare perfection of elegance she feature have add to the original brilliancy of she girlish loveliness something of that higher beauty which judgment and sagacity inspire and which dignity render only the more impose while the same benevolence and purity beam in every look which be remark as she most sterling characteristic on she first arrival in the country and it be not to she french or german admirer alone that we be reduce to trust for the impression which at this time she make on all beholder we have see that english gentleman and lady of rank be frequent visitor to the french court and from two of these man of widely different character talent and turn of mind we have a striking concurrence of testimony as to the power of the fascination which she exert on all who come within the sphere of she influence burke be the earlier visitor indeed it be in the last month of the precede reign while she be still dauphiness that she have excite in he enthusiastic imagination those emotion which he afterward describe in word which will live as long as the english language it be in the spring of 1774 that it seem to he that surely never light on this orb which she hardly seem to touch a more delightful vision i see she just above the horizon decorating and cheer the elevated sphere she just begin to move in -- glitter like the morning-star full of life and splendor and joy no one could be less like burke than horace walpole a cynical observer who pique himself on indifference and especially on a superiority to the vulgar belief in the merit and attraction of king and prince yet he report of the charm of marie antoinette as he see they in the autumn of this year 1775 reveal a admiration of they as vivid as that of the warm-hearted and more poetical irishman he see she as he report to lady ossory first at a state court hall -lrb- 7 -rrb- give on the occasion of the marriage of the princess clotilde in the theater of the palace and he would have desire to give he correspondent some description of the beauty of the build the bravest in the universe and yet one in which taste predominate over expense but he be absorb by the still more powerful attraction of the princess whom he have see in it : what i have to say i can tell you ladyship in a word for it be impossible to see any thing but the queen hebe and flora and helen and grace be street-walker to she she be a statue and beauty when stand or sit grace itself when she move as he be write to a lady he proceed to describe she dress which to lady of the present day may still have its interest : she be dress in silver scatter over with _ laurier _ rose few diamond and feather much lower than the monument he proceed to describe the ball itself and some of the company which be however very select but at every sentence or two he come back to the queen so deep and so real be the impression which she have make on he monsieur be very handsome the comte d'artoi be a better figure and a better dancer they character approach to those of two other royal duke -lrb- 8 -rrb- there be but eight minuet and except the queen and princess only eight lady dancer i be not so much strike with the dancing as i expect for beauty i see none or the queen efface all the rest after the minuet be french country-dance much incumber by the long train longer tress and hoop in the interval of dancing basket of peach china orange -lrb- a little out of season -rrb- biscuit ice and wine-and-water be present to the royal family and dancer the ball last just two hour the monarch do not dance but for the first two round of the minuet even the queen do not turn she back to he yet she behavior be as easy as divine such be a french court ball on day of most special ceremony a somewhat solemn affair which require graciousness such as that of marie antoinette to make admission to every one a very enviable privilege even though its stiffness have be in some degree relieve by a new regulation of the queen that the invitation which have hitherto be confine to matron should be extend to unmarried girl scarcely any change produce greater consternation among the admirer of old custom the dowager search all the register of those who have be admit to the court ball since the beginning of the century to fortify they objection but to they dismay some of the early festivity in the time of marie leczinska prove to have be share by one or two noble maiden the discovery be of little importance since marie antoinette have show that she be not afraid of make precedent but still it in some degree silence the grumbler and for the rest of the reign no one contest the queen 's right to decide who should and who should not be admit to she society chapter xi tea be introduce -- horse-racing of count d'artoi -- marie antoinette go to see it -- the queen 's submissiveness to the reproof of the empress -- birth of the duc d'angoulême -- she at time speak lightly of the king -- the emperor remonstrate with she -- character of some of the queen 's friend -- the princess de lamballe -- the countess jule de polignac -- they set the queen against turgot -- she procure he dismissal -- she gratify madame polignac 's friend -- she regard for the french people -- water party on the seine -- she health be delicate -- gambling at the palace nor be these the only innovation which mark the age a rage for adopt english fashion -- _ anglomanie _ as it be call -- begin to prevail and among the different mode in which it exhibit itself it be especially notice that tea -lrb- 1 -rrb- be now introduce and begin to share with coffee the privilege of afford sober refreshment to those who aspire in they different way to give the tone to french society a less innocent novelty be a passion for horse-racing in which the comte d'artoi and the duc de chartre set the example of indulge establish a race-course in the bois de boulogne the count have but little difficulty in persuade the queen to attend it and she soon show so decide a fancy for the sport and become so regular a visitor of it that a small stand be build for she which in subsequent year provoke some unfavorable comment when the princess obtain she leave to give luncheon in it to some of they racing friend who be not in all instance of a character deserving to be bring into a royal presence she pursue this as she pursue every other amusement which she take up with great keenness for a while so much so as to provoke earnest remonstrance from she mother whose letter be commonly dictate by mercy 's report and suggestion nor if she feel uneasiness do marium teresa spare she daughter or take any great care to moderate she language of reproof at time she tone be so severe as to excite a feeling of wonder at the submissiveness with which she letter be receive no express eulogy of she admirer could give so great a idea of marie antoinette 's amiability good-nature genuine modesty and sincere affection for she mother as the ingenuousness with which she admit error or the temper with which she urge excuse to that venerated parent she be just as patient of admonition now that she be seat on a throne as she could have be in she schoolroom at schönbrunn and in reply to the scolding -lrb- no milder word can do justice to the earnest vehemence of the letter which at this time she receive from vienna -rrb- she plead not only that a appetite for amusement be natural to she age but that she enter into none of which the king do not fully approve and none which be ever allow to interfere with she give he full enjoyment of she society whenever he have leisure or inclination for it but she reply to she mother hint also at the continuance of the old cause for she restlessness and for she eager pursuit of new diversion to distract she thought she natural desire for child of she own be greatly increase when on the 12th of August she sister-in-law the countess d'artoi present she husband with a son -lrb- 2 -rrb- she treat the young mother with a sisterly kindness suit to the occasion which extort the unqualified praise of mercy himself but she could not restrain she feeling on the subject to she mother and she express to she frankly the extreme pain which she suffer at thus see a heir to the throne who be not she own child nor be it strange that at such moment she should feel hurt at the coldness with which she husband continue to behave toward she or that she should run eagerly after any excitement which might aid in divert she mind from a comparison of she own position with that of she happier sister-in-law -lrb- 3 -rrb- it would have be well if she have confine she expression of disappointment to she mother but since we may not disguise she occasional act of imprudence it must be confess that at time she mortification lead she to speak of she husband to stranger in a tone of disparagement which be highly unbecoming maximilian have be accompany by the count de rosenburg who have in consequence be admit to the intimate society of the court during the archduke 's visit and who have inspire marie antoinette with so favorable a opinion of he character and judgment that after he return to vienna she more than once send he a account of the proceedings at the palace since she brother 's departure she describe to he a series of concert at which she have sing herself with some of she lady she give he a list of the guest remark with a particularity which seem to show that she expect she word to be report to the empress that the gentleman though amiable and well breed be not young but she also complain that the king 's taste do not resemble hers that he care for nothing but hunting and mechanical employment and indulge in a unwonted bit of sarcasm she proceed : you will allow that i should not look well beside a forge i could never become a vulcan and the part of venus would displease he more than my real taste which he do not disapprove in another letter she mention he in a tone of contemptuous pity almost equally unbecoming speaking of he as the poor man whom she have make a tool of to further some view of she own though mercy assure the empress that she assertion of have so treated he be a mere fiction of she imagination to impart a sort of lively tone to she letter that in spite of occasional outburst of levity she have in reality the firmest affection and esteem for loui and that nothing could be more irreproachable than she conduct toward he in every respect he add that the people in general do she full justice on this head that if she popularity with the parisian have for a moment suffer any diminution through the artifice of faction the cloud have be blow away and that she have be recently receive at the different theater with as fervent a loyalty as have greet even she first appearance the empress however be so uneasy that she induce she son the emperor joseph to add he expostulation to hers and he who be a prince of considerable shrewdness as well as of a high idea of the propriety of he rank write she a long letter of remonstrance impute with great truth the failing which he point out with sufficient plainness to a facility of disposition which make she indulgent to the maneuver of those whom she admit to she friendship but who do not deserve such a honor he even speak of the society which she have gather round she as calculate to prevent he from perform he promise of pay she a visit for what should he do in a court of frivolous intriguer and he conclude by urge she to prevent these false friend from make a tool of she for the gratification of they own selfishness and rapacity and to be solicitous for no friendship or confidence but that of she husband the study of whose wish be to she not only a state duty but the only one which would make she permanently happy and secure to she the lasting affection of the people there be however no subject on which marie antoinette be so little amenable to advice as the choice of she friend and none on which she more require it above all the frequenter of the court two lady be distinguish by she especial favor -- the princess de lamballe and the countess de polignac the princess a daughter of the prince de carignan in savoy have be marry to the son of the duc de penthièvre be leave a widow before she be twenty year of age she have be originally recommend to mario antoinette in the first year of she residence in france partly by she royal birth and partly by she misfortune and the attachment which the dauphiness at once conceive for she be cement by the ardor with which it be return in many respects the princess well deserve the favor with which she be regard she temper be sweet and amiable she character singularly truthful and sincere and that she might never be separate from she friend the place of superintendent of the queen 's household be revive for she some caviler be dispose to grumble at the re-establishment of a office which have be suppress as useless and costly but no one could allege that madame de lamballe abuse the royal favor and she share in the calamity of later day justify the queen 's choice by the proof it afford of the princess 's unalterable fidelity and devotion but the countess be a very different character she have indeed a well-bred air of good humor but that with she youth -lrb- she be but twenty year of age -rrb- be she only qualification for she capacity be narrow she disposition selfish and grasp and she be so inveterate a manoeuvrer that when she have no intrigue of she own on foot she be always ready to lend herself to the plot of other what be worse she do not enjoy a untainted character the name of the comte de vaudreuil be often couple with hers in the scandal of the court and the queen since she could hardly be ignorant of the report which be circulate incur by the marked favor which she show to the countess the imputation of shut she eye to the frailty of she friend and thus show that dissoluteness be not a insuperable barrier to she partiality it be only the earnest remonstrance of mercy which prevent she from confer the place of lady of honor on the countess but she allow she to exert a pernicious influence over she in many way for the countess be unwearied in solicit appointment and pension for she relative at time make demand in such number and of so exorbitant a character that the queen herself be force to admit the impossibility of grant they all though she still seek to gratify she to far too great a extent and would not allow the proved insatiability of she and she family to open she eye to she real character it be however a far more mischievous submission to the influence of the countess and she coterie when she permit they to prejudice she against turgot whom she have more than once describe to she mother as a upright statesman and who have constantly show so far as he could make compliance consistent with he duty to the state a sincere desire to consult she wish but as the polignac party see in he prudence integrity and firmness the most formidable obstacle to they project of use the queen 's favor to enrich themselves she now yield up she judgment to they calumny forget she former praise of the minister 's integrity she begin to disparage he as one whose measure cause general dissatisfaction and at last she push she hostility to he so far that she actually try to induce loui not to be content with dismiss he from office but to send he as a prisoner to the bastille -lrb- 4 -rrb- that she could not avoid feel some shame at the part which she have act may be infer from the pain which she take to conceal it from she mother whom she assure that though she be not sorry for he dismissal she have in no degree interfere in the matter but she conduct and even she intention be well know and know to be far remove from all maneuver and intrigue -lrb- 5 -rrb- unfortunately the ambassador 's letter tell a different story as a sincere friend as well as a loyal servant of marie antoinette he express to the empress he deep feeling that as the comptroller - general enjoy a great reputation for integrity and be beloved by the people it be a melancholy thing that he dismissal should be in part the queen 's work -lrb- 6 -rrb- and he fear that she conduct in the affair may hereafter bring upon she the reproach of the king she husband and even of the entire nation the foreboding thus utter be but too sadly realize she have drive from she husband 's council the only man who combine with the penetration to perceive the absolute necessity of a large reform and the character of the change require the genius to devise they and the firmness to carry they out thirteen year later a variety of cause some of which will be unfold in the course of this narrative have contribute to irritate the impatience of the nation while the unskillfulness of the exist minister have disarm the royal authority and the very same reform which would now have be accept with general thankfulness be then only use by demagogue as a pretext for further inflame the mind of the multitude against every thing which bear the slightest appearance of authority even against the very sovereign who have grant they france and all europe to this day feel the sad effect of marie antoinette 's interference she have give fatal proof of the truth of the word wring from she by nervous excitement at the moment of the late king 's death when she declare that loui and she be too young to reign and the best excuse that can be find for she be that she be not yet one-and-twenty it be not however wholly from submission to the interested malevolence of other that she have show herself the enemy of the great financier and statesman she have a spontaneous dislike to the retrenchment which necessarily form a great portion of he economical measure not as interfere with the indulgence of any extravagant taste of she own but as restrain she power of gratify she friend for she be entirely impressed with the idea that no person or body could have any right to call in question the king 's disposal of the national revenue and that there be no prerogative of the crown of which the exercise be more become to the royal dignity than that of grant pension or create sinecure with no limitation but such as might be impose by he own will or discretion and on this point she husband fully share she feeling what say he on one occasion to turgot who be urge he to refuse a utterly unwarrantable application for a pension what be a thousand crown a year sire reply the minister they be the taxation of a village the king acquiesce for the moment but probably not without some secret wincing at the control to which he seem to be subject and we may perhaps suppose that even the queen 's disapproval of the minister would have be less effectual have it not be re-enforce by the king 's own feeling in fact that the part which she take against the great minister be the fruit of mere inconsiderateness and ignorance of the feeling and necessity of the nation and that if she have know the depth of the people 's distress and the degree in which it be cause by the viciousness of the whole exist system of government she would gladly have promote every measure which could tend to they relief we may find abundant proof in a letter which she have write to she mother a few week earlier maria teresa have speak with some harshness of the french fickleness marie antoinette reply : -lrb- 7 -rrb- you be quite right in all you say about french levity but i be truly grieve that on that account you should conceive a aversion for the nation the disposition of the people be very inconsistent but it be not bad pen and tongue utter a great many thing which be not in they heart the proof that they do not cherish hatred be that on the very slightest occasion they speak well of one and even praise one much more than one deserve i have just this moment myself have experience of this there have be a terrible fire in paris in the palace of justice and the same day i be to have go to the opera so i do not go but send two hundred loui to relieve the most pressing case of distress -lrb- 8 -rrb- and ever since the fire the very same people who have be circulate libel and song against I -lrb- 9 -rrb- have be extol I to the sky these revelation of she inmost thought to she mother show how real and warm be she affection for the french as a nation as well as how little she claim any merit for she endeavor to benefit they though a subsequent passage in the same letter also show that she have be so much annoy by some pasquinade and libel of which she have be the subject that she have become careful not to furnish fresh opportunity to she enemy : we have have here such a quantity of snow as have not be see for many year so that people be go about in sledge as they do at vienna we be out in they yesterday about this place and to-day there be to be a grand procession of they through pari i should greatly have like to be able to go but as a queen have never be see at such thing people might have make up story if i have go and i prefer give up the pleasure to be worry by fresh libel she be still as eager as ever in the pursuit of amusement and especially of novelty in that way when not restrain by consideration such as those which she here mention when at choisy she give water party on the river in boat with awning which she call gondola rowing down as far as the very entrance to the city it be not quite a prudent diversion for she for at this time she health be not very strong she easily catch cold and the report of such attack often cause great uneasiness at vienna but the waterman be highly delighted look on she act in put herself under they care as a compliment to they craft and some of they to increase she pleasure jump overboard and swim about they well-meant gallantry however be nearly have a unfavorable effect unaware that it be not a accident she think that they life be in danger and the fear for they turn she sick while madame de lamballe faint away but when she perceive the truth the qualm pass away and she reward they handsomely for they duck beg however that it might not be repeat and assure they that she need no such proof to convince she of they dutiful and faithful loyalty but the craving for excitement which be breed and nourish by the continuance of she unnatural position with respect to she husband in some part of he treatment of she be threaten to produce a very pernicious effect by lead she to become a gambler some of those lady whom she admit to she intimacy be deeply infect with this fatal passion and one of the most mischievous and intriguing of the whole company the princess de guimenée introduce a play-table at some of she ball which she induce marie antoinette to attend at first the queen take no share in the play as she have hitherto bear none or only a formal part in the gaming which as we have see have long be a recognize feature in court entertainment but gradually the hope of banish vexation if only by the substitution of a heavier care get dominion over she and in the autumn of 1776 we find mercy comment on she loss at lansquenet and faro at that time the two most fashionable round game the stake at which often rise to a very considerable amount though she continue to indulge in this unhealthy pastime for some time in mercy 's opinion she never take any real interest in it she practice it only because she wish to pass the time and to drive away think and because the one accomplishment she want be the art of refuse she even carry she complaisance so far as to allow profess gaming-table keeper to be bring from pari to manage a faro-bank in she apartment where the play be often continue long after midnight it be not the least evil of this habit that it unavoidably leave the king who never quit he own apartment in the evening to pass a great deal of time by himself but as if to make up for he coldness in one way he be most indulgent in every other and seem to have make it a rule never to discountenance any thing which could amuse she he behavior to she in mercy 's eye seem to resemble servility it be that of the most attentive courtier and be carry so far as to treat with marked distinction person whose character he be know to disapprove solely because she regard they with favor -lrb- 10 -rrb- in case such as these the defect in the king 's character contribute very injuriously to aggravate those in hers she require control and he be too young to exercise it he have too little liveliness to enter into she amusement too little penetration to see that though many of they -- it may be say all except the gaming-table -- be innocent if he partake of they indulgence in they when he do not share they could hardly fail to lead to unfriendly comment and misconstruction though even he presence could hardly have save he queen 's dignity from some humiliation when wrangle take place and accusation of cheating be make in she presence the gaming-table be a notorious leveler of distinction and the worst-behaved of the guest be too frequently the king 's own brother they be rude overbearing and ill-tempered the count de provence on one occasion so wholly forget the respect due to she that he assault a gentleman in she presence and the count d'artoi who play for very high stake invariably lose he temper when he lose he money indeed the queen seem to have feel the discredit of such scene and it be probable that it be they frequent occurrence which lead to a temporary suspension of the faro-bank as a violent quarrel on the race-course between d'artoi and he cousin the duke de chartre whom he openly accuse of cheat he for a while disgust she with horse-race and lead she to propose a substitution of some of the old exercise of chivalry such as run at the ring a proposal which have a great element of popularity in it as be calculate to lead to a renewal of the old french pastime which seem greatly preferable to the exist rage for copying and copying badly the fashion and pursuit of england chapter xii marie antoinette find herself in debt -- forgery of she name be commit -- the queen devote herself too much to madame de polignac and other -- versaille be less frequent -- remonstrance of the empress -- volatile character of the queen -- she go to the bal d'opéra at paris -- she receive the duke of dorset and other english noble with favor -- grand entertainment give she by the count de provence -- character of the emperor joseph -- he visit pari and versaille -- he feeling toward and conversation with the king and queen -- he go to the opera -- he opinion of the queen 's friend -- marie antoinette 's letter to the empress on he departure -- the emperor leave she a letter of advice but this addiction to play though it be that consequence of the influence of the society to which marie antoinette be at this time so devoted which would have seem the most objectionable in the eye of rigid moralist be not that which excite the greatest dissatisfaction in the neighborhood of the court excessive gambling have so long be a notorious vice of the french prince that she let herself down to join the gaming-table be not regard as indicate any peculiar laxity of principle while the stake which she permit herself and the loss she incur though they seem heavy to she anxious german friend be as nothing when compare with those of the king 's brother even when it become know that she be involve in debt that again be regard as a ordinary occurrence apparently even by the king himself who pay the amount -lrb- about # 20000 -rrb- without a word of remonstrance merely remark that he do not wonder at she fund be exhaust since she have such a passion for diamond for a great portion of the debt have be incur for some diamond ear-ring which the queen herself do not wish for and have only buy to gratify madame de polignac who have promise she custom to the jeweler who have they for sale marie antoinette have evidently become less careful in regulate she expense till she be awaken by the discovery of a crime which she herself imputed to she own carelessness in such matter the wife of the king 's treasurer have borrow money in she name and have forge she handwriting to letter of acknowledgment of the loan the fraud be only discover through mercy 's vigilance and the criminal be at seize and punish but it prove a wholesome lesson to the queen who never forget it though as we shall see hereafter if other remember it the recollection only serve to induce they to try and enrich themselves by similar knavery and this devotion of the queen to the society of the polignac and guimenées she society as she sometimes call it -lrb- 1 -rrb- have also a mischievous effect in diminish she popularity with the great body of the noble the custom of former sovereign have be to hold reception several evening in each week to which the man and woman of the highest rank be proud to repair to pay they court but now the royal apartment be generally empty the king be alone in he private cabinet while the queen be pass she time at some small private party of young people by she presence often seem to countenance intrigue of which she do not in she heart approve and giddy conversation which be hardly consistent with she royal position though mercy in report these habit to the empress add that the queen 's own demeanor even in the moment of apparently unrestrained familiarity be mark by such uniform self-possession and dignity that no one ever venture to take liberty with she or to approach she without the most entire respect -lrb- 2 -rrb- it be hardly strange then that those who be not member of this society should feel offended at find the court as it be close against they and should cease to frequent the palace when they have no certainty of meet any thing but empty room they even absent themselves from the queen 's ball which in consequence be so thinly attend that sometimes there be scarcely a dozen dancer of each sex so that it be universally remark that never within the memory of the oldest courtier have versaille be so desert as it be this winter the difference between the scene which the palace present now from what have be witness in previous season strike the queen herself and incline she to listen more readily to the remonstrance which at mercy 's instigation the empress address to she she mother point out to she with all the weight of she own long experience the incompatibility of a private mode of life such as be suitable for subject with the state befitting a great sovereign and urge she to recollect that all the king 's subject so long as they rank and character be such as to entitle they to admission at court have a equal right to she attention and that the system of exclusiveness which she have adopt be a dereliction of she duty not only to those who be thus deprive of the honor of the reception to which they be entitle but also to the king she husband who be injure by any line of conduct which tend to discourage the noble of the land from pay they respects to he in the midst of all she giddiness marie antoinette always listen with good humor it may even be say with docility to honest advice no one ever in she rank be so unspoiled by authority and more than one conversation which she hold with the ambassador on the subject show that these remonstrance re-enforce as they be by the undeniable fact of the thinness of the company at the palace have make a impression on she mind though such impression be as yet too apt to be fleeting and too liable to be overborne by fresh temptation for in volatile impulsiveness she resemble the french themselves and the good resolution she make one day be always liable to be forget the next nothing as yet be steady and unalterable in she character but she kindness of heart and graciousness of manner they never change and it be on she genuine goodness of disposition and righteousness of intention that she german friend rely for produce a amendment as she grow older far more than on any regret for the past or intention of improvement for the future which might be wring from she by any momentary reflection or vexation if versaille be less lively than usual pari on the other hand have never be so gay as during the carnival of 1777 the queen go to several of the mask ball at the opera with one or other of she brother-in-law and they wife the king express he perfect willingness that she should so amuse herself but never be able to overcome he own indolence and shyness so far as to accompany she it could not have be a very lively amusement she do not dance but sit in a arm-chair survey the dancer or walk down the saloon attend by a officer of the bodyguard and one lady in wait both mask like herself occasionally she would grant to some noble of high rank the honor of walk at she side but it be remark that those whom she thus distinguish be often foreigner some english nobleman such as the duke of dorset and lord strathavon be especially favor for a reason which as give by mercy show that that insular stiffness which with national self-complacency briton sometimes confess as a not unbecoming characteristic be not at that time attribute to they by other since the ambassador explain the queen 's preference by the self-evident fact that the english gentleman be the best dancer and make the best figure in the ball-room but all the other festivity of this winter be throw into the shade by a entertainment of extraordinary magnificence which be give in the queen 's honor by the count de provence at he villa at brunoy -lrb- 3 -rrb- the count be a admirer of spenser and appear to desire to embody the spirit of that poet of the ancient chivalry in the scene which he present to the view of he illustrious guest when she enter he grounds every one seem asleep group of cavalier arm _ cap-a-pie _ and surround by a splendid retinue of squire and page be see slumber on the ground they lance lie by they side they shield hang on the tree which overshadow they they very horse repose idly on the grass on which they care not to browse all seem under the influence of a spell as powerful as that under which merlin have bind the pitiless daughter of arthur but the moment that marie antoinette pass within the gate the enchantment be dissolve the page spring to they foot and bring the easily rouse steed to they awaken master twenty-five challenger with scarf of green the queen 's favorite color on snow-white charger overthrow a equal number of antagonist but no deadly wound be give the victory of she champion have be decide both party of combatant mingle as spectator at a play and afterward as dancer at a grand ball which be wind up by a display of fire-works and a superb illumination of which the principal ornament be a gorgeous bouquet of flower in many-colored fire light up the inscription vive loui vive marie antoinette at last however the carnival come to a end not too soon for the queen 's good since hunt and long ride by day and ball keep up till a late hour by night have be too much for she strength -lrb- 4 -rrb- so that even indifferent observer remark that she look ill and have grow thin but even have lend not interrupted she amusement she would have cease for a while to regard they she whole mind be now devote to prepare for the reception of she brother the emperor joseph whose visit which have be promise in the previous year be at last fix for the month of April it be anticipate with anxiety by the empress and mercy as well as by marie antoinette he be a prince of a peculiar disposition and habit before he accession to the imperial throne he have be keep apparently not greatly against he will in the background nor while he father live do he give any indication of a desire for power or of any capacity for exercise it but since he have be place on the throne he have display great activity and energy though he be still in the opinion of many more of a philosopher -- a detractor might say more of a pedant -- than of a statesman he study theory of government and be extremely fond of give advice and as both loui and marie antoinette be person who in many respects stand in need of friendly counsel mercy and marium teresa have both look forward to he visit to the french court as a event likely to be of material service to both while he sister regard it with a mixed feeling of hope and fear in which however the pleasurable emotion predominate she be not insensible to the probability that he would disapprove of some of she habit indeed we have already see that he have express he disapproval of they and of some of she friend in the preceding year and she dread he lecture but on the other hand she feel confident that a personal acquaintance with the court would prove to he that many of the tale to she prejudice which have ready he have be mischievous exaggeration and that thus he would be able to disabuse they mother and to tranquilize she mind on many point she hope too that a personal knowledge of each other by he and she own husband would tend to cement a real friendship between they and that he stronger mind would obtain a influence over loui which might induce he to rouse himself from he ordinary apathy and reserve and make he more of a man of the world and more of a companion for she lastly but probably above all she thirst with sisterly affection for the sight of she brother and anticipate with pride the opportunity of present to she new countryman a relation of whom she be proud on account of he personal endowment and character and whose imperial rank make he visit wear the appearance of a marked compliment to the whole french nation high-strung expectation often insure they own disappointment but it be not so in this instance though the August visitor 's first act display a eccentricity of disposition which must have lead more people than one to entertain secret misgiving as to the consequence which might flow from a visit which have such a commencement like he brother maximilian he too travel incognito under the title of the count falkenstein and he persist in maintain he disguise so absolutely that he refuse to occupy the apartment which the queen have prepare for he in the palace and insist on take up he quarter with mercy in pari and at a hotel for the few day which he pass at versaille however though by he conduct in this matter he to some extent disappoint the hope which he sister have conceive of a uninterrupted intercourse with he during he stay in france in every other respect the visit pass off to the satisfaction of all the party principally concerned fortunately at they first interview marie antoinette herself make a most favorable impression on he she have be but a child when he have last see she she be now a woman and he be wholly unprepared for the mature and queenly beauty at which she have arrive he be not a man to flatter any one but almost he first word to she be that have she not be he sister he could not have refrain from seek she hand that he might secure to himself so lovely a partner and each succeed meeting strengthen he admiration of she personal grace she always eager to please be gratify at the feeling she have inspire and thus a affectionate tone be from the first establish between they and all reserve be banish from they conversation it be not diminish by the admonition which as he conceive he age and greater experience entitle he to address to she though sometimes they take the form of banter and ridicule sometimes that of serious reproof -lrb- 5 -rrb- but she bear all he lecture with unvarying good humor promise he that the time should come when she would make the amendment which he desire never attempt to conceal from he and scarcely to excuse the fault of which she be not unconscious nor the vexation which in some particulars continually disquiet she it be at least equally fortunate that the king also conceive a great liking for he brother-in-law at first sight he character dispose he to receive with eagerness advice from one who have himself occupy a throne for several year and whose relationship seem a sufficient warrant that he counsel would be honest and disinterested accordingly those about he soon remark that loui treat the emperor with a cordiality that he have never show to any one else they have many long and interesting conversation sometimes with marie antoinette as a third party sometimes by themselves loui discuss with the emperor he anxiety to have a family and he hope of such a result and joseph express he opinion freely on all subject even volunteer suggestion of a change in the king 's habit as when he recommend he as a part of he kingly duty to visit the different province sea-port city and manufacture town of he kingdom so as to acquaint himself generally with the feeling and resource of the people loui listen with attention if there be any case in which the emperor 's advice be throw away it be if the queen 's suspicion be correct when he recommend to the king a line of conduct adverse to she influence mercy have tell the emperor that loui be devotedly attach to the queen but that he fear she at least as much as he love she and joseph would have desire to see some of this fear transfer to and feel by she and show he wish that the king should exert he legitimate authority as a husband to check those habit of he wife of which they both disapprove and which she herself do not defend but even if loui do for a moment make up he mind to adopt a tone of authority he resolution fade away in he wife 's presence before she superior resolution and to the end of they day she continue to be the leader and he to follow she guidance it need hardly be tell that so August a visitor have entertainment give in he honor the king give banquet at versaille the queen less formal party at she little trianon though gayety be not much to joseph 's taste and at a visit which he sister compel he to pay to the opera he remain ensconce at the back of she box till she drag he forward and as if by main force present he to the audience the whole theater resound with applause express in such a way as to mark that it be to the queen 's brother fully as much as to the emperor that the homage be pay the opera be iphigénie the chorus in which _ chanton célébrons notre reine _ have by this time be almost as fully adopt as the expression of the national loyalty as god save the queen be in england but even on its first performance it have not be hail with more rapturous cheer than shake the whole house on this occasion and joseph have the satisfaction of believe that he sister 's hold on the affection and on the respect of the parisian be securely establish he be less pleased at the race in the bois de boulogne which he visit the next day no inconsiderable part of mercy 's disapproval of such gathering have be found on the impropriety of gentleman appear in the queen 's presence in top-boot and leather breeches instead of in court dress and the emperor 's displeasure appear to have be chiefly excite by the hurry and want of stately order which be inseparable from the excitement of a race-course and which indifferent as he be to many point of etiquette seem even to he derogatory to the majesty of a queen to witness so closely but he be far more dissatisfied with the company at the princess de guimenée 's to which the queen with not quite she usual judgment persuade he one evening to accompany she he see not only gamble for much higher stake than could be right for any lady to venture -lrb- the queen do not play herself -rrb- but he see those who take part in the play lose they temper over they card and quarrel with one another while he hear the hostess herself accuse of cheat the gamester forget the respect due to they queen in they excitement and intemperance he speak strongly on the subject to marie antoinette declare that the apartment be no better than a common gaming-house but be greatly mortify to see that he reproof on this subject be receive with less than the usual attention and that she allow she partiality for those whom she call she friend to outweigh she feeling of the impropriety of disorder of which she could not deny the existence but entertainment and amusement be not permit to engross much of he time if he visit the king and queen as a brother he be visit france and pari as a sovereign and a statesman and as such he make a careful inspection of all that pari have most worthy of he attention -- of the barracks the arsenal the hospital the manufactory and he acquire a very high idea of the capability and resource of the country though at the same time a very low opinion of the talent and integrity of the exist minister of the king himself he conceive a favorable estimate of he desire to do he duty to he people he have always be convince but in a long conversation which he have hold with he on the character of the french people -lrb- 6 -rrb- and of the best mode of govern they in which loui enter into many detail he find he correctness of judgment and general knowledge of sound principle of policy far superior to he anticipation though at the same time he feel convinced that he want of readiness and decision and he timidity in action would always render and keep he very inferior to the queen especially whenever it should be necessary to come to a prompt decision on matter of moment after a visit of six week he quit paris for he dominion in the netherland at the end of may and a letter of the queen to she mother be very expressive of the pleasure which she have receive from he visit and of the lasting benefit which she hope to derive from it versaille June 14th my dearest mother -- it be plain truth that the departure of the emperor have leave a void in my heart from which i can not recover i be so happy during the short time of he visit that at this moment it all seem like a dream but one thing will never be a dream to I and that be the good advice and counsel which he give I and which be forever engraven in my heart i must tell my dear mamma that he give I one thing which i earnestly beg of he and which cause I the greatest pleasure : it be a packet of advice which he have leave I in write at this moment it constitute my chief reading and if ever i could forget what he say to I which i do not believe i ever could i should still have this paper always before I which would soon recall I to my duty my dear mamma will have learn by the courier who start yesterday how well the king behave during the last moment of my brother 's visit i can assure you that i thoroughly understand he and that he be really affect at the emperor 's departure as he do not always recollect to pay attention to form he do not at all time show he feeling to the outer world but all that i see prove to I that he be truly attach to my brother and that he have the greatest regard for he and at the moment of my brother 's departure when i be in the deepest distress he show a attention to and a tenderness for I which all my life i shall never forget and which would attach I to he if i have not be attach to he already it be impossible that my brother should not have be please with this nation for one who like he know how to estimate man must have see that in spite of the exceed levity which be inveterate in the people there be a manliness and cleverness in they and speak generally a excellent heart and a desire to do right the only thing be to manage they properly i have this moment receive you dear letter by the post what goodness yours be at a moment when you have so much business to think of to recollect my name day it overwhelm I you offer up prayer for my happiness the greatest happiness that i can have be to know that you be pleased with I to deserve you kindness and to convince you that no one in the world feel greater affection or greater respect for you than i it be a letter very characteristic of the writer as show that neither time nor distance could chill she affection for she family and that the attainment of royal authority have in no degree extinguish she habitual feeling of duty : that it have even strengthen it by make its performance of importance not only to herself but to other nor be the jealousy for the reputation of the french people and the desire so warmly profess that they should have win she brother 's favorable opinion less become in a queen of france while to descend to minor point the neatness and felicity of the language may be admit to prove if she education have be incomplete when she leave austrium with how much pain since she progress have depend on herself she have labor to make up for its deficiency that she should have ask she brother as she here mention to leave she he advice in write be a practical proof that she expression of a earnest desire to do she duty be not a mere form of word while the resolution which she avow never to forget he admonition show a genuine humility and candor a sincere desire to be tell of and to amend she fault which one be hardly prepare to meet with in a queen of one-and-twenty for joseph do not spare she nor forbear to set before she in the plainest light those part of she conduct which he disapprove he tell she plainly that if in france people pay she respect and observance it be only as the wife of they king that they honor she and that the tone of superiority in which she sometimes allow herself to speak of he be as ill-judged as it be unbecome he hint he dissatisfaction at she conduct toward he as she husband in a series of question which unless she could answer as he wish must even in she own judgment convict she of some failure in she duty to he do she show he that she be wholly occupy with he that she study be to make he shine in the opinion of he subject without any thought of herself do she stifle every wish to shine at he expense to be affable when he be not so to seem to attend to matter which he neglect do she preserve a discreet silence as to he fault and weakness and make other keep silence about they also do she make excuse for he and keep secret the fact of she acting as he adviser do she study he character he wish do she take care never to seem cold or weary when with he never indifferent to he conversation or he caress the other matter on which the emperor chiefly dwell be those on which mercy and by mercy 's advice marium teresa also have repeatedly press she but those question of joseph 's set plainly before we some of he young sister 's difficulty and temptation and it must be confess some point in which she conduct be not wholly unimpeachable in discretion even though she solid affection for she husband never waver for a moment in some respects they be a ill-assorted couple he be slow reserve and awkward she be clever graceful lively and look for liveliness both be thoroughly upright and conscientious but he be indifferent to the opinion form of he while she be eager to please to be applaud to be love the temptation be great to one so young at time to put she grace in contrast to he uncouthness to be see to lead he who have a right to lead she and though we may regret we can not greatly wonder that she have not always steadiness to resist it one tie be still want to bind she to he more closely and happily the day be not far distant when that be add to complete and rivet they union chapter xiii impression make on the queen by the emperor 's visit -- mutual jealousy of she favorite -- the story of the chevalier d'assa -- the terrace concert at versaille -- more inroad on etiquette -- insolence and unpopularity of the count d'artoi -- marie antoinette take interest in politics -- france conclude a alliance with the united state -- affair of bavarium -- character of the queen 's letter on politics -- the queen expect to become a mother -- voltaire return to pari -- the queen decline to receive he -- misconduct of the duke of orléans in the action off ushant -- the queen use she influence in he favor the emperor 's admonition and counsel have not be altogether unfruitful if they have not at once entirely extinguish he sister 's taste for the practice which he condemn they have evidently weaken it even though as the first impression wear off and she fear of be overwhelm with _ ennui _ -lrb- 1 -rrb- resume its empire she relapse for a while into she old habit it be no longer with the same eagerness as before and not without frequent avowal that they have lose they attraction she visibly draw off from the entanglement of the coterie with which she have surround herself the member have grow jealous of one another madame de polignac fear the influence of the superior disinterestedness of the princess de lamballe madame de guimenée who be suspect of a want of even common honesty grudge every favor that be bestow on madame de polignac and they rivalry which be not always suppress even in the queen 's presence be not only feel by she to be degrade to herself but be also wearisome throughout the autumn she occupation and amusement be of a simpler kind she read more and agreeably surprised de vermond by the soundness of she reflection on many incident and character in history account of chivalrous deed have a especial charm for she hume be still she favorite author and it happen that while the gallantry of the loyal champion of charle i be fresh in she memory a casual conversation throw in she way a opportunity of do honor to the self-devoted heroism of a french soldier whom the proudest of the british cavalier might have welcome as a brother but whose valiant and self-sacrificing fidelity have be leave unnoticed by the worthless sovereign in whose service he have perish and by he minister who think only of secure the favor of the reign mistress -- favor to be win by action of a very different complexion in the seven year ' war when the french army under the marshal de broglie and the prussian under prince ferdinand of brunswick be watch one another in the neighborhood of wesel the chevalier d'assa a captain in the regiment of auvergne be in command of a outpost on a dark night of October he have stroll a little in advance of he sentry into the wood which front he position when suddenly he find himself surround and seize by a body of armed enemy they be the advanced guard of the prince 's army who be march to surprise de broglie by a night attack and they threaten he with instant death if he make the slightest noise if he be but silent he be safe as a prisoner of war but he safety would have be the ruin of the whole french army which have no suspicion of its danger he do not for even a moment hesitate with all the strength of he voice he shout to he man who be within hearing that the enemy be upon they and fall bayonet to death almost before the word have pass he lip he have save he comrade and he commander and have influence the issue of the whole campaign the enemy whose well-planned enterprise he self-devotion have baffle pay a cordial tribute of praise to he heroism ferdinand himself publicly express he regret at the fate of one whose valor have shed honor on every brother-soldier but not the slightest notice have be take of he by those in authority in france till he exploit be accidentally mention in the queen 's apartment it fill she with admiration she ask what have be do to commemorate so noble a deed she be tell nothing the man and he gallantry have be alike forget have he leave descendant or kinsman he have a brother and two nephew the brother a retired veteran of the same regiment the nephew officer in different corps of the army the dead hero be forget no longer marie antoinette never rest till she have procure a adequate pension for the brother which be settle in perpetuity on the family and promotion for both the nephew and as a further compliment clostercamp the name of the village which be the scene of the brave deed be add forever to they family name the pension be pay to this day for a time indeed it be suspend while france be under the sway of the rapacious and insensible murderer of the king who have grant it but napoleon restore it and amidst all the change that have since take place in the government of the country every succeed ruler have feel it equally honorable and politic to recognize the eternal claim which patriotic virtue have on the gratitude of the country marie antoinette have thus the honor of set a example to the government and the nation she heart be get lighter as the vexation under which she have so long fret begin to disappear the late card-party be often supersede throughout the autumn by concert on the terrace at versaille where the regimental band be the performer and to which all the well-dressed towns-people be admit while the queen attend by the princess and she lady and occasionally escort by loui himself stroll up and down and among the crowd diffuse even greater pleasure than they themselves enjoy marie antoinette as usual be the central object of attraction and greet all with a team brightness of expression and a affability as cordial as it be dignified which deserve to win all heart one of the entertainment which she give to the king at the little trianon may he record not for any unusual sumptuousness of the spectacle but as have be the occasion on which she make one more inroad on the established etiquette of the court in one of its most unaccountable restriction : to such royal party the king 's minister have never be regard as admissible but on this night marie antoinette command the company of the count and countess de maurepa and the innovation be regard not only by they as a singular favor but by all they colleague as a marked compliment to the whole body of minister and serve to increase they desire to consult she inclination in every matter in which she take a interest and the esteem which she thus conciliate be at this time not destitute of real importance since the conduct of the other member of the royal family excited very different feeling the count de provence be generally distrust as intriguing and insincere and the count d'artoi whose bad quality be of a more conspicuous character be become a object of general dislike not so much from he dissipate mode of life as from the overbearing arrogance which he impart into he pleasure no rank be high enough to protect the object of he displeasure from he insolence even lady be not safe from it -lrb- 2 -rrb- while he extravagance be beyond all bound since he consider himself entitle to claim from the national treasury whatever he might require in addition to he stated income he be at the same time repair one castle that of st germain which the king have give he rebuild another large house which he have purchase in the same neighborhood and pull down and rebuild a third name bagatelle in the bois de boulogne which he have just buy and as to which he have lay a enormous wager that it should be complete and furnish in sixty day to win he bet nearly a thousand workman be employ day and night and as the requisite material could not be provide at so short a notice he send patrol of he regiment to scour the road and seize every cart load with stone or timber for other employer which he thus appropriate to he own use he do indeed pay for the goods thus seize and he win he bet but when the prince of the land make so open a parade of they disregard of all law and all decency one can hardly wonder that man in secret begin to talk of a revolution or that all the grace and gentleness of the queen should be need to outweigh such grave cause of discontent and indignation as the new year open affair of a very different kind begin to occupy the queen 's attention on political question the advice which the empress give she differ in some degree from that of she embassador marium teresa be a earnest politician but she be also a mother and as be eager above all thing for she daughter 's happiness while she entreat marie antoinette to study politics history and such other subject as might qualify she to be a intelligent companion of the king and so far as or whenever he might require it he chief confidante she warn she also against ever wish to rule he but mercy be a statesman above every thing and feeling secure of be able to guide the queen he desire to instill into she mind a ambition to govern the king on one most important question she prove wholly unable to do so since the decision take be not even in accordance with the judgment or inclination of loui himself but he allow himself to be persuade by two of he minister to adopt a course against which joseph have earnestly warn he in the preceding year and which as he have be then convince be inconsistent alike with he position as a king and with he interest as king of france england have be for some year engage in a civil war with she colony in north america and from the commencement of the contest a strong sympathy for the colonist have be evince by a considerable party in france loui who for several reason dislike england and english idea be at first inclined to coincide in this feeling as a development of anti-english principle : he be far from suspect that its source be rather a revolutionary and republican sentiment but he have converse with he brother-in-law on the possibility of advantage which might accrue to france from the weakening of she old foe if french aid should enable the american to establish they independence joseph 's opinion be clear and unhesitating : i be a king it be my business to be royalist and he easily convinced loui that for one sovereign to assist the subject of another monarch who be in open revolt be to set a mischievous example which might in time be turn against himself but since he return to vienna unprecedented disaster have befall england a whole army have lay down its arm the ultimate success of the american seem to every statesman in europe to be assure and the prospect give such encouragement to the war party in the french cabinet that loui could resist it no longer in February 1778 a treaty be conclude with the united state as the insurgent call themselves and france plunge into a war from which she have nothing to gain which involve she in enormous expense which bring on she overwhelming defeat and which from its effect upon the troops send to serve with the american army who thus become infected with republican principle have no slight influence in bring about the calamity which a few year later overwhelm both king and people all marie antoinette 's language on the subject show that she view the quarrel with england with even greater repugnance than she husband but it be curious to see that she chief fear be lest the war should be wage by land and that she feel much greater confidence in the french navy than in the army -lrb- 3 -rrb- though it be just at this time that voltaire be point out to he countryman that england have always enjoy and always would possess a maritime superiority which different inquirer might attribute to various cause but which none could deny -lrb- 4 -rrb- even before the conclusion of this treaty however the american have find sympathizer in france to one of whom some of the circumstance of the war which they be now wage give a subsequent importance to which no talent or virtue of he own entitle he the marquis de la fayette be a young man of ancient family and of fair but not excessive fortune he be awkward in appearance and manner gawky red-haired and singularly deficient in the accomplishment which be cultivate by other youth of he age and rank -lrb- 5 -rrb- but he be deeply imbue with the doctrine of the new philosophy which see virtue in the mere fact of resistance to authority and when the colonist take up arm he become eager to afford they such aid as he could give he make the acquaintance of sila deane one of the most unscrupulous of the american agent who promise he though he be only twenty year of age the rank of major-general as he be at all time the slave of a most overweening conceit he be tempt by that bait and though he could not leave france without incur the forfeiture of he military rank in the army of he own country in April 1777 he cross over to america to serve as a volunteer under washington who naturally receive with special distinction a recruit of such political importance he be present at more than one battle and be wound at brandywine but the exploit which make he most conspicuous be a ridiculous act of bravado in send a challenge to lord carlisle the chief of the english commissioner who in 1778 be dispatch to america to endeavor to re-establish peace however the close of the war which end as be well know in the humiliation of great britain and the establishment of the independence of the colony make he seem a hero to he countryman on he return the queen always eager to encourage and reward feat of warlike enterprise treat he with marked distinction and procure he from she husband not only the restoration of he commission but promotion to the command of a regiment -lrb- 6 -rrb- kindness which as will be see he afterward requite with the foulest ingratitude nor be this most imprudent war with england the only question of foreign politics which at this time interested marie antoinette she native land she mother 's hereditary dominion be also threaten with war on the death of the elector of bavarium at the end of 1777 joseph who have be marry to he sister claim a portion of he territory and frederick of prussium that bad neighbor as marie antoinette be wont to call he announce he resolution to resist that claim by force of arm if necessary if he should carry out the resolution which he have announce and if war should in consequence break out much would depend on the attitude which france would assume on she fidelity to or disregard of the alliance which have now subsist more than twenty year so all-important to austrium be she decision that marium teresa forget the line which as a general rule of conduct she have recommend to she daughter and write to she with the most extreme earnestness to entreat she to lose no opportunity of influence the king 's council if it depend upon marium teresa the claim would probably not have be advance but joseph have make it on the part of the empire and when it be once make the empress could not withhold she support from she son she therefore throw herself into the quarrel with as much earnestness as if it have be she own indeed since joseph have as yet no authority over she hereditary possession it be only by she army that it could be maintain and in she letter to she daughter she declare that marie antoinette have she happiness the welfare of she house and of the whole austrian nation in she hand that all depend on she activity and affection she know that the french minister be incline to favor the view of frederick but if the alliance should be dissolve it would kill she -lrb- 7 -rrb- marie antoinette grow pale at read so ominous a denunciation it require no art to inflame she against frederick the seven year ' war have begin when she be but a year old and all she life she have hear of nothing more frequently than of the rapacity and dishonesty of that unprincipled aggressor she now enter with eagerness into she mother 's view and press they on loui with unremitting diligence and considerable fertility of argument though she be greatly dismay at find that not only he minister but he himself regard austrium as actuate by a aggressive ambition and compare she claim to a portion of bavarium to the partition of poland which six year before have draw forth unwonted expression of honorable indignation from even he unworthy grandfather the idea that the alliance between france and the empire be itself at stake on the question make she so anxious that she send for the minister themselves press she view on both maurepa and vergenne with great earnestness but they though still faithful to the maintenance of the alliance sympathize with the king rather than with she in he view of the character of the claim which the emperor have put forward and they also urge another argument for abstain from any active intervention that the finances of the country be in so deplorable a state that france could not afford to go to war it be plain as she tell they that this consideration should at least equally have prevent they quarrel with england but in spite of all she persistence they be not to be move from this view of the true interest of france in the conjuncture that have arise and accordingly in the brief war which ensue between the empire and prussium france take no part though it be more than probable that she mediation between the belligerent which have no little share in bring about the peace of teschen -lrb- 8 -rrb- be in a great degree owe to the queen 's influence for she be not discourage by she first failure but renew she importunity from time to time and at last do succeed in wring a promise from she husband that if prussium should invade the flemish province of austrium france would arm on the empress 's side so fully do the affair absorb she attention that it make she indifferent to the gayety which the carnival always bring round she do indeed as a matter of duty give one or two grand state ball one of which in which the dancer of the quadrille be mask and in which they dress represent the male and female costume of indium be long talk of for both the magnificence and the novelty of the spectacle and she attend one or two of the opera-ball under the escort of she brother-in-law and they countess but they have begin to pall upon she and she make repeat offer to the king to give they up and to spend she evening in quiet with he but he be more inclined to prompt she to seek amusement than to allow she to sacrifice any -lrb- 9 -rrb- even such as he do not care to partake of nevertheless he be please with the offer and it be observe by the courtier that the mutual confidence of the husband and wife in each other be more marked and more firmly establish than ever he show she all the dispatch consult she on all point and explain he reason when he could not adopt all she view as marie antoinette write to she brother if it be possible to reckon wholly on any man the king be the one on whom she could thoroughly rely -lrb- 10 -rrb- so greatly indeed do the quarrel between austrium and prussium engross she that it even occupy the greater part of letter whose ostensible object be to announce prospects of personal happiness which might have be expect to extinguish every other consideration in one after touch briefly on she health and hope she proceed : how kind my dear mamma be to express she approval of the way in which i have conduct myself in these affair up to the present time alas there be no need for you to feel oblige to I it be my heart that act in the whole matter i be only vex at not be able to enter myself into the feeling of all these minister so as to be able to make they comprehend how every thing which have be do and demand by the authority at vienna be just and reasonable but unluckily none be more deaf than those who will not hear and besides they have such a number of term and phrase which mean nothing that they bewilder themselves before they come to say a single reasonable thing i will try one plan and that be to speak to they both in the king 's presence to induce they at least to hold language suitable to the occasion to the king of prussium and in good truth it be for the interest and glory of the king -lrb- 11 -rrb- himself that i be anxious to see this do for he can not but gain by support ally who on every account ought to be so dear to he in other respects and especially in my present condition he behave most admirably and be most attentive to I i protest to you my dear mamma that my heart would be tear by the idea that you could for a moment suspect he good-will in what have be do no it be the terrible weakness of he minister and ti own great want of self-reliance which do all the mischief and i be sure that if he would never act but on he own judgment every one would see he honesty he correctness of feeling and he tact which at present they be far from appreciate -lrb- 12 -rrb- and at the end of the month she write again : i see mercy a day or two ago : he show I the article which the king of prussium send to my brother i think it be impossible to see any thing more absurd than he proposal in fact they be so ridiculous that they must strike every one here i can answer for they appear so to the king i have not be able to see the minister m de vergenne have not be here -lrb- she be write from marly -rrb- he be not well so that i must wait till we return to versaille i have see before the correspondence of the king of prussium with my brother it be most abominable of the former to have send it here and the more so since in truth he have not much to boast of he imprudence he bad faith and he malignant temper be visible in every line i have be enchant with my brother 's answer it be impossible to put into letter more grace more moderation and at the same time more force i be go to say something which be very vain but i do believe that there be not in the whole world any one but the emperor the son of my dearest mother who have the happiness of see she every day who could write in such a manner there be no trace in these letter of the levity and giddiness of which mercy so often complain and which she at time do not deny on the contrary they display a earnestness as well as a good sense and a energy which be gracefully set off by the affection for she mother and the pride in she brother 's firmness and address which they also express with respect to the conduct of loui at this crisis we may perhaps differ from she and may think that he rarely show so much self-reliance the general want of which be in truth he greatest defect as when he prefer the argument of vergenne to she entreaty but if she praise of the emperor be as she herself term they vanity it be the vanity of sisterly and patriotic affection which can not but be regard with approval and we may see in it a additional proof of the correctness of a assertion repeat over and over again in mercy 's correspondence that whenever marie antoinette give the rein to she own natural impulse she invariably both thought and act rightly in one of the extract which have just be quote the queen allude to she own condition and that in any one less unselfish might well have drive all other thought from she head for the event to which she have so long look forward as that which be want to crown she happiness and which have be so long defer that at time she have cease to hope for it at all be at last about to take place -- she be about to become a mother she own joy at the prospect be share to its full extent by both the king and the empress loui rouse out of he usual reserve write with he own hand to both the empress and the emperor to give the intelligence and marium teresa declare that she have nothing leave to wish for and that she could now close she eye in peace and the news be receive with almost equal pleasure by the citizen of pari who have long desire to see a heir bear to the crown and by those of vienna who have not yet forget the fair young princess the flower of she mother 's flock as they have fondly call she whom they have send to fill a foreign throne she own happiness exhibit itself as usual in act of benevolence in the distribution of liberal gift to the poor of pari and versaille and a foundation of a hospital for those in a similar condition with herself -lrb- 13 -rrb- in the course of the spring pari be for a moment excite even more than by the declaration of war against england or than by the expectation of the queen 's confinement by the return of voltaire who have long be in disgrace with the court and have be for many year live in a sort of tacit exile on the border of the lake of geneva he be now in extreme old age and believe himself to have but a short time to live he wish to see pari once more put forward as he principal motive he desire to superintend the performance of he tragedy of irene he admirer could easily secure he a brilliant reception at the theater but they be anxious above all thing to obtain for he admission to the court or at least a private interview with the queen she feel in a dilemma joseph a year before have warn she against give encouragement to a man whose principle deserve the reprobation of all sovereign he himself though on he return to vienna he have pass through geneva have avoid a interview with he while the empress have be far more explicit in she condemnation of he character on the other hand marie antoinette have not yet learn the art of refuse when those who solicit a favor have personal access to she and she have also some curiosity to see a man whose literary fame be account one of the chief glory of the nation and the age she consult the king but find loui on this subject in entire agreement with she mother and she brother he have no literary curiosity and he disapprove equally the lesson which voltaire have throughout he life seek to inculcate upon other and the licentious habit with which he have exemplify he own principle in action she yield to he objection and voltaire deeply mortified at the refusal -lrb- 14 -rrb- be leave to console himself as best he could with the enthusiastic acclamation of the play-goer of the capital who crown he bust on the stage while he sit exultingly in he box and escort he back in triumph to he house those who could approach near enough even kiss he garment as he pass till he ask they whether they design to kill he with delight as indeed in some sense they may be say to have do for the excitement of the homage thus pay to he day after day whenever he be see in public prove too much for he feeble frame he be seize with illness which however be but a natural decay and in a few week after he arrival in paris he die as the year wear on marie antoinette be fully occupy in make arrangement for the child whose come be expect with such impatience she mother be of course she chief confidante she be to be the child 's godmother she name shall be the first its tongue be to learn to pronounce while for its early management the advice of so experienced a parent be naturally seek with unhesitate deference still marie antoinette be far from be always joyful russium have make a alliance with prussium frederick have invade bohemia and she be so overwhelmed with anxiety that she cancel invitation for party which she be about to give at the trianon and would absent herself from the theater and from all public place do not mercy persuade she that such a withdrawal would seem to be the effect not of a natural anxiety but of a despondency which would be both unroyal and unworthy of the reliance which she ought to feel on the proved valor of the austrian army the war with england also be a additional cause of solicitude and vexation the sailor in whom she have express such confidence be not better able than before to contend with british antagonist in a undecisive skirmish which take place in July between two fleet of the first magnitude the french admiral d'orvillier have make a practical acknowledgment of he inferiority by retreat in the night and elude all the exertion of the english admiral keppel to renew the action the discontent in pari be great the populace be severe on one or two of the captain who be think to have take undue care of they ship and of themselves and especially bitter against the duke de chartre who have have a rear-admiral 's command in the fleet and who after have make himself conspicuous before d'orvillier sail by he boast of the prowess which he intend to exhibit have make himself equally notorious in the action itself by the pain he take to keep himself out of danger on he return to pari shameless as he be he scarcely dare show he face till the comte d'artoi persuade the queen to throw she shield over he it be impossible for he to remain in the navy but to soften he fall the count propose that the king should create a new appointment for he as colonel-general of the light cavalry loui see the impropriety of such a step : truly it be but a questionable compliment to pay to he hussar to place in authority over they a man under whom no sailor would willingly serve marie antoinette in she heart be as indignant as any one constitutionally a admirer of bravery she have take especial interest in the affair of the fleet and in the detail of this action she have honor with the most marked eulogy the gallantry of admiral du chaffault who have be severely wound but now she allow herself to be persuade that the duke 's public disgrace would reflect on the whole royal family and press the request so earnestly on the king that at last he yield in outward appearance the duke 's honor be save but the public whose judgment on such matter be generally sound and who have revive against he some of the jest with which the comrade of luxemburg have show they scorn of the duke de maine blame she interference and the duke himself by the vile ingratitude with which he subsequently repay she protection give but too sad proof that of all offender against honor the most unworthy of royal indulgence be a coward chapter xiv birth of madame royale -- festivity of thanksgiving -- the dames de la halle at the theater -- thanksgive at notre dame -- the king go to a bal d'opéra -- the queen 's carriage break down -- marie antoinette have the measles -- she anxiety about the war -- retrenchment of expense mercy while deplore the occasional levity of the queen 's conduct and she immoderate thirst for amusement have constantly look forward to the birth of a child as the event which by the fresh and engrossing occupation it would afford to she mind would be the surest remedy for she juvenile heedlessness and as we have see the absence of any prospect of become a mother have till recently be a constant source of anxiety and vexation to the queen herself -- the one drop of bitterness in she cup which but for that would have be fill with delight but this disappointment be now to pass away from the moment that it be publicly announce that the queen be in the way to become a mother one general desire seem to prevail to show how deep a interest the whole nation feel in the event in cathedral monastery abbey university and parish church mass be celebrate and prayer offer for she safe delivery in many instance private individual even give extraordinary alms to bring down the blessing of heaven on the nation so interested in the expect event and on the 19th of December 1778 the prayer be answer and the hope of the country in great measure realize by the birth of a princess who be instantly christen marium thérèse charlotte in compliment to the empress she godmother the labor be long and have nearly prove fatal to the mother from the strange and senseless custom which make the queen 's bed-chamber on such a occasion a reception-room for every one of whatever rank or station who could force he way in -lrb- 1 -rrb- in most country perhaps in all the genuineness of a royal infant be assure by the presence of a few great officer of state but on this occasion not only all the minister with all the member of the king 's or of the queen 's household be present in the chamber but a promiscuous rabble fill the adjacent saloon and gallery and the moment that it be announce that the birth be about to take place rush in disorderly tumult into the apartment some climb on the chair and sofa and even on the table and wardrobe to obtain a better sight of the patient the uproar be great the heat become intense the queen faint the king himself dash at the window which be firmly close and by a unusual effort of strength tear down the fastening and admit air into the room the crowd be drive out but marie antoinette continue insensible and the moment be so critical that the physician have recourse to he lancet and open a vein in she foot as the blood come she revive the king himself come to she side and announce to she that she be the mother of a daughter it can hardly be say that the hope of the nation or of the king himself have be fully realize since a heir to the throne a dauphin that have be universally hope for but in the general joy that be feel at the queen 's safety the disappointment of this hope be disregard and the little princess madame royale as she be call from she birth be receive by the still loyal people in the same spirit as that in which anne boleyn 's lady in wait have announce to henry viii the birth of she fair young maid : _ king henry _ now by thy look i guess thy message be the queen deliver say ay and of a boy _ lady _ ay ay my liege and of a lovely boy the god of heaven both now and ever bless she ` tis a girl promise boy hereafter and a month before the empress have express a similar sentiment : i trust she write to she daughter in November that god will grant I the comfort of know that you be safely deliver every thing else be a matter of indifference boy will come after girl -lrb- 2 -rrb- and the same feeling be share by the parisian in general and embody by m imbert a courtly poet whose ode be greatly in vogue in the fashionable circle in a epigram which be set to music and sing in the theater pour toi france un dauphin doit naître une princesse vient pour en être témoin sitôt qu'on voit une grâce paraître croyez que l'amour n'est pas loin -lrb- 3 -rrb- marie antoinette herself be scarcely disappoint at all when the attendant bring she she babe she press it to she bosom poor little thing say she you be not what be desire but you shall not be the less dear to I a son would have belong to the state you will be my own : you shall have all my care you shall share my happiness and sweeten my vexation -lrb- 4 -rrb- the count de provence make no secret of he joy he be still heir presumptive to the throne and though no one share he feeling on the subject for the next few week the whole kingdom and especially the capital be absorb in public rejoicing she own thankfullness be display by marie antoinette in she usual way by act of benevolence she send large sum of money to the prison to release poor debtor she give dowry to a hundred poor maiden she apply to the chief officer of both army and navy to recommend she veteran worthy of especial reward and to the curate of the metropolitan parish to point out to she any deserving object of charity and she also settle pension on a number of poor child who be bear on the same day as the princess one of whom who owe she education to this grateful and royal liberality become afterward know to every visitor of pari as madame mars the most accomplished of comic actress -lrb- 5 -rrb- one portion of the rejoicing be mark by a curious incident in which the same body whose right to a special place of honor at ceremony connect with the personal happiness of the royal family we have already see admit -- the lady of the fish-market -- again assert they pretension with triumphant success on christmas-eve the theater be open gratuitously but these lady who with they friend the coal-heaver select the most aristocratic theater la comédie française for the honor of they visit arrive with aristocratic unpunctuality so late that the guard stop they at the door declare that the house be full and that there be not a seat vacant they declare that in any event room must be make for they who be in the box of the king and queen for on such occasion those place be theirs of right even they however be full and the guard demur to the lady ' claim to be consider though for this night only as the representative of royalty and to have the exist occupant of the seat demand turn out to make room for they the box-keeper and the manager be send for the register of the house confirm the validity of the claim by former precedent and a compromise be at last effect row of bench be place on each side of the stage itself those on the right be allot to the coal-heaver as representative of loui the lady of the fish-market sit on the leave as the deputy of marie antoinette before the play be allow to begin he majesty the king of the coal-heaver read the bulletin of the day announce the rapid progress of the queen toward recovery and then give he hand to the queen of the fish-wife the August pair follow by they respective suite execute a dance expressive of they delight at the good news and then resume they seat and listen to voltaire 's zaire with the most edifying gravity -lrb- 6 -rrb- it be evident that in some thing there be already enough and rather more than enough of that equality the unreasonable and unpractical passion for which prove a few year later the most pregnant cause of immeasurable misery to the whole nation but the demonstration most in accordance with the queen 's own taste be that which take place a few week later when she go in a state procession to the great national cathedral of notre dame to return thanks one most interesting part of the ceremony be the wedding of the hundred young couple to whom she have give dowry who also receive a silver medal to commemorate the day the gayety of the spectacle since they with the formal witness of they marriage fill a great part of the antechapel and the blessing invoke on the queen 's head as she leave the cathedral by the prisoner whom she have release and by the poor whose destitution she have relieve make so great a impression on the spectator that even the highest dignitary of the court add they cheer and applause to those of the populace who escort she coach to the gate on its return to versaille she be now for the first time since she arrival in france really and entirely happy without one vexation or one foreboding of evil the king 's attachment to she be render if not deeper than before at least far more lively and demonstrative by the birth of he daughter he delight carry he at time to most unaccustomed ebullition of gayety on the last Sunday of the carnival he even go alone with the queen to the mask opera ball and be highly amuse at find that not one of the company recognize either he or she he even propose to repeat he visit on shrove-tuesday but when the evening come he change he mind and insist on the queen 's go by herself with one of she lady and the change of plan lead to a incident which at the time afford great amusement to marie antoinette though it afterward prove a great annoyance as furnish a pretext for malicious story and scandal to preserve she _ incognito _ a private carriage be hire for she which break down in the street close by a silk-mercer 's shop as the queen be already mask the shop-man do not know she and at the request of the lady who attend she stop for she the first hackney-coach which pass and in that unroyal vehicle such as certainly no sovereign of france have ever set foot in before she at last reach the theater as before no one recognize she and she might have enjoy the scene and return to versaille in the most absolute secrecy have not she sense of the fun of a queen use such a conveyance overpower she wish for concealment so that when in the course of the evening she meet one or two person of distinction whom she know she could not forbear tell they who she be and that she have come in a hackney-coach she health seem less delicate than it have be before she confinement but in the spring she be attack by the measles and she illness slight as it be give occasion to a curious passage in court history the fear of infection be always great at versaille and as the king himself and some of the lady have never have the complaint they be exclude from she room but that she might not be leave without attendant four noble of the court the duke de coigny the duke de guine the count esterhazy and the baron de besenval in something of the old spirit of chivalry devoted themselves to she service and solicit permission to watch by she bedside till she recover as have be already see the bed-chamber and dressing-room of a queen of france have never be guard from intrusion with the jealousy which protect the apartment of lady in other country so that the proposal be less startling than it would have be consider elsewhere while the number of nurse remove all pretext for scandal loui willingly give the require permission be apparently flatter by the solicitude exhibit for he queen 's health and each morning at seven the sick-watcher -lrb- 7 -rrb- take they seat in the queen 's chamber sharing with the countess of provence the princesse de lamballe and the count d'artoi the task of keep order and quiet in the sick-room till eleven at night though there be no scandal there be plenty of jest at so novel a arrangement wag propose that in the case of the king be take ill a list should be prepare of the lady who should tend he sick-bed however the champion be not long on duty : at the end of little more than a week they patient be convalescent she herself take off the sentence of banishment which she have pronounce against the king in a brief and affectionate note which say that she have suffer a great deal but what she have feel most be to be for so many day deprive of the pleasure of embrace he and the temporary separation seem to have but increase they mutual affection for each other the trianon be now more than ever delightful to she the new plantation which contain no fewer than eight hundred different kind of tree rich with every variety of foliage be begin by they effectiveness to give evidence of the taste with which they have be lay out while with a charity which could not bear to keep she blessing wholly to herself she have set apart one corner of the grounds for a row of picturesque cottage in which she have establish a number of pensioner whom age or infirmity have render destitute and whom she constantly visit with present from she dairy or she fruit-tree roam about the lawn and walk which she have make herself in a muslin gown and a plain straw hat she could forget that she be a queen she do not suspect that the intriguer who from time to time malign she most innocent action be misrepresent even these simple and natural pleasure and whisper in they secret cabal that she very dress be a proof that she still cling as resolutely as ever to she austrian preference that she discard she silk gown because they be the work of french manufacturer while they be she brother 's flemish subject who supply she with muslin but far beyond she plantation and she flower she child be to she a source of unceasing delight she could be carry by she side about the garden a great part of the day for as in she anticipation and preparation she have tell she mother long before french parent keep they child as much as possible in the open air -lrb- 8 -rrb- a fashion which fully accord with she own notion of what be best calculate to give a infant health and strength and before the babe be five month old -lrb- 9 -rrb- she flatter herself that it already distinguish she from its nurse that nothing might be want to she comfort peace be re-established between austrium and prussium and if at this time the war with england do make she in some degree uneasy she yet feel a sanguine anticipation of triumph for the french arm in the event of a battle between the hostile fleet a result of which when the antagonist do come within sight of each other it appear that the french and spanish admiral feel far less confident she anxiety and hope be vividly set forth in a letter which in the course of the summer she write to she mother which be also singularly interesting from its self-examination and from the substantial proof it supply of the correctness of those anticipation which be base on the salutary effect which she novel position as a mother might be expect to have upon she character versaille August 16th my dearest mother -- i can not find language to express to my dear mamma my thanks for she two letter and for the kindness with which she express she willingness to exert herself to the utmost to procure we peace -lrb- 10 -rrb- it be true that that would be a great happiness and my heart desire it more than any thing in the world but unhappily i do not see any appearance of it at present every thing depend on the moment we fleet the french and spanish be now unite we have a considerable superiority -lrb- 11 -rrb- they be now in the channel and i can not without great agitation reflect that at any instant the whole fate of the war may be decide i be also terrify at the approach of September when the sea be no longer practicable in short it be only on the bosom of my dearest mamma that i lay aside all my disquiet god grant that it may be groundless but she kindness encourage I to speak to she as i think the king be touch quite as he should be with all the service you so kindly propose to render he and i do not doubt that he will be always eager to profit by it rather than to deliver himself up to the intrigue of those who have so frequently deceive france and whom we must regard as we natural enemy my health be completely re-establish i be go to resume my ordinary way of life and consequently i hope soon to be able to announce to my dearest mother fresh news such as that of last year she may feel quite re-assured now as to my behavior i feel too strongly the necessity of have more child to be careless in that if i have formerly do amiss it be my youth and my levity but now my head be thoroughly steady and you may reckon confidently on my properly feel all my duty besides that i owe such conduct to the king as a reward for he tenderness and i will venture to say it he confidence in I for which i can only praise he more find more i venture to send my dear mamma the picture of my daughter : it be very like she the dear little thing begin to walk very well in she leading-string she have be able to say papa for some day she tooth have not yet come through but we can feel they all i be very glad that she first word have be she father 's name it be one more tie for he he behave to I most admirably and nothing could be want to make I love he more my dear mamma will forgive my twaddle about the little one but she be so kind that sometimes i abuse she kindness it be well for marie antoinette 's happiness that she husband be one in whom as we have see that she tell she mother she could feel entire confidence for during she seclusion in the measles the intriguer of the court have venture to try and work upon he mercy have reason to suspect that some be even wicked enough to desire to influence he against he wife by the same means by which the duke de richelieu have formerly alienate he grandfather from marie leczinska and the queen herself receive proof positive that maurepa in spite of she civility to he and he countess have become jealous of she political influence and have endeavor to prevent he consult she on public affair but all maneuver intend to disturb the conjugal felicity of the royal pair be harmless against the honest fidelity of the king the graceful affection of the queen and the firm confidence of each in the other the people generally feel that the influence which it be now notorious that the queen do exert on public affair be a salutary one and great satisfaction be express when it become know in the autumn that the usual visit to fontainebleau be give up partly as be costly and therefore undesirable while the nation have need to concentrate all its resource on the effective prosecution of the war and partly that the king might be always within reach of he minister in the event of any intelligence of importance arrive which require prompt decision she letter to she mother at this time show how entirely she whole attention be engross by the war and at the same time with what wise earnestness she desire the re-establishment of peace even some gleam of success which have attend the french arm in the west indy where the marquis de bouillé the most skillful soldier of whom france at that time could boast take one or two of the british island and the count d'estae whose fleet of thirty-six sail be for a short time far superior to the english force in that quarter capture one or two more do not diminish she eagerness for a cessation of the war though it be curious to see that she have become so deeply imbue with the principle of statesmanship with which m necker the present financial minister be seek to inspire the nation that she objection to the continuance of the war turn chiefly on the degree in which it affect the revenue and expenditure of the kingdom she evidently sympathize in the disappointment which as she report to the empress be generally feel by the public at the mismanagement of the admiral m d'orvillier who with force so superior to those of the english have neither be able to fall in with they so as to give they battle nor to hinder any of they merchantman from reach they harbor in safety as it be he will have spend a great deal of money in do nothing -lrb- 12 -rrb- and a month later she repeat the complaint -lrb- 13 -rrb- the king and she have renounce the journey to fontainebleau because of the expense of the war and also that they may be in the way to receive earlier intelligence from the army but the fleet have not be able to fall in with the english and have do nothing at all it be a campaign lose and which have cost a great deal of money what be still more afflict be that disease have break out on board the ship and have cause great havoc and the dysentery which be rage as a epidemic in brittany and normandy have attack the land force also which be intend to embark for england i greatly fear she proceed that these misfortune of ours will render the english difficult to treat with and may prevent proposal of peace of which i see no immediate prospect i be constantly persuade that if the king should require a mediation the intrigue of the king of prussium will fail and will not prevent the king from avail himself of the offer of my dear mamma i shall take care never to lose sight of this object which be of such interest to the whole happiness of my life so full be she mind of the war that four or five word in each letter to report that she daughter be in perfect health or that she have cut four tooth be all that she can spare for that subject generally of such engrossing interest to herself and the empress while before the end of the year we find she taking even the domestic trouble of england into she calculation -lrb- 14 -rrb- and speculate on the degree in which the aspect of affair in ireland may affect the great preparation which the english minister be make for the next campaign the mere habit of devote so much consideration to affair of this kind be beneficial as tend to mature and develop she capacity she be rapidly learn to take large view of political question even if they be not always correct and the acuteness and earnestness of she comment on they daily increase she influence over both the king and the minister so that in the course of the autumn mercy could assure the empress -lrb- 15 -rrb- that the king 's complaisance toward she increase every day that he make it he study to anticipate all she wish and that this attention show itself in every kind of detail while maurepa also be unable to conceal from himself that she voice always prevail in every case in which she choose to exert a decisive will and accordingly bent himself very prudently before a power which he have no means of resist so solicitous indeed do the whole council show itself to please she that when the king who be aware that she allowance in spite of its recent increase be insufficient to defray the charge to which she be liable propose to double it necker himself with all he zeal for economy and retrenchment eagerly embrace the suggestion and its adoption give the queen a fresh opportunity of strengthen the esteem and affection of the nation by declare that while the war last she would only accept half the sum thus place at she disposal the continuance of the war be not without its effect on the gayety of the court from the number of officer whom they military duty detain with they regiment but the quiet be beneficial to marie antoinette whose health be again become delicate so much so that after a grand drawing-room which she hold on new-year 's - eve and which be attend by nearly two hundred of the chief lady of the city she be completely knock up and force to put herself under the care of she physician meanwhile the war become more formidable the english admiral rodney the greatest sailor who as yet have ever command a british fleet in the middle of January utterly destroy a strong spanish squadron off cape st vincent and as from the coast of spain he proceed to the west indy the french ministry have ample reason to be alarm for the safety of the force which they have in those region it be evident that it would require every effort that could be make to enable they sailor to maintain the contest against a antagonist so brave and so skillful and as one of the first step toward such a result necker obtain the king 's consent to a great reform in the expenditure of the court and in the civil service and to the abolition of a great number of costly sinecure we may be able to form some idea of the prodigality which have hitherto waste the revenue of the country from the circumstance that a single edict suppress above four hundred office and marie antoinette be so sincere in she desire to promote such measure that she speak warmly in they praise to she mother even though they greatly curtail she power of gratify she own favorite the king she say have just issue a edict which be as yet only the forerunner of a reform which he design to make both in he own household and in mine if it be carry out it will be a great benefit not only for the economy which it will introduce but still more for its agreement with public opinion and for the satisfaction it will give the nation it be impossible for any language to show more completely how above all thing she make the good of the country she first object and she be the more inclined to approve of all that be be do in this way from she conviction that necker be both honest and able a opinion which she share with if she have not learn it from she mother and she brother and which be to some extent justify by the comparative order which he have re-establish in the finance of the country and by the degree in which he have revive public credit she be not aware that the real danger of the situation have a source deeper than any financial difficulty a fact which necker himself be unable to comprehend and she could not foresee when it become necessary to grapple with those danger how unequal to the struggle the great banker would be find it may perhaps be infer that she do suspect necker of some deficiency in the higher quality of statesmanship when in the spring of 1780 she tell she mother that she would give every thing in the world to have a prince kaunitz in the ministry -lrb- 16 -rrb- but that such man be rare and be only to be find by those who like the empress herself have the sagacity to discover and the judgment to appreciate such merit she be however shut she eye to the fact that she husband have have a minister far superior to kaunitz and that she herself have lend she aid to drive he from he service chapter xv anglomanium in paris -- the winter at versaille -- hunting -- private theatricals -- death of prince charle of lorraine -- success of the english in america -- education of the duc d'angoulême -- libelous attack on the queen -- death of the empress -- favor show to some of the swedish noble -- the count de fersen -- necker retire from office -- he character it be curious while the resource of the kingdom be so severely tax to maintain the war against england of which every succeed dispatch from the seat of war show more and more the imprudence to read in mercy 's correspondence account of the anglomanium which still subsist in paris surpass that which the letter of the empress describe as reign in vienna though it do not show itself now in quite the same manner as a year or two before in the aping of english vice gamble at race and hard drinking but rather in a copying of the fashion of man 's dress in the introduction of top-boot and very wholesomely in the adoption of a country life by many of the great noble in imitation of the english gentry so that for the first time since the coronation of loui xiv the great territorial lord begin to spend a considerable part of the year on they estate and no longer to think the interest and requirement of they tenant and dependent beneath they notice the winter of 1779 and the spring of 1780 pass very happily if versaille from the reason mention above be not as crowd as in former year it be very lively the season be unusually mild the hunting be scarcely ever interrupted and marie antoinette who now make it a rule to accompany she husband on every possible occasion sometimes do not return from the hunt till the night be far advance and find she health much benefit by the habit of spend the greater part of even a winter 's day in the open air she garden too which daily occupy more and more of she attention as it increase in beauty have the same tendency and she anxiety to profit by the experience of other on one occasion inflict a whimsical disappointment of the free-thinker of the court the profligate and sentimental infidel rousseau have die a couple of year before and have be bury at ermenonville in the park of the count de girardin in the course of the summer the queen drive over to ermenonville and the admirer of the versatile writer flatter themselves that she object be to pay a visit of homage to the shrine of they idol but they wear greatly mortify to find that though he tomb be point out to she she take no further notice of it than such as consist of a pass remark that it be very neat and very prettily place and that what have attract she curiosity be the english garden which the count have recently lay out at a great expense and from which she have be lead to expect that she might derive some hint for the further improvement of she own little trianon she have not yet entirely give up she desire for novelty in she amusement and she begin now to establish private theatricals at versaille choose light comedy intersperse with song and with but few character the male part be fill by the count d'artoi and some of the most distinguished officer of the household while she herself take one of the female part the spectator be confine to the royal family and those noble whose post entitle they to immediate attendance on the king and queen she be so anxious to perform she own part well though she do not take any of the principal character but prefer to act the waiting-woman rather than the mistress that she place herself under the tuition of michu a professional actor of reputation from one of the parisian theater but though the audience be far too courtly to greet she appearance on the stage without vociferous applause the preponderance of evidence must lead we to believe that she majesty be not a good actress -lrb- 1 -rrb- and perhaps we may think that as the part which she select require rather a arch pertness than the grace and majesty which be more natural to she so also they be not altogether in keep with the stately dignity which queen should never wholly lay aside it be well however that she should have amusement to cheer she for the year be destine to bring she heavy trouble before its close : loss in she own family which would be feel with terrible heaviness by she affectionate disposition be impend over she while the news from america where the english army at this time be achieve triumph which seem likely to have a decisive influence on the result of the war cause she great anxiety how great a letter which she write to she mother in July afford a striking proof in June when she hear of the dangerous illness of she uncle prince charle of lorraine now governor of the low country formerly the gallant antagonist of frederick of prussium she declare that the intelligence overwhelm she with a agitation and grief such as she have never before experienced and she lament with evidently deep and genuine distress the threaten extinction of the male line of the house of lorraine but before she write again the news of sir henry clinton 's exploit in carolina have arrive and though almost the same post inform she of the prince 's death the sorrow which that bereavement awaken in she mind be scarcely allow even in its first freshness a equal share of she lamentation with the more absorb importance of the event of the campaign beyond the atlantic my dearest mother -- i write to you the moment that i receive the sad intelligence of my uncle 's death though as the brussels courier have already start i fear my letter may have arrive rather late i will not venture to say more on the subject lest i should be reopen a sorrow for which you have so much cause to grieve the capture of charleston -lrb- 2 -rrb- be a most disastrous event both for the facility it will afford the english and for the encouragement which it will give to they pride it be perhaps still more serious because of the miserable defense make by the american one can hope nothing from such bad troops it be curious to contrast the angry jealousy which she here betray of we disposition and policy as a nation with the partiality which as we have see she show for the agreeable quality of individual englishman but she uneasiness on this subject lead to practical result by induce she to add she influence to that of a party which be discontent with the ministry and be especially labor to persuade the king to make a change in the war department and to dismiss the prince de montbarey whose sole recommendation for the office of secretary of state seem to be that he be a friend of the prime minister and to give he place to the count de ségur the change be make as any change be sure to be make in favor of which she personally exert herself even the partisan of m de maurepa himself be force to allow that the new minister be in every respect far superior to he predecessor and mercy be desirous that she should procure the dismissal of maurepa also think it of great importance to she own comfort that the prime minister should be bind to she interest but she be far more anxious on other subject nearly two year have now elapse since the birth of the princess royal and there be as yet no prospect of a companion to she so that the count d'artoi begin to make arrangement for the education of he infant son the duc d'angoulême with a premature solicitude which be evidently design to point the child out to the nation as its future sovereign -lrb- 3 -rrb- the queen be greatly annoyed and to add to she vexation one of the teethe illness to which child be subject at this time throw the little princess into convulsion which to a mother 's anxiety seem even dangerous to she life though in a day or two that apprehension pass away but these hope of d'artoi and he flatterer again fill the court with intrigue in the course of the summer she be make highly indignant by find that news from the court with malicious comment be send from pari across the frontier to be print at deux-pont or düsseldorf and then circulate in pari and in vienna and it be difficult to avoid connect these libel with those who in the palace itself be manifestly build hope on the diminution of she influence and the disparagement of she character but this and all other vexation be presently throw into the shade by a great grief the more difficult to bear because it be wholly unexpected by she -- the death of she mother in reality marium teresa have be unwell for some time but the suspicion of the serious character of she complaint which she secretly entertain she have never reveal to marie antoinette and at last the end follow too quickly on the first appearance of danger to allow time for any preparatory warning to be receive at versaille before the fatal intelligence arrive on the 24th of November she be take ill in a manner which excite the alarm of she physician but she family feel no apprehension even on the 27th the emperor feel so sanguine that the cough which seem she most distressing symptom be but temporary that it be with the greatest unwillingness that he consent to she receive the communion as the physician recommend but the next day even he be force to acquiesce in the hopeless view which they take of they patient and on the 29th she die after have bear suffering which for the last three day have be of the most painful character with the same heroism with which in she earlier life she have struggle against grief of a different kind the dispatch announce she death be bring to the king and it be characteristic of he timid disposition that he could not nerve himself to communicate it to he wife but suppress all mention of it during the evening and in the morning summon the abbé de vermond and employ he to break the news to she reserve for himself the less painful task of approach she with word of affectionate consolation after the first shock be over for a time however she be almost overwhelm with sorrow she attempt to write to she brother but after a few line she close the letter declare that she tear prevent she from see the paper and those about she find that for some time she could bear no other topic of conversation than the courage the wisdom the greatness of she mother and above all she warm affection for herself and for all she other child -lrb- 4 -rrb- with the death of the empress we lose the aid of mercy 's correspondence which have afford such invaluable service in the light it have throw on the peculiarity of marie antoinette 's position and the gradual development of she character during the earlier year of she residence in france we shall again obtain light from the same source of almost greater importance when the still more terrible danger of the revolution render the queen more dependent than ever on he counsel but for the next few year we shall be compel to content ourselves with scantier material than have be furnish by the empress 's unceasing interest in she daughter 's welfare and the embassador 's faithful and candid report the death of marium teresa naturally close the court of she daughter against all gayety during the spring of 1781 still one of the tax which prince pay for they grandeur be the force which at time they be compel to put upon they inclination when they dispense with that retirement which they own feeling would render acceptable and after a few week of seclusion a few guest begin to be admit to the royal supper-table among whom as a very extraordinary favor be some swedish noble -lrb- 5 -rrb- one of whom the count de stedingk have establish a claim to the royal favor by serve with several of he countryman as a volunteer in the count d'estaing 's fleet in the west indy such service be highly esteem by both king and queen since loui though he have be unwillingly drag into the war by the ambition of the count de vergenne and the popular enthusiasm naturally when once engage in it take as vivid a interest in the prowess of he force as if he have never be trouble with any misgiving as to the policy which have set they in motion and marie antoinette be at all time excite to enthusiasm by any deed of valor and as we have see take a especial interest in the achievement of the navy the king of sweden the chivalrous gustavus iii have already make the acquaintance of loui and marie antoinette in a short visit which he have pay to france the year after they marriage and the queen now write to he in warm praise of m de stedingk and all he countryman who have come under she notice while the king reward the count 's valor and the wound which have be incur in its exhibition by a order of knighthood -lrb- 6 -rrb- and the more substantial gift of a pension but the swede who soon outrun all he compatriot in the race for the royal favor of both king and queen be the count axel de fersen a descendant it be believe of one of the scotch officer of the great macpherson clan who in the stormy time of the thirty year ' war have seek fame and fortune under the banner of gustavus adolphus the beauty of he countess be celebrate throughout both sweden and france and he own be but little inferior to it if she be know as the rose of the north he name be rarely mention without the addition of the handsome he be a perfect master of all noble and knightly accomplishment and be also distinguish for a certain high-souled and romantic -lrb- 7 -rrb- enthusiasm which lend a tinge to all he conversation and demeanor and this combination win for he the marked favor of marie antoinette the calumniator whom the condition and prospects of the royal family make more busy than ever at this time insinuate that he have touch she heart but those who know best the manners of life and character of both denounce it as the vilest of libel the count 's be a loyal attachment do nothing but honor to he who feel it and to the queen who inspire it and it be mark by a permanence which distinguish no devotion but that which be pure and noble as he show ten year later by the well-planned and courageous though unsuccessful effort which he make for the deliverance of the queen and all she family that marie antoinette who from early youth have show a intuitive accuracy of judgment in she estimate of character should from the very first honorably distinguish a man capable of such devotion to she service be not unnatural but there be another circumstance in he favor which he share with the other foreign noble english and german who in these year be well receive by the queen they disinterestedness present a striking contrast to the rapacity of the french every french noble value the court only for what he could obtain from it even madame de polignac whom the queen specially honor with the title of she friend exhibit a all-grasping covetousness of which with all she effort to shut she eye to it marie antoinette could not be unconscious and she perception of the difference between she french and she foreign courtier be mark by herself in a few word when the comte de la marck who be himself of foreign extraction venture once to recommend to she greater caution in she display of liking for the foreign noble as what might excite the jealousy of the french -lrb- 8 -rrb- and she reply that he might be right but the foreigner be the only people who ask she for nothing meanwhile the war go on in america the colonist themselves be make but little if any progress and the french contingent be certainly reap no honor m de la fayette the only officer who come in contact with a british force show no military skill or capacity and not even much courage but in the course of the spring france sustain a far heavier loss than even the defeat of a army could have inflict on she in the retirement of necker from the ministry as a statesman he be certainly not entitle to any very high rank he have neither extensive knowledge nor large view nor firmness the only project of constitutional reform which he have bring forward have be but a mutilate and imperfect copy of the system devise by the original and statesman-like daring of turgot at a subsequent period he prove himself incapable of discerning the true character of the circumstance which surround he and wholly ignorant of the feeling of the nation and of the principle and object of those who aspire to take a lead in its council but as yet he financial policy have undoubtedly be successful he have greatly relieve the general distress he have maintain the public credit and he have inspire the nation with confidence in itself and other country also with confidence in its resource but he have make many and powerful enemy by the retrenchment which have be a necessary part of he system as early as the spring of 1780 mercy have report to the empress that both the king 's brother and the duc d'orléans complain that some of he measure infringe upon they established rights that the count d'artoi have have a very stormy discussion with necker himself and when he could neither convince nor overbear he have try though unsuccessfully to enlist the queen against he the count have since employ the controller of he own household m boutourlin to write pamphlet against he and in point of fact many of the most elaborate detail of a financial statement which necker have recently publish be very ill-calculated to endure a strict scrutiny but m boutourlin do he work so badly that necker have no difficulty in repel he and for a moment seem the stronger for the attack that have be make upon he he have be so far right in he estimate of he position that he could rely on the support of the queen who be aware that both she mother and she brother have a high opinion of he integrity but though the king also have from time to time give he cordial sanction to he different measure it be not in the nature of loui to withstand repeated pressure and solicitation necker too himself unintentionally play into the hand of he enemy he have nominally only a subordinate position in the ministry as he be a protestant loui have fear to offend the clergy by give he a seat in the council or the title of comptroller-general but have confer that post on m taboureau des reaux make necker director of the treasury under he the real management of the exchequer be however place wholly in he hand and as he be one of the vainest of man he have gradually assume a tone of importance as if he be the paramount influence in the government go so far as even to open negotiation with foreign statesman to which none of he colleague be privy -lrb- 9 -rrb- it be not strange that he be not very well satisfy with a position which seem as if it have be contrived in order to keep he out of sight and to deprive he of the credit belong to he financial success but hitherto he have be satisfy to bide he time now however he triumph over m boutourlin seem to he so to have establish he supremacy as to entitle he to insist on a promotion which should be a public recognition of he position as the real minister of finance and as entitle to a preponderating voice in all matter of general policy he accordingly demand admission to the council and on its be refuse at once resign he office the consternation be universal the general public have gradually learn to place such confidence in he that they look on he loss as irreparable some even of the prince who have originally strive to prepossess the king against he either change they mind or fear to show they disagreement with the common feeling and marie antoinette who fully share he view as to the primary importance of finance in all question of government condescend to admit he to a interview request he as a personal favor to herself to recall he resignation urge upon he that patience would surely in time procure he all that he ask and in she honest earnestness for the welfare of the nation weep when he withdraw without have yield to she solicitation it be late in the evening and dark when he take he leave and afterward when he be tell that he have draw tear from she eye by he refusal he say that have he see they he should have submit to a wish so enforce even at the sacrifice of he own comfort and reputation chapter xvi the queen expect to be confine again -- increase unpopularity of the king 's brother -- birth of the dauphin -- festivity -- deputation from the different trade -- song of the dames de la halle -- ball give by the body-guard -- unwaver fidelity of the regiment -- the queen offer up she thanksgiving at notre dame -- banquet at the hôtel de ville -- rejoice in paris how irreparable he loss be be show by the rapid succession of finance minister who in the course of the next seven year successively hold the office of comptroller-general all be equally incompetent and under they administration sometimes merely incapable sometimes combine recklessness and corruption with incapacity the treasury again become exhaust the resource of the nation dwindle away and the distress of all but the wealthiest class become more and more insupportable but for a time the attention of marie antoinette be draw off from political embarrassment by the event which alone seem want to complete she personal happiness and to place she position and popularity on a impregnable foundation in the spring she discover that she be again about to become a mother the whole nation expect the result with a intense anxiety the king 's brother be daily become more and more deservedly unpopular the count d'artoi who as the father of a son occupy more of the general attention than he elder brother seem to take pain to parade he contempt for the commercial class and still more for the lower order and he disapproval of every proposal which have for its object to conciliate the trader or to relieve the suffering of the poor while the count de provence openly establish a mistress the countess de balbus at the luxembourg palace he residence in the capital where she preside over the reception which he take upon himself to hold to the exclusion of he lawful princess the countess de provence be not well calculate to excite admiration or sympathy since she be plain and ungracious but madame de balbi whose character have be disgracefully notorious even before she connection with the count be not more attractive in appearance or manner than the savoy princess and the citizen of pari who in this instance faithfully represent the feeling of the entire nation do not disguise they anxiety that the child about to be bear should be a prince who might extinguish the hope and project of both he uncle they wish be gratify on the morning of the 22d of October the king be start from the palace on a hunting expedition with he brother when it be announce to he that the queen be take ill -lrb- 1 -rrb- he at once return to she room and mindful of the danger which she have incur on the occasion of the birth of madame royale from the greatness and disorder of the crowd he break through the ancient custom and order that the door should be close and that no one should be admit beyond a very small number of the great officer male and female of the household he care be reward by a comparatively easy birth and he anxiety to protect he wife from agitation be further show by a second arrangement which be perhaps hardly so easy to carry out but which be also perfectly successful as be most natural the queen and himself fully share the ardent wish of the nation that the expect child should prove a heir to the throne and he consequently fear that should it not be so the disappointment might produce a injurious effect on the mother 's health or should they hope be realize that the excessive joy might be equally dangerous with a desire therefore to avoid expose she to either shock in the first moment of weakness he forbid any announcement of the sex of the child be make to any one but himself the instant that the child be bear he hasten to the bedside to judge for himself whether she could bear the news presently she come to herself and it seem to she that the general silence indicate that she have become the mother of a second daughter but she desire to be assure of the fact see say she to loui how reasonable i be i ask no question -lrb- 2 -rrb- and loui who from joy be scarcely able to contain himself see she freedom from agitation think he might safely reveal to she the whole extent of they happiness he call out so as to be hear by the princess de guimenée who still hold the post of governess to the royal child and who have already exhibit the child to the witness in the antechamber and be now await he summons at the open door my lord the dauphin beg to be admit the princess de guimenée bring my lord the dauphin to he mother 's arm and for a few minute the small company in the room gaze in respectful silence while the father and mother mingled tear of joy with broken word of thanksgive yet even in this moment of exultation marie antoinette could not forget she first-born nor the feeling which have make she rejoice at the birth of a daughter who still have as it be no rival in she eye because no rival claim to she own could be set up with respect to a princess she kiss the long-wished-for infant over and over again press he fondly to she heart and then after she have peruse each feature with anxious scrutiny and point out some resemblance such as mother see to he father take he say she to madame de guimenée he belong to the state but my daughter be still mine -lrb- 3 -rrb- presently the chamber be clear and in a few minute the glad tiding be carry to every corner of the palace and town of versaille and as speedily as express could gallop to the anxious city of pari by a somewhat whimsical coincidence the count de stedingk who from have be one of the intended hunting-party have be admit into the antechamber rush down-stair in he haste to spread the intelligence meet the countess de provence on the staircase it be a dauphin madame he cry what a happy event the countess make he no reply nor do she or she husband pretend to disguise they mortification the count d'artoi be a little less open in the display of he discontent which be however sufficiently notorious but with these exception all france or at least all france sufficiently near the court to feel any personal interest in its concern be unanimous in its exultation as soon as the new-born child be dress he father take he in he arm and carry he to the window show he to the crowd -lrb- 4 -rrb- which on the first news of the queen 's illness have throng the court-yard and be wait in breathless expectation the result a rumor have already begin to penetrate the throng that the child be a son and the moment that the happy tiding be confirm and the infant -- they future king as they undoubtingly hail he -- be present to they view they joy break forth in such vociferous acclamation that it become necessary to silence they by a appeal to they to show consideration for the mother 's weakness for the next three month all be joy and festivity when the little duc d'angoulême now a sprightly boy of six year old be take into the nursery to see or in the court language to pay he homage to the heir to the throne he say to he father as he leave the room papa how little my cousin be the day will come my boy reply the count when you will find he quite great enough and it seem as if the whole nation and especially the city of pari think no celebration of the birth of its future king could be too sumptuous for he greatness it be a real heart-felt joy that be awaken in the people on the day follow the birth chronicler of the time remark that no other subject be speak of that even stranger stop one another in the street to exchange congratulation -lrb- 5 -rrb- the different trade and guild lead the way in the expression of these loyal felicitation when he royal highness be a week old he hold a grand reception deputation from different body of artisan each with a band of music at its head and each carry some emblem of its occupation march in a long procession to versaille the chimney-sweep bear aloft a chimney entwine with garland on the top of which be perch one of the smallest of they boy the chairman carry a chair superbly gilt on which sit in state a representative of the royal nurse with a child in she arm in royal robe the butcher drive a fat ox the pastry-cooks bear on a splendid tray a variety of pastry and sweetmeat such as might tempt child of a larger growth than the little prince they have come to honor the blacksmith beat a anvil in time to they cheer the shoe-maker bring a pair of miniature boot the tailor have devote elaborate and minute pain to the embroidering of a uniform of the dauphin 's regiment such as might even now fit its young colonel if he parent would permit he to be attire in it the crowd be too great to be receive in even the largest saloon of the palace but it fill the court-yard beneath and as the weather be luckily favorable the dauphin be bring to the balcony and display to the people while they greet he with cheer which be renew from time to time even after he have be withdraw till the shout seem as if it would have no end one deputation consist of member of the fairer sex receive even higher honor fifty lady of the fish-market vindicate the long-acknowledged claim of they body by form a separate procession each dame be dress in a gown of rich black silk they establish court-dress and nearly every one have diamond ornament to they the celebrated antechamber from the oval window at the end know as the bull 's eye be open -lrb- 6 -rrb- and three of they body be admit even into the queen 's room and to the side of the bed the popular poet la harpe whom the partiality of voltaire have designate as the heir of he genius have compose a address which the spokeswoman of the party have write out on the back of she fan and now read with a sweet voice which have procure she the honor of be so select -lrb- 7 -rrb- and with very appropriate delivery the queen make a brief but most gracious answer and then on they retirement the whole company with a train of fish-woman of the lower class be entertain at a grand banquet which they enliven with song compose for the occasion one of they so hit the fancy of the king and queen that they quote it more than once in they letter to they correspondent and marie antoinette even sing it occasionally to she harp : ne craignez pa cher papa d' voir augmenter vot ' famille le bon dieu z ' y pourvoira : fait 's en tant qu ' versaille en fourmille y eut-il cent bourbon chez nous y a du pain du laurier pour tous the body-guard celebrate the auspicious event by give a grand ball in the concert-room of the palace to the queen on she recovery it be attend by the whole court and marie antoinette open it herself dance a minuet with one of the troop whom he comrade have select for the honor and whom the king promote as a memorial of the occasion and as a testimony of he approval of the loyalty of that gallant regiment amidst all the trouble of later year the fidelity of those noble troops never waver they have even in one hour of terrible danger the honor in the same palace of save the life of they queen but it be a melancholy proof of the fleeting character and instability of popular favor which be supply by the recollection that these very artisan who be now so vociferous and undoubtedly at this moment so sincere in they profession of loyalty be afterward she foul and ferocious enemy and yet between 1781 and 1789 there have be no change in the character or conduct of the king and queen or rather it may be say the intervene year have be a period during which a countless series of act of beneficence have display they unceasing affection for they subject the festivity be crown in the most appropriate manner by a public thanksgiving offer by the queen herself to heaven for the gift of a son and for she own recovery but that celebration be necessarily postpone till she strength be entirely re-establish and it be not till the 21st of January that the physician would allow she to encounter the excitement of so interesting but fatigue a day the court have quit versaille for la muette the day before to be nearer the city and on the appoint morning which the watcher for omen delightedly remark as one of midsummer brilliancy -lrb- 8 -rrb- the most superb procession that even pari have ever witness issue from the gate of the old hunting-lodge whose earlier occupant have be animated by a very different spirit -lrb- 9 -rrb- that the honor of the day might be wholly the queen 's loui himself do not accompany she but follow she three hour later to meet she at the hôtel de ville nineteen coach glitter with burnish gold and every panel of which be embellish with crown wreath or allegorical picture march on at a stately walk toward the city gate convey the queen radiant with beauty and happiness the sister and aunt of the king the long train of she and they lady and all the great officer of she household squadron of the

provide for the male guest the most renowned musician perform the sweetest air but the melody of gluck and grétry be drown in the cheer of the multitude outside who thus relieve they impatience for the re-appearance of they queen the banquet be succeed by a grand reception with its singular but invariable accompaniment of a gaming-table -lrb- 10 -rrb- and the whole be conclude by a grand illumination and display of firework in which the pyrotechnist have exhaust they allegorical ingenuity a temple of hymen occupy the center and the god of marriage -- never so far as present appearance indicate more auspiciously employ -- present to france the precious infant who be the most recent fruit of he favor while the flame upon he altar which never have burn with a brighter light be feed by the thank-offering of the whole french people as each new feature of the display burst upon they eye the acclamation of the populace redouble and they enthusiasm be kindle to the utmost pitch when loui and marie antoinette descend the stair and arm-in-arm walk out among the crowd ostensibly to see the illuminations from the different point which present the most impose spectacle but really as the citizen perceive to show they sympathy with the joy of the people by mingle with the multitude and thus allow all to approach and even to accost they while they and especially the queen reply to every loyal cheer or homely word of congratulation by a cordial smile or expression of approval or thanks which long dwell in the memory of those to whom they be address chapter xvii madame de guimenée resign the office of governess of the royal child -- madame de polignac succeed she -- marie antoinette 's view of education -- character of madame royale -- the grand duke paul and he grand duchess visit the french court -- they character -- entertainment give in they honor -- insolence of the cardinal de rohan -- he character and previous life -- grand festivity at chantilly -- event of the war -- rodney defeat de grasse -- the siege of gilbralter fail -- m de suffrein fight five draw battle with sir e hughe in the indian sea -- the queen receive he with great honor on he return the post of governess to the royal child be one which be confer for life and do not even cease on the accession of a new sovereign and the birth of a new royal family madame de guimenée therefore have be appoint to that office on the birth of the first child of the late dauphin the father of loui xvi still retain it and on the birth of madame royale transfer she service to that princess the arrangement have be far from acceptable to marie antoinette who have no great liking for the lady though with she habitual kindness of disposition she have accept she attention and have often condescend to appear as a guest at she evening party take only the precaution of ascertain beforehand whom she be likely to meet there -lrb- 1 -rrb- but in the spring of 1782 the prince de guimenée become involve in pecuniary difficulty that compel he to retire from the court and he princess to resign she appointment which marie antoinette at once bestow on madame de polignac she attachment to that lady afford a striking exemplification of one feature in she character a steady adherence to friendship once form which can never be otherwise than amiable even when as it may be think be the case in this and one or two other instance she carry it to excess for she could hardly fail to be aware that madame de polignac be most unpopular with all class and that she unpopularity be not undeserved she be covetous for herself and she have a number of relation equally rapacious who regard she court favor solely as a means of enrich the whole family she have procure a valuable reversion for she husband and subsequently the rare favor of a hereditary dukedom and it be characteristic of she disposition that she might have attain the rank of duchess for herself at a earlier date but that she prefer to it the chance of other favor of a more practically useful nature nor be it till she have receive such sum of money that nothing more could well be ask that she turn she ambition to title and to the much-coveted dignity of a stool to sit upon in the presence of royalty -lrb- 2 -rrb- but the more people speak ill of she the more the queen protect she and if she receive the resignation of madame de guimenée with pleasure much of she joy seem to be owe to the opportunity which it afford she of promote the new duchess to the vacant place while madame de polignac have even the address to persuade she that she accept the post unwillingly and in undertake it be make a sacrifice to loyalty and friendship but if the queen be dupe on that point she be not deceive on other she know that the duchess have no qualification for the office that she be neither clever nor accomplished but she absence of any special qualification be in fact she best recommendation in the eye of she patroness for marie antoinette have high idea of the duty which a mother owe to she child she think herself bind to take upon herself the real superintendence of they education and have this view she prefer a governess who would be content that she child 's mind should receive they color from herself she own idea of education as we shall see it hereafter describe by herself -lrb- 3 -rrb- be that example be more powerful than precept and that love be a better teacher than fear and act on this principle from the moment that she little daughter be old enough to comprehend she intention and wish she begin to make she she companion abandon or at least relax she pursuit of other pleasure for that which be now she chief delight as well as in she eye she chief duty -- the task of watch over the early promise the opening talent and virtue of those who be destine as she hope to have a predominant influence on the future welfare of the nation especially she make a rule of take the little princess with she on the different errand of humanity and benevolence which wherever she might be and more particularly while she be at versaille form a almost habitual part of she occupation she see that much of the distress which now seem to be the normal condition of the humbler class and much of the discontent which be feel by all class but the highest be cause by the pride of the prince and noble who in france draw a far more rigorous and unbending line of demarkation between themselves and they inferior than prevail in other country and she desire from they earliest infancy to imbue she child with a different principle and to teach they by she own example that none could be so lowly as to be beneath the notice even of a sovereign and that on the contrary the greater the depression of the poor the greater claim do it give they on the solicitude and protection of they prince and ruler nor be these lesson which even worldly policy might have dictate the only one which she seek to inculcate on the little princess before the more exciting pursuit of society should have render she less susceptible to good impression unfriendly as she husband 's aunt have always be to herself and little as there be that be really amiable in they character there be yet one the princess louise the nun of st deni whose renunciation of the world seem to point she out to she family as a model of holiness and devotion and as above all thing marie antoinette desire to inspire she little daughter with a deep sense of religious obligation she soon begin to take she with she in all she visit to the convent and to encourage she to converse with the other sister of the house nor do she abandon the practice even when it be suggest to she that such a intercourse with those who be notoriously always on the watch to attract recruit of rank or consideration might have the result of incline the child to follow she great-aunt 's example and perhaps by renounce the world to counteract plan which she parent might have prefer for she establishment in life marie antoinette declare that should the princess express such a desire far from be annoyed she should feel flattered by it -lrb- 4 -rrb- she would it may be presume have regard it as a convincing testimony of the soundness of she own system of education and of the purity of the instruction which she have give but such be not to be the destiny of she whose life at this moment seem to beam with prospects of happiness which it would have be cruel to allow she to exchange for the gloom of a convent though even before she arrive at womanhood the most austere seclusion of such a abode would have seem a welcome asylum from danger yet undreamed of she destiny be indeed to be one of trial and affliction even to the end trial very different in they kind from those which the gate of the carmelite sisterhood would have open to she but she mother 's early lesson of humility and piety and still more she mother 's virtuous and heroic example never cease to bear they fruit in they influence on she character amidst all the vicissitude of fortune the unhappy daughter -lrb- 5 -rrb- as she be style by the faithful and eloquent champion of she race live to win the respect even of its enemy -lrb- 6 -rrb- supply at more than one critical moment a courage and decision of which she male relative be destitute and in the second and final ruin of she house she fortitude and resignation still command the loyal adherence of a large party among she countryman and the esteem of foreign statesman who gladly recognize in she no small portion of the nobility of she female ancestor in the spring of 1782 the attention of the parisian be occupy for a while by the arrival of two visitor from a nation which as yet have send forth but few of its son to mingle in society with those of other country the grand duke of russium who have indeed be its rightful emperor ever since the murder of he father twenty year before but who have be compel to postpone he claim to those of he ambitious and unscrupulous mother catherine ii have conceive a desire so far to imitate the example of he great ancestor the founder of the russian empire peter the great as to make a personal investigation of the manners of other people besides he own to use the language in which the empress communicate to loui xvi she son 's wish to pay he a visit he seek in the first instance to take lesson in courtesy and nobility from the most elegant court in the world and as loui have respond with a cordial invitation to versaille at the end of may he with he grand duchess a princess of würtemberg arrive at the palace paul have not as yet give any indication of the brutal and ferocious disposition which distinguish he in he later year till it gradually develop into a savage insanity which neither he noble nor even he son could endure he appear rather a young man of frank and open temper somewhat more unguarded in he language especially concern he own affair and position than be quite prudent or become but kind in intention sometimes even courteous in manner shrewd in discerning what thing and what person be most worthy of he notice and show no deficiency of judgment in the observation which he make upon they the grand duchess however be generally regard as greatly superior to she husband in every respect he be almost repulsive in he ugliness she be extremely handsome in feature though disfigure by a stoutness extraordinary in one so young she have also a high reputation for accomplishment and general ability though that too be disguise by a coldness or ungraciousness of manner that give stranger a disagreeable impression of she which however a more intimate acquaintance greatly remove they character have precede they and marie antoinette for perhaps the first time in she life feel very uneasy as to she own power of receive they with the dignity which become both she and they as she afterward explain she feeling to madame de campan she find the part of a queen much move difficult to play in the presence of other sovereign or of prince who be bear to become sovereign than before ordinary courtier -lrb- 7 -rrb- she even fortify she courage before dinner with a glass of water and the medicine prove effectual even if it cost she a effort to preserve she habitual gayety she difficulty be unperceived and indeed after the few first moment cease to be a difficulty paul himself care but little for female attraction or grace but the archduchess be charm with she union of liveliness and dignity which surpass all she previous experience of court and one of she lady madame d'oberkirch who have leave behind she some memoirs to which all succeed writer have be indebted for many particulars of this visit could scarcely find word to describe the impression the queen 's beauty have make upon she and all she fellow-traveler the queen be marvelously beautiful she fascinate every eye it be absolutely impossible for any one to display a greater grace and nobility of demeanor -lrb- 8 -rrb- madame d'oberkirch like herself be german by birth and marie antoinette beg she to speak german to she that she might refresh she recollection of she native language but she find that she have almost forget it ah say she german be a fine language but french in the mouth of my child seem to I the finest language in the world and in the same spirit of entire adoption of french feeling and even of french prejudice she declare to the baroness that though the rhine and the danube be both noble river the seine be so much more beautiful that it have make she forget they both but she preference for every thing french do not make she neglect the duty of hospitality to she foreign visitor she wish rather that they should carry with they as fix a idea as she herself entertain of the superiority of france to they own country in this as in every other particular and she give two magnificent entertainment in they honor at the little trianon display the beauty of she garden by day and also by night by a illumination of extraordinary splendor they be highly delighted with the beauty and the novelty of a scene such as they have never before witness but she pleasure be in a great degree mar by the indecent boldness of one whose sacred profession as well as he ancient lineage ought to have restrain he from such misconduct though it be but too completely in harmony with he previous life prince loui de rohan be a descendant of the great duke de sully and a member of a family which during the last reign have possess a influence at court which be surpass by that of no other house among the french noble -lrb- 9 -rrb- he himself have reap the full advantage of its interest as we have already see he have be coadjutor of strasburg when marie antoinette pass through that city on she way to france in 1770 he have subsequently be promote to the rank of cardinal and though he be notoriously devoid of capacity yet through the influence of he relation and that of madame du barrus with whom they maintain a intimate connection he have obtain the post of embassador to the court of vienna where he have make himself conspicuous for every species of disorder he whole life in the austrian capital have be a round of shameless profligacy and extravagance the conduct of the inferior member of the embassy stimulate by he example and protect by he official character have be equally scandalous till at last marium teresa have feel herself bind in justice to she subject to insist on he recall the moment that he become aware that he position be in danger he begin to write abusive letter against the empress-queen and to circulate libel at vienna against both she and marie antoinette on whom he openly threaten to avenge himself if he pleasure or he prospects should in any way be interfere with -lrb- 10 -rrb- since he return to france he have have the address to conciliate maurepa who add the authority of he ministerial office to the solicitation of the cardinal 's sister madame de marsan have succeed in wring from the unwilling king he appointment to the honorable and lucrative preferment of grand almoner but even that post though it make he one of the great officer of the court do not weaken he desire to annoy the queen for have as he believe use she influence to deprive he of he embassy and for have by she marked coldness since he return from vienna show she disapproval of he profligate character and of he insolence to she mother and unhappily there be not want person base enough to co-operate with he generally discredit as he be as instrument of they own secret malice the birth of the dauphin have be a fatal blow to the hope which have be found on the possible succession of the king 's brother and from this time forth the whisperer of detraction and calumny be more than ever busy sometimes venture to forge she handwriting and sometimes daring with still fouler audacity to invent story design to tarnish she reputation by throw doubt on she conjugal fidelity at such a moment the presence of such a man as the cardinal on the stage be a evil omen he audacity it seem could hardly be purposeless and he purpose could not be innocent he have be most anxious to obtain admission to one of the entertainment which the queen give to the russian prince and when he be disappoint he have the silly audacity to bribe the porter of the trianon to admit he into the garden where as the royal party pass down the different walk he thrust himself ostentatiously at different point into they sight profess to disguise himself by throw a mantle over he shoulder but take care that he scarlet stocking should prevent any uncertainty from be feel as to he identity that he should have presume to intrude into the queen 's presence in she own palace without permission be in itself a insult but those behind the scene believe that he have a deeper design and that he wish to diffuse a belief that marie antoinette secretly regard he with a favor which she be unwilling to show openly and that he have not obtain admission to she garden without she connivance the prince of the blood too the prince de condé and the duke de bourbon invite paul and he archduchess to a entertainment at chantilly which far surpass in splendor the display at trianon but the queen be willing on such a occasion to be eclipse by she subject the prince she say might well give festivity of vast cost because they defray the charge out of they private revenue but the expense of entertainment give by the king or by herself fall on the national treasury of which they be bind to be the guardian in the interest of the poor tax-payer not that in all probability paul and he archduchess notice the inferiority court festivity at st petersburg be as yet neither numerous nor magnificent and they soon show themselves so wearied with the round of gayety which have be force upon they that some of the diversion which have be project at other royal palace besides versaille be give up to avoid distressing they -lrb- 11 -rrb- the sight which please they most be the play to which at they own special request the queen accompany they and where they be greatly strike by the magnificence of the theater and every thing connect with the performance as well as with the reception which the audience give the queen much as they have admire what they have see it be she grace and kind solicitude for they gratification which make the greatest impression on they and the archduchess keep up a correspondence with she during the rest of they travels especially dwelling on the scene which please she most in germany and on the person she meet who be know to and regard by the queen political affair be at this time cause marie antoinette great anxiety one of she most frequently express wish have be that the french fleet should have a opportunity of engage that of england in a pitched battle when the judicious care which m de sartine have bestow on the marine would be see to bear its fruit but when the battle do take place the result be such as to confound instead of justify she patriotic expectation in April the english admiral rodney inflict on the count de grasse a crush defeat off the coast of jamaica in September the combined force of france and spain be beat off with still heavier loss from the impregnable fortress of gibraltar and the only region in which a french admiral escape disaster be the indian sea where the bailli de suffrein a officer of rare energy and ability encounter the british admiral sir edward hughe in a series of severe action and except on one occasion in which he lose a few transport never permit he antagonist to claim any advantage over he the single loss which he sustain in he first combat be more than counterbalance by he success on land where by the aid of hyder alus 's son the celebrated tippoo be make himself master of cuddalore and then drop down to the cingalese coast recapture trincomalee the conquest of which have be one of hughe 's most recent achievement -lrb- 12 -rrb- the queen feel the reverse keenly she even curtail some of she own expense in order to contribute to the building of new ship to replace those which have be lose and she receive m de suffrein on he return from indium at the conclusion of the war with the most sincere and marked congratulation she invite he to the palace and when he arrive she cause madame de polignac to bring both she child into the room my child say she and especially you my son know that this m de suffrein we be all under the greatest obligation to he look well at he and ever remember he name it be one of the first that all my child must learn to pronounce and one which they must never forget -lrb- 13 -rrb- she be act up to she mother 's example than whom no sovereign have better know how to give they due honor to bravery and loyalty such a queen deserve to have faithful friend and suffrein be a man who have he life be spare might like the marquis de bouillé have show that even in france the feeling of chivalry and devotion to king and lady be not yet extinguish but he die before either he country or he queen have again need of he service or before he have any opportunity of prove by fresh achievement he gratitude to a sovereign who know so well how to appreciate and to honor merit chapter xviii peace be re-establish -- embarrassment of the ministry -- distress of the kingdom -- m de calonne become finance minister -- the winter of 1783 -  be very severe -- the queen devote large sum to charity -- she political influence increase -- correspondence between the emperor and she on european politics -- the state of france -- the baron de breteuil -- she description of the character of the king the conclusion of peace between france and england be one of the earliest event of the year 1783 but it bring no strength to the ministry or rather it place its weakness in a more conspicuous light maurepa have die at the end of 1781 and since he death the count de vergenne have be the chief adviser of the king but he attention be almost exclusively direct to the conduct of the diplomacy of the kingdom and to its foreign affair and he make no pretension to financial knowledge unluckily the profess minister of finance joly de fleury and he successor d'ormesson be as ignorant of that great subject as himself and within two year after necker 's retirement they mismanagement have bring the kingdom to the very verge of bankruptcy d'ormesson be dismiss and for many day it be anxiously deliberate in the palace by whom he should be replace some propose that necker should he recall but the king have feel himself personally offend by some circumstance which have attend the resignation of that minister two year before the queen incline to favor the pretension of loménie de brienne archbishop of toulouse not because he have any official experience but because fifteen year before he have recommend the abbé de vermond to marium teresa and the abbé see in the present embarrassment a opportunity of repay the obligation now speak highly to she of the archbishop 's talent but madame de polignac and she party persuade she majesty to acquiesce in the appointment of m de calonne a man who like turgot have already distinguish himself as intendant of a province though he have not inspire those who watch he career with as high a opinion of he uprightness as of he talent he have also secure the support of the count d'artoi by promise to pay he debt and loui himself be win to think well of he by the confidence which he express in he own capacity to grapple with the exist or even with still greater difficulty nor indeed have he be possess of steadiness prudence and principle be he very unfit for such a post at such a time for he be very fertile in resource and well-endowed with both physical and moral courage but these faculty be combine with be indeed the parent of a mischievous defect he have such reliance on he own ingenuity and ability to deal with each difficulty or danger as it should arise that he be indifferent to precaution which might prevent it from arise the spirit in which he take office be exemplify in one of he first speech to the queen know that he be not the minister whom she would have prefer he make it he especial business to win she confidence and he have not be long install in office when she express to he she wish that he would find means of accomplish some object which she desire to promote madame be he courtly reply if it be possible it be do already if it be impossible i will take care and manage it but be very unscrupulous himself he overshoot he mark when he seek to propitiate she further by offer to represent as hers act of charity which she have not perform the winter of 1783 be one of unusual severity the thermometer at paris be for some week scarcely above zero scarcity with its inevitable companion clearness of price reduce the poor of the northern province and especially of the capital and its neighborhood to the verge of starvation the king queen and princess give large sum from they privy purse for they relief but as such supplies be manifestly inadequate loui order the minister to draw three million of franc from the treasury and to apply they for the alleviation of the universal distress calonne cheerfully receive and execute the beneficent command he be perhaps not sorry at he first entrance on he duty to show how easy it be for he to meet even a unforeseen demand of so heavy a amount and he fancy he see in it a means of ingratiate himself with marie antoinette he propose to she that he should pay one of the million to she treasurer that that officer might distribute it in she name as a gift from she own allowance but marie antoinette disdain such unworthy artifice she would have feel ashamed to receive praise or gratitude to which she be not entitle she reject the proposal insist that the king 's gift should be attribute to himself alone and express she intention to add to it by curtail she personal expenditure by abridge she entertainment so long as the distress should last and by dedicate the sum usually appropriate to pleasure and festivity to the relief of those whose very existence seem to depend on the aid which it be she duty and that of the king to furnish for there be this especial characteristic in marie antoinette 's charity that it do not proceed solely from kindness of heart and tenderness of disposition though these be never want but also from a settle principle of duty which in she opinion impose upon sovereign as a primary obligation the task of watch over the welfare of they subject as person intrust by providence to they care and such a feeling be obviously more to be depend upon as a constant motive for action than the most vivid emotion of the moment which if easily excite be not unfrequently as easily overpower by some fresh object meanwhile event be gradually compelling she to take a more active part in politics maurepa have be jealous of she influence and while that old minister live loui who from he childhood have be accustom to see he in office commit almost every thing to he guidance but as he always require some one of stronger mind than himself to lean upon as soon as maurepa be go he turn to the queen it be to she that he now chiefly confide he anxiety and perplexity from she that he seek counsel and strength and the minister naturally come to regard she as the real ruler of the state accordingly we find from she correspondence of this period that even such matter as the appointment of the embassador to foreign state be often refer to she decision and how greatly the habit of consider affair of importance expand she capacity we may learn from the opinion which she brother the emperor who be never dispose to flatter or even to spare she have evidently come to entertain of she judgment in one long letter write in September of the year 1783 he discuss with she the attitude which france have assume toward austrium ever since the dismissal of choiseul the willingness of she minister to listen to prussian calumny the encouragement which they have give to the opposition in the empire and they obsequiousness to prussium while austrium have not retaliate as she have have many opportunity of do by any complaisance toward england though the english statesman have make many advance toward she it be a curious instance of fear be realize in a sense very different from that which trouble the writer at the moment that among the act of france of which have he be incline to be captious he might justly have complain he enumerate she recent acquisition of corsica as one which for a number of reason might be very prejudicial to the possession of the house of austrium and its branch in italy it do indeed prove a acquisition which largely influence the future history not only of austrium but of the whole world when the little island which hitherto have be but a hot-bed of disorder and a battle-field of faction burdensome to its genoese master give a general to the army of france whose most brilliant exploit be a succession of triumph over the austrian commander in every part of the emperor 's dominion he letter conclude with warning draw from the present condition and view of the different state of europe and especially of france whose finances and resource to speak with moderation have be greatly strain in the recent war embrace in they scope even the design of russium on the independence of turkey and with a request that he sister would inform he frankly what he be to believe as to the opinion of the king and in what light he be to regard the recent letter of vergenne which to he apprehension show a indifference to the maintenance of the alliance between the two country -lrb- 1 -rrb- it be altogether a letter such as might pass between statesman and prove clearly that joseph regard he sister now as one fully capable of take large view of the situation of both country and she answer show that she fully enter into all the different question which he have raise though it also show that she be guide by she heart as well as by she judgment still look on the continuance of the friendship between she native and she adopted country as essential not only to she comfort but even in some degree to she honor and also that on that account she be desirous at time of exert a greater influence than be always allow she versaille September 29th 1783 shall i tell you my dear brother that you letter have delight I by its energy and nobleness of thought and why should i not tell you so i be sure that you will never confound you sister and you friend with the trick and maneuver of politician i have read you letter to the king you may be sure that it like all you other letter shall never go out of my hand the king be strike with many of you reflection and have even corroborate they himself he have say to I that he both desire and hope always to maintain a friendship and a good understanding with the empire but yet that it be impossible to answer for it that the difference of interest might not at time lead to a difference in the way of look at and judge of affair this idea appear to I to come from himself alone and from the distrust with which people have be inspiring he for a long time for when i speak to he i believe it to be certain that he have not see m de vergenne since the arrival of you courier m de mercy will have report to you the quietness and gentleness with which this minister have speak to he i have have occasion to see that the head of the other minister which be a little heated have since cool again i trust that this quiet spirit will last and in that case the firmness of you reply ought to lead to the rudeness of style which the people here adopt be forget you know the ground and the character so you can not be surprise if the king sometimes allow answer to pass which he would not have give of he own accord my health consider my present condition -lrb- 2 -rrb- be perfect i have a slight accident after my last letter but it produce no bad consequence : it only make a little more care necessary accordingly i shall go from choisy to fontainebleau by water my child be quite well my boy will spend he time at la muette while we be absent it be just a piece of stupidity of the doctor who do not like he to take so long a journey at he age though he have two tooth and be very strong i should be perfectly happy if i be but assure of the general tranquillity and above all of the happiness of my much-loved brother whom i love with all my heart -lrb- 3 -rrb- another letter write three month later explain to the emperor the object of some of the new arrangement which calonne have introduce have for one object among other the facilitation of a commercial intercourse especially in tobacco with the united state she hope that another consequence of they will be the abolition of the whole system of farmers-general of the revenue and she explain to he both the advantage of such a measure and at the same time the difficulty of carry it out immediately after so costly a war since it would involve the instant repayment of large sum to the farmer with all the clearness of a practice financier she mention also the appointment of the baron de breteuil as the new minister of the king 's household -lrb- 4 -rrb- and she estimate of he character be render important by he promotion six year later to the post of prime minister the emperor also have ample means of judge of it himself since the baron have succeed the cardinal de rohan as embassador at vienna i think with you that he require to be keep within bound and he will be so more than other minister by the nature of he office which be very limited and entirely under the eye of the king and of he colleague who will be glad of any opportunity of mortify he vanity however he activity will be very useful in a thousand detail of a department which have be neglect and badly manage for the last sixty year and though it be a slight anticipation of the order of we narrative it will not be inconvenient to give here some extract from a third letter to the same brother write in the autumn of the following year in which she describe the king 's character and point out the difficulty which it often interpose to she desire of influence he view and measure it may perhaps be think that she unconsciously underrate she influence over she husband though there can be no doubt that he be one of those man whom it be hardest to manage wholly without self-reliance yet with a scrupulous wish to do right that make he distrustful of other even of those whose advice he seek or whose judgment he most highly value September 22d 1784 i will not contradict you my dear brother on what you say about the short-sightedness of we ministry i have long ago make some of the reflection which you express in you letter i have speak on the subject more than once to the king but one must know he thoroughly to be able to judge of the extent to which he character and prejudice cripple my resource and means of influence he he be by nature very taciturn and it often happen that he do not speak to I about matter of importance even when he have not the least wish to conceal they from I he answer I when i speak to he about they but he scarcely ever open the subject and when i have learn a quarter of the business i be then force to use some address to make the minister tell I the rest by let they think that the king have tell I every thing when i reproach he for not have speak to I of such and such matter he be not annoyed but only seem a little embarrassed and sometimes answer in a off-hand way that he have never think of it this distrust which be natural to he be at first strengthen by he govern -- or before my marriage m de vauguyon have alarm he about the authority which he wife would desire to assume over he and the duke 's black disposition delighted in terrifying he pupil with all the phantom story invent against the house of austrium m de maurepa though less obstinate and less malicious still think it advantageous to he own credit to keep up the same notion in the king 's mind m de vergenne follow the same plan and perhaps avail himself of he correspondence on foreign affair to propagate falsehood i have speak plainly about this to the king more than once he have sometimes answer I rather peevishly and as he be never fond of discussion i have not be able to persuade he that he minister be deceive or be deceive he i do not blind myself as to the extent of my own influence i know that i have no great ascendency over the king 's mind especially in politics and would it be prudent in I to have scene with he minister on such subject on which it be almost certain that the king would not support I without ever boast or say a word that be not true i however let the public believe that i have more influence than i really have because if they do not think so i should have still less the avowal which i be make to you my dear brother be not very flattering to my self-love but i do not like to hide any thing from you in order that you may be able to judge of my conduct as correctly as be possible at this terrible distance from you at which my destiny have place I -lrb- 5 -rrb- a melancholy interest attune to sentence such as these from the influence which the defect in she husband 's character when join to those of he minister have on the future destiny of both and of the nation over which he rule it be natural that she should explain they to a brother and though as a general rule it be clearly undesirable for queen consort to interfere in politics it be clear that with such a husband and with the nation and court in such a condition as then exist in france it be indispensable that marie antoinette should covet and so far as she be able exert influence over the king if she be not prepare to see he the victim or the tool of caballer and intriguer who care far more for they own interest than for those of either king or kingdom but as yet though as we see these deficiency of loui occasionally cause she annoyance she have no foreboding of evil she general feeling be one of entire happiness she child be grow and thrive she own health be far stronger than it have be and she enter with as keen a relish as ever into the excitement and amusement become she position and what we may still call she youth since she be even now only eight-and-twenty chapter xix the marriage of figaro -- previous history and character of beaumarchai -- the performance of the play be forbid -- it be say to be a little altered -- it be license -- displeasure of the queen -- visit of gustavus iii of sweden -- fête at the trianon -- balloon ascent in the spring of 1784 the court and capital wear work up to a high pitch of excitement by a incident which be in reality of so ordinary and trivial a character that it would be hard to find a more striking proof how thoroughly unhealthy the whole condition and feeling of the nation must have be when such a matter could have be regard as important it be simply a question whether a play which have be recently accept by the manager of the principal theater in pari should receive the license from the theatrical censor which be necessary to its be perform the play be entitle the marriage of figaro the history of the author m beaumarchai be curious as that of a rare specimen of the literary adventurer of he time he be bear in the year 1732 he father be a watch-maker name caron and he himself follow that trade till he be three or four and twenty and attain considerable skill in it but he be ambitious he be conscious of a handsome face and figure and know they value in such a court as that of loui xv he give up he trade as a watch-maker and buy successively different place about the court the last of which be sell at a price sufficient to entitle he to claim gentility so that in one of he subsequent railing against the noble he declare that he nobility be more incontestable than that of most of the body since he could produce the stamped receipt for it follow the example of molière and voltaire he change he name and call himself beaumarchais he marry two rich widow he form a connection with the celebrated financier pari duverney who initiate he in the mystery of stock-jobbing be a good musician he obtain the protection of the king 's daughter teach they the harp and conduct the weekly concert which during the life of marie leczinska they give to the king and the royal family he write two or three play none of which have any great success while one be a decide failure he become involve in lawsuit one of which he conduct himself against the best ability of the parisian bar and display such wit and readiness that he not only gain he cause but establish a notoriety which throughout life be apparently he dearest object he cross over to england where he make the acquaintance of wilke and one or two agent of the american colony then just commence they insurrection and partly from political sympathy with they view of freedom partly as he declare to retaliate on england for the injury which france have suffer at she hand in the seven year ' war he become a political agent himself procure arm and ship to be send across the atlantic and also a great quantity of store of a more peaceful character out of which he have hope to make a handsome profit but the american give he credit for greater disinterestedness the president of congress write he a letter thank he for he zeal but refuse to pay for he store for which he demand nearly a hundred and fifty thousand franc he commence a action for the money in the american court but as he could not conduct it himself he do not obtain a early decision indeed the matter imbitter all he closing day and be not settle when he die but while he be in the full flush of self-congratulation at the degree in which as he flatter himself he have contribute to the downfall of england the exuberance of he spirit prompt he to try he hand at a fourth play a sort of sequel to one of he earlier performance -- the barber of seville he finish it about the end of the year 1781 and as the manager of the theater be willing to act it he at once apply for the necessary license but it have already be talk about : if one party have pronounce it lively witty and the cleverest play that have be see since the death of molière another set of reader declare it full of immoral and dangerous satire on the institution of the country it be almost inseparable from the very nature of comedy that it should be to some extent satirical the offense which those who complain of the marriage of figaro on that account really find in it be that it satirize class and institution which could not bear such attack and have not be use to they molière have ridicule the lower middle class the newly rich the tradesman who because he have make a fortune think himself a gentleman but as one whose father be in the employ of royalty he lay no hand on any pillar of the throne but beaumarchai in the marriage of figaro single out especially what be call the privileged class he attack the licentiousness of the noble the pretentious imbecility of minister and diplomatist the cruel injustice of wanton arrest and imprisonment of protracted severity against which there be no appeal nor remedy and the privileged class in consequence denounce he work and they complaint of its character and tendency make such a impression that the court resolve that the license should not he grant the refusal however be not at first pronounced in a straightforward way but be defer as if those who have resolve on it fear to pronounce it for a long time the censor give no reply at all till beaumarchai complain of the delay as more injurious to he than a direct denial when at last he application be formally reject he induce he friend to raise such a clamor in he favor that loui determine to judge for himself and cause madame de campan to read it to himself and the queen he fully agree with the censor many passage he pronounce to be in extremely bad taste when the reader come to the allusion to secret arrest protracted imprisonment and the tedious formality of the law and lawyer he declare that it would be necessary to pull down the bastile before it could be act with safety as beaumarchai be ridicule every thing which ought to be respect it be not to be perform then say the queen no reply the king you may depend upon that similar refusal of a license have be common enough so that there be no reason in the world why this decision should have attract any notice whatever but beaumarchai be the fashion he have influential patron even in the palace : the count d'artoi and madame de polignac with the coterie which meet in she apartment be among they and the mere idea that the court or the government be afraid to let the play be act cause thousand to desire to see it who without such a temptation would have be wholly indifferent to its fate the censor could not prevent its be read at private party and such reading become so popular that in 1782 one be get up for the amusement of the russian prince who be greatly please by the liveliness of the dramatic situation and probably not sufficiently aware of the prevalence of discontent in many circle of french society to sympathize with those who see danger in its satire the praise lavish on it give the author greater boldness which be quite unnecessary he even meditate a evasion of the law by get it act in a place which be not a theater and ticket be actually issue for the performance in a saloon which be often use for rehearsal when a royal warrant -lrb- 1 -rrb- peremptorily forbid such a proceeding be send down from the palace a clamor be at once raise by the friend of beaumarchai as if seal letter have never be issue before they talk in a loud voice of oppression and tyranny and any one who know the king 's disposition might have divine that such a act of vigor be sure to be follow by one of weakness presently beaumarchais change he tone he give out that he have retrench the passage which have excite the royal disapproval and request that the play might be re-examine a new censor of high literary reputation report to the head of the police -lrb- 2 -rrb- that if one or two passage be correct and one or two expression which be liable to be misinterpret be suppress he foresee no danger in allow the representation beaumarchai at once promise to make the require correction and one of madame de polignac 's friend the count de vaudreuil the very nobleman with whom that lady 's name be by many discreditably connected obtain the king 's leave to perform it at he country house that thus a opportunity might be afford for judge whether or not the alteration which have be make be sufficient to render its performance innocent the king be assure that the passage which he have regard as mischievous be suppress or divest of they sting marie antoinette apparently have she suspicion but loui could never long withstand repeat solicitation and as he have not when madame de campan read it form any very high opinion of its literary merit he think that now that it be deprive of its venom it would be look upon as heavy and would fail accordingly some good judge such as the marquis de montesquieu be of the same opinion the actor think differently it be my belief say a man of fashion to the witty mademoiselle arnould use the technical language of the theater that you play will be ` damned ' yes she reply it will fifty night run but even if loui have hear of she prophecy he would have disregard it he give he permission for the performance to take place and on the 27th April 1784 the marriage of figaro be accordingly act to a audience which fill the house to the very ceiling and which the long uncertainty as to whether it would ever be see or not have dispose to applaud every scene and every repartee and even to see wit where none exist to a impartial critic remove both by time and country from the agitation which have take place it will probably seem that the play thus obtain a reception far beyond its merit it be undoubtedly what manager would call a good act play its plot be complicate without be confuse it contain many striking situation the dialogue be lively but there be more humor in the surprise and discovery than verbal wit in the repartee some stroke of satire be level at the grasp disposition of the exist race of courtier whose whole trade be represent as consist of get all they could and ask for more and other at the trick of modern politician feign to be ignorant of what they know to know what they be ignorant of to keep secret which have no existence to lock the door to mend a pen to appear deep when they be shallow to set spy in motion and to intercept letter to try to ennoble the poverty of they means by the grandeur of they object the censorship of course do not escape the scene be lay in spain figaro affirm that at madrid the liberty of the press mean that so long as a author speak neither of authority nor of public worship nor of politics nor of morality nor of man in power nor of the opera nor of any other exhibition nor of any one who be concern in any thing he might print what be please the lawyer be reproach with a scrupulous adherence to form and a connivance at needless delay which put money into they pocket and the noble with think that as long as they give themselves the trouble to be bear society have no right to expect from they any further useful action but such satire be too general it might have be think to cause uneasiness much more to do specific injury to any particular individual or to any company or profession figaro himself be represent as say that none but little man fear little writings -lrb- 3 -rrb- and one of the adviser whom king loui consult as to the possibility of any mischief arise from the performance of the play be say to have express he opinion in the form of a apothegm that none but dead man be kill by jest the author might even have argue that he keenest satire have be pour upon those national enemy the english when he declare what have be sometimes regard as the national oath to be the pith and marrow of the english language the open sesame to english society the key to unlock the english heart and to obtain the judicious swearer all that he could desire -lrb- 4 -rrb- and a english writer with english notion of the liberty of the press would hardly have think it worth while to notice such a affair at all do he not feel bind to submit he judgment to that of the french themselves and if they view be correct almost every institution in france must have be a dead man past all hope of recovery since the french historical writer to whatever party they belong be unanimous in declare that it be from this play that many of the oldest institution in the country receive they death-blow and that beaumarchai be at once the herald and the pioneer of the approach revolution pari have scarcely cool down after this excitement when its attention be more agreeably attract by the arrival of a king gustavus iii of sweden he have pay a visit to france in 1771 which have be cut short by the sudden death of he father necessitate he immediate return to he own country to take possession of he throne but the brief acquaintance which marie antoinette have then make with he have inspire she with a great admiration of he chivalrous character and in the precede year hearing that he be contemplate a tour in southern europe she have write to he to express a hope that he would repeat he visit to versaille promise he such a reception as be due to a ancient ally of france -lrb- 5 -rrb- and add that she should personally have great pleasure in testify to he how greatly she value he friendship she mention of the ancient alliance between the two country which indeed have subsist ever since the day of franci i be very welcome to gustavus since the object of he journey be purely political and he desire to negotiate a fresh treaty but those matter he of course arrange with the minister the queen be only concern in the entertainment due from royal host to so distinguish a guest most of they be of the ordinary character there be a sort of established routine of festivity for such occasion and it may be take as a proof that the court have abate somewhat of its alarm at beaumarchai 's play that the marriage of figaro be allow to be act on one of the king 's visit to the theater she also give he a entertainment of more than usual splendor at the trianon at which all the lady present and the invitation be very numerous be require to be dress in white while all the walk and shrubbery of the garden be illuminate so that the whole scene present a spectacle which he describe in one of he letter as a complete fairy-land a sight worthy of the elysian field themselves -lrb- 6 -rrb- but as usual the queen herself be the chief ornament of the whole as she move graciously among she guest lay aside the character of queen to assume that of the cordial hostess and not even take she place at the banquet but devote herself wholly to the pleasurable duty of do honor to she guest one of the display be of a novel character from which its inventor and patron expect scientific result of importance which though nearly a century have since elapse have not yet be realize in the preceding year montgolfier have for the first time send up a balloon and the new invention be now exhibit in the court of versaille : the queen allow the balloon to be call by she name and to the great admiration of gustavus who have a decide taste for matter which be in any way connect with practical science the marie antoinette make a successful voyage to chantilly the date of another invention if indeed it deserve so respectable a title be also fix by this royal visit mesmer have recently begin to astonish or bewilder the parisian with he theory of animal magnetism and gustavus spend some time in discuss the question with he and seem for a moment to have flatter himself that he comprehend he principle but the only durable result which arise from he stay in france be the sincere regard and esteem which he and the queen mutually conceive for each other they establish a correspondence in which marie antoinette repeatedly show she eagerness to gratify he wish and to attend to he recommendation and when at a later period unexpected trouble fall on she and she husband there be no one whom they trouble inspire with greater eagerness to serve they than gustavus whose last project before he fall by the hand of a assassin be direct to they deliverance from the danger which though neither he nor they be as yet fully alive to they magnitude be on the point of overwhelming they chapter xx st cloud be purchase for the queen -- libelous attack on she -- birth of the duc de normandie -- joseph press she to support he view in the low country -- the affair of the necklace -- share which the cardinal de rohan have in it -- the queen 's indignation at he acquittal -- subsequent career of the cardinal marie antoinette have long since complete she garden at the trianon but the gradual change in the arrangement of the court have make a number of alteration requisite at versaille with which the difficulty of find money render it desirable to proceed slowly it be reckon that it would be necessary to give up the greater part of the palace to workman for ten year and as the other palace which the king possess in the neighborhood of pari be hardly suit for the permanent residence of the court the queen propose to she husband to obtain st cloud from the duc d'orléans give he in exchange la muette the castle of choisy and a small adjacent forest such a arrangement would have produce a considerable saving by the reduction of the establishment keep up at those place at which the court only spend a few day in each year and as the duke be dispose to think that he should be a gainer by the exchange it be not very easy to explain how it be that the original project be give up and that st cloud be eventually sell to the crown for a sum of money choisy and la muette be also retain st cloud be buy and marie antoinette still eager to prevent she own acquisition from be too costly propose to the king that it should he buy in she name and call she property since a establishment for she would naturally lie frame on a more moderate scale than that of any palace belong to the king which be hold always to require the appointment of a governor and deputy-governor with a corresponding staff of underling while she should only require a porter at the outer gate the advantage of such a plan be so obvious that it be at once adopt the porter and servant wear the queen 's livery and all notice of the regulation to be observe be sign in the queen 's name -lrb- 1 -rrb- yet so busy be she enemy at this time that even this simple arrangement devise solely for the benefit of the people who be intimately concern in every thing that tend to diminish the royal expenditure give rise to numberless cavil some affirm that the issue of such notice in the name of the queen instead of in that of the king be a infringement on he authority one most able and influential counselor of the parliament duval d'esprémesnil who in more than one discussion in subsequent year show that in general he fully appreciate the principle of constitutional government but who at this time seem to have be animated by no other feeling than that of hatred for the exist minister even go the length of affirm that there be something not only impolitic but immoral in the idea of any palace belong to a queen of france -lrb- 2 -rrb- but when the arrangement have once be make marie antoinette not unnaturally think she honor concern in not abandon it in deference to clamor so absurd as well as so disrespectful to herself and st cloud to which she have always be partial continued hers and for the next five year divide she attention with the trianon but though she herself disregard all such attack with the calm dignity which belong to she character she friend be not free from serious apprehension as to the power of persistent detraction and calumny it be one of the penalty which the nation have to pay for the infamy which have stain the crown during the last three century that the people have learn to think that nothing be too bad to say and to believe of they king and marie antoinette seem as yet a fairer mark than usual for slanderous attack because she position be weaker than that of a king -lrb- 3 -rrb- it depend on the life of she husband and of a single son who be already begin to show sign of weakness of constitution it be therefore with exceed satisfaction that in the autumn of 1784 she friend learn that she be again about to become a mother they pray with inexpressible anxiety that the expect child should prove a son and on the 27th of march 1785 they prayer be grant a son be bear whom he delighted father at once take in he arm call he he little norman and say that the name alone would bring he happiness create duke of normandy no prophecy be ever so sadly falsify no king 's son have ever so miserable a lot but no foreboding of evil as yet disturb he parent they delight be fully share by the body of the people for the cabal against the queen be as yet confine to the immediate precinct of the court and have not descend to infect the middle class it be with difficulty when after she confinement she pay she visit to pari to return thanks at notre dame and st geneviève that the citizen could he prevent from unharness she horse and drag she coach in triumph through the street -lrb- 4 -rrb- and they exultation be fully share by the better-intentioned class of courtier and by all marie antoinette 's real friend who feel assure that the birth of this second son have give she the security which have hitherto be want to she position meanwhile she be again lead to interest herself greatly in foreign politics though in truth she hardly regard any thing in which she brother 's empire be interested as foreign so deep be she conviction that the interest of france and austrium be identical and inseparable and so unwearied be she endeavor to make she husband 's minister see all question that concern she brother 's dominion with she eye throughout the latter part of 1784 and the earlier month of 1785 joseph who be always restless in he ambition be full of scheme of aggrandizement which he desire to carry out through the favor and co-operation of france at one moment he project obtain bavarium in exchange for the netherland at another he aim at procure the opening of the scheldt by threaten the dutch with instant war if they resist but as all these scheme be eventually abandon they would hardly require to be mention here be it not for the proof which he correspondence with he sister afford of he increase esteem for she capacity and he evident conviction of she grow influence in the french government and for the light which some of she answer to he letter throw on she relation with the minister which have perhaps some share in increase the annoyance that the affair of the necklace as will be presently mention cause she before the end of the year she difficulty with loui himself be the same as she have already describe to she brother on former occasion it be impossible to induce he to take a strong line so as to speak resolutely to m de vergenne in she presence and equally so to prevent he change he mind afterward -lrb- 5 -rrb- while she distrust the good faith of the minister so much that though she resolve to speak to he strongly on the subject she would not do so till she could discuss the question with he in the presence of the king that he might not be able to disfigure or to exaggerate what she say yet she do not always find she precaution effectual loui 's judgment be always at the mercy of the last speaker she assure she brother that he have abundant reason to be contented with the king 's personal feeling on the subject when he receive the emperor 's letter he speak to she about it in a way that delighted she he regard joseph 's demand as just and he motive as most reasonable yet -- she blush to own it even to she brother -- after he have see he minister he tone be no longer the same he be embarrassed he shun the subject with she and often find some new objection to weaken the effect of he previous admission at one time she even fear a rupture between the two country vergenne be urge the king to send a army of observation to the frontier and if it be send the proximity of such a force to the austrian troops in the netherland would to she apprehension be full of danger there be sound political acuteness in she remark that the dispatch of a army of observation be not in itself a declaration of war but that when two army be so near to one another a order to advance be very soon execute and with a shrewd perception of the argument which be most likely to influence the humane disposition of she husband she press upon he that the delay and shuffling of he minister might very probably involve he in war in spite of he own intention however eventually the cloud which have cause she anxiety be dissipate the mediation of france have even some share in lead to a conclusion of these dispute in a manner in which joseph himself acquiesce and the good understanding between the two crown on which as marie antoinette often declare she happiness greatly depend be preserve or as she hope even strengthen by the result of these negotiation but on one occasion of real moment to the personal comfort and credit of the queen loui behave with a clear good sense and what be equally important with a firmness which she gratefully acknowledge -lrb- 6 -rrb- and contrast remarkably with the pusillanimous advice that have be give by more than one of the minister that the affair in which he exhibit these quality should for a moment have be regard as one of political importance be another testimony to the diseased state of the public mind at the time and that it should have be possible so to use it as to attach the slightest degree of discredit to the queen be a proof as strange as melancholy how greatly the secret intrigue of the basest cabal that ever disgrace a court have succeed in undermine she reputation and poisoning the very heart of the people against she -lrb- 7 -rrb- boehmer the court jeweler have collect a large number of diamond of unusual size and brilliancy which he have form into a necklace in the hope of sell it to the queen whose fancy for such jewel have some year before be very great she have at one time spend sum on diamond ornament large enough to provoke warm remonstrance from she mother though certainly not excessive for she rank and loui know she partiality for they have more than once make she costly gift of the kind but she taste for they have cool she child now engross far more of she attention than she dress and she be keenly alive to the distress which still prevail in many part of the kingdom and to the embarrassment of the revenue which the ingenuity of calonne do not relieve half so rapidly as he rashness encumber it accordingly she reply to boehmer 's application that she would purchase he necklace be that she jewel-case be sufficiently full and that she have almost give up wear diamond and that if such a sum as he ask which be nearly seventy thousand pound be available she should greatly prefer its be spend on a ship for the nation to replace the _ ville de paris _ whose loss still rankle in she breast the king who think that she must secretly wish for a jewel of such unequalled splendor offer to make she a present of the necklace but she adhere to she refusal boehmer be greatly disappointed he have exhaust he resource and he credit in collect the stone in the hope of make a grand profit and declare loudly to he patron that he should be ruin if the queen could not be induce to change she mind he complaint be so unrestrained that they reach the ear of those who see in he despair a possibility of enrich themselves at he expense there be in pari at the time a countess de la mothe who as claim descent from a natural son of henrus ii have add valoi to she name and have she claim to royal birth so far allow that as she be in very destitute circumstance she have obtain a small pension from the crown she pension and she pretension have perhaps unite to procure she the hand of the count de la mothe who have for some time be discreditably know as one of the most worthless and dangerous adventurer who infested the capital but she marriage have be no restraint on a life of unconcealed profligacy and among she lover she reckon the cardinal de rohan who as we have already see be as little scrupulous or decent as herself as however the cardinal 's extravagance have leave he with little means of supply she necessity madame la mothe conceive the idea of swindle boehmer out of he necklace and of make de rohan a accomplice in the fraud the one thing which in the transaction be difficult to determine be whether the cardinal be she willing and conscious assistant or she dupe that he capacity be of the very lowest order be notorious but he be a man who have be breed in court he know the manner in which prince transact they business and in which queen sign they name he have long be acquaint with marie antoinette 's figure and gesture and voice while unhappily there be nothing in he character which be incompatible with he become a accomplice in any act of baseness what follow be a drama of surprise it be with as much astonishment as indignation that marie antoinette learn that boehmer believe that she have secretly buy the necklace which openly and formally she have refuse and that he be look to she for the payment of its price and about a fortnight later it be like a thunder-clap that a summons come upon the cardinal de rohan who have just be perform mass before the king and queen to appear before they in loui 's private cabinet and that he find himself subject to a examination by loui himself who demand of he with great indignation a explanation of the circumstance that have lead he to represent himself to boehmer as authorize to buy a necklace for the queen terrify and confuse he give a explanation which be half a confession but which be too complicate to be thoroughly intelligible he be order to retire into the next room and write out he statement he written narrative prove more obscure than he speak word in spite of he prayer that he might be spare the degradation of be arrest while still clothe in he pontifical habit he be at once send to the bastile a day or two afterward madame la mothe be apprehend in the province and loui direct that a prosecution should be instantly commence against all who have be concern in the transaction for the queen 's name have be forge the cardinal do not deny that he have represent himself to boehmer as employ by she for the purchase of the jewel which as he say she secretly covet and for the payment of its price by installment but as he justification he produce a letter desire he to undertake the business and sign marie antoinette de france he declare that he have never suspect the genuineness of this letter though it be notorious that such a addition to they christian name be use by none but the son and daughter of the reign sovereign and never by a queen and eventually he whole story be find to be that madame la mothe have induce he to believe that she be in the queen 's confidence and also that the queen covet the necklace and be resolve to obtain it but that she be unable at once to pay for it and that be desirous to make amends to the cardinal for the neglect with which she have hitherto treat he she have resolve on employ he to make arrangement with boehmer for the instant delivery of the ornament and for she payment of the price by installment this be strange enough to have excite the suspicion of most man what follow be stranger still not content with forge the queen 's handwriting madame la mothe have even if one may say so forge the queen herself she have assure the cardinal that marie antoinette have consent to grant he a secret interview and at midnight in the garden of versaille have introduce he to a woman of notoriously bad character name oliva who in height resemble the queen and who in a conference of half a minute give he a letter and a rose with the word you know what this mean she have hardly utter the word when madame la mothe interrupt the pair with the warn the countess of provence and artoi be approach the mock queen retire in haste the cardinal press the rose to he heart act on the letter and protest that he have never doubt that he have see the queen and have be act on she command in obtain the necklace from boehmer and deliver it to madame la mothe though he now acknowledge that he have be impose upon and offer to pay the jeweler for he property there be not want those who advise that this offer should be accept and that the matter should be hush up rather than that a prince of the church should be publicly disgrace by a prosecution for fraud but loui and marie antoinette both rightly judge that they duty as sovereign of the kingdom forbid they to compromise justice by screen dishonesty it be but two year before that a great noble the most eloquent of all french orator have single out marie antoinette 's love of justice as one of she most conspicuous as it be one of she most noble quality and the word deserve especially to be remember from the melancholy contrast which he subsequent conduct present to the voluntary tribute which he now pay to she excellence in 1783 the young count de mirabeau plead for the restitution of he conjugal rights put the question to the judge at aix before whom he be argue which of you if he desire to consecrate a living personification of justice and to embellish it with all the charm of beauty would not set up the August image of we queen she and she husband might well have feel they be bind to act up to such a eulogy some of they adviser also and especially the baron de breteuil and the abbé de yermond fortify they decision with they advice be in truth greatly influence by a reason which they forbear to mention namely by they suspicion that the untiring malice of the queen 's enemy would not have fail to represent that the suppression of the slightest particle of the truth could only have be dictate by a guilty consciousness which feel that it could not bear the light and that the queen have forbear to bring the cardinal into court solely because she know that he be in a situation to prove fact which would deservedly damage she reputation it be impossible to doubt that the resolution which be adopt be the only one consistent with either propriety or common sense however plausible may be the argument which in this or that case may be adduce for concealment the common instinct of mankind which rarely err in such matter always conceive a suspicion that it be dictate by secret and discreditable motive and that he who screen manifest guilt from exposure and punishment make himself a accomplice in the wrong-doing if he be not so before but though loui judge rightly for he own and he queen 's character in bring those who be guilty of forgery and robbery to a public trial the result inflict a irremediable wound on one great institution furnish a additional proof how incurably rotten the whole system of the government must have be when corruption without shame or disguise be allow to sway the highest judicial tribunal in the country the parliament of pari constantly endeavor throughout its whole history to encroach upon the royal prerogative have always found its pretension on its purity and disinterestedness since its re-establishment at the beginning of the present reign it have advance its claim to the possession of those virtue more loudly than ever yet now in the very first case which come before it in which a noble of the highest rank be concern it be make apparent not only that it be wholly destitute of every quality which ought to belong to a judicial bench of a regard for truth and justice and even of a knowledge of the law but that no one give it credit for they and that every one regard the decision to be give as one which would depend not on the merit of the case but on the interest which the culprit might be able to make with the judge -lrb- 8 -rrb- the trial take place in may of the following year we need not enter into its detail the denial the admission the mutual recrimination of the person accuse in the fate of the la mothe and mademoiselle oliva no one profess to be concerned but the friend of the cardinal be numerous rich and powerful and for month have be and still be indefatigable in he cause some day before the trial the attorney - general have become aware that nearly the whole of the parliament have be gain by they he even furnish the queen with a list of the name of those judge who have promise they verdict beforehand and of the means by which they have be win over and on the decisive morning the cardinal and he friend make a theatrical display which be evidently intend to overawe those member of the parliament who be yet unconvinced and to enlist the sympathy of the public in general he himself appear at the bar in a long violet cloak the mourning robe of cardinal and all the passage lead to the hall of justice be line by he partisan also in deep mourning and they be not solely he own relation the noble of the different branch of he family the soubise the rohan the guimenées but though as prince of the blood the condés be nearly ally to the king and queen they also be not ashamed to swell the company assemble and to solicit the judge as they pass into the court to disregard alike justice and they own oath and to acquit the cardinal whatever the evidence might be which have be or be to be produce against he they be only ask what they have already assure themselves of obtain the queen 's signature be indeed declare to be a forgery and the la mothe mademoiselle oliva and a man name retaux de villette who have be the actual writer of the forge letter be convict and sentence to the punishment which the counsel for the crown have demand but the cardinal be acquit as well as a notorious juggler and impostor of the day call cagliostro who have apparently be so entirely unconnected with the transaction that it be not easy to see how he become include in the prosecution and permission be give to the cardinal to make he acquittal public in any manner and to any extent which he might desire -lrb- 9 -rrb- the subsequent history of the la mothe be singular and characteristic the countess who have be sentence to be flog branded and imprison for life after a time contrived it be believe by the aid of some of the rohan family to escape from prison she flee to london where for some time she and she husband live on the proceeds of the necklace which they have break up and sell piecemeal to jeweler in london and other city but they be soon reduce to great distress after the revolution have break out in pari they try to make money by publish libel on the queen in which they be believe to have obtain the aid of some who in former time have be under great personal obligation to marie antoinette but the scheme fail : they be overwhelm with debt writ be issue against they and in try to escape from the sheriff 's officer the countess fall from a window at the top of a house and receive injury which prove fatal a most accomplished writer of the present day who have devote much care and ability to the examination of the case have pronounce a opinion that the cardinal be innocent of dishonesty -lrb- 10 -rrb- and limit he offense to that of insulting the queen by the mere suspicion that she could place she confidence in such a unworthy agent as madame la mothe or that he himself could be allow to recover she favor by such means as he have employ but he absolute ignorance of the countess 's scheme be not entirely consistent with the admit fact that when he be arrest he first act be to send order to he secretary to burn all the letter which he have receive from she on the subject and unquestionably neither loui nor marie antoinette doubt he full complicity in the conspiracy loui at once deprive he of he office of grand almoner and banish he from the court declare that he know too well the usage of the court to have believe that madame la mothe have really be admit to the queen 's presence and intrust with such a commission -lrb- 11 -rrb- and marie antoinette give open expression to she indignation at the acquittal of a intriguer who have seek to ruin she or to procure money for himself by abuse she name and forge she signature add with undeniable truth that still more to be pity than herself be a nation which have for its supreme tribunal a body of man who consult nothing but they passion and of whom some be full of corruption and other be inspire with a boldness which always vent itself in opposition to those who be clothe with lawful authority -lrb- 12 -rrb- but she magnanimity and she sincere affection for the whole people be never more manifest than now even in she first moment of indignation even while write to madame de polignac that she be bath in tear of grief and despair and that she can hope for nothing good when perverseness be so busy in seek means to chill she very soul she yet add that she shall triumph over she enemy by do more good than ever and that it will be easier for they to afflict she than to drive she to avenge herself on they -lrb- 13 -rrb- and she use the same language to she sister christine even while express still more strongly she indignation at be sacrifice to a perjured priest and a shameless intriguer she demand she sister 's pity as one who have never deserve such injurious treatment -lrb- 14 -rrb- but who have only recollect that she be the daughter of marium teresa -- to fulfill she mother 's exhortation always to show herself french to the very bottom of she heart but she conclude by repeat the declaration that nothing shall tempt she to any conduct unworthy of herself and that the only revenge that she will take shall he to redouble she act of kindness it be please to be able to close so odious a subject by the statement that the disgrace which the cardinal have thus bring upon himself may be suppose in some respects to have serve as a lesson to he and that he conduct in the latter day of he life be such as to do no discredit to the noble race from which he spring a great part of he diocese as bishop of strasburg lay on the german side of the rhine and thither -lrb- 15 -rrb- when the french revolution begin to assume the blood-thirsty character which have make it a warn to all future age he be fortunate to escape in safety from the fury of the assassin who rule france and though he be no longer rich he less fortunate countryman and especially he clerical brethren find in he a liberal protector and supporter -lrb- 16 -rrb- he even levy a body of troops to re-enforce the royalist army but when the first consul wring from the pope a concordat of which he disapprove he resign he bishopric and shortly afterward die at ettenheim -lrb- 17 -rrb- where have he remain but a short time longer he like the duke d'enghien might have find that a residence in a foreign land be no protection against the ever-suspicious enmity of bonaparte chapter xxi the king visit cherbourg -- rarity of royal journey -- the princess christine visit the queen -- hostility of the duc d'orléans to the queen -- libel on she -- she be call madame deficit -- she have a second daughter who die -- ill health of the dauphin -- unskillfulness and extravagance of calonne 's system of finance -- distress of the kingdom -- he assemble the notable -- they oppose he plan -- letter of marie antoinette on the subject -- she idea of the english parliament -- dismissal of calonne -- character of archbishop loménie de brienne -- obstinacy of necker -- the archbishop be appoint minister -- the distress increase -- the notable be dissolve -- violent opposition of the parliament -- resemblance of the french revolution to the english rebellion of 1642 -- arrest of d'esprémesnil and montsabert it be owe to marie antoinette 's influence that loui himself in the following year begin to enter on a line of conduct which if circumstance have not prevent he from persevere in it might have tend more perhaps than any thing else that he could have do to make he also popular with the main body of the people the emperor while at versaille have strongly press upon he that it be he duty as king of the nation to make himself personally acquaint with every part of he kingdom to visit the agricultural district the manufacturing town the fortress arsenal and harbor of the country joseph himself have practice what he preach no corner of he dominion be unknown to he and it be plain that there can be no nation which must not be benefit by its sovereign thus obtain a personal knowledge of all the various interest and resource of he subject but such personal investigation be not yet understand to be a part of a monarch 's duty loui 's contemporary we own sovereign george iii than whom if rectitude of intention and benevolence of heart be the principal standard by which prince should be judge no one ever better deserve to be call the father of he country scarcely ever go a hundred mile from windsor and never once visit even those midland county which before the end of he reign have begin to give undeniable token of the contribution which they industry be to furnish to the grow greatness of he empire and the last two king of france though in the course of they long reign they have once or twice visit they army while wage war on the flemish or german frontier have never see they western or southern province but now marie antoinette suggest to she husband that it be time that he should extend he travels which except when he have go to rheim for he coronation have never yet carry he beyond compiègne in one direction and fontainebleau in another and as of all the department of government that which be concern with the marine of the nation interested she most -lrb- we fear that she be secretly look forward to a renewal of war with england -rrb- she persuade he to select for the object of he first visit the fort of cherbourg in normandy where those great work have be recently begin which have since be constantly augmented and improved till they have make it a worthy rival to we own harbor on the opposite side of the channel he be receive in all the town through which he pass with real joy the norman have never see they king since henry iv have make they province he battle-field and the queen who would gladly have accompany he have it not be that such a journey undertake by both would have resemble a state procession and therefore have be tedious and comparatively useless exult in the reception which he have meet with and begin to plan other expedition of the same kind for he feel assure that he presence would be equally welcome in other province -- at bourdeaux at lyon or at toulon and a series of such visit would undoubtedly have be calculate to strengthen the attachment of the people everywhere to the royal authority which already to some far-seeing judge seem likely soon to need all the re-enforcement which it could obtain in any quarter in the summer of 1786 she have a visit from she sister christine the princess of teschen who with she husband have be joint governor of hungary and since the death of she uncle charle of lorraine have be remove to the netherland she have never see she sister since she own marriage and the month which they spend together at versaille may be almost describe as the last month of perfect enjoyment that marie antoinette ever know for trouble be thicken fast around the government and be be take wicked advantage of by she enemy at the head of whom the duc d'orléans now begin openly to range himself he be a man notorious as have be already see for every kind of infamy and though he well know the disapproval with which marie antoinette regard he way of life and he character it be believe that he have have the insolence to approach she with the language of gallantry that he have be reject with merit indignation and that he ever afterward regard she noble disdain as a provocation which it should be the chief object of he life to revenge in fact on one occasion he do not scruple to avow he resentment at the way in which as he say she have treat he though he do not mention the reason -lrb- 1 -rrb- calumny be the only weapon which could be employ against she but in that he and he partisan have long be adept every old libel and pretext for detraction be diligently revive the old nickname of the austrian be repeat with pertinacity as spiteful as causeless even the king 's aunt lend they aid to swell the clamor on that ground and often say with all the malice of they inveterate jealousy that it be not to be expect that she should have the same feeling as they father or loui xiv since she be not of they blood though it be plain that the same remark would have apply to every queen of france since anne of brittany even the embarrassment of the revenue be imputed to she and she who have curtail she private expense even those which seem almost necessary to she position that she might minister more largely to the necessity of the poor -- who have decline to buy jewel that the money might be apply to the service of the state -- be now hold up to the populace as be by she extravagance the prime cause of the national distress pamphlet and caricature give she a new nickname of madame deficit and such a impression to she disfavor be thus make on the mind of the lower class that a painter who have just finish a engaging portrait of she surround by she child fear to send it to the exhibition lest it should be make a pretext for insult and violence she unpopularity do not indeed last long at this time but be supersede as we shall presently see by fresh feeling of gratitude for fresh labor of charity nevertheless the outcry now raise leave its seed behind it to grow hereafter into a more enduring harvest of distrust and hatred she have trouble too of another kind which touch she more nearly a second daughter sophie -lrb- 2 -rrb- have be bear to she in the summer of 1786 but she be a sickly child and die before she be a year old of one of the illness to which child be subject and for some month the mother mourn bitterly over she little angel as she call she she eldest boy too be get rapidly and visibly weaker in health : he spine seem to diseased marie antoinette 's only hope of save he rest on the fact that he father have also be delicate at the same age luckily he brother give she no cause for uneasiness as she write to the emperor -lrb- 3 -rrb- -- he have all that he elder want he be a thorough peasant 's child tall stout and ruddy -lrb- 4 -rrb- she have also another comfort which as she trouble thicken become more and more precious to she in the warm affection that have spring up between she and she sister-in-law the princess elizabeth a letter -lrb- 5 -rrb- have be preserve in which the princess describe the death of the little sophie to one of she friend which it be impossible to read without be strike by the sincerity of the sympathy with which she enter into the grief of the bereaved mother in these moment of anguish she show herself indeed a true sister and the two cling to one another the more the greater they danger and distress become a true sister she continue to the end meanwhile the embarrassment of the government be daily assume a more formidable appearance calonne have for some time endeavor to meet the deficiency of the revenue by raise fresh loan till he have completely exhaust the national credit and at last have be force to admit that the scheme originally propound by turgot and subsequently in a more modified degree by necker of abolish the exemption from taxation which be enjoy by the noble -- the privileged class as they be often call -- be the only expedient to save the nation from the disgrace and ruin of total bankruptcy but as it seem probable that the noble would resist such a measure and that they resistance would prove too strong for he as it have already be find to be for he predecessor he propose to the king to revive a old assembly which have be know by the title of the notable trust that if he succeed in obtain the sanction of that body to he plan the noble would hardly venture to insist on maintain they privilege in defiance of the recorded judgment of so respectable a council he hope be disappoint he might fairly have reckon on obtain they concurrence since it be the unquestioned prerogative of the king to nominate all the member but even when he be most deliberate and resolute he rashness and carelessness be incurable he take no pain whatever to select member favorable to he view and the consequence be that in march 1787 in the very first month of the session of the notable the whole body protest against one of the tax which he desire to impose and he enemy at once urge the king to dismiss he base they recommendation on the practice of england where as they affirm a minister who find himself in a minority on a important question immediately retire from office marie antoinette who as we have see have be a diligent reader of hume have also be lead to compare the proceedings of the refractory notable with the conduct of we english parliamentary party and to a english reader some of she comment can not fail to be as interesting as they be curious the duchess de polignac be drink the water at bath which at that time be a favorite resort of french valetudinarian and while she be still in that most beautiful of english city the queen keep up a occasional correspondence with she we have two letter which marie antoinette write to she in April one on the 9th the very day on which calonne be dismiss the second two day latter and even the passage which do not relate to politics have they interest as specimen of the writer 's character and of the sincere frankness with which she lay aside she rank and believe in the possibility of a friendship of complete equality April 9th 1787 i thank you my dear heart for you letter which have do I good i be anxious about you it be true then that you have not suffer much from you journey take care of yourself i insist on it i beg of you and be sure and derive benefit from the water else i should repent of the privation i have inflict on myself without you health be benefit when you be near i feel how much i love you and i feel it much more when you be far away i be greatly take up with you and yours and you would be very ungrateful if you do not love I for i can not change toward you where you be you can at least enjoy the comfort of never hearing of business although you be in the country of a upper and a lower house you can stop you ear and let people talk but here it be a noise that deafen one in spite of all i can do the word ` opposition ' and ` motion ' be establish here as in the english parliament with this difference that in london when people go into opposition they begin by denude themselves of the favor of the king instead of which here number oppose all the wise and beneficent view of the most virtuous of master and still keep all he have give they it may be a cleverer way of managing but it be not so gentleman-like the time of illusion be past and we be tasting cruel experience we be pay dearly to-day for we zeal and enthusiasm for the american war the voice of honest man be stifle by member and cabal man disregard principle to bind themselves to word and to multiply attack on individual the seditious will drag the state to its ruin rather than renounce they intrigue and in she second letter she specify some of the opposition by name one of whom as will be see hereafter contribute greatly to she subsequent misery the repugnance which you know that i have always have to interfere in business be today put cruelly to the proof and you would be as tired as i be of all that go on i have already speak to you of we upper and lower house -lrb- 6 -rrb- and of all the absurdity which take place there and of the nonsense which be talk to be load with benefit by the king like m de beauvau to join the opposition and to surrender none of they be what be call have spirit and courage it be in truth the courage of infamy i be wholly surround with folk who have revolt from he a duke -lrb- 7 -rrb- a great maker of motion a man who have always a tear in he eye when he speak be one of the number m de la fayette always found the opinion he express on what be do at philadelphium even bishop and archbishop belong to the opposition and a great many of the clergy be the very soul of the cabal you may judge after this of all the resource which they employ to overturn the plan of the king and he minister calonne however as have already be intimate have be dismiss from office before this last letter be write there have be a trial of strength between he and he enemy which he believe that he have win the confidence of loui himself reckon on turn to he own advantage by induce the king to dismiss those of he opponent who be in office to he astonishment he find that loui prefer dispense with he own service and the general voice be probably correct when it affirm that it be the queen who have induce he to come to that decision loménie de brienne archbishop of toulouse be again a candidate for the vacant post and de vermond be as diligent as on the previous occasion -lrb- 8 -rrb- in labor to return the obligation under which that prelate have formerly lay he by extol he ability and virtue to the queen and recommend he as a worthy successor to calonne whom she have never trust or like in reality the archbishop be wholly destitute of either ability or virtue he be notorious both for open profligacy and for avowed infidelity so much so that loui have refuse to transfer he to the diocese of pari on the ground that at least the archbishop of the metropolis ought to believe in god -lrb- 9 -rrb- but marie antoinette be ignorant of he character and believe de vermond 's assurance that the appointment of so high a ecclesiastic would propitiate the clergy whose opposition as many of she letter prove she think specially formidable and for whose support she know she husband to be nervously anxious some of calonne 's colleague strongly urge the king to re-appoint necker whose recall would have be highly popular with the nation but necker have recently give loui personal offense by publish a reply to some of calonne 's statement in defiance of the king 's express prohibition and have be banish from pari for the act and the queen recollect how he have formerly refuse to withdraw he resignation at she entreaty feel that she have no reason to expect any great consideration for the opinion or wish of either herself or the king from one so conceited and self-willed who would be likely to attribute he re-appointment not to the king 's voluntary choice but to he necessity : she therefore strongly press that the archbishop should be prefer in a unhappy moment she prevail -lrb- 10 -rrb- and on the 1st of may 1787 loménie de brienne be install in office with the title of chief of the council of finance a more unhappy choice could not possibly have be make the new minister be soon see to be as devoid of information and ability as he be know to be of honesty he have a certain gravity of outward demeanor which impose upon many and he have also the address to lead the conversation to point which he hearer understand still less than himself dilate on finance and the money market even to the lady of the court who have have some share in persuade the queen of he fitness for office -lrb- 11 -rrb- but he disposition be in reality as rash as that of calonne and it be a curious proof of he temerity as well as of he ignorance of the feeling of party in pari that though he know the notable to be friendly to he as indeed they would have be to any one who might have supersede calonne he dismiss they before the end of the month and the language hold on they dissolution both by the minister and by the president of the notable and which be cheerfully accept by the people be remarkable from the contrast which it afford to the feeling which sway the national council exactly two year afterward some measure of retrenchment which the notable have recommend have be adopt some reduction have be make in the royal household some costly ceremony have be abolish and one or two impost which have press with great severity on the poorer class have be extinguish or modify and not only do m lamoignon the keeper of the seal in the speech in which he dismiss they venture to affirm that these reduction would be find to have effect all that be need to restore universal prosperity to the kingdom but the president of the assembly in he reply thank god for have cause he to be bear in such a age under such a government and for have make he the subject of a king whom he be constrain to love and the thanksgiving be re-echoed by the whole assembly but this contentment do not last long the embarrassment of the treasury be too serious to be dissipate by soft speech the notable be hardly dissolve before the archbishop propose a new loan of a enormous amount and as he might have foresee they dissolution revive the pretension of the parliament the queen 's description of the rise of a french opposition at once receive a practical commentary the debate in the parliament become warmer than they have ever be since the day of the fronde : the citizen share in the excitement throng the palace of the parliament express they approval or disapproval of the different speaker by disorderly and unprecedented clamor the great majority hoot down the minister and he supporter and cheer those who speak against he the duc d'orléans by open bribe gain over many of the councilor to oppose the court in every thing the registration of several of the edict which the minister have send down be refuse and one member of the orleanist party even demand the convocation of the state - general formerly and constitutionally the great council of the nation but which have never be assemble since the time of richelieu the archbishop be sometimes angry and sometimes terrify and as weak in he anger as in he terror he persuade the king to hold a bed of justice to compel the registration of the edict when the parliament protest he banish it to troye in less than a month he become alarm at he own vigor and recall it encourage by he pusillanimity and more secure than ever of the support of the citizen who have be throw into consternation by he demand of a second loan nearly -lrb- 12 -rrb- six time as large as the first it become more audacious and defiant than ever d'orléans openly place himself at the head of the malcontent loménie persuade the king to banish the duke and to arrest one or two of he most vehement partisan and again in a few week repent of this act of decision also release the prisoner and recall the duke as a matter of course the parliament grow bolder still every measure which the minister propose be reject and under the guidance of one of they member duval d'esprémesnil the councilor at last proceed so far as to take the initiative in new legislation into they own hand in the first week in may 1788 they pass a series of resolution affirm that to be the law which indeed ought to have be so but which have certainly never be regard as such at any period of french history one declare that magistrate be irremovable except in case of misconduct another that the individual liberty and property of every citizen be inviolable other insist on the necessity of convoke the state - general as the only assembly entitle to impose tax and the councilor hope to secure the royal acceptance of these resolution by some previous vote which assert that of those law which be the very foundation of the constitution the first be that which assure the crown to the reign house and to its descendant in the male line in the order of primogeniture -lrb- 13 -rrb- but loui or rather he rash minister be not to be so conciliated and a scene ensue which be the first of the striking parallel which this period in france afford to the event which have take place in england a century and a half before as in 1642 charle i have attempt to arrest member of the english parliament in the very house of common so the archbishop now persuade loui to send down the captain of the guard the marquis d'agoust to the palace of the parliament to seize d'esprémesnil and another councilor name montsabert who have be one of he foremost supporter in the recent discussion they behave with admirable dignity marie antoinette be not one to betray she husband 's counsel as henrietta marium have betray those of charle d'esprémesnil and he friend wholly take by surprise have have no warning of what be design no time to withdraw nor in all probability would they have do so in any case when m d'agoust enter the council hall and demand he prisoner there be a great uproar the whole assembly make common cause with they two brethren who be thus threaten we be all d'esprémesnils and montsabert be they unanimous cry while the tumult at the door where a vast multitude be collect many of whom have arm in they hand and seem prepare to use they be more formidable still but d'agoust though courteous in the discharge of he duty be intrepid and firm and the two member voluntarily surrender themselves and retire in custody while the archbishop be so elated with he triumph that a few day afterwards he induce the king to venture on another imitation of the history of england though now it be not charle but the more tyrannical cromwell whose conduct be copy before the end of the month the governor of pari enter the palace of the parliament seize all the register and document of every kind lock the door and close they with the king 's seal and a royal edict be issue suspend all the parliament both in the capital and the province chapter xxii formidable riot take place in some province -- the archbishop invite necker to join he ministry -- letter of marie antoinette describe she interview with the archbishop and she view -- necker refuse -- the queen send message to necker -- the archbishop resign and necker become minister -- the queen 's view of he character -- general rejoicing -- defect in necker 's character -- he recall the parliament -- riot in paris -- severe winter -- general distress -- charity of the king and queen -- gratitude of the citizen -- the prince be concern in the libel publish against the queen -- preparation for the meeting of the state - general -- long disuse of that assembly -- need of reform -- vice of the old feudal system -- necker 's blunder in the arrangement for the meeting of the state -- a edict of the king concede the chief demand of the common -- view of the queen the whole kingdom be throw into great and dangerous excitement by these transaction little as be the benefit which the people have ever derive from the conduct of the parliament they opposition to the archbishop who have already have time to make himself generally hate and despise cause the councilor to be very generally regard as champion of liberty and in the most distant province in béarn in isère and in brittany public meeting -lrb- a thing hitherto unknown in the history of the nation -rrb- be hold remonstrance be draw up confederacy be form and oath be administer by which those who take they bind themselves never to surrender what they affirm to be the ancient privilege of the nation the archbishop become alarm a little perhaps for the nation and the king but far more for he own place which he have already contrived to render profitable to himself by the preferment which it have enable he to engross and in the hope of save it he now entreat necker to join the government propose to yield up the management of the finances to he and to retain only the post of prime minister a letter from the queen to mercy show that she acquiesce in the scheme she disapproval of necker 's past conduct be outweigh by she sense of the need which the state have of he financial talent though for reason which she explain she be unwilling wholly to sacrifice the archbishop and the letter have a further interest as display some of the difficulty which arise from the peculiar disposition of the king while every one be daily more and more learn to look upon she as the more important person in the government on the 19th of August 1783 she write to mercy -lrb- 1 -rrb- whom the archbishop have employ as he agent to conciliate the stubborn swiss banker : the archbishop come to I this morning immediately after he have see you to report to I the conversation which he have have with you i speak to he very frankly and be touch by what he say he be at this moment with the king to try and get he to decide but i very much fear that m necker will not accept while the archbishop remain the animosity of the public against he be push so far that m necker will be afraid of be compromise and indeed perhaps it might injure he credit but at the same time what be to be do in truth and conscience we can not sacrifice a man who have make for as all these sacrifice of he reputation of he position in the world perhaps even of he life for i fear they would kill he there be yet m foulon if m necker refuse absolutely -lrb- 2 -rrb- but i suspect he of be a very dishonest man and confidence would not be establish with he for comptroller i fear too that the public be press we to take a part much more humiliating for the minister and much more vexatious for ourselves inasmuch as we shall have do nothing of we own will i be very unhappy i will close my letter after i know the result of this evening 's conference i greatly fear the archbishop will be force to retire altogether and then what man be we to take to place at the head of the whole for we must have one especially with m necker he must have a bridle and the person who be above I -lrb- 3 -rrb- be not able to be such and i whatever people may say and whatever happen be never any thing but second and in spite of the confidence which the first have in I he often make I feel it the archbishop have just go the king be very unwilling and could only be bring to make up he mind by a promise that the person -lrb- 4 -rrb- should only be sound and that no positive engagement should be make necker refuse the next day mercy report to the queen that though the excitement be great it confine itself to denunciation of the archbishop and of the keeper of the seal and that the name of the queen have never once be mention and on the 22d marie antoinette -lrb- 5 -rrb- from a conviction of the greatness of the emergency determine to see necker herself and employ the embassador and de vermond to let he know that she own wish for he restoration to the direction of the finances be sincere and earnest and to promise he that the archbishop should not interfere in that department in any way whatever two day later -lrb- 6 -rrb- she write again to mention that the king have vanquish he repugnance to necker and have come wholly over to she opinion time press and it be more essential than ever that necker should accept and on the 25th she write a final letter to report to mercy that the archbishop have resign and that she have just summon necker to come to she the next morning though she feel that she have do what be both right and indispensable she be not without misgiving if she write in a strain of anxious despondency very foreign to she usual tone and which show how deeply she feel the importance of the crisis and of every step that might be take -- if he will but undertake the task it be the best thing that can be do but i tremble -lrb- excuse my weakness -rrb- at the fact that it be i who have bring he back it be my fate to bring misfortune and if infernal machination should cause he once more to fail or if he should lower the authority of the king they will hate I still more in one point of view she need not have tremble at be know to have cause necker 's re-appointment since it be plain that no other nomination be possible vergenne have die a few month before and the whole kingdom do not supply a single statesman of reputation except necker nor could any choice have for the moment be more universally popular the citizen illuminate pari the mob burn the archbishop in effigy and the lead merchant and banker show they approval in a far more practical way the fund rise loan to any amount be freely offer to the treasury the national credit revive as if the solvency or insolvency of the nation depend on a single man and he a foreigner yet if regard in any point of view except that of a financier he be extremely unfit to be the minister at such a crisis and the queen 's acuteness have in the extract from she letter which have be quote above correctly point out the danger to be apprehend namely that he might lower the authority of the king -lrb- 7 -rrb- it be in fact to he uniform and persistent degradation of the king 's authority that the greater part if not the whole of the evil which ensue may be clearly trace and the cause that lead he to adopt this fatal system be thoroughly visible to one gifted with such intuitive penetration into character as marie antoinette for he have two great defect or weakness a overweening vanity which as it be value applause above every thing lead he to regard the popularity which they might win for he as the natural motive and the surest test of he action and a abstract belief in human perfection and in the submission of all class to strict reason which could only proceed from a total ignorance of mankind -lrb- 8 -rrb- yet greatly as financial skill be need if the kingdom be to be save from the bankruptcy which seem to be imminent it be plain that a faculty for organization and legislation be no less indispensable if the vessel of the state be to be steer safely along the course on which it be enter for the archbishop 's last act have be to induce the king to promise to convoke the states-general the 1st of may of the ensue year be fix for they meeting and the arrangement for and the management of a assembly which as not have meet for nearly two hundred year could not fail to present many of the feature of a entire novelty be a task which would have severely test the most statesman-like capacity but unhappily necker 's very first act show he equally void of resolution and of sagacity he be not only unable to estimate the probable conduct of the people in future but he show himself incapable of profit by the experience of the past and in spite of the insubordinate spirit which the parliament have at all time display he at once recall they in deference to the clamor of the parisian citizen and allow they to enter pari in a triumphal procession as if he very object have be to parade they victory over the king 's authority they return be the signal for a renewal of riot which assume a more formidable character than ever the police and even the guardhouse be attack in open day and the government have reason to suspect that the money which be employ in foment the tumult be supply by the duc d'orléans a fierce mob traverse the street at night terrifying the peaceable inhabitant with shout of triumph over the king as have be compel to recall the parliament against he will while those who be suppose to be adverse to the pretension of the councilor be insult in the street and brand as royalist the first time in the history of the nation that ever that name have be use as a term of reproach yet presently the whole body of citizen with they habitual impulsive facility of temper again for a while become royalist the winter be one of unprecedented severity by the beginning of December the seine be freeze over and the whole adjacent country be bury in deep snow wolf from the neighbor forest desperate with hunger be say to have make they way into the suburb and to have attack people in the street food of every kind become scarce and of the poorer class many be believe to have die of actual starvation necker as head of the government make energetic and judicious effort to relieve the universal distress form magazine in different district facilitate the means of transport finding employment for vast number of laborer and artisan and purchase large quantity of grain in foreign country and not only be loui and marie antoinette conspicuous for the unstinting liberality with which they devote they own fund to the supply of the necessity of the destitute but the queen in many case of unusual or press suffer that be report to she in versaille and the neighbor village send trustworthy person to investigate they and in numerous instance go herself to the cottage make personal inquiry into the condition of the occupant and show not only a feeling heart but a considerate and active kindness which double the value of she benefaction by the gracious thoughtful manner in which they be bestow she would willingly have do the good she do in secret partly from she constant feeling that charity be not charity if it be boast of partly from a fear that those ready to misconstrue all she act would find pretext for evil and calumny even in she bounty one of she good deed strike necker as of so remarkable a character that he press she to allow he to make it know be sure on the contrary she reply that you never mention it what good could it do they would not believe you -lrb- 9 -rrb- but in this she be mistaken she charity be too widely spread to escape the knowledge even of those who do not profit by they and they have they reward though it be but a short-lived one though the majority of she act of personal kindness be perform in versaille rather than in paris the parisian be as vehement in they gratitude as the versaillese and it find a somewhat fantastic vent in the erection of pyramid and obelisk of snow in different quarter of the city all bear inscription testify the citizen ' sense of she benevolence one which far exceed all its fellow in size -- the chief beauty of work of that sort -- since it be fifteen foot high and each of the four face be twelve foot wide at the base be decorate with a medallion of the royal pair and bear a poetical inscription commemorate the cause of its erection : reine dont la beauté surpasse les appas près d'un rous bienfaisant occupe ici la place si ce monument frêle est de neige et de glace nos coeurs pour tous ne le sont pas de ce monument san exemple couple auguste l'aspect bien doux pur votre coeur san doute vous plaira plus qu'un palai qu'un temple que vous élèverait un peuple adulateur -lrb- 10 -rrb- neither the queen 's feeling nor she conduct have be in any way altered but six month later the same populace who raise this monument and applaud these verse be with ferocious and obscene threat clamor for she blood and there be hardly any thing more strange or more grievous in the history of the nation hardly any greater proof of that incurable levity which be one great cause of the long series of misery which soon fall upon it than that the impression of gratitude which be so vivid at the moment and so constantly revive by the queen 's untiring benevolence could yet be so easily efface by the act of demagogue and libeler whom the people thoroughly despise even while suffer themselves to be lead by they how great a part in these libel be bear by those who be bind by every tie of blood to the king to be he warmest supporter we have a remarkable proof in a edict of council which be issue during the ministry of the archbishop and which deprive the palace of the count de provence the count d'artoi and the duc d'orléans of they usual exemption from the investigation of the syndic of the library as those officer be call whose duty it be to search all suspect place for libelous or seditious pamphlet the reason publicly give for this edict be that the dwelling of these three prince be a perfect arsenal for the issue of publication contrary to the law to morality and to religion -lrb- 11 -rrb- with the return of spring the severity of the distress begin to pass away but even while it last it scarcely divert the attention of the middle class from the preparation for the approach meeting of the states-general from which the whole people with few exception promise themselves great advantage though comparatively few have form any precise notion of the benefit which they expect or of the mode in which they be to be attain the states-general have be originally establish in the same age which see the organization of we own parliament with very nearly the same power though the member have more of the narrower character of delegate of they constituent than be the case in england where they be more wisely regard as representative of the entire nation -lrb- 12 -rrb- and it be a acknowledged principle of they constitution that they could neither propose any measure nor ask for the redress of any grievance which be not expressly mention in the instruction with which they constituent furnish they at the time of they election in england the two house of parliament by a vigilant and systematic perseverance have gradually extort from the sovereign a great and progressive enlargement of they original power till they have almost engross the entire legislative authority in the kingdom but in france a variety of circumstance have prevent the states-general from arrive at a similar development and consequently as in human affair very little be stationary they authority have steadily diminish instead of increase till they have become so powerless and utterly insignificant that since the year 1615 they have never once be convene not only have they be wholly disused but they seem to have be wholly forget during the last two reign no one have ever mention they name much less have any wish be express for they resuscitation till the financial difficulty of the government and the general and grow discontent of the great majority of the nation with which since the death of turgot every successive minister have be manifestly incompetent to deal have as we have see lead some ardent reformer to demand they restoration as the one expedient which have not be try and which therefore have this in its favor that it be not condemn by previous failure that great reform be indispensable be admit in every quarter there be no country in europe where the feudal system have receive so little modification -lrb- 13 -rrb- every law seem to have be make and every custom to have be establish for the exclusive benefit of the noble they be even exempt from many of the tax a exemption which be the more intolerable from the vast number of person who be include in the list practically it may be say that there be two class of noble -- the old historic house as they be sometimes call such as the grammont or montmorency which be not numerous and many of which have greatly decay in wealth and influence and a inferior class whose nobility be derive from they possession of office under the crown in any part of the kingdom even tax-gatherer and surveyor if appoint by royal warrant could claim the rank and new office be continually be create and sell which confer the same title those so ennobled be not reckon the equal of the higher class they could not even be receive at court until they patent be four hundred year old but they have a right to vote as noble at election to any representative body those whose patent be twenty-four year old could be elect as representative and from the moment of they creation they all enjoy great exemption so that as the lowest estimate reckon they number at a hundred thousand it be a matter for some wonder how the tax to which they do not contribute produce any thing worth collect it be of course manifest that the exemption enormously increase the burden to be bear by the class which do not enjoy such privilege but heavy as the grievance of these exemption be it be as nothing when compare with the feudal rights claim by the greater noble the peasant on they estate be force to grind they corn at the lord 's mill to press they grape at he wine-press pay for such act whatever price he might think fit to exact and often have they crop wholly waste or spoil by the delay which such a system engender the game-law forbid they to weed they field lest they should disturb the young partridge or leveret to manure the soil with any thing which might injure they flavor or even to mow or reap till the grass or corn be no longer require as shelter for the young covey some of the rights of seigniory as it be call be such as can hardly be mention in this more decorous age some be so ridiculous that it be inconceivable how they very absurdity have not lead to they abolition in the marshy district of brittany one right enjoy by the great noble be the silence of the frog -lrb- 14 -rrb- which whenever the lady be confine bind the peasant to spend they day and night in beat the swamp with long pole to save she from be disturb by they inharmonious croaking and if this or any other feudal right be dispense with it be only commute for a money payment which be little less burdensome the power exercise by the crown be more intolerable still the sovereign be absolute master of the liberty of he subject without allege the commission of any crime he could issue warrant -- letter under seal as they be call -- which consign the person name in they to imprisonment which be often perpetual the unhappy prisoner have no power of appeal no judge could inquire into he case much less release he the arrest be often make with such secrecy and rapidity that he nearest relation know not what have become of he but he be cut off from the outer world for the rest of he life as completely as if he have at once be hand over to the executioner -lrb- 15 -rrb- it be impossible but that such custom should produce general discontent and a resolute demand for a complete reformation of the system and one of the problem which the minister have to determine be how to organize the states-general so that they should be dispose to promote such measure as reform as should be adequate without be excessive as should give due protection to the middle and lower class without deprive the noble of that dignity and authority which be not only desirable for themselves but useful to they dependent and lastly such as should carefully preserve the rightful prerogative of the crown while put a end to those arbitrary power the existence of which be incompatible with the very name of freedom in make the necessary arrangement the long disuse of the assembly be a circumstance greatly in favor of the government if necker have have skill to avail himself of it since it wholly free he from the obligation of be guide by former precedent those arrangement be long and warmly debate in the king 's council though the record of former session have be so carelessly preserve that little be know of they proceedings it seem to be establish that the representative of the common have usually amount to about four-tenth of the whole body those of the clergy and of the noble be each about three-tenths and that they have almost invariably deliberate and vote in separate chamber and the prince and the chief noble present memorial to the king in which they almost unanimously recommend a adherence to these ancient form while with patriotic prudence they seek to obviate all jealousy of they own pretension or view which might be entertain or feign in any quarter by announce they willingness to abandon all the exclusive privilege and exemption which they have hitherto possess and which be notoriously one chief cause of the generally prevail discontent but the party which have originate the clamor for the states-general now encourage by they success put forward two fresh demand the first that the number of the representative of the common should equal that of both the other order put together which they call the duplication of the third estate the second that the three order should meet and vote as one unite body in one chamber the two proposition take together be manifestly calculate and design to throw the whole power into the hand of the common necker have great doubt about the propriety and safety of the first proposal and no doubt at all of the danger of the second he own judgment be that the wisest plan would be to order the clergy and noble to unite in a upper chamber so as in some degree to resemble the british house of lord while the third estate in a lower chamber would be a tolerably faithful copy of we house of common but he could never bring himself to risk he popularity by oppose what he regard as the opinion of the mass he be alarm by the political club which be spring up in paris one whose president be the duc d'orléans assume the significant and menacing title of les enragés -lrb- 16 -rrb- and by the vast number of pamphlet which be circulate both in the capital and the chief town of the province by thousand -lrb- 17 -rrb- every writer of which put himself forward as a legislator -lrb- 18 -rrb- and of which the vast majority advocate what they call the rights of the third estate in most violent language and finally he adopt the course which be a great favorite with vain and weak man and which he probably represent to himself as a compromise between unqualified concession and unyielding resistance though every one possess of the slightest penetration could see that it practically surrender both point : he advise the king to issue he edict that the number of representative to be return to the states-general should be twelve hundred half of whom be to be return by the common a quarter by the clergy and a quarter by the noble -lrb- 19 -rrb- and to postpone the decision as to the number of the chamber till the assembly should meet when he propose to allow the state themselves to determine it trust against all probability that after have thus give the common the power to enforce they own view he should be able to persuade they to abandon the same in deference to he judgment loui as a matter of course adopt he advice and after several different town -- bloi tour cambraus and compiègne among they -- have be propose as the place of meeting he himself decide in favor of versaille -lrb- 20 -rrb- as that which would afford he the best hunting while the session last the queen in she heart disapprove of every one of these resolution she see that necker have as she have forebode sacrifice the king 's authority by he advice on the two first question and she perceive more clearly than any one the danger of fix the state - general so near to pari that the turbulent population of the city should be able to overawe the member she press these consideration earnestly on the king -lrb- 21 -rrb- but it be characteristic of the course which she prescribe to herself from the beginning and from which she never swerve that when she advice be overrule she invariably defend the course which have be take she language when any one speak to she either of she own opinion and wish or of the feeling with which the different class of the nation regard she be invariably the same you be not to think of I for a moment all that i desire of you be to take care that the respect which be due to the king shall not be weaken -lrb- 22 -rrb- and it be only she most intimate friend who know how unwise she think the different decision that have be adopt or how deep be she foreboding of evil chapter xxiii the reveillon riot -- opening of the states-general -- the queen be insult by the partisan of the duc d'orléans -- discussion as to the number of chamber -- career and character of mirabeau -- necker reject he support -- he determine to revenge himself -- death of the dauphin the meeting of the states-general as have be already see be fix for the 4th of may 1789 and as if it be fate that the bloody character of the period now to be inaugurate should be display from the very outset the election for the city of pari which be only hold in the precede week be stain with a riot so formidable as to be commonly speak of in the record of the time as a insurrection -lrb- 1 -rrb- one of the candidate for the representation of the third estate be a paper-maker of the name of reveillon a man eminent for he charity and general liberality but one who be believe to regard the view of the extreme reformer with disfavor he be so popular with he own workman who be very numerous and with they friend who know he character from they that he be generally expect to succeed the opposite party who have candidate of they own and have the support of the purse of the duc d'orléans be determine that he should not and no way seem so sure as to murder he band of ferocious-looking ruffian be bring in from the country district arm with heavy bludgeon and as be afterward learn well supply with money and on the morning of the 28th of April news be bring to the baron de besenval the commander of the royal guard that a mob of several thousand man have collect in the street who have read a mock sentence profess to have be pass by the third estate which condemn reveillon to be hang after which they have burn he in effigy and then attack he house which they be sack and destroy they even venture to attack the first company of soldier whom de besenval send to the rescue and it be not till he dispatch a battalion with a couple of field-piece to the spot that the plunderer be expel from the house and the riot be quell nearly five hundred of the mob be kill but when the parliament proceed to set on foot a judicial inquiry into the cause of the tumult necker prevail on the secretary of state to suppress the investigation as he fear to exasperate d'orléans further by give publicity to he machination which he do not yet suspect either the extent or the object -lrb- 2 -rrb- a momentary tranquility be however restore at pari and all eye be turn from the capital to versaille where the first few day of may be devote to the reception of the states-general by the king and queen ceremony which might have have a good effect since the bitterest adversary of the court be favorably impress by the grace and affability of the queen but which many shrewd judge afterward believe to have have a contrary influence from the offense take by the representative of the common at some of the detail of the ancient etiquette which on so solemn a occasion be revive in all its stately strictness the dignitary of the church wear they most sumptuous robe the noble glitter with silk and gold lace jeweled clasp fasten plume of feather in they hat order glitter on they breast and many a precious stone sparkle in the hilt of they sword the representative of the common be allow neither feather nor embroidery nor sword but be force to content themselves with plain black cloak and a unadorned homeliness of attire which seem as if intend to exclude all idea of they be the equal of those other order of which they have for a moment become the colleague and in a similar spirit it be arrange that after the folding-door of the saloon in which the sovereign be await they be throw wide open to admit the representative of the higher order the common be let in through a side door and though in the eye of person habituate to the ceremonious nicety of court life these distinction seem matter of course and as such unworthy of notice it can hardly be wonder at if they be galling to man accustom only to the simpler manners of a provincial town and who proud of they new position and deeply impressed with its importance fancy they see in they a settle intention to degrade both they and they constituent by thus stamp they with a badge of inferiority before all the spectator the opening of the states-general be fix for the 5th of may and on the day before which be Sunday a solemn mass be perform at the principal church in versaille that of notre dame after which the congregation proceed to another church that of st loui to hear a sermon from the bishop of nancy it be a stately procession that move from one church to the other and it be afterward remember as the very last in which the royal pair appear before they subject with the undiminished magnificence of ancient ceremony first after a splendid escort of troops come the member of the state in they several order then the king march by himself the queen follow and behind she come the prince and princess of the royal family of the blood the officer of state and of the household and company of the body-guard bring up the rear the acclamation of the spectator be loud as the deputy of the state and especially as the representative of the common pass on loud too as the king move forward bear himself with unusual dignity but when the queen advance though still the main body of the people cheer with sincere respect a gang of ruffian among whom be several woman -lrb- 3 -rrb- shout out long live the duke of orléans in she ear with so menace a accent that she nearly faint with terror by a strong mastery over herself she shake off the agitation which be only perceive by she immediate attendant but the disloyal feeling thus show toward she at the outset be a sad omen of the spirit in which one party at least be prepare to view the measure of the government and so far as she be concern of the degree in which she enemy have succeed in poisoning the mind of the people against she as the person whose resistance to they meditate encroachment on the royal authority be likely to prove the most formidable it be a significant hint too of the project already form by the worthless prince whose adherent these ruffian proclaim themselves the duc d'orléans conceive himself to have lately receive a fresh provocation and a additional motive for revenge he eldest son the duc de chartre -lrb- 4 -rrb- be now a boy of sixteen and he have propose to the king to give he madame royale in marriage a idea which the queen who hold he character in deserve abhorrence have reject with very decide mark of displeasure he be also stimulate by view of personal ambition the history of england have be recently study by many person in france besides the king and queen and there be not want adviser to point out to the duke that the revolution which have take place in england exactly a century before have owe its success to the dethronement of the reign sovereign and the substitution of another member of the royal family in he place as william of orange be after the king 's own child the next heir to jame ii so be the duc d'orléans now the next heir after the king 's child and brother to loui xvi and for the next five month there can be no doubt that he and he partisan who number in they body some of the most influential member of the state - general keep constantly in view the hope of place he on the throne from which they be to depose he cousin the next day the state be formally open by loui in person the place of meeting be a spacious hall which two year before have be use for the meeting of the notable it have be the scene of many a splendid spectacle in time past but have never before witness so impose or momentous a ceremony the town itself have not rise into notice till the memory of the precede states-general have almost pass away and now after all the deputy have range themselves to receive they sovereign the representative of the clergy on the right of the throne the noble on the leave the common in denser mass at the bottom of the hall -lrb- 5 -rrb- as the king accompany by the queen lead two of she child -lrb- 6 -rrb- by the hand and attend by all the prince of the royal family and of the blood by the duke and peer of the kingdom the minister and great officer of state enter and take he seat on the throne the most unimpassioned spectator must have feel that he be behold a scene at once magnificent and solemn and one from long desuetude as novel as if it have be wholly unprecedented such as might well inaugurate a new policy or a new constitution could those who behold it as spectator could those who bear a part in the solemnity have look into futurity could they have divine that no other hall would ever again see that virtuous and beneficent king surround with that pomp or receive with that reverential homage which be now pay to he as as unquestioned right nay that the end of which this day be the beginning scarcely one single person of all those now present whether man in the flower of they strength woman in the pride of they beauty or even child in they infantine innocence and grace would live to behold but that sovereign and subject be destine almost without exception to perish with circumstance of unutterable unimaginable horror and misery as the direct consequence of this day 's pageant we may well believe that the most sanguine of those who now greet it with eager hope and exultation would rather have avert he eye from the ill-omened spectacle and would have prefer to bear the worst evil of which he be anticipate the abolition to bring on he country the calamity which be about to fall upon it a large state arm-chair a little lower than the throne have be set beside it for the queen the prince and princess be range on each side on a row of chair without arm and when all have take they place the king open the session with a short speech leave the real business to be unfold at greater length by he minister in order to feel assure of the proper emphasis and expression he have rehearse he speech frequently to the queen and as he now deliver it with unusual dignity and gracefulness it be receive with frequent acclamation though some of those who be watch all that pass with the greatest anxiety fancy that one or two compliment to the queen which it contain meet with a colder response while at its close the representative of the third estate give a indication of they feeling toward the other order and provoke a display on they part which promise little cordiality to they deliberation the king who have uncover himself while speak on resume he seat replace he hat the noble accord to the ancient etiquette replace theirs and many of the common at once assert they equality with they by also cover themselves such a assumption be a breach of all establish custom the noble be indignant and with angry shout demand the removal of the common ' hat they be meet with louder clamor by the common and in a moment the whole hall be in a uproar which be only allay by the presence of mind of loui himself who as if oppress by the heat lay aside he own hat when as a matter of course the noble follow he example the deputy of the common do the same and peace be restore the king 's speech be follow by another short one from the keeper of the seal which receive but little attention and by one of prodigious length from necker which be equally injudicious and unacceptable to he hearer both in what it say and in what it omit he never mention the question of constitutional reform he say nothing of what the common at least thought still more important -- the number of chamber in which the member be to meet and though he dilate at the most profuse length on the condition of the finances and on he own success in re-establish public credit they be by no means pleased to hear he assert that success have remove any absolute necessity for they meeting at all and that they have only be call together in fulfillment of the king 's promise that so the sovereign might establish a better harmony between the different part of the constitution before any business could be proceed with it be necessary for the member to have the writ of they election properly certify and register for which they be to meet on the follow day we need not here detail the artifice and assumption by which the member of the third estate put forward pretension which be design to make they master of the whole assembly nor be it necessary to unfold at length the combination of audacity and craft aid by the culpable weakness of necker by which they ultimately carry the point they contend for provide that the three order should deliberate and vote together as one unite body in one chamber embolden by they success they even proceed to a step which probably not one among they have originally contemplate and as if one of they principal object have be to disown the authority of the king by which they have be call together they repudiate the title of states-general and invent for themselves a new name that of the national assembly which as it have never be hear of before seem to mark that they owe they existence to the nation and not to the sovereign but the discussion that take place before all these point be settle present besides the importance of the conclusion which be adopt another feature of powerful interest since it be in they that the member first hear the voice of the count de mirabeau who more than any other deputy be suppose during the ensue year to be able to sway the whole assembly and to hold the destiny of the nation in he hand necker 's daughter the celebrated baroness de staël wife of the swedish embassador who be present at the opening of the state which as she father 's daughter she regard with exult confidence as the body of legislator who be to regenerate the nation remark as the long procession pass before she eye that of the six hundred deputy of the common -lrb- 7 -rrb- the count de mirabeau alone bear a name which be previously know and he be manifestly out of he place as a representative of the common he history be a strange one he be the eldest son of a provençal noble of italian origin great wealth and a ferocious eccentricity of character which make he one of the worst possible instructor for a youth of brilliant talent unbridled passion and a disposition equally impetuous in its pursuit of good and of evil even before he arrive at manhood he have become notorious for every kind of profligacy while he father in a almost equal degree provoke the censure of those who interested themselves in the career of a youth of undeniable ability by punishment of such severity as wear the appearance of vengeance rather than of fatherly correction in six or seven year he obtain no fewer than fifteen warrant or letter under seal for the imprisonment of he son in different jail or fortress while the young man seem to take a wanton pleasure in show how completely all effort for he reformation be throw away though unusually ugly -lrb- he himself compare he face to that of a tiger who have have the small-pox -rrb- he be irresistible among woman while one of the youngest subaltern in the army he make love rarely without success to the mistress or wife of he superior officer and fight duel after duel with those who take offense at he gallantry from one castle in which he be imprison he be aid to escape by the wife of a officer of the garrison who accompany he flight from another he be deliver by the love of a lady of the highest rank the marchioness de monnier whom he have meet at the governor 's table when after some year of misery the marchioness terminate they by suicide he seduce a nun of exquisite beauty to leave she convent for he sake and as france be no longer a safe residence for they he flee to frederick of prussium who equally glad to welcome he as a frenchman a genius and a profligate receive he for a while into high favor but he be penniless and frederick be never liberal of he money debt soon drive he from prussium and he retire to england where he make acquaintance with fox fitzpatrick and other man of mark in the political circle of the day he be at all time and amidst all he excess both observant and studious and while witness in person the strife of party in this country he learn to appreciate the excellency of we constitution both in its theory and in its practical working but presently debt drive he from london as it have drive he from berlin and after take refuge for a short time in holland and switzerland he be hesitate whither next to betake himself when hearing of the election for the states-general he resolve to offer himself as a candidate and return to provence to seek the suffrage of the noble of he own county unluckily he character be too well know in he native district and the noble unwilling to countenance the ambition of one who have obtain so evil a notoriety reject he full of indignation he turn to the third estate offering himself as a representative of the common in he speech to the citizen of aix and marseille -- for he canvass both town -- he inveigh against necker and the government with a eloquence which electrify he audience who have never before be address in the language of independence he be return for both town and hasten to versaille eager to avenge on the noble the body which as he feel he have a right to have represent the affront which have drive he against he will to seek the vote of a class with which he have scarcely a feeling in common for in the whole assembly there be no man less of a democrat in he heart or prouder of he ancestry and aristocratic privilege he differ from most of he colleague inasmuch as he from the first have distinct view of the policy desirable for the nation which he conceive to be the establishment of a limited constitutional monarchy such as he have see in england -lrb- 8 -rrb- but no man in the whole assembly be more inconsistent as he be ever change he view or at least he conduct and language at the dictate of interest or wounded pride sometimes as it might seem in the mere wantonness of genius as if he wish to show that he could lead the assembly with equal ease to take a course or to retrace its step -- that it rest with he alone alike to do or to undo the only object from which he never depart be that of make all party feel and bow to he influence and it be this very inconsistency which so especially connect he career for the rest of he life with the fortune of the queen since while he misunderstand she character and fear she power with the king and minister as likely to be exert in opposition to he own view he be the most ferocious and most foul of she enemy : when he see that she be willing to accept he aid and when he therefore begin to conceive a hope of make she useful to himself in the prosecution of he design no man be louder in she praise nor it must be admit more energetic or more judicious in the advice which he give she he language on the first occasion on which he make he voice hear in the assembly be eminently characteristic of he so manifestly be it direct to the attainment of he own object -- that of make himself necessary to the court and obtain either office or some pension which might enable he to live since he own resource have long be exhaust by he extravagance d'espresménil have strongly advocate the doctrine that the meeting of the three order in separate chamber be a fundamental principle of the monarchy and mirabeau in opposition to he move a address to the king which represent the third estate as desirous to ally itself with the throne so as to enable it to resist the pretension of the clergy and the noble and as this speech of he produce no overture from the minister in the middle of June he make a direct offer to necker to support the government if necker have any plan at all which be in the least reasonable -lrb- 9 -rrb- and he give proof of he sincerity by vigorously oppose some proposal of the extreme reformer but with incredible folly necker reject he support treat he argument to he face as insignificant and affirm that they view be irreconcilable since mirabeau wish to govern by policy while he himself prefer morality he at once resolve to revenge himself on the minister who have thus slight he -lrb- 10 -rrb- and he be not long in find a opportunity on the 23d of June after the state have assume they new form and loui at a royal sit have announce the reform he have resolve to grant and which be so complete that the most extreme reformer admit that they could have wish for nothing more except that they should themselves have take they and that the king should not have give they mirabeau take the lead in throw down a defiance to he sovereign refusing to consent to the adjournment of the assembly as be natural on the withdrawal of the king and declare that they the member of the common would not quit the hall unless they be expel by bayonet but violently as versaille and pari be agitate throughout may and June marie antoinette take no part in the discussion which these question excite she have a still graver trouble at home she eldest son the dauphin whose birth have be greet so enthusiastically by all class have as we have see long be sickly since the beginning of the year he health have be grow worse and on the 4th of June he die and though he bereaved mother bear up bravely under he loss she feel it deeply and for a time be almost incapacitate from turn she attention to any other subject chapter xxiv troops be bring up from the frontier -- the assembly petition the king to withdraw they -- he refuse -- he dismiss necker -- the baron de breteuil be appoint prime minister -- terrible riot in paris -- the tri-color flag be adopt -- storm of the bastile and murder of the governor -- the count d'artoi and other prince fly from the kingdom -- the king recall necker -- withdraw the soldier and visit pari -- formation of the national guard-insolence of la fayette and bailly -- madame de tourzel become governess of the royal child -- letter of marie antoinette on they character and on she own view of education but even so solemn a grief as that for a dead child she be not suffer to indulge long even for such a purpose royalty be not always allow the respite which would be concede to those in a more moderate station and affair in pari begin to assume so menacing a character that she be force to rouse herself to support she husband demagogue in paris excite the lower class of the citizen to formidable tumult the troops be tamper with they mutiny and when the assembly so violate its duty as to take the mutineer under its protection and to intercede with the king for they pardon loui or as we should probably say necker do not venture to refuse though it be plain that the condign punishment of such a offense be indispensable to the maintenance of discipline for the future and loui feel the humiliation so deeply that some of those about he the count d'artoi take the lead in that party be able to induce he to bring up from the frontier some german and swiss regiment which as not have be expose to the contagion of the capital be free from the prevail taint of disloyalty but loui be incapable of carry out any plan resolutely he select the commander with judgment place the troops under the order of a veteran of the seven year ' war the old marshal de broglie who though more than seventy year of age gladly bring once more he try skill and valor to the service of he sovereign but the king even while intrust he with this command disarm he at the same moment by a strict order to avoid all bloodshed and violence though nothing could be more obvious than that such outbreak as the marshal be likely to be call on to suppress could not be quell by gentle mean the orleanist and mirabeau probably know nothing of this humane or rather pusillanimous order though most of the secret of the court be betray to they but mirabeau saw in the arrival of the soldier a fresh opportunity of make the king feel the folly of the minister in reject he advance and in a speech of unusual power he thunder against those who have advise the bringing-up of troops as he declare to overawe the assembly though in fact nothing but they presence and active exertion could prevent the assembly from be overawe by the mob but undoubtedly at this time he own first object be to use the populace of pari to terrify the member into obedience to himself in one of he end he succeed he drive necker from office he carry the address which he propose to entreat the king to withdraw the troops but loui have for the moment resolve on adopt bolder counsel than those of necker he decline to comply with the petition declare that it be he duty to keep in paris a force sufficient to preserve the public tranquillity though if the assembly be disquiet by they neighborhood he express he unwillingness to remove they session to some more distant town and at the same time he dismiss necker from office banish he from france but order he to keep he departure secret the queen have evidently have great influence in bring he to this decision but how cordially she approve of all the concession which the king have already make and how clearly she see that more still remain to be do before the necessary reformation could be pronounced complete the letter which on the evening of necker 's dismissal she write to madame de polignac convincingly prove she have high idea of the authority which a king be legitimately entitle to exercise and to what she regard as undue restriction on it injurious to he dignity she would never consent she probably regard they as abstract question which have but little bearing on the substantial welfare of the people in general but of all measure to increase the happiness of all class even of the very lowest she be throughout the warmest advocate July 11th 1789 i can not sleep my dear heart without let you know that m necker be go mm de breteuil and de la vauguyon will be summon to the council to-morrow god grant that we may at last be able to do all the good with which we be wholly occupy the moment will be terrible but i have courage and provide that the honest folk support we without expose themselves needlessly i think that i have vigor enough in myself to impart some to other but it be more than ever necessary to bear in mind that all class of man so long as they be honest be equally we subject and to know how to distinguish those who be right-thinking in every district and in every rank my god if people could only believe that these be my real thought perhaps they would love I a little but i must not think of myself the glory of the king that of he son and the happiness of this ungrateful nation be all that i can all that i ought to wish for for as for you friendship my dear heart i reckon on that always such language and sentiment be worthy of a sovereign that the feeling here express be genuine and sincere the whole life of the writer be a standing proof and yet already fierce wicked spirit even of woman -lrb- for never be it more clearly see than in france at this time how far when woman be cruel they exceed the worst of man in ferocity -rrb- be thirst for she blood already a woman in education and ability far above the lowest class one whose energy afterward raise she to be if not the avowed head at least the move spirit of a numerous party -lrb- madame roland -rrb- be urge the public prosecution or if the nation be not ripe for such a formal outrage the secret assassination of both king and queen -lrb- 1 -rrb- but however benevolent and patriotic be the queen 's intention it become instantly evident that those who have counsel the dismissal of necker have give they advice in entire ignorance of the hold which he have establish on the affection of the parisian while the new prime minister the baron de breteuil whose previous office have connect he with the police be on that account very unpopular with a class which be very numerous in all large city the populace of pari break out at once in riot which amount to insurrection thousand of citizen not all of the lowest class decorate with green cockade the color of necker 's livery and arm with every variety of weapon parade the street bear aloft bust of necker and the duc d'orléans without stop in they madness to consider how incongruous a combination they be present the most ridiculous story be circulate about the queen : it be affirm that she have cause the hall of the assembly to be undermine that she might blow it up with gunpowder -lrb- 2 -rrb- and by way of avert or avenge so atrocious a act the mob begin to set fire to house in different quarter of the city grow bolder at the sight of they own violence they break open the prison and thus obtain a re-enforcement of hundred of desperado ripe for any wickedness the troops be paralyze by loui 's imbecile order to avoid bloodshed and in the same proportion the rioter be encourage by they inaction and evident helplessness they attack the great armory and equip themselves with its contents apply to the basest use time-honored weapon monument of ancient valor and patriotism the spear with which dunoi have clear he country of the british invader the sword with which the first bourbon king have route egmont 's cavalry at ivry be tear down from the wall to arm the vilest of mankind for rapine and slaughter they storm the hôtel de ville and get possession of the municipal chest contain three million of franc and now more and more intoxicate with they triumph and with the evidence which all these exploit afford that the whole city be at they mercy they proceed to give they riot a regular organization by establish a committee to sit in the guildhall and direct they future proceedings lawless and ferocious as be the main body of the rioter there be shrewd head to guide they fury and the very first order issue by this committee be mark by such acute foresight and such a skillful adaptation to the requirement of the moment and the humor of the people that it remain in force to this day it be hardly strange that man in open insurrection against the king 's authority should turn they wrath against one of its conspicuous emblem consecrate though it be by usage of immemorial antiquity and by many a heroic achievement -- the snow-white banner bear the golden lily but that glorious ensign could not be lay aside till another be substitute for it and the color of the city red and blue and white the color of the army be now blended together to form the tricolor flag which have since win for itself a wider renown than even the deed of bayard or turenne have shed upon the lily and with which under every form of government the nation have permanently identify itself they demand more man and a committee with three million of franc could easily command recruit they storm the hôtel des invalides where thousand of musket be keep fit for instant use one division of regular troops whose commander the baron de besenval be a resolute man determine to do he duty mutiny against he order and refuse to fire on the mob they take possession of the city gate and think themselves now strong enough for any exploit on the third day of the insurrection the 14th of July they march in overpower force to attack the bastile in former time the bastile have be the great fortress of the city and as such it have be fortify with all the resource of the engineer 's art massive well-armed tower rise at numerous point above wall of great height and solidity a deep fosse surround it and when well supply and garrison it have be regard with pride by the citizen as a bulwark capable of defy the utmost effort of a foreign enemy and not the less to be admire because they never expect it to be expose to such a test but as a warlike fortress it have long be disuse in recent time it have only be know as the state-prison identify more than any other with the worst act of despotism and barbarity as such it be now as much detest as it have formerly be respect and it have nothing but the outward appearance of strength to resist a attack evidently the military authority have never anticipate the possibility that the mob would rise to such a height of audacity but the rioter be now encourage by two day of unbroken success and those who spur they on be well-informed as well as fearless they know that the castle be in such a state that its apparent strength be its real weakness that its entire garrison consist of little more than a hundred soldier most of whom be superannuated veteran a force inadequate to man one-tenth of the defens and that the governor de launay though personally brave be a man devoid of presence of mind and nervous under responsibility lead by a brewer name santerre who for the next three year bear a conspicuous part in all the worst deed of ferocity and horror they assail the gate in vast number while the attention of the scanty garrison be fully occupy by this assault another party scale the wall at a point where there be not even a sentinel to give the alarm and let down one draw-bridge across the fosse while another be loosen as be believe by traitor in the garrison itself swarm across the passage thus open to they thousand of the assailant rush in murder the governor officer and almost every one of the garrison and with a savage ferocity as yet unexampled though but a faint omen of they future crime they cut off the head and hand of de launay and several of they chief victim and stick they on pike bear they as trophy of they victory through the street of the city the news of what have be do come swiftly to versaille where it excite feeling in the assembly which have the king or he adviser be capable of avail themselves of it with skill and firmness might have lead to a salutary change in the policy of that body for the greater part of the deputy be thoroughly alarm at the violence of santerre and he companion and would in all probability have support the king in take strong measure for the restoration of order but loui could not be rouse even by the murder of he own faithful servant to employ force to save those who might be similarly menace the only expedient which occur to he mind be to concede all that the rioter require and at midday on the 15th he repair to the assembly and announce that he have order the removal of the troops from pari and from versaille declare that he trust himself to the assembly and wish to identify himself with the nation the assembly could hardly have avoid feeling that it be a strange time to select for withdraw the troops when a armed mob be in possession of the capital but as they have formerly request that measure they think themselves bind now to applaud it and be for the moment touch by the compliment pay to themselves when he quit the hall they unanimously rise and follow he escort he back to the palace with vehement cheer a vast crowd fill the outer court who catch the contagion and shout out a demand for a sight of the whole royal family and presently when the queen bring out on the balcony she only remain boy whom the death of he brother have raise to the rank of dauphin and salute they with a graceful bow the whole mass burst out in one vociferous acclamation yet even in that moment of congratulation there be base and malignant spirit in the crowd full of bitterness against the royal family and especially against the queen whom they have evidently be teach to regard as the chief obstacle to the reform which they desire she faithful waiting-woman madame de campan have go down into the court-yard and mingle with the crowd to be the better able to judge of they real feeling she could see that many be disguise and one woman whose veil of black lace with which she conceal she feature show that she do not belong to the lowest class seize she violently by the arm call she by she name and bid she go and tell she queen not to interfere any more in the government but to leave she husband and the good states-general to work out the happiness of the people other she hear utter threat of vengeance against madame de polignac and one while pour forth a thousand invective against both king and queen declare that it should soon be impossible to find even a fragment of the throne on which they be now seat marie antoinette be greatly alarm not for herself but for she husband and now that he have determine on withdraw the soldier from the capital she earnestly entreat he to accompany they take the not unreasonable view that the violence of the parisian mob would be to some extent quell and the well-intentioned portion of the assembly would have greater boldness to support they opinion if the king be thus place out of the reach of danger from any fresh outbreak and it be generally understand that a attack on versaille itself be anticipate -lrb- 3 -rrb- she feel so certain of the wisdom of such a course and so sanguine of prevail that she pack up she diamond burn many of she papers and draw up a set of order for the arrangement of the detail of the journey but on the morning of the 16th she be compel to inform madame campan that the plan be give up large portion of the parisian mob and among they one deputation of the fish-woman who in this as well as on more festive occasion claim equally to take the lead have come out to demand that the king should visit paris and the ministerial council think it safer for he to comply with that petition than to throw himself into the arm of the soldier a step which might not improbably lead to a civil war to the queen this seem the most dangerous course of all she know that both at versaille and at paris the agent of the duke of orléans have be scatter money with a lavish hand and she scarcely doubt that either on he road or in the city she husband would be assassinate or at the least detain by the mob as a prisoner and a hostage have she not fear to increase he danger she would have accompany he but at such a crisis it require more courage and fortitude to separate herself from he and the most courageous part be ever that which be most natural to she but though she take no precaution for herself she be as thoughtful as ever for she friend and know how obnoxious the duchess de polignac be to the multitude she insist on she depart with she family the duchess flee not unwillingly and at the same time other also quit versaille who have not the same plea of delicacy of sex to excuse they terror and who be bind by every principle of duty to remain by the king 's side the more steadily the greater might be the danger the prince de condé who certainly at one time have be a brave man and have win a honorable name worthy of he intrepid ancestor in the seven year ' war he brother the prince de conti the count d'artoi who have always be the advocate of the most violent measure be doubly bind to stand forward in defense of he king and brother all flee set the first example of that base emigration which eventually leave the king defenseless in the midst of he enemy the baron de breteuil and some of the minister make similar provision for they own safety though it may be say as some extenuation of they ignoble flight that they have no longer any official duty to detain they since the king have already dismiss they and on the evening of the 16th have write to necker to beg he to return without delay and resume he office claim he instant obedience as a proof of the attachment and fidelity which he have promise when depart five day before on the morning of the 17th loui set out for paris in a single carriage escort by a very slender guard and accompany by a party of the deputy he be fully alive to the danger he be incur he know that threat have be openly utter that he should not reach paris alive -lrb- 4 -rrb- and he have prepare for he journey as for death burn he papers take the sacrament and make arrangement for a regency marie antoinette be almost hopeless of he safety she sit with she child in she private room shed no tear lest the knowledge of she grief should increase the alarm of she attendant but she carriage be keep harness and she have prepare and learn by heart a short speech with which if the worst news which she apprehend should arrive she intend to repair to the assembly and claim its protection for the wife and child of they sovereign -lrb- 5 -rrb- but often as she rehearse it she voice in spite of all she effort be break by sob and she reiterate exclamation they will never let he return but too truly express the deep foreboding of she heart they be not yet fate to be realize the insurrection committee have already organize a force which they have entitle the national guard and of which they have confer the command on the marquis de la fayette and at the gate of the city the king be meet by he and the mayor a man name bailly who have achieve a considerable reputation as a mathematician and a astronomer but who be thoroughly imbue with the leveling and irreligious doctrine of the school of the encyclopedist no man in pari be less likely to treat they sovereign with due respect since he return from america la fayette have be live in retirement on he estate till at the recent election he have be return to the states-general as one of the representative of the noble for he native province of auvergne he have take no part in the debate be entirely destitute of political ability -lrb- 6 -rrb- and he have apparently no very distinct political view but waver between a desire for a republic such as that of which he have witness the establishment in america and a feeling in favor of a limited monarchy such as he understand to exist in great britain though he have no accurate comprehension of its most essential principle but he ruling passion be a desire for popularity and as he have always be vain of he unbending ill-manners as a proof of he liberal sentiment -lrb- 7 -rrb- and as he vanity make he regard king and queen with a general dislike as be of a rank superior to he own he look on the present occurrence as a favorable opportunity for gain the good-will of the mob by show marked disrespect to loui he would not even pay he the ordinary compliment of appear in uniform but head he new troops in plain clothes and even those be not such as belong to he rank but be the ordinary dress of a plain citizen while bailly 's address as loui enter the gate be mark with the most study and gratuitous insolence sire say he i present to you majesty the key of you good city of pari they be the same which be present to henri iv he have conquer he people : to-day the people have conquer they king loui proceed onward to the hôtel de ville in a strange procession head by a numerous band of fish-women always prominent and recruit at every step by a crowd of rough peasant-looking man arm with bludgeon scythe and every variety of rustic weapon evidently on the watch for some opportunity to create a tumult and seek to provoke one by raise from time to time vociferous shout of vive la nation and utter ferocious threat against any one who might chance to exclaim vive le rous but they be disconcert by the perfect calmness of the king on whom danger to himself seem the only thing incapable of make a impression on bailly 's insolent speech he have make no comment remark in a whisper to he principal attendant that he have better appear not to have hear it and now at the hôtel de ville he demeanor be as unruffled as if every thing that have happen have be in perfect accordance with he wish he make a short speech in which he confirm all the concession and promise which he have previously make he even place in he hat a tricolor cockade which the mayor have the effrontery to present to he though it be the emblem of the revolt of he subject and of the defeat of he troops and at last such a effect have he fearless dignity on even the fiercest of he enemy that when he afterward come out on the balcony to show himself to the crowd beneath the whole mass raise the shout of vive le rous with as much enthusiasm as have ever greet the most fear or the most beloved of he predecessor he return to the barrier resemble a triumphal procession yet happy as it seem that outrage have thus be avert and unanimity restore the result of the day can not perhaps be deem entirely fortunate since it probably contribute to fix more deeply in the king 's mind the belief that concession to clamor be the course most likely to be successful nor do the queen though for the moment she despondency be change to thankful exultation at all conceal from herself that the peril which have be escape be certain to recur and that vigilance and firmness would surely again be call for to repel they -- quality which she could find in herself but which she might well doubt she ability to impart to other -lrb- 8 -rrb- she own attention be for a moment occupy by the necessary work of select a new governess for she child in the place of madame de polignac and after some deliberation she choice fall on the marchioness de tourzel a lady of the most spotless character who seem to have be in every respect well fit for so important a office as marie antoinette have scarcely any previous acquaintance with she it be by she character alone that she have be recommend to she as be gracefully express in the brief speech with which marie antoinette deliver she little charge into she hand madame say she i formerly intrusted my child to friendship to-day i intrust they to virtue -lrb- 9 -rrb- and a day or two afterward to make easier the task which the marchioness have not undertake without some unwillingness she address she a letter in which she describe the character of she son and she own principle and method of education with a impartiality and soundness of judgment which could not have be surpass by one who have devote she whole attention to the subject : July 25th 1789 my son be four year and four month old all but two day i say nothing of he size nor of he general appearance it be only necessary to see he he health have always be good but even in he cradle we perceive that he nerve be very delicate this delicacy of he nerve be such that any noise to which he be not accustom frighten he for instance he be afraid of dog because he once hear one bark close to he and i have never oblige he to see one because i believe that as he reason grow stronger he fear will pass away like all child who be strong and healthy he be very giddy very volatile and violent in he passion but he be a good child tender and even caress when he giddiness do not run away with he he have a great sense of what be due to himself which if he be well manage one may some day turn to he good till he be entirely at he ease with any one he can restrain himself and even stifle he impatience and he inclination to anger in order to appear gentle and amiable he be admirably faithful when once he have promise any thing but he be very indiscreet he be thoughtless in repeat any thing that he have hear and often without in the least intend to tell story he add circumstance which he own imagination have put into he head this be he greatest fault and it be one for which he must be correct however take altogether i say again he be a good child and by treat he with allowance and at the same time with firmness which must be keep clear of severity we shall always be able to do all that we can wish with he but severity would revolt he for he have a great deal of resolution for he age to give you a instance : from he very earliest childhood the word _ pardon _ have always offend he he will say and do all that you can wish when he be wrong but as for the word _ pardon _ he never pronounce it without tear and infinite difficulty i have always accustomed my child to have great confidence in I and when they have do wrong to tell I themselves and then when i scold they this enable I to appear pained and afflict at what they have do rather than angry i have accustom they all to regard ` yes ' or ` no ' once utter by I as irrevocable but i always give they reason for my decision suitable to they age to prevent they thinking that my decision come from ill-humor my son can not read and he be very slow at learn but he be too giddy to apply he have no pride in he heart and i be very anxious that he should continue to feel so we child always learn soon enough what they be he be very fond of he sister and have a good heart whenever any thing give he pleasure whether it be the go anywhere or that any one give he any thing he first movement always be to ask that he sister may have the same he be light-hearted by nature it be necessary for he health that he should be a great deal in the open air and i think it be better to let he play and work in the garden on the terrace than to take he longer walk the exercise which child take in run about and play in the open air be much more healthy than force they to walk which often make they back ache -lrb- 10 -rrb- some of these last recommendation may seem to show that the governess be to some extent regard as a nurse as well as a teacher and when we find marie antoinette complain of want of discretion in a child of four year old it may perhaps be think that she be expect rather more of such tender year than be often find in they that she be incline to be overexact rather than overindulgent a error the more venial since it be probable that the educator of prince be more likely to go astray in the opposite direction but it be impossible to avoid be strike with the candor with which she judge she boy 's character and with the judiciousness of she system of education and equally impossible to resist the conviction that a boy of good disposition train by such a mother have every chance of become a blessing to he subject if fate have only allow he to succeed to the throne which she have still a right to look forward to for he as he assure inheritance chapter xxv necker resume office -- outrage in the province -- pusillanimity of the body of the nation -- party in the assembly -- view of the constitutionalist or plain -- barnave make overture to the court -- the queen reject they -- the assembly abolish all privilege August 4th -- debate on the veto -- a attack on versaille be threaten -- great scarcity in paris -- the king send he plate to be melt down -- the regiment of flander be bring up to versaille -- a military banquet be hold in the opera-house -- October 5th a mob from pari march on versaille -- blunder of la fayette -- ferocity of the mob on the 5th -- attack on the palace on the 6th -- danger and heroism of the queen -- the royal family remove to pari -- they reception at the barrier and at the hôtel de ville -- shabbiness of the tuilery -- the king fix he residence there necker have obey the king 's summons the moment that he receive it and before the end of the month he return to versaille and resume he office but even before the king 's dispatch reach he paris have witness terrible proof that the tranquillity which the king 's visit to the capital be suppose to have re-establish be but temporary the populace have break out into fresh tumult murder some of breteuil 's colleague with circumstance of frightful barbarity while intelligence of similar disturbance in the province be constantly arrive in normandy in alsace and in provence in the town and in the rural district the towns-people and the peasant rise against they wealthier neighbor or they landlord burn they house and commonly murder the owner with the most revolting barbarity some be tear into piece some be roasted alive some have actually portion of they flesh cut off and eat by they murderer in they own sight before the blow be give which terminate they agony they sex do not save lady from be victim of the same cruelty nor do it prevent woman from be actor in they yet the horror of these scene be scarcely stranger than the pusillanimity of those who endure they unresistingly for there be not want instance of magistrate honest enough to detest and courageous enough to chastise such outrage and wherever the effort be make it succeed so completely as to fix no slight criminality on those who submit to they in dauphiny the state of the province raise a small guard which quell the first attempt to cause riot there and hang the ringleader in mâcon a similar force though not three hundred strong encounter a band of brigand six thousand in number and bring back two hundred prisoner the chief of whom be instantly execute and by they prompt punishment tranquillity be restore similar firmness would have save other district which now allow themselves to be the victim of ravage and murder as afterward it would have preserve the whole country even when the madness and wickedness of subsequent year be at they height for in no part of the kingdom do those who perpetrate or sympathize with the crime which have make the revolution a by-word approach the number of those who loathe they but who have not the courage or foresight to withstand they it seem as if a long course of misgovernment and the example of the profligacy and impiety set by the higher class for many generation have demoralize the entire people some in they excess discard the ordinary instinct of human being while the bulk of the nation have lose even that courage which have once be among its most shine quality and have no longer the manliness to resist outrage which they abhor even when they own safety be stake upon they repression and similar weakness be exhibit in the assembly itself for unquestionably the party which at last prevail be not that which be originally the strongest like most assembly of the kind it be divide into three party -- the extreme royalist or the right the extreme reformer -lrb- who be subdivide into several section -rrb- or the left and between they the moderate constitutionalist or the plain as they be call from occupy seat in the middle of the hall between the raise bench on either side and to the last party belong all the man most distinguish either for statesman-like perception or for eloquence mirabeau himself agree with they in all they lead principle though he never formally enrol himself in the rank of any party the majority of the constitutionalist be as loyal to the king 's person and dignity as the extreme royalist they most eloquent speaker a young lawyer name barnave at the first opening of the state have even seek to open a direct communication with the court beg madame de lamballe -lrb- 1 -rrb- to assure the queen of the wish of himself and all he friend to maintain the king in the full enjoyment and exercise of what he call a constitutional authority borrow the idea and expression from the english government but though marie antoinette have no objection to the king of he own accord renounce portion of the power which have be claim and exert by he predecessor she would not hear of the state take upon themselves to impose such sacrifice on he or to curtail he authority by any exercise of they own and she reject with something like disdain the support of those whose alliance be only to be purchase on such condition barnave like mirabeau feel insult determine to revenge himself and for a while unite himself to the fiercest of the republican while the right with incredible folly often play into he hand join the left of which many member avowedly aim at the abolition of royalty and with none of whom they have one opinion or sentiment in common to defeat the constitutionalist with whom they practically have but very slight difference and thus as with a base pusillanimity many both of the right and of the plain flee from the country after the tumult of October the mastery of the assembly gradually fall into the hand of that party which contain by far fewer man of ability or honesty than either of the other but which surpass they both in distinctness of object and in unscrupulous resolution to carry out its view but the event of July the mutiny of the troops the successful insurrection of the mob the destruction of the bastile and the visit of loui to paris have be a series of damaging blow to the government and as each successive exploit give encouragement to the movement party event proceed with extreme rapidity necker who return to versaille on the 27th of July show more clearly than ever he unfitness for the chief post in the administration at such a crisis by devote himself solely to financial arrangement and omit to take on the part of the crown the initiative in any one of the reform which the king have promise those he permit to be intrust to a committee of the assembly and the committee have scarcely meet when the assembly take the matter into its own hand and in a strange panic and at a single sit sweep away the privilege of both noble and clergy those who seem personally most concern in they maintenance be the foremost in urge they suppression a member of the oldest nobility propose the abolition of the privilege of the noble a bishop move the extinction of tithe breton burgundian provençals renounce for they fellow - citizen the old distinction and immunity to which each province have hitherto cling with a unyielding if somewhat unreasoning attachment and the whole be crown by the archbishop of pari propose a celebration of the _ te deum _ as a expression of gratitude to god for have inspire a series of action calculate to confer so much happiness on the nation though he could not avoid see the mischievous character of many of the resolution thus tumultuously pass and though he royal assent to they be ask in language unceremonious and almost peremptory in its curtness loui could not bring himself or perhaps do not venture to refuse he sanction to they he have lay down a rule for himself to refuse no concession except such as on religious grounds he conscience might revolt from and on the 18th he signify he formal acceptance of the resolution and of the title of restorer of french liberty it be a act of great weakness and be reward as such act generally be by further encroachment on he authority the progress of the left be not even arrest by a quarrel between some of its member -lrb- who be clergyman be not incline to be reduce to beggary by the extinction of they income -rrb- and mirabeau who not unnaturally bear the priest especial ill-will before the end of the month the assembly even deprive the king of the power of withhold he assent from measure which it might pass enact that he should no longer possess a absolute veto as it be call and necker exhibit on this question a incapacity more glaring than even he former conduct have display induce the king to yield this point also and to express he own preference for what its contriver call a suspensive veto -- a power that be of withhold he assent to any measure till it have be pass by two successive assembly the discussion on this most momentous point have be very vehement in the assembly itself and besides the greatness of the principle involve in the decision they have a peculiar importance as show that mirabeau have not the absolute power over the mind of the member which he believe himself to possess since he contend with all the energy of he temper and with irresistible force of argument against a vote which as he declare could only take the power from the king to vest it in the assembly and yet be wholly unable to carry more than a small minority with he in he opposition and this defeat may have have some share in prompt he to countenance and aid if indeed he be not the original contriver of a plot which be undoubtedly intend to produce a change in the whole frame-work of the government the harvest have be bad and at the beginning of September paris be suffer under a scarcity almost as severe as have ever be feel in the depth of winter the emergency be so great that the king send all he plate to the mint to be melt down to procure money to purchase food for the starve citizen and many patriotic individual necker himself be among the most munificent give they plate and jewel for the same benevolent object but relief procure from such source be unavoidably of too limit a character to last long though necker propose and the assembly vote tax of prodigious amount they could not at once be make available and some of the lower class be say to have die of actual famine in they distress the citizen look to the king and attribute they misery in a great degree to he ignorance of they situation which be cause by he living at versaille they nickname he the baker as if he could supply they with bread and begin to clamor for he at least to take up a occasional residence among they in in he capital from raise a cry the step be easy to organize a riot to compel he to do so and to this object the partisan of the duke of orlean assist if not prompt by mirabeau now begin to apply themselves hope that the result would be the deposition of loui and the enthronement of the duke who might be glad to take the great orator for he prime minister so certain do the conspirator feel of success that they take no pain to keep they machination secret as early as the middle of September intelligence be receive at versaille that the parisian would march upon that town in force on the 5th of October and the assembly be greatly alarmed believe not without reason that the object of the intended attack be to overawe and overbear they the magistrate of the town be even more terrify and besought the king to bring up at least one regiment for they protection and prudent and reasonable as the request be the compliance with it furnish the agent of sedition with pretext for further violence a regiment know as that of flander be send for from the frontier and speedily arrive at versaille when accord to they old and hospitable fashion the body-guard -lrb- 2 -rrb- who regard versaille as they home invite the officer and with they the officer of the swiss guard and those of the town militia also to a banquet on the 1st of October the opera-house as have often be do in similar instance be lend for the occasion and the box be fill with the chief lady of the court and of the town and also with many member of the assembly as spectator so enthusiastic be the acclamation that greet the toast of the king 's health that though marie antoinette have previously desire that the royal family should not appear to have any connection with the entertainment the captain of the guard the count de luxembourg have no difficulty in persuade she that it would but be a graceful recognition of such spontaneous and sincere loyalty at such a time if she be to honor the banquet with she presence though but by the briefest visit loui too accept the proposal with greater warmth than usual and when the royal pair with they child -- the queen as be she custom lead one in each hand -- descend from they apartment and walk through the banquet-hall the enthusiasm be redouble the spectator among whom be many member of the assembly catch the contagion loyal cheer resound from every part of the theater and the feeling excite become so fervid that some officer of the national guard who be among the guest reverse they new tricolor cockade and display the white side outermost seem to have resume the time-honored badge under which the army have reap all its old glory the band strike up a favorite air from one of the new opera peut-on affliger ce qu'on aime which those who see the anxiety which recent event have already stamp upon the queen 's majestic brow could hardly avoid apply to they royal mistress and when it follow it up by blondel 's lamentation for richard o richard o mon rous l'univer t ` abandonne the first note of the well-known song touch a chord in every heart and the whole company courtier lady soldier and deputy be all carry away in a perfect delirium of loyal rapture the whole company escort the royal family back to they apartment though it be remark afterward that some of the soldier who on this occasion be the most vociferous in they exultation be before the end of the same week among the most furious threatener and assailant of the palace but a demonstration such as this in which the whole number of the soldier concern do not exceed fifteen hundred man could not deter the organizer of the impending riot from carry out they plan : if it do not even aid they by the opportunity which it afford for spread abroad exaggerated account of what have take place as a additional proof of the settle hatred and contempt which the court entertain for the people mirabeau have suggest that the best chance of success for a insurrection in paris lay in place woman at its head and in compliance with he hint at day-break on the appoint morning a woman of notorious infamy of character move toward the chief market-place of pari beat a drum and call on all who hear she to follow she -lrb- 3 -rrb- she soon gather round she a troop of follower worthy of such a leader market - woman fish-women and man in woman 's clothes whose deep voice and the power with which they brandish they weapon betray they sex through they disguise one man maillard who have be conspicuous as one of the fiercest of the stormer of the bastile disdain any concealment or dress but he own they choose he for they leader mingle with they cry for bread horrid threat against the queen and the aristocrat they number increase till they feel themselves strong enough to attack the hôtel de ville a detachment of the national guard who be on duty offer they no resistance plead that they have receive no order from la fayette and the rioter now amount to many thousand have arm themselves from the store of musket and sword which they find in the armory pass on to the barrier and take the road to versaille the riot have last four hour and the very last of the rioter have already pass through the gate before la fayette reach the hôtel de ville though he office of commander of the national guard make the preservation of tranquillity one of he most especial duty he have evidently fear to risk he popularity by resist the mob and even now he refuse to act at all till be have receive a write order from the municipal council and when he have obtain that he do not obey it but prefer comply with the demand of he own soldier who insist on follow the rioter to versaille where they would exterminate the regiment of flander bring the king back to pari and perhaps depose he and appoint a regent yet even this open avowal of they treasonable view do not deter they unworthy general from submit to they dictate he have indeed no desire for the success of they design for he have no connection with the duc d'orléans and no inclination to co-operate with mirabeau who he know be in the habit of speaking of he with contempt but he have not firmness to resist they demand he vanity too always he most predominant feeling be flatter by the desire they express to retain he as they commander and at last he procure from the magistrate a fresh order authorize he to comply with the soldier ' clamor and to lead they to versaille when before the magistrate he have profess a expectation that he should be able to induce the king to comply with the wish of the assembly and a determination to restrain the excess of the mob but the whole day have be so waste by he irresolution that when he at last put he regiment in motion it be seven o'clock in the evening -- full four hour after maillard and he fish-woman have reach versaille the news of they approach and of they design have be bring to the palace by monsieur de chinon the eldest son of the duc de richelieu who at great personal risk have disguise himself as a artisan and have march some way with the crowd to learn they object he report that even the woman and child be arm that the great majority be drunk that they be beguile the way with the most ferocious threat and that they have be join by a gang of man who give themselves the name of coupe-têtes and boast that they should have ample opportunity of prove they title to it in addition to the warning previously receive a rumor have reach the palace on the precede evening that the duc d'orléans have come down to versaille in disguise -lrb- 4 -rrb- a movement which could hardly have a innocent object but so little heed have be give to the intelligence or it may perhaps be say so little be it suppose that if such a attack be really meditate any warning would have be give that monsieur de chinon find the palace empty loui have go to hunt in the bois de meudon marie antoinette be at the little trianon but messenger easily find they the queen come in with speed from she garden which she be destine never to behold again the king hasten hack from he covert and by the time that they return the count de st priest the minister of the household have they carriage ready for they to retire to rambouillet and he earnestly press the adoption of such a course loui as usual could not make up he mind he sit in he chair repeat that it be a moment to think seriously rather say marie antoinette say that it be a time to act promptly he would gladly have have she depart with she child but she refuse to leave he declare that she place be by he side that as the daughter of marium teresa she do not fear death and after a time he change he mind and cease to wish even she to retire cling to he old conviction that conciliation be always possible he believe that he have win over even the worst of the mob and that all danger be past versaille witness a strange scene that morning the moment that the mob reach the town they force they way into the assembly hall where maillard as they spokesman after terrifying the member with ferocious threat against the whole body of the noble demand that the assembly should send a deputation to the king to represent to he the distress of the people and that a party of the woman should accompany it loui consent to receive they and when they reach the palace the woman disorderly and ferocious as they be be so awed by the magnificence and pomp which they behold and by the actual presence of the king and queen that they could only summon up a few modest and humble word of petition and one a young and pretty girl of seventeen faint with the excitement one of the princess bring she a glass of water : she recover and as she kneel to kiss the king 's hand loui kiss she himself and transport by he affability she and she companion quit the apartment utter loud cheer for the king and queen but this have not be the impression which they leader have intend they to receive and when they reach the street they new-born loyalty so exasperated they comrade that the soldier have some difficulty in save they from they fury meanwhile the mob increase every hour they occupy the court-yard of the palace roar out ferocious threat the most sanguinary of which be direct against the queen the president of the assembly move that the member should adjourn and repair to the palace for the protection of the royal family but mirabeau resist the proposal and procure its rejection and when a large party of the member go as individual to place they service at the king 's disposal he mingle with the rioter tamper with the soldier and urge they to espouse what he call the cause of the people as it grow dark the crowd grow more and more tumultuous and violent the body-guard who be all gentleman be faithful and fearless but it begin to be see that none of the other troops not even the regiment of flander could be trust some of they even fire on the body-guard and mortally wound its commander the marquis de savonières while loui adhering to he unhappy policy of conciliation even at such a moment send down order to the officer who succeed to the command that the man be not to use they weapon and that all bloodshed be to be avoid tell the king reply m d'huillier that he order shall be obey but that we shall all be assassinate the mob grow fiercer when it become know that la fayette and he regiment be approach no one know what course he might take but the ringleader of the rioter resolve on a strenuous effort to render he arrival useless by they previous success gun be fire heavy blow be deal on the railing of the inner court-yard and on the gate and the danger seem so imminent that the mob might force its way into the palace that the deputy themselves beseech the king to delay no longer but to retire to rambouillet he be still irresolute and still trust to he plan of conciliate by non-resistance the queen though more earnest than ever that he should depart still nobly adhere to she own view of duty and refuse to leave he but hope that he might change he mind she give a write order to keep the carriage harness and to prepare to force a passage for they if the life of the king should appear to be in danger but she add they be not to be use if she alone be threaten at last when it be nearly midnight la fayette arrive with a singular perverseness of folly at a time when every moment be of consequence he have halt he man a mile out of the town to make they a speech in praise of himself and he own loyalty and to administer to they a oath to be faithful to the nation to the law and to the king a oath needless if they be incline to keep it useless if they be not and in the state of feeling then common mischievous in the order in which he range the power to which he require they to profess allegiance at last he reach the palace leave he man below he ascend to the king 's apartment and lay he hand on he heart assure the king that he have no more loyal servant than himself loui be not give to sarcasm : yet some of the bystander fancy that there be a tone of irony in he voice when in reply he express he conviction of the marquis 's sincerity and perhaps la fayette think so too for he proceed to harangue he majesty on he favorite subject of he own courage describe the danger which as he affirm he have incur in the course of the day after which he descend into the court-yard to assure the soldier that the king have promise to accede to they wish and then return to the royal apartment to inform the king that contentment be restore and that he himself would be responsible for the tranquillity of the night the royal family exhaust with the fatigue of so terrible a day retire to rest the queen expressly enjoin she lady to follow she example fortunately they be too anxious for she safety to obey she and with they own attendant keep watch in the room outside she bed-chamber but la fayette in spite of the responsibility which he have take upon himself feel no such anxiety he declare himself tired and sleepy and leave the palace go to a friend 's house to ask for a bed -lrb- 5 -rrb- yet he well know that the crowd be still assemble around the palace and be increase in violence though the night be stormy and wet the rioter seek no shelter except such as be afford by a hurry resort to the wine-shop in the neighborhood where they inflamed they intoxication and from which they soon return to renew they savage clamor and threat increase the disorder by keep up a frequent fire of they musket throughout the night the duc d'orléans be briskly go to and fro he emissary scatter money among the rioter who seem to have no definite purpose or plan till as day begin to break one of the gate lead into the prince ' court be see to be open it have be intrust to some of la fayette 's soldier and could not have be open without treachery the crowd pour in utter fiercer threat than ever from the belief that they prey be within they reach there be in truth nothing between they and the staircase which lead to the royal apartment except two gallant gentleman m des huttes and m moreau the sentry of the detachment of the body - guard on duty whose quarter be at the head of the staircase in a saloon opposite to the queen 's chamber but these brave man be worthy of the best day of the french army the more formidable the mob and the greater the danger the more imperative to they loyal heart be the duty to defend those whose safety be intrust to they vigilance and with so dauntless a front do they stand to they post that for a moment the ruffian recoil and shrink from attack they till d'orléans himself come forward wave to they with he hand a signal to force the way in and point out to they which way to take what then could two man effect against such a multitude des huttes perish pierce by a hundred pike and tear into piece by he blood - thirsty assailant moreau with equal valor but with better fortune back up the stair fight so desperately as he retreat that he give he comrade time to barricade the door lead to the queen 's apartment and to come to he assistance as they draw he back terribly wound into the guardroom de varicourt and durepaire take he place de varicourt be soon slay but durepaire a man of prodigious strength and prowess hold the assassin at bay for some time till he too fall reduce to helplessness by a score of deep wound when he in he turn be replace by miomandre he devotion and intrepidity equal that of he comrade he be eminently skillful also in the use of he weapon and with he own hand he strike down many of he assailant till he be gradually force back by number when he place he musket as a barrier across the door-way and thus still keep he enemy at bay while he shout to the queen 's lady now separate from he by but a single partition to save the queen for the tiger with whom he be struggle be aim at she life in the annals of the ancient chivalry of the nation it have be record as the most brilliant feat of bayard that on a bridge of the garigliano he have for a while with he single arm stem the onset of two hundred spaniard and that glorious exploit of the model hero of the nation have never be more faithfully copy and more nobly rival than it be on this morning of shame and danger by miomandre and he intrepid comrade as they successively step into the breach to fight against those whom he truly call not man but tiger it be but a brief moment before he too be strike down but he have gain for the lady a respite sufficient to enable they to secure the safety of they royal mistress they rouse she from she bed for she fatigue have be so great that she have hitherto sleep soundly through the uproar and hurry she off to the apartment of the king who have in be just similarly awaken be come to seek she and in a few minute the whole family be collect in he antechamber while the body-guard occupy the queen 's bedroom and the rioter balk of they intended victim be pillage the different room into which they have be able to make they way luckily la fayette be still absent : he be have he hair dress with great composure while the mob for whose contentment and orderly behavior he have vouch be plunder the royal palace and seek its owner to murder they and in he absence the marquis de vaudreuil and a body of noble take upon themselves the office of defender of the crown and go down to the court-yard reproach the national guard with they inaction at such a moment of danger and with they manifest sympathy with the rioter at first out of mere shame the national guard attempt to justify themselves : they have be tell they say that the body-guard be the aggressor that they have attack the people do you pretend to believe say the gallant marquis that two hundred man have be mad enough to attack thirty thousand the argument be irresistible they declare that if the body-guard would assume the tricolor they would stand by they as brother and by a reaction not uncommon at such time of excitement the two regiment become reconcile in a moment as no tricolor cockade could be procure they exchange shako and in many case arm and presently when the coup-têtes after mutilate the body of two of the body-guard who have be kill on the previous evening be prepare to murder two or three more who have fall into they hand the national guard dash to they rescue shout out with a curious identification of they force with the old french army that they would save the body-guard who save they at fontenoy and bring they off unhurt balk of they expect prey the rioter grow more furious than ever in useless wrath they keep firing against the wall of the palace and shout out a demand for the queen to show herself she with she child be still in the king 's apartment where the princess the minister and a few courtier be also assemble necker in a agony of terror and distress sit with he face bury in he hand unable to offer any advice la fayette who have just arrive dwelt upon the danger which he have run though no one else know what they be and assure the king of the power which he still possess to allay the tumult if the reasonable demand of the people -lrb- as he call they -rrb- be grant marie antoinette alone be undaunted and calm or at least if in the depths of she woman 's heart she feel terror at the sanguinary and obscene threat of she ruffianly enemy she scorn to show it when the firing begin m de luzerne one of the minister have quietly place himself between she and the window but while she thank he for he devotion she beg he to retire say with she habitually gracious courtesy that it be she place to be there -lrb- 6 -rrb- not he since the king could not afford to have so faithful a servant endanger and now hold she little son and daughter one in each hand she step out on the balcony to confront those who be shout for she blood no child be they cry she lead the dauphin and he sister back into the room and return to the balcony stand before they alone with she hand cross and she eye look up to heaven as one who expect instant death with a firmness as far remove from defiance as from supplication even those ruthless miscreant be awed by she magnanimous fearlessness not a shot be fire for a moment it seem as if she enemy have become she partisan loud shout of bravo and long live the queen be hear on all side and one ruffian who raise he gun to take aim at she have he weapon beat down by those who stand near he and run some risk of be himself sacrifice to they indignation but this impulse of respect like other impulse of such a people be short-lived and presently the multitude begin to raise a shout which express the original purpose which have lead the majority to march upon versaille to paris be the cry and again la fayette volunteer he advice urge the king to comply with the request by this time loui have learn the value of the marquis 's loyalty but he have no alternative it be evident that the rioter have the power of compelling compliance with they demand and accordingly he authorize the marquis to promise that he would remove he family to pari and a few minute afterward he himself go out on the balcony with the queen and himself announce he intention with the view of give he act a greater appearance of be voluntarily resolve upon soon after midday he set out accompany by the queen he brother the count de provence he sister the princess elizabeth and he child it be a strange and shameful retinue that escort the king of france to he capital one party of the rioter with maillard and another ruffian name jourdan the chief of the coupe-têtes at they head have start two hour before bear aloft in triumph the head of the mangled body-guard and combine such hideous mockery with they barbarity that they halt at sèvres to compel a barber to dress the hair on the lifeless skull and now the royal carriage be surround by a vast and confused medley market-woman and the rest of the female rabble with drunken gang of the ruffian who have storm the palace in the morning still brandish they weapon or bear loaf of bread on they pike-head and singing out that they should all have enough of bread now since they be bring the baker the bakeress and the baker 's boy to pari -lrb- 7 -rrb- the only part of the procession that bear even a decent appearance be a small escort of ` different regiment -- the guard the national guard and the body-guard many of the latter still bleed from the wound which they have receive in the conflict and tumult of the morning a train of carriage contain a deputation of the member of the assembly also follow mirabeau himself have just earn a motion that the assembly be inseparable from the king and that wherever he be there must be the place of meeting for the great council of the nation yet in spite of the confidence which they presence might have be expect to diffuse among the mob and in spite of the hope of come plenty which the rioter themselves announce the royal party be not even yet safe from further attack some ruffian stab at the royal carriage as it pass with they pike and several shot be fire at it though fortunately they miss they aim and no one be injure -lrb- 8 -rrb- to the queen the journey be more painful than to any one else a few week before she have congratulate mademoiselle de lamballe on not be a mother -- perhaps the bitterest exclamation that grief and anxiety ever wring from she lip and now the keenest anxiety of a mother be indeed add to those of a queen the procession move with painful slowness no provision have be take in the carriage and the little dauphin be suffer from hunger and beg for some food tear which she own danger could not bring to she eye flow plentifully as she witness the suffering of she child she could only beg he to bear he privation with patience and she have the reward of the pain she have always take to inspire he with confident in she in the fortitude with which for the rest of the day he bear what to child of he age be probably the severest hardship to which they can be expose -lrb- 9 -rrb- so vast and disorderly be the procession that it be nine o'clock at night before it reach paris bailly again meet the royal carriage at the barrier and re-assume the tone of coarse insult which he have adopt on the king 's previous visit have the effrontery to describe the day so full of horror to every one and of humiliation and agony to those whom he be address as a glorious day it be at such moment as these that loui 's impassibility assume the character of dignity he disdain to notice the mayor 's insolence and briefly answer that it be always with pleasure and with confidence that he find himself among the inhabitant of he good city of pari he proceed to the hôtel de ville where the council of civic magistrate be sit and where the president address he in language which afford a marked contrast to that of the mayor call he a adore father who have come to visit the place where he could meet with the greatest number of he child and it seem as if bailly himself have become in some degree ashamed of he insolence for now when loui desire he in reply to the president 's address to repeat the answer which he have make to he at the barrier he merely say that the king have come with pleasure among the parisian the king sir interrupt the queen add ` and with confidence ' gentleman say bailly you hear she majesty 's word you be happier in do so than if i myself have utter they the whole company burst into one rapturous cheer and at they request the king and queen show themselves for a few minute at the window beneath which late as the hour be a vast multitude be still collect which receive they with vociferous cheer and then the royal family quit the hotel drive to the tuilery where they attendant have be hastily make such preparation as a few hour allow for they reception since the completion of the palace at versaille the tuilery have be almost desert -lrb- 10 -rrb- the paint and gilding be tarnish the curtain be fade many most necessary article of furniture be altogether want and the whole be so shabby that it attract the notice of even the little dauphin how bad mamma say he every thing look here my boy she reply loui xiv live here comfortably enough but they have not yet decide on make it they permanent residence la fayette who have try to induce the king to promise to do so have be distinctly refuse and for some day loui do not make up he mind but after a time the fear if he should propose to return to versaille of be meet by a opposition on the part of the assembly or the civic magistrate which he might be unable to surmount or if he should again settle there of he absence from the city furnish a pretext for fresh tumult cause he to announce he intention of make pari he principal abode for the future he give order for the removal of some furniture and of the queen 's library to the tuilery and with something of the apathy of despair begin to reconcile himself to he new abode and he changed position chapter xxvi feeling of marie antoinette on come to the tuilery -- she tact in win the heart of the common people -- mirabeau change he view -- quarrel between la fayette and the duc d'orléans -- mirabeau desire to offer he service to the queen -- riot in paris -- murder of françois -- the assembly pass a vote prohibit any member from take office -- the emigration -- death of the emperor joseph ii -- investigation into the riot of October -- the queen refuse to give evidence -- violent proceedings in the assembly -- execution of the marquis de favras the comment make by marie antoinette on quit versaille be that they be undo they be be drag off perhaps to death which be never far remove from captive sovereign -lrb- 1 -rrb- and such henceforward be she prevailing feeling she may occasionally prompt by she own innate courage and sanguineness of disposition have cherish a short-lived hope found on a consciousness of the king 's and she own purity of intention or on a belief which she never wholly discard in the natural goodness of heart of the french people when not lead astray by demagogue and of they impulsive levity of disposition which seem to make no change of temper on they part impossible but she general feeling be one of humiliation for the past and despair for the future not only do the example of charle i whose fate be ever before she eye fill she with dread for she husband 's life -lrb- to she own danger she never give a thought -rrb- but she feel also that the cause and principle of royalty have be degrade by the shameful scene through which she have lately pass and we shall fail to do justice to the patience fortitude and energy of she conduct during the remainder of she life if we allow ourselves to forget that these high quality be maintain and exert in spite of the most depressing circumstance and the most discouraging conviction that she be struggle because it be she duty to struggle for she husband 's honor and she child 's inheritance but that she be never long sustain by that incentive which with so many be absolutely indispensable to steady and useful exertion -- the anticipation of eventual success a letter which the very next morning she write to mercy who fortunately still retain he old post as embassador show the courage with which she still catch at every circumstance which seem in the least hopeful and with what unfaltering tact she seek every opportunity of act on the impulsiveness which she regard as one chief characteristic of the french people October 7th 1789 i be quite well you may be easy about I if we could only forget where we be and how we come here we ought to be satisfy with the feeling of the people especially this morning i hope if bread do not fall short that many thing will return to they proper order i speak to the people militia fish-woman and all : all offer I they hand i give they mine in the hôtel de ville i be personally well receive the people this morning beg we to remain here i answer they speak for the king who be by my side that it depend on themselves whether we remain that we desire nothing better that all animosity must be lay aside that the slightest renewal of bloodshed would make we flee with horror those who be nearest to I swear that all that be over i tell the fish-women to go and tell other all that we have just say to one another -lrb- 2 -rrb- and a day or two later on the 10th even while give fuller expression to she feeling of unhappiness and of disgust at the event of the past week as to which she assure mercy that no description could be exaggerate on the contrary that any account must fall far short of what the king and she have see and experience she yet repeat that she hope to bring back to a right feeling the honest and sound portion of the citizen and people unhappily however as she add they be not the most numerous body still with gentleness and unwearied patience she may hope that at least she shall succeed in do away with the horrible distrust which occupy every mind and which have drag the king and herself into the gulf in which they be at present so keen at this time be she feeling that one principal cause of they misery be the unjust distrust which the citizen in general conceive of the view and design of the court that she desire mercy not to try to see she and while she describe the scantiness of the accommodation which she attendant have as yet be able to provide for she so that madame royale have a bed in she dressing-room and the little dauphin be in she own room she find advantage in these arrangement inconvenient as they be since they prevent any suspicion from arise that she be give audience which she desire to keep secret she do not overrate the impression which she have make on the people and she faithful attendant madame campan have preserve more minute detail of the event of the 7th than she herself report to the embassador she be hardly dress when a huge crowd collect on the terrace under she window shout for she to show herself and when she come forward they begin to accost she in a mingled tone of expostulation and menace she must drive away the courtier who be the ruin of king she must love the inhabitant of she good city she reply that she have always feel so toward they she have love they while at versaille she should continue to love they at paris ah interrupt a virago hardier than she companion but on the 14th of July you would have besiege and bombard the city and on the 6th of October you want to flee to the frontier she answer in the gentlest tone that these be idle story which they be wrong to believe tale like these be what cause at once the misery of the people and that of the best of king another woman address she in german marie antoinette declare that she do not understand what she say that she have become so completely french that she have forget she native language and the compliment to they country fairly vanquish they they receive it with shout of bravo and with loud clapping of they hand they beg the ribbon and flower of she bonnet she take they off with she own hand and distribute they among they and they divide the spoil with thankful exultation smile wave they hand and cry out long live marie antoinette long live we good queen -lrb- 3 -rrb- for a time it seem as if the fortune of the king and country be be weigh in a uncertain balance one day some circumstance seem to hold out a prospect of the re-establishment of tranquillity and of the return of the mass to a better feeling the next day these favorable appearance be more than counterbalance by fresh evidence of the increase power of the factious and unscrupulous demagogue it be greatly in favor of the crown that the triumph of the mob on the 6th of October have lead to violent quarrel between the duc d'orléans la fayette and mirabeau la fayette have charge the duke with have enter into a plot to assassinate he and threaten to impeach he formally if he do not at once quit the kingdom -lrb- 4 -rrb- the duke tremble and consent easily procure from the minister who be glad to get rid of he a diplomatic mission to england as a pretext for he departure and mirabeau who despise both the duke and the marquis full of contempt for the pusillanimity which the former have show in the quarrel abandon all idea of place he on he cousin 's throne make he my king he exclaim i would not have he for my valet embolden by he success with the duke la fayette who have great confidence in he own address next try to win over or to get rid of mirabeau himself he propose to obtain a embassy for he also the suggestion of what be clearly a honorable exile in disguise be at once decline -lrb- 5 -rrb- he then offer he a large sum of money for at that moment he have the entire disposal of the civil list but he find that the great orator be disincline to connect himself with he in any way much more to lay himself under any obligation to he in fact mirabeau be at this moment hope to obtain a post in the home administration where if he could once succeed in procure a footing he have no doubt of soon obtain the entire mastery and the royal family be hardly settle at the tuilery before he apply to he friend the count de la marck whom he rightly believe to enjoy the queen 's good opinion beg he to express to she he ardent wish to serve she he even draw up a long memorial on the exist state of affair indicate the line of conduct which in he opinion the king ought to pursue the lead feature of which be a early departure from pari to some city at no great distance that he might be safe and free while in the capital it be evident that he be neither and the step which he thus recommend at the outset deserve attention as be also that on which a year later he still insist as the indispensable preliminary to whatever line of conduct might be decide on but at this moment he advice never reach those for whom it be intend la marck with all he good-will both to he friend and to the court could not venture to bring before the queen 's notice the name of one who only a few day before have denounce she in the foulest manner in the assembly for have appear at the soldier ' banquet and whom she with she own eye have behold unite with the assailant of the palace he think it more politic even for the eventual attainment of he friend 's object to content himself for the time with give the memorial and state the view of the writer to the count de provence and that prince declare that it would be useless to bring it to the knowledge of either king or queen : that the queen have not sufficient influence over she husband to induce he to adopt such a plan and he even hint that at time loui be dispose to be jealous of she appear to influence he but if these circumstance -- the quarrel between the enemy of the court and the conversion of one more able and formidable than either -- be in the king 's favor other event which take place in the same few week be full of mischief and danger before the end of the month fresh riot break out in paris bread the supply of which marie antoinette as we have see rightly regard as a matter of the first importance to the tranquillity of the city continue scarce and dear and the mob break open the baker ' shop and murder one baker a man name françois with a ferocity more terrible than they have even show toward de launay or the guard at versaille they tear he body to piece and have cut off he head compel he wife to kiss the scarcely cold lip and then leave she fainting on the pavement still cover with he blood even la fayette be horror-stricken at such brutality it be the only occasion on which he do he duty during the whole progress of the revolution he come down with a company of the national guard disperse the rioter seize the ruffian who be bear aloft the head of the murder man on a pole and cause he to be hang the next day and during the next few week he more than once bring he soldier to the support of the civil power and inflict summary punishment on gang of miscreant whose idea of reform be a state of thing which should afford impunity to crime but in the next month the assembly deal a heavier blow on the king 's authority than could be inflict by the worst excess of a informal mob -- they pass a resolution prohibit any of its member from accept any office in the administration : it be a imitation of the self-denying ordinance into which cromwell have trick the english parliament and though bear a appearance of disinterestedness in close the access to official emolument and honor against themselves be in reality a injury to the king as deprive he of he right to select he minister from the entire body of the nation and to the nation itself as prevent it from obtain the service of those who might be presume to be its ablest citizen as have be already select as its representative but a far more irreparable injury than any that could be inflict on the court by either populace or assembly come from its friend we have see that the count d'artoi with some noble who have especial reason to fear the enmity of the parisian have flee from the country in July and now they example be follow by a vast number of the higher class several of they have hitherto be prominent as the leader of the moderate or constitutional section of the assembly -- man who have no grounds for complain that except in one or two instance at moment of extraordinary excitement they influence have be overborne but who now yield to a infectious panic before the end of the year more than three hundred deputy have resign they seat and quit the country salve over to themselves the dereliction of the duty which a few month before they have voluntarily seek and they performance of which be now a more imperative duty than ever by denunciation of the crime which have be commit and which they have find themselves unable to prevent they do not see that they pusillanimous flight must lead to a continuance of such atrocity leave as it do the undisputed sway in the assembly to those very man who have be the author of the outrage of which they complain they be in fact insure the ruin of all that they most wish to preserve for in the progress of the debate in the assembly during the winter many question of the most vital importance be decide by very small majority which they presence would have turn into minority the greater the danger be the more irresistible they ought to have feel the obligation to stand to the last by the cause of which they be the legitimate champion and the final triumph of the jacobin party owe hardly more to the energy of its leader than to the cowardly and inglorious flight of the prince and noble who leave the field open without resistance to they wickedness and audacity it be a melancholy winter that the queen now pass so far as she be able she divert she mind from political anxiety by devote much of she time to the education of she child a little plot of ground be rail off in the garden of the tuilery for the dauphin 's -lrb- 6 -rrb- amusement and one of she favorite relaxation be to watch he work at the flower-bed himself with he little hoe and rake though as if to mark that they be in fact prisoner both she and he be follow wherever they go by grenadier of the city-guard and be not allow to dispense with they attendance for a single moment marie antoinette have reason to complain that she be watch as a criminal -lrb- 7 -rrb- sad as she be at heart she be not allow the comfort of privacy and retirement she be force to hold reception for the noble and chief citizen and as the court be now formally establish at the tuilery she dine every week in public with the king but she steadily resist the entreaty of some of the minister and courtier to visit the theater think with great justice that a attendance at public spectacles of that character would have have a appearance of gayety as unbecome at such a period of anxiety as it be inconsistent with she feeling and before the end of the winter she sustain a fresh affliction in the loss of she brother the emperor -lrb- 8 -rrb- whose death bear with it the additional aggravation of deprive she of a counselor whose advice she value and of a ally on whose active aid she believe that she could rely far more than she could on that of they brother leopold who now succeed to the imperial throne not that leopold can be charge with indifference to he sister 's welfare in the very week of he accession to the throne he write to she with great affection assure she of he devotion to she interest and express he desire to correspond with she in the most unreserved confidence but the same letter show that as yet he know but very little of she -lrb- 9 -rrb- and that he regard the difficulty in which some of joseph 's recent measure have involve the imperial government as sufficiently serious to engross he attention a few extract from she reply be worth preserve as prove how steadily in she conduct and language to every one she adhere to she rule of conceal she husband 's defect and put he forward as the first person on whose wish and direction she own conduct most depend it also show what advance she be herself make in the perception of the true character of the crisis so far as the object of the few honest member who still remain in the assembly be concerned and the extent to which she be try to reconcile herself to some curtailment of she husband 's former authority thank he for the assurance of he friendship she say : believe I my dear brother we shall always be worthy of it i say we because i do not separate the king from myself he be touch by you letter as i be myself and bid I assure you of this he heart be loyalty and honesty itself and if ever again we become i do not say what we have be but at least what we ought to be you may then depend on the entire fidelity of a good ally i do not say any thing to you of we actual position : it be too heart - rend it ought to afflict every sovereign in the universe and still more a affectionate relation like you it be only time and patience that can bring back man 's mind to a healthy state it be a war of opinion and one which be still far from be terminate it be only the justice of we cause and the feeling of a good conscience that can support we my most sincere wish be that you may never meet with ingratitude my own melancholy experience prove to I that of all evil that be the most terrible yet no indignation at the thanklessness of the parisian could chill she constant benevolence toward they and amidst all the anxiety which fill she mind for herself she husband and she child she found a asylum for the education of a number of orphan daughter of old soldier and find time to give she careful attention to a code of regulation for its management -lrb- 10 -rrb- meanwhile circumstance be gradually pave the way for she accept the help of he who during the earliest discussion of the assembly have be not so much through he own malice as through necker 's folly she worst enemy we have see how immediately after the attack on versaille mirabeau have once more endeavor to find a opening through which to place himself at she service he alone perhaps of all man in the kingdom perceive the reality and greatness of the danger which threaten even the life of the sovereign -lrb- 11 -rrb- and as amidst all the error into which he regard for he own interest he vindictiveness or he caprice impel he he always preserve the perception and instinct of a genuine statesman many of the transaction of the winter increase he conviction of the peril in which every interest in the whole kingdom be place if the headlong folly of the assembly could not be restrain and if even proverbially difficult as such a course be some of its act could not be rescind while one transaction which more than any other that have yet take place show the greatness of the queen 's heart much sharpen he eagerness to prove himself a worthy servant of so noble-minded a mistress some of the magistrate who still desire to discharge they duty have institute a investigation into the conspiracy which have originate the attack on versaille and all its multiply horror they have examine a great body of witness whose evidence leave no doubt of the active part take in it by the duc d'orléans and he partisan and by mirabeau whether he be to be include among that prince 's adherent or not but they conceive it specially important to procure the testimony of the queen herself however it be in vain that they apply to she for the slightest information appeal to she indignation to she pride and to she danger be equally disregard by she no denunciation of those who whatever have be they crime be still the subject of she husband could in she eye be become to she as queen and when those who hope to make a tool of she to crush they political rival urge that no evidence would be accept as equally conclusive with hers since no one have see so much of what have take place or have in so great a degree preserve that coolness which be indispensable to a clear account of it and to the identification of the guilty she reply be a dignified and magnanimous pardon of the outrage beneath which she have so nearly perish i have see every thing i have know every thing i have forget every thing and mirabeau not unthankful for the protection which she magnanimity thus throw around he be eager to make atonement for he past insult and injury and many of the recent event have convince he that there be no time to lose the vote of November debar he in common with all other member of the assembly from office be a severe blow to the most important of he project so far as he own interest be concern within a month it have be follow by another propose by the abbé siéyes a busy priest who boast that he have make himself master of the whole science of politics but who be in fact a mere slave of abstract theory the safety or even the practicability of which he be utterly unable to estimate on he motion the assembly in a single evening abolish all the ancient territorial division of the kingdom and the very name of the province divide the country anew into eighty-three department and coupling with this new arrangement a number of detail which be evidently calculate to wrest the whole executive authority of the kingdom from the crown and to vest it in the populace at another sit the whole property of the church be confiscate on another night the parliament be abolish and on a fourth the party which have carry these measure make a still more direct and audacious attack on the royal prerogative by pass a resolution which deprive the crown of all power of revise the sentence of the judicial tribunal and of pardoning or mitigate the punishment of those who might have be condemn and if to bring home to the tender-hearted monarch the full effect of this last inroad upon he legitimate power they at the same time create a new crime to which they give the name of treason against the nation -lrb- 12 -rrb- without either define it or specify the kind of evidence which should he require to prove it and they proceed at once to put it in force to procure the condemnation of a nobleman of decayed fortune but of the highest character the marquis de favras in a manner which show that they real object be to strike terror into the whole royalist party the charge on which he be bring to trial be not merely unfounded but ridiculous he be charge with design to raise a army of thirty thousand man with the object of carry off the king from pari of dissolve the assembly by force and put la fayette and bailly to death the evidence with which it be pretend to support these charge break down on every point and its failure of itself establish the prisoner 's innocence even without the aid of he own defense which be lucid and eloquent but the marquis be know to be a royalist in feeling and though very poor to stand high in the confidence of the prince the demagogue collect mob round the courthouse to intimidate the judge and the judge prove as base as the accuser themselves they profess indeed to fear not so much for they own life as for the public tranquillity but they pronounce he guilty one of they have even the effrontery to acknowledge he innocence to favras himself and to affirm that he life be a necessary sacrifice to the public peace no event since the attack on versaille have cause marie antoinette equal anguish it show that attachment to the king and herself be in itself regard as a inexpiable crime and she distress be greatly augmented when on the Sunday follow the execution of the marquis some of he friend bring to the table where as usual she be dine in public with the king the widow marchioness and she orphan son in deep mourning and present they to they majesty they introducer evidently expect that the king or at least the queen by the distinguished reception which she would accord to they would mark they sense of the merit of they late husband and father and of the indignity of the sentence under which he have suffer marie antoinette be sadly embarrassed and distressed : she be take wholly by surprise and it happen by a cruel perverseness of fortune that santerre the brewer whose ruffianly and ferocious enmity to the whole royal family and especially to herself have be conspicuous throughout the worst outrage of the past summer and autumn be on the same day on duty at the palace as commander of one of the battalion of the parisian guard and be stand behind she chair when the marchioness and she son be introduce she embarrassment and all she feeling on the occasion be describe by herself in the course of the afternoon to madame campan after the dinner be over she go up to she attendant 's room say that it be a relief to find herself where she could weep at she ease for weep she must at the folly of the ultra-royalist we can not but be destroy she continue when we be attack by people who unite every kind of talent to every kind of wickedness and when we be defend by folk who be indeed very estimable but who have no just notion of we position they have now compromise I with both party in they present to I the widow and son of favras if i have be free to do as i would i should have take the child of a man who have just be sacrifice for we and have place he at table between the king and myself but surround as i be by the very murderer who have cause he father 's death i could not venture even to bestow a glance upon he yet the royalist will blame I for not have seem to be interested in the poor child while the revolutionist will be furious thinking that those who present he to I know that it would please I and all that she could venture to do she do she know that the marchioness be very poor and she send she by a trusty agent a few hundred loui and with it a kind message assure the unhappy widow that she would always watch over she and she son 's interest chapter xxvii the king accept the constitution so far as it have be settle -- the queen make a speech to the deputy -- she be well receive at the theater -- negotiation with mirabeau -- the queen 's view of the position of affair -- the jacobin club denounce mirabeau -- deputation of anacharsis clootz -- demolition of the statue of loui xiv -- abolition of title of honor -- the queen admit mirabeau to a audience -- he admiration of she courage and talent -- anniversary of the capture of the bastile -- fête of the champ de mar -- presence of mind of the queen what be probably as painful to marie antoinette as these occurrence themselves be the apathy with which the king regard they the english traveler to whose journal we have more than once refer and who in the first week of the year see the royal pair wait in the garden of the tuilery remark that though the queen do not appear in good health but show melancholy and anxiety in she face the king on the other hand be as plump as ease could render he -lrb- 1 -rrb- and in the course of February in spite of all she remonstrance necker succeed in persuade he to go down to the assembly and to address the member in a long speech in which though some of he expression be clearly intend as a reproof of the assembly itself for the precipitation and violence of some of its measure he nevertheless declare he cordial assent to the new constitution so far as they have yet settle it and promise to co-operate in a spirit of affection and confidence in the labor which still remain to be achieve the greater part of the speech be believe to have be he own composition and it be characteristic of the fidelity with which on every occasion marie antoinette adhere to she rule of strengthen she husband 's position by she own cordial and conspicuous support that strongly as she have object to the step before it be take now that it be decide on she profess a decide approval of it and when a deputation of the assembly which have be appoint to escort the king with honor back to the palace solicit a audience of herself to pay they respects she assure the deputy that she partake of all the sentiment of the king that she unite with all she heart and mind in the measure which he love for he people have just dictate to he and then bring the dauphin forward she add : behold my son i shall unceasingly speak to he of the virtue of he most excellent father i shall teach he from the earliest age to cherish public liberty and i hope that he will be its firmest bulwark for a moment the step seem to have succeed though the proof of its success be still more strongly proof of the utter want of sense that mark all the proceedings of the assembly as loui have express he assent to the constitution so far as it be settle it be propose as a fitting compliment to he that the assembly and the whole body of the citizen of pari should take a oath of fidelity to the constitution without any such reservation but in the course of the next few week the assembly show how little he reproof of its former precipitation and violence have be heed since among the first measure with which it proceed to the completion of the constitution one deprive he of the right of decide on peace and war a power which all wise statesman regard as inseparable from the executive government another extinguish the right of primogeniture and a third confiscate all the property of the monastic establishment however those who take the lead in the management of affair -lrb- for necker and the minister have long cease to exert the slightest authority -rrb- be blind by they own fury to the absurdity and inconsistency of they conduct they exultation be unbounded and adhering to the line of conduct which she have mark out for herself marie antoinette now yield to they entreaty that she would show herself to the citizen at the theater even in the day of she earliest popularity she have never meet a more enthusiastic reception the greater part of the house rise at she entrance clap they hand and cheer and the disloyalty of a few malcontent only make she triumph more conspicuous so roughly be they treat by the rest of the audience marie antoinette be herself touch at the cordiality with which she be greet and see in it another proof that the people and citizen be good at heart if leave to themselves but she add to the princess de lamballe to whom she describe the scene all this enthusiasm be but a gleam of light a cry of conscience which weakness will soon stifle -lrb- 2 -rrb- it be probably do no injustice to mirabeau to believe that the crime which have make the greatest impression on the queen be not the event which affect he the most strongly but he be not only a statesman in intellect but a aristocrat in every feeling of he heart no man be fonder of refer to he illustrious ancestor or of claim kindred with man of old renown such as the admiral de coligny of whom he more than once boast in the assembly as he cousin and each blow deal at the consideration of the noble be a additional incentive to he to seek to arrest the progress of a revolution which have already go far beyond he wish or he expectation and as he be always energetic in the pursuit of he plan he have by some means or other in spite of the discouragement derive from the language and conduct of the count de provence contrived to get information of he willingness to enlist in the royalist party convey to the queen the count de la marck who be still he chief confidant be at brussels at the beginning of the spring when he receive a letter from mercy beg he to return without delay to pari he lose no time in obey the summons when he learn to he great delight though he pleasure be alloy by some misgiving that the king and queen have resolve to avail themselves of mirabeau 's service and that he himself be select as the intermediate agent in the negotiation la marck 's misgiving -lrb- 3 -rrb- as he frankly tell the embassador at the outset be cause by the fear that mirabeau have do more harm than he could repair but he gladly undertake the commission though its difficulty be increase by a stipulation which show at once the weakness of the king and the extraordinary difficulty which it place in the way of he friend the count be especially warn to keep all that be pass a secret from necker he be startle as he well might be at such a injunction but he do not think it become he position to start a difficulty and as he be fully impress with the importance of not lose time the negotiation proceed rapidly he introduce mirabeau to mercy and he himself be admit to a interview with the queen when he learn that she greatest objection to accept mirabeau 's service be of a personal nature found partly on the general badness of he character partly on the share he have bear in the event of the 5th and 6th of October by the count 's own account he go rather beyond the truth in he endeavor to exculpate he friend on this point and he probably deceive himself when he believe that he have convince the queen of he innocence but both she and loui who be present at a part of the interview have evidently make up they mind to forget the past if they could trust he promise for the future and the interview end in the further conduct of the necessary arrangement be leave by loui to the queen in a subsequent conversation with the count she explain she own view of the exist situation of affair describe they indeed accord to she custom as the idea of the king in a manner which show how much she be willing that the king should abate of he old prerogative provide only that the concession be make voluntarily by himself and not impose by violent and illegal resolution of the assembly mirabeau have draw up a elaborate memorial for the consideration of the king in which he point out in general term he sense of the state of utter anarchy into which france have fall he shame and indignation at feeling that he himself have contribute to bring affair into such a bad state and he profound conviction of the necessity in the interest of the whole nation of re-establish the legitimate authority of the king -lrb- 4 -rrb- and marie antoinette comment on this expression assure la marck that the king have no desire to recover the full extent of the authority which he have formerly possess and that he be far from think it necessary for he own personal happiness any more than for the welfare of he people -lrb- 5 -rrb- and it seem to the count that she place unlimited confidence in mirabeau 's ability to re-establish she husband 's power on a sufficient and satisfactory basis so full be she conversation during the latter part of the interview of the good which she expect to be again able to do and of the warm affection with which she regard the people the benefit of this new alliance be not to be all on one side mirabeau be overwhelm with debt and though he father have die in the precede summer he have not yet enter into he inheritance but be in a state little short of absolute destitution from this condition he be to be relieved and the arrangement for the discharge of he debt and the secure to he the enjoyment of a sufficient though by no means excessive income be intrust to marie antoinette by the king and by she to she almoner m de fontange who when loménie de brienne be promote to the archbishopric of sen have succeed he at toulouse the archbishop who be sincerely devote to he royal mistress carry out the necessary arrangement with great skill but they could not be manage with such secrecy as entirely to escape notice among the club which have be set on foot at the beginning of the previous year the most violent have be that know as the breton club from be found by some of the deputy from the great province of brittany but when the court remove to pari and the assembly be establish in a large building close to the garden of the tuilery the breton obtain the use of a apartment in a old convent of dominican or jacobin friar -lrb- as they be call -rrb- the same which two century before have be the council-room of the league and they change they own designation also and call themselves the jacobin and cancel the rule which limit the right of membership to deputy they now admit every one who by application for election avow he adherence to they principle they leader at this time be barnave a young noble name alexander lameth whose mother have be leave in necessitous circumstance owe to the bounty of the king and queen the means of educate she child a benefit which they repay with the most unremitting hostility to the whole royal family and a lawyer name duport mirabeau be in the habit of ridicule they as the triumvirate but they be crafty and unscrupulous man skillful in procure information and have obtain intelligence of he negotiation with the court they retaliate on he by hire pamphleteer and journalist to attack he and narrative of the treason of the count de mirabeau be hawk about the street to apply such language to the adherence of a french noble to the crown be the most open avowal of disloyalty on which the revolutionary party have yet venture and in the next four week it receive a practical development in a series of measure some of which be so ridiculous as only to deserve notice from the additional evidence which they furnish of the extreme folly of those who now have the lead in the assembly and of the strange excitement in which the whole nation or at least the whole population of pari must have be work up before they could mistake they act for those of sagacity or patriotism but other of which though not less unwise be of greater importance as be irrevocable step in the downward course of destruction along which the whole country be be drag the leader of the revolutionary party have already select two day in the past year as especially memorable for the triumph win over the crown : one be the 20th of June on which in the tennis court at versaille the member of the assembly have bind themselves to effect the regeneration of the kingdom the other the 14th of July on which as they boast they have forever establish freedom by the destruction of the bastile and they determine this year to celebrate both these anniversary in a become manner accordingly on the 20th of June a crack-brained member of the jacobin club a prussian of noble birth name clootz who to show he affinity with the philosopher of old have assume the name of anacharsis hire a band of vagrant and idler and dress they up in a variety of costume to represent arab red indian turk chinese laplander and other tribe savage and civilized lead they into the assembly as a deputation from all the nation of the earth to announce the resurrection of the whole world from slavery and demand permission for they to attend the festival of the ensue month that each on behalf of he country might give in he adhesion to the principle of liberty as expound by the assembly the president of the day reply with a oration thanking m clootz for the honor do to france by such a embassy and alexander lameth follow up the president 's harangue by fresh praise of the deputation as holy pilgrim who have throw off the shackle of superstition nor be he content with a barren panegyric he have devise a appropriate sacrifice with which to commemorate such exalted virtue in the finest square of the city the place des victoire the duke de la feuillade have erect a statue of loui xiv to celebrate he royal master 's triumph the pedestal of which be decorate with allegorical representation of the nation which have be conquer by the french marshal it be generally regard as the finest work of art in the city and as such it have long be a object of admiration and pride to the citizen but m lameth in he new-born enthusiasm regard it with other eye and close he speech by propose that as monument of despotism and flattery could not fail to be shocking to so enlighten a body the assembly should order its instant demolition he proposal be receive with enthusiastic cheer and the noble monument be instantly overthrow in a fit of blind fury more resemble the orgy of drunken bacchanal or the thirst for desolation which have animated the goth and hun than the conduct of the choose legislator of a polite and accomplished people but even this be not all the insult to the memory of a king who little as he deserve it have a century before be the object of the unanimous admiration of he subject be but a prelude to other resolution of far greater moment as give a indelible character to the future of the nation a deputy m lambel whose very name be previously unknown to the majority of he colleague rise and make a speech of three line as if the proposal which it contain only require to be mention to command instant and universal assent this day say he be the tomb of vanity i demand the suppression of the title of duke count marquis viscount baron and knight la fayette and alexander lameth 's brother charle support the demand with almost equal brevity a representative of one of the most ancient family in the kingdom the viscount matthieu de montmorency move a prohibition of the use of armorial bearing another noble m de st targeau propose that the use of name derive from the estate of the owner should be abolish every proposal be carry by acclamation louder and louder cheer follow each suggestion of a new abolition a member who venture to propose a amendment to one proposal be hoot down and in little more than a hour the whole series of resolution which strike at once at the recollection and glory of the past and at the dignity of the future be make the law of the land every one of these attack on the noble be a fresh provocation to mirabeau and increase he eagerness to complete he reconciliation with the crown he pronounce the abolition of title a torch to kindle civil war and press more earnestly than ever for a interview with the queen in which he might both learn she view and explain he own marie antoinette have foresee that she should be force to admit he to she presence but there be nothing to which she feel a stronger repugnance he profligate character excite a feeling of perfect disgust in she mind but for the public good she overcome it and have in the course of June remove to st cloud for change of air on the 3d of July she accompany by the king receive he in the garden of that palace the account which she send she brother of the interview show with what a mixture of feeling she have be agitate she speak of herself as shiver with horror as the moment draw near and can not bring herself to describe he except as a monster though she admit that he language speedily remove she agitation which when he be first present to she have nearly make she ill he seem to be actuate by entire good faith and to be altogether devote to the king and loui be highly please with he so that they now think every thing be safe -lrb- 6 -rrb- she on she part have make a equally favorable impression on he she have adroitly flatter he high opinion of himself by say that if she have be speak to person of a different class and character she should have feel the necessity of be guard in she language but that in deal with a mirabeau there could be no need of such caution and he tell he confidant la marck that till he know the soul and thought of the daughter of marium teresa and learn how fully he could reckon on that August ally he have see nothing of the court but its weakness but now confidence have raise he courage and gratitude have make the prosecution of he principle a duty -lrb- 7 -rrb- and in some subsequent letter he speak of every thing as depend on the queen and describe in brief but forcible language he appreciation of the danger which surround she and of the magnanimous courage with which he see that she be prepare to confront they the king he say have but one man about he and that be he wife there be no safety for she but in the reestablishment of the royal authority i love to believe that she would not desire to preserve life without the crown what i be quite certain of be that she will not preserve she life unless she preserve she crown in he interview with she as she report it to the emperor he have recommend as the first step to be adopt by the king and herself a departure from pari and in reference to that plan which he at all time regard as the foundation of every other he tell la marck : the moment will soon come when it will be necessary to try what can be do by a woman and a child on horseback for she it be but the adoption of a hereditary mode of action -lrb- 8 -rrb- but she must be prepare for it and must not suppose that one can extricate one 's self from a extraordinary crisis by mere chance or by the combination of a ordinary man the hope with which the acquisition of such a ally inspire the queen at this time nerve she to bear she part in the festival with which the assembly have decide on celebrate the demolition of the bastile the arrangement for it be of a gigantic character round the side of the champ de mar a vast embankment be raise so as to give the plain the appearance of a amphitheatre and to afford accommodation to three hundred thousand spectator at the entrance a magnificent arch of triumph be erect the center be occupy by a grand altar and on one side a gorgeous pavilion be appropriate to the king he family and retinue the member of the assembly and the municipal magistrate they be all to be performer in the grand ceremony which be to be the distinguish feature of the day the constitution be scarcely more complete than it have be when loui signify he acceptance of it five month before but now not only be he the deputy and municipal authority of pari to swear to its maintenance but the same oath be to be take by the national guard and by a deputation from every regiment in the army and it be to bind the soldier throughout the kingdom to the new order of thing that the ceremony be originally design -lrb- 9 -rrb- as a spectacle few have be more successful and perhaps none have ever be so impose before midnight on the 13th of July the whole of the vast amphitheatre be fill with a dense crowd in its gayest holiday attire -- a marvelous and magnificent sight from its mere number and early the next morning the head of the procession begin to defile under the arch at the entrance of the plain -- la fayette at the head of the national guard lead the way it be a curious proof of the king 's weakness and of the tenacity with which he cling to he policy of conciliation that in spite of he knowledge of the general 's bitter animosity to he authority and to himself and of he recent vote for the suppression of all title of honor loui have offer he the sword of the constable of france a dignity which have be disuse for many year and it be a equally striking evidence of la fayette 's inveterate disloyalty that gratify as the succession to duguesclin and montmorency would have be to he vanity he nevertheless refuse the honor and contented himself with the dignity which the enrollment of the detachment from the different department under he banner confer on he by give he the appearance of be the commander-in-chief of the national guard throughout the kingdom the national guard be follow by regiment after regiment and deputation after deputation of the regular army and to show the subordination to the law which they be expect to acknowledge for the future they sword be all sheathe while the deputy the municipal magistrate and other peaceful citizen who bear a part in the procession have they sword draw sailor from the fleet magistrate and deputation from every department and from every city or town of importance in the kingdom follow and after they come two hundred priest with talleyrand bishop of autun in he episcopal vestment at they head they white robe somewhat uncanonically decorate with tricolor ribbon who pass on into the center of the plain and range themselves on the step of the altar so vast be the procession that it be half-past three in the afternoon before the detachment of royal guard which close it take up they position when at last all be in they place loui accompany by the queen and other member of he family enter the royal pavilion he be know by sight to the deputation from the most distant province for he have review they in a body the day before when several of they have be separately present to he toward whom he have for once lay aside he habitual reserve assure they of he fatherly regard for all he subject with warmth and manifest sincerity the queen too as she always do have make a most favorable impression on those member whom she have see by she judicious and cordial affability loui wear no robe but only the ordinary dress of a french noble marie antoinette be in full evening costume and she hair be dress with a plume of tricolor feather yet even on this day which be intend to be one of universal joy and friendliness evil sign be not want to show how powerful be the enemy of both king and queen for no seat whatever have be provide for she while by the aide of that construct for the king another on very nearly the same level have be place for the president of the assembly but these refinement of discourtesy be lose on the spectator they cheer the royal pair joyously the moment that they appear before the shout have die away bishop talleyrand begin the service of the mass and on its termination administer the oath of fidelity to the nation the law the king and the constitution as decree by the assembly and accept by the king la fayette take the oath first in the name of the army talleyrand follow on behalf of the clergy bailly come next as the representative of the citizen of pari it be a stormy day and when the moment arrive for the king to set the seal to the universal acceptance of the constitution by swearing to exert all he own power for its maintenance the rain come down so heavily as to render it impossible for he to leave the shelter of he own pavilion as it happen the momentary disappointment give a greater effect to he act with more than usual presence of mind he advance to the front of the pavilion so as to be see by the whole of the assemble multitude and take the oath with a loud voice and perfect dignity of manner as he resume he seat the rain clear away the sun burst through the cloud and the queen as if by a sudden inspiration bring forward the little dauphin and lift he up in she arm show he to the people those whom the king 's voice could not reach see the graceful action and from every side of the plain one universal acclamation burst forth which seem to bear out marie antoinette 's favorite assertion that the people be good at heart and that it be not without great perseverance in artifice and malignity that they could be excite to disloyalty and treason chapter xxviii great tumult in the province -- mutiny in the marquis de bouillé 's army -- disorder of the assembly -- difficulty of manage mirabeau -- mercy be remove to the hague -- marie antoinette see constant change in the aspect of affair -- marat denounce she -- attempt be make to assassinate she -- resignation of mirabeau -- misconduct of the emigrant prince but man less blind by the feverish excitement of revolutionary enthusiasm would have see but little in the state of france at this time to regard as matter for exultation many of the recent measure of the assembly and especially the extinction of the old province have create great discontent in the rural district formidable riot have break out in many quarter especially in the great southern city in some of which the mob have rival the worst excess of its parisian brethren massacre the magistrate tear they body into piece and terrifying the peaceable inhabitant by procession in which the mangled remains of they victim form the most conspicuous feature at brest and at toulon the sailor show that they fully share the general dissatisfaction while in the army a formidable mutiny break out among the troops which be under the command of the marquis de bouillé in lorraine that indeed have a different object since it have be excite by jacobin emissary who be aware that the marquis the soldier who of the whole french army at that time enjoy the highest reputation be firmly attach to the king though he be not one of the noble who have oppose all reform nor have he hesitate to follow he royal master 's example and to declare he acceptance of the new constitution fortunately he have subaltern worthy of he and faithful to they oath and as he be a man of great promptitude and decision he with they aid quell the mutiny though not without a sanguinary conflict in which he himself lose above four hundred man while the loss which he inflict on the mutineer be far heavier but he have set a noble example and have give a undeniable proof of the possibility of quell the most formidable tumult and it may be say that he quarter be the only spot in all france which be not wholly give up to anarchy and disorder for even the assembly itself be a prey to tumult and violence from the time of its assume that title admission have be give to every one who could force he way into the chamber whether he be a member or not nor be any order preserve among those who thus obtain admission but they be allow to express they opinion of every speaker and of every speech by friendly or unfriendly clamor : a practice which as may well be suppose materially influence many vote and presently attendance for that purpose become a trade some of the most violent deputy hire a regularly appoint troop to take they station in the gallery and pay they daily wages to applaud or hiss in accordance with the sign which they themselves make from the body of the hall -lrb- 1 -rrb- and if the populace be thus the master of the assembly while at versaille this be far more the case after its removal to pari where the number of the idle portion of the population furnish the jacobin with far greater means of intimidate they adversary it be remarkable that la marck himself as have be already intimate do not fully share the hope which the king and queen found on the adhesion of mirabeau it be not only that on one point he have sounder view than mirabeau himself -- doubt as he do whether the mischief which he vehement friend have formerly do could now be undo by the same person merely because he have change he mind -- but he also feel doubt of mirabeau 's steadiness in he new path and fear lest eagerness for popularity or a innate levity of disposition might still lead he astray as he describe he in a letter to mercy he be sometimes very great and sometimes very little he could be very useful and he could be very mischievous : in a word he be often above and sometimes greatly below any other man at another time he speak of he as by turn imprudent through excess of confidence and lukewarm from distrust and this estimate of the great demagogue which be not very incorrect show too how high a opinion la marck have form of the queen 's ability and force of character for he look to she to put a curb on he inconstancy -lrb- 2 -rrb- trust for that result not so much to she power of fascination as to she clearness of view and resolution and she herself be never so mislead by she high estimate of mirabeau 's ability and influence as to think he judgment unerr on the contrary she comment to mercy on one of the earliest letter which he address to the king be that it be full of madness from one end to the other and she ask how he or any one else could expect that at such a moment the king and she could be induce to provoke a civil war allude apparently to he urgent advice that the royal family should leave paris a step of the necessity for which she be not yet convinced she hope evidently be that he would bring forward some motion in the assembly which might at least arrest the progress of mischief and perhaps even pave the way for the repair of some of the evil already do on one point she partly agree with he but not wholly he insist on the necessity of dismiss the minister but she though think they both as a body and individually unequal to the crisis see great difficulty in replace they since the vote of the precede winter forbid the king to select they successor from the member of the assembly -lrb- 3 -rrb- and she fear also lest if he should dismiss they the assembly would carry out a plan which as it seem to she it already show great inclination to adopt of manage every thing by means of committee and prevent the appointment of any new administration she view of the situation and of the king 's and she position vary from time to time as indeed they circumstance and the view of the assembly appear to alter in August she be in great distress cause by a decision of the emperor to remove mercy to the hague i be she write to the embassador in despair at you departure especially at a moment when affair be become every day more embarrassing and more painful and when i have therefore the greater need of a attachment as sincere and enlighten as yours but i feel that all the power under different pretext will withdraw they minister one after another it be impossible to leave they incessantly expose to this disorder and license but such be my destiny and i be force to endure the horror of it to the very end -lrb- 4 -rrb- but a fortnight later she tell madame de polignac that for some day thing have be wear a better complexion she can not feel very sanguine the mischievous folk have such a interest in pervert every thing and in hinder every thing which be reasonable and such means of do so but at the moment the number of ill-intentioned people be diminish or at least the right-thinking of all class and of all rank be more unite you may depend upon it she add that misfortune have not diminish my resolution or my courage : i shall not lose any of that they will only give I more prudence -lrb- 5 -rrb- indeed she own strength of mind fortitude and benevolence be the only thing in france which be not constantly change at this time and she derive one lesson from the continue vicissitude to which she be expose which if partly grievous be also in part full of comfort and encouragement to so warm a heart it be in moment such as these that one learn to know man and to see who be truly attach to one and who be not i gain every day fresh experience in this point sometimes cruel sometimes pleasant for i be continually find that some people be truly and sincerely attach to we to whom i never give a think another of she old vexation be revive in the renewed jealousy of austrian influence with which the jacobin leader at this time inspire the mob and which be so great that when in the autumn leopold send the young prince de lichtenstein as he envoy to notify he accession marie antoinette could only venture to give he a single audience and greatly as she enjoy the opportunity of gathering from he news of vienna and of the old friend of the childhood of whom she still cherish a affectionate recollection she be yet force to dismiss he after a few minute ' conversation and to beg he to accelerate he departure from paris lest even that short interview should be make a pretext for fresh calumny the kindest thing that any austrian of mark could do for she she tell she brother be to keep away from pari at present -lrb- 6 -rrb- she would gladly have see the assembly interest itself a little in the politics of the empire where leopold 's own situation be full of difficulty but the french have not yet come to consider themselves as justified in interfere in the internal government of other country as she describe they feeling to the emperor they feel they own individual trouble but those of they neighbor do not yet affect they and the name of liberty and despotism be so deeply engraved in they head even though they do not clearly define they that they be everlastingly pass from the love of the former to the dread of the latter and then she add a sketch of she own idea and expectation and of the object which she conceive it she duty to keep in view in which it be affect to see that she utter despair of any future happiness for the king and herself in no degree weaken she desire to promote the happiness of the very people who have cause she suffering we task be to watch skillfully for the moment when man 's head have return to proper idea sufficiently to make they enjoy a reasonable and honest freedom such as the king have himself always desire for the happiness of he people but far from that license and anarchy which have precipitate the fairest of kingdom into all possible misery we health continue good but it would be better if we could only perceive the least gleam of happiness around we as for ourselves that be at a end forever happen what will i know that it be the duty of a king to suffer for other and it be one which we be discharge thoroughly she have indeed at this time suffering to which it be characteristic of she undaunted courage that she never make the slightest allusion in she letter of all the jacobin party one of the most blood-thirsty be a wretch name marat -lrb- 7 -rrb- at the very outset of the revolution he have establish a newspaper to which he give the name of _ the people 's friend _ and the staple topic of which be the desirableness of bloodshed and massacre he have be exasperate at the reception give to the royal family at the festival of July and for some week afterward he effort be direct to inflame the populace to a new riot in which the king and queen should be drag into pari from st cloud as in 1789 they have be drag in from versaille and which should end in the murder of the queen the minister and several hundred of other innocent person and he denunciation very nearly bear a part of they intended fruit the royal family have hardly return to st cloud when a man name rotondo be apprehend in the inner garden who confess that he have make he way into it with the express design of assassinate marie antoinette a design which be only balk by the fortunate accident of a heavy shower which prevent she from leave the house and a week or two afterward a second plot be discover the contriver of which design to poison she she attendant be greatly alarmed and she physician furnished madame campan with a antidote for such poison as seem most likely to be employ but marie antoinette herself care little for such precaution assassination be not the end which she anticipate on one occasion when she find madame campan change some powdered sugar which it be suspect might have be tamper with she thank she and praise m vicq-d'azyr the physician by whose instruction madame campan be act but tell she that she be give herself needless trouble depend upon it she add they will not employ a grain of poison against I the brinvillier -lrb- 8 -rrb- do not belong to this age people now use calumny which be much more effectual for kill people and it be by calumny that they will work my destruction -lrb- 9 -rrb- but even thus if my death only secure the throne to my son i shall willingly die one of the measure which mirabeau strongly urge and as to which marie antoinette hesitate balance the difficulty to which it be not unlikely to give rise against the advantage which be more obvious be arrange without she intervention necker have but one panacea for all the ill of a defective constitution or a ill-regulated government -- the re-establishment of the finances of the country and as public confidence be indispensable to national credit the trouble of the last year have largely increase the embarrassment of the treasury he be also but scantily endowed with personal courage in the denunciation of marat he have not be spare and by the beginning of September fear have so predominate over every other feeling in he mind that he resolve to quit a country which as he be not one of she son seem to he to have no such claim on he allegiance that he should imperil he life for she sake but in carry out he determination he exhibit a strange forgetfulness not only of the respect due to he royal master as king but also of all the ordinary rule of propriety for he do not resign he office into the hand of the sovereign from whom he have receive it but he announce he retirement to the assembly send the president of the week a letter in which he attribute he reason for the step partly to he health which he describe as weak and partly to the mortal anxiety of he wife as virtuous as she be dear to he heart it be hardly to be wonder at that the member present be move rather to laughter than to sympathy by this sentimental effusion they take no notice of the letter and pass to the order of the day and certainly if it afford evidence of he amiable disposition it supply proof at least equally strong of the weakness of he character and of he consequent unfitness for any post of responsibility at such a time it be more to he credit that he at the same time place in the treasury a sum of two million of franc to cover any incorrectness which might be discover or suspect in he account and any loss which might be sustain from the depreciation of the paper money lately issue under he administration though not with he approbation all the rest of he colleague retire at the same time except the foreign secretary m montmorin they have recently be attack with great violence in the assembly by a combination of the most extreme democrat and the most extreme royalist the latter of whom accuse they of have betray the royal authority by unworthy accession but though in the division which have take place they have be support by a considerable majority they fear a repetition of the attack and resign they office in some degree undoubtedly weaken they royal master by they retirement since those by whom he find himself compel to replace they have still less of he confidence two -- duport de tertre keeper of the seal and duportail minister of war -- be creature of la fayette and the first mention be notoriously unfriendly to the queen two other -- lambert the successor of necker and fleurieu the minister of marine -- be under the influence of barnave and the jacobin the only member of the new ministry who be in the least degree acceptable to loui be m de lessart the minister of the interior but he though loyal in purpose be of too moderate talent for he appointment to add any real strength to the royal cause marie antoinette however pay but little attention to these ministerial change she disregard they -- and she view be not unsound -- as but the displacement of one set of weak man by another set equally weak and she see too that the assembly have establish so complete a mastery over the government that even man of far greater ability and force of character would have be impotent for good she whole dependence be on mirabeau and he course at this time be so capricious and erratic that it often cause she more perplexity and alarm than pleasure or confidence he regard himself as have a very difficult part to play he could not conceal from himself that he be no longer able to lead the assembly as he have do at first except when he be urge it along a road which it desire to take in spite of one of he most brilliant effort of eloquence he have recently be defeat in a endeavor to preserve to the king the right of peace and war and to regain he ascendency he more than once in the course of the autumn support measure to which the king and queen have the greatest repugnance and make speech so inflammatory that even he own friend la marck be indignant at he language and expostulate with he with great earnestness he justify himself by explain he view -lrb- 10 -rrb- that no man in the country could at present bring the people back to reasonable notion that they could only at this moment be govern by flattering they prejudice that the king must trust to time alone and that he own sole prospect of be of use to the crown lay in he preservation of he popularity till the favorable moment should arrive even if to preserve that popularity it be necessary for he at time still to appear a supporter of revolutionary principle it be not impossible that the motive which he thus describe do really influence he but it be not strange that marie antoinette should fail to appreciate such refine subtlety she have look forward to he take a bold straightforward course in defense of royalist principle and she could hardly believe in the honesty of a man who for any object whatever could seem to disregard or to despise they she feeling may be show by some extract from one of she letter to the emperor write just after one of mirabeau 's most violent outburst apparently he speech in support of a motion that the fleet should be order to hoist the tricolor flag October 22d 1790 we be again fall back into chaos and all we old distrust mirabeau have send the king some note a little violent in language but well argue on the necessity of prevent the usurpation of the assembly when on a question concern the fleet he deliver a speech suit only to a violent demagogue enough to frighten all honest man here again all we hope from that quarter be overthrow the king be indignant and i be in despair he have write to one of he friend in whom i have great confidence a man of courage and devote to we a explanatory letter which seem to I neither a explanation nor a excuse the man be a volcano which would set a empire on fire and we be to trust to he to put out the conflagration which be devour we he will have a great deal to do before we can feel confidence in he again la marck defend mirabeau and maintain that if at time he break away he be still in reality faithful to the monarchy the king will not believe this he be greatly irritated yesterday la marck say that he have no doubt that mirabeau think that he be act well in speak as he do to throw dust in the eye of the assembly and so to obtain greater credit when circumstance still more grave should arise o my god if we have commit fault we have sadly expiate they -lrb- 11 -rrb- and before the end of the year the royal cause have fresh difficulty throw in its way by the perverse and selfish wrongheadedness of the emigrant prince who be already evince a inclination to pursue object of they own and to disown all obedience to the king on the plea that he be no longer master of he policy or of he action they show such open disregard of he remonstrance that in December as marie antoinette tell the emperor loui have write both to the count d'artoi and to the king of sardinium -lrb- in whose dominion the count be at the time -rrb- that if he brother persist in they design he should be compel to disavow they peremptorily and summon all he subject who be still faithful to he to return to they obedience she hope she say that that would make they pause it seem certain to she that no one but those on the spot no one but themselves could judge what moment and what circumstance be favorable for action so as to put a end to they own misery and to those of france and it will be then she conclude my dear brother that i shall reckon on you friendship and that i shall address myself to you with the confidence with which i be inspire by the feeling of you heart which be well know to I and by the good-will which you have show we on all occasion -lrb- 12 -rrb- chapter xxix loui and marie antoinette contemplate foreign intervention -- the assembly pass law to subordinate the church to the civil power -- insolence of la fayette -- marie antoinette refuse to quit france by herself -- the jacobin and la fayette try to revive the story of the necklace -- marie antoinette with she family -- flight from pari be decide on -- the queen 's preparation and view -- a oath to observe the new ecclesiastical constitution be impose on the clergy -- the king 's aunt leave france the last sentence of the letter just quote point to a new hope which the king and she have begin to entertain of obtain aid from foreign prince as it can hardly have be suggest to they by any other adviser we may probably attribute the origination of the idea to the queen who be naturally incline to rate the influence of the empire highly and to rely on she brother 's zeal to assist she confidently and loui catch at it as the only means of extricate he from a religious difficulty which be cause he great distress and which appear to he insurmountable by any means which he could command in he own country as have be already see he have have no hesitation in yield up he own prerogative and in make any concession or surrender which the assembly require so long as they touch nothing but he own authority he have even -lrb- which be a far greater sacrifice in he eye -rrb- sanction the vote which have deprive the church of its property but in the course of the autumn the assembly pass other measure also which appear to he absolutely inconsistent with religion they frame a new ecclesiastical constitution which not only reduce the number of bishop -lrb- which indeed in france as in all other roman catholic country have be unreasonably excessive -rrb- but which also vest the whole patronage of the church in the municipal authority and generally subordinate the church to the civil law and have complete these arrangement which to a conscientious roman catholic bear the character of sacrilege they require the whole body of the clergy to accept they and to take a oath to observe they faithfully loui be in a great strait many of the chief prelate appeal to he for protection which he think he duty as a christian man bind he to afford they but the protection which they implore could only be give by refusal of the royal assent to the bill and he could not disguise from himself that such a exercise of he veto would furnish a pretext to he enemy for more violent denunciation of himself and the queen than have yet be hear he have also though he personal safety be at all time very slightly regard by he begin to feel himself a prisoner at the mercy of he enemy la fayette as commander-in-chief of the national guard of pari have the protection of the royal palace intrust to he and he avail himself of this charge not as the guardian of the royal family but rather as they jailer -lrb- 1 -rrb- place he sentry so as to be spy and a restraint upon all they movement and seek every opportunity to gain a ignoble popularity by a ostentatious disregard of all they wish and of all courtesy not to say decency in he behavior to they -lrb- 2 -rrb- and these consideration lead the king not only to authorize the baron de breteuil who as we have see have flee from the country in the previous year to treat with any foreign prince who might he willing to exert themselves in he cause but even to write with he own hand to the principal sovereign inform they that in spite of he acceptance of the constitution the factious portion of he subject openly manifest they intention of destroy the monarchy and suggest the idea of a armed congress of the principal power of europe support by a armed force as the best measure to arrest the progress of faction to re-establish order in france and to prevent the evil which be devour he country from seize on the other state of europe -lrb- 3 -rrb- the historian of the democratic party have denounce with great severity the conduct of loui in thus appeal to foreign aid as a proof that in spite of he acceptance of the constitution he be meditate a counter - revolution the whole tenor of he and the queen 's correspondence prove that this charge be groundless but it be equally certain that it be a impolitic step one wholly oppose to every idea of constitutional principle of which the very foundation must always be perfect freedom from foreign influence and from foreign connection in the internal government of the country fortunately he secret be well keep so that no knowledge of this step reach the leader of the popular party and however great may have be the queen 's secret anxiety and fear she keep they bravely to herself display outwardly a serenity and a patience which win the admiration of all those who in foreign country be watch the course of event in france with interest -lrb- 4 -rrb- when she weep she weep by herself she one comfort be that she child be always with she and though the dauphin could only witness without understand she grief remark on one occasion when in one of he childish book he meet the expression ` as happy as a queen ' that all queen be not happy for he mamma weep from morning till night she daughter be old enough to enter into she sorrow and as she write to madame de polignac mingle she own tear with hers she have also the society of she sister-in-law elizabeth whom she have learn to love with a affection which could not be exceed even by that which she bear she own sister and which be cordially return she tell madame de polignac that elizabeth 's calmness be one great relief and support to they all and elizabeth can not find adequate word to express to one of she correspondent she admiration for the queen 's piety and resignation which alone enable she to bear up against trouble such as no one before have ever know but amidst all she grief she cherish hope -- hope that the people -lrb- the good people as she invariably term they -rrb- will return to they sens and she other habitual feeling of benevolence though she can now only exert it in form project for confer further benefit on they when tranquillity should be restore the feeling show itself even in letter which have no reference to she own position there have be discontent and sign of insurrection in the netherland which mercy 's recent letter lead she to believe be pass away and she congratulation to she brother on this peaceful result dwell on the happiness which it be to be able to pardon one 's subject without shed one drop of blood of which sovereign be bind to be always careful -lrb- 5 -rrb- she brother and many of she friend in france be at this time press she to quit the country profess to believe that if she enemy know that she be out of they reach they would be less vehement in they hostility to the king but she feel that such a course would be both unworthy of she as timid and selfish and in every way injurious rather than beneficial to she husband it could not save he authority which be what the jacobin make it they first object to destroy and it would deprive he of the support of she affection and advice which he constantly need pardon I i beg of you she reply to leopold if i continue to reject you advice to leave paris consider that i do not belong to myself my duty be to remain where providence have place I and to oppose my body if the necessity should arise to the knife of the assassin who would fain reach the king i should be unworthy of the name of we mother which be as dear to you as to I if danger could make I desert the king and my child -lrb- 6 -rrb- we have see that marie antoinette dreaded calumny more than the knife or poison of the assassin and there could hardly have be a greater proof how well found she apprehension be and how unscrupulous she enemy than be afford by the fact that in the latter part of this year they actually bring back madame la mothe to pari with the purpose of make a demand for a re-investigation of the whole story of the fraud on the jeweler -- a pretense for revive the libelous story to the disparagement of the queen the utter falsehood and absurdity of which have be demonstrate to the satisfaction of the whole world four year before nor be it wholly a jacobin plot la fayette himself be to a certain extent a accomplice in it as commander of the national guard of the city it be he duty to apprehend one who be a escape convict but instead of do so he prefer identify himself with she and on one occasion have what mirabeau rightly call the inconceivable insolence to threaten the queen with a divorce on the ground of unfaithfulness to she husband she treat he insinuation with the dignity which become herself and the scorn which they and they utterer deserve and he find that he conduct have create such general disgust among all people who make the slightest pretense to decency that he fear to lose he popularity if he do not disconnect himself from the plotter accordingly he separate himself from the lady though he still forbear to arrest she and for some time confine himself to he old course of heap on the royal family these petty annoyance and insult which he could inflict with impunity because they be unobserved except by he victim it be remarkable however that mirabeau who hold he in a contempt which however deserve have in it some touch of rivalry and envy believe that the queen be not really so much the object of he animosity as the king in he eye all the maneuver of la fayette be so many attack on the queen and he attack on the queen be so many step to bring he within reach of the king it be the king whom he really want to strike and he see that the individual safety of one of the royal pair be as inseparable from that of the other as the king be from he crown -lrb- 7 -rrb- and this opinion of mirabeau be strongly corroborate by the count de la marck who a few week later have occasion to go to alsace and who take great pain to ascertain the general state of public feeling in the district through which he pass during he absence he be in constant correspondence with those whom he have leave behind and he report with great satisfaction that in no part of the country have he find the very slightest ill-feeling toward the queen it be in pari alone that the different libel against she be forge and there alone that they find acceptance and manifestly refer to the project departure from paris he express he firm conviction that the moment that she be at liberty and able to show herself in the province she will win the confidence of all class -lrb- 8 -rrb- however greatly mirabeau would on other grounds have prefer personal intercourse with the court he think that he power of usefulness depend so entirely on he connection with it be unsuspected that he do not think it prudent to solicit interview with the queen but he keep up a constant communication with the court sometimes by note and elaborate memorial address indeed to loui but intend for marie antoinette 's perusal and consideration and sometimes by conversation with la marck which the count be expect to repeat to she but in all the counsel thus give the thing most to be remark be the high opinion which they invariably display of the queen 's resolution and ability every thing depend on she it be from she alone that he wish to receive instruction it be she resolution that must supply the deficiency of all around she when he urge that a line of conduct should be adopt calculate to render they majesty more popular that they should show themselves more in public that they should walk in the most frequented place that they should visit the hospital the artisan ' workshop and make themselves friend by act of charity and generosity it be to she that he look to carry out he suggestion and to she affability and presence of mind that he trust for the success which be to result from they -lrb- 9 -rrb- and la marck be equally convince that she ability and resolution be equal to the conduct of affair of the first importance meantime she health continue good it show she strength of mind that she never intermit the recreation which contribute to she strength about which she be especially anxious that she might at all time be ready to act on any emergency but ride with elizabeth with great regularity in the bois de boulogne even in the depth of the winter and while watch with she habitual vigilance of affection over the education of she child she find a pleasant relaxation for herself in provide they with amusement also often arrange party to which other child of the same age be invite and find amusement herself from watch they gambol in the long corridor of the tuilery they blindman 's - buff and hide-and-seek -lrb- 10 -rrb- the new year open with grave plan for they extrication from they trouble -- plan require the utmost forethought ingenuity and secrecy to bring they to a successful issue and also with fresh injury and insult from the assembly and the municipal authority which every week make the necessity of promptitude in carry such plan out more manifest mirabeau as we have see have from the very first recommend that the king and he family should withdraw from paris in he eye such a step be the indispensable preliminary to all other measure and some of the earliest of the queen 's letter in 1791 show that the resolution to leave the turbulent city have at last be take but though what he recommend be to be do it be not to be do as he recommend yet there be a manliness about the course of action which he propose which would of itself have win the queen 's preference if she have not be force to consider not what be best and fittest but what it be most easy to induce he on whom the final choice must impend the king to adopt mirabeau advise that the king should depart publicly in open day like a king as he express himself -lrb- 11 -rrb- and he affirm he conviction that it would in all probability be quite unnecessary to remove farther than compiègne but that the moment that it should be know that the king be out of pari petition demand the re-establishment of order would flock in from every quarter of the kingdom and public opinion which be for the most part royalist would compel the assembly to modify the constitution which it have frame or if it should prove refractory would support the king in dissolve it and convoke another but this be too bold a step for loui to decide on he anticipate that the assembly or the mob might endeavor to prevent such a movement by force which could only be repel by force and force he be resolve never to employ the only alternative be to flee secretly and in the course of January mercy learn that that plan have be adopt and that compiègne be not consider sufficiently distant from pari but that some fortify place will be select valencienne be the most likely as he himself imagine since if farther flight should become necessary it would be easy from thence to cross the frontier into the belgian dominion of the queen 's brother but if valencienne have ever be think of it be reject on that very account for loui have learn from english history that the withdrawal of jame ii from he kingdom have be allege as one reason for declare the throne vacant and he be resolve not to give he enemy any plea for pass a similar resolution with respect to himself valencienne be so celebrated as a frontier town that the mere fact of he fix himself there might easily be represent as a evidence of he intention to quit the kingdom but there be a small town of considerable strength name montmédy in the district under the command of the marquis de bouillé which afford all the advantage of valencienne and do not appear equally liable to the same objection montmédy therefore be fix upon and in the very first week of February marie antoinette announce the decision to mercy and begin she own preparation by send he a jewel-case full of those diamond which be she private property she explain to he at considerable length the reason which have dictate the choice the very smallness of montmédy be in itself a recommendation since it would prevent any one from think it likely to be select as a refuge it be also so near luxembourg that in the present temper of the nation which regard the austrian power with a panic fear any addition which m de bouillé might make to either the garrison or to he supplies would seem only a wise precaution against the much-dreaded foreigner moreover the troops in that district be among the most loyal and well-disposed in the whole army and if the king should find it unsafe to remain long at montmédy he would have a trustworthy escort to retreat to alsace she also explain the reason which have lead they to decide on quit paris secretly by night if they start in the daytime it would be necessary to have detachment of troops plant at different spot on they road to protect they but m de bouillé could not rely on all he own regiment for such a service and still less on the national guard in the different town while to bring up fresh force from distant quarter would attract attention and awaken suspicion beforehand which might be fatal to the enterprise montmédy therefore have be decide on and the plan be already so far settle that she could tell mercy that they should take madame de tourzel with they and travel in one single carriage which they have never be see to use before they preparation have even go beyond these detail minute as they be the king be already collect material for a manifesto which he design to publish the moment that he find himself safely out of paris it would explain the reason for he flight it would declare a amnesty to the people in general to whom it would impute no worse fault than that of be mislead -lrb- none be except but the chief leader of the disloyal faction the city of paris unless it should at once return to its ancient tranquillity and any person or body who might persist in remain in arm -rrb- to the nation in general the manifesto would breathe nothing but affection the parliament would be re-established but only as judicial tribunal which should have no pretense to meddle with the affair of administration or finance in short the king and she have determine to take he declaration of the 23d of June -lrb- 12 -rrb- as the basis of the constitution with such modification as subsequent circumstance might have suggest religion would be one of the matter place in the foreground so sanguine be they or rather be she of success that she have even take into consideration the principle on which future ministry should be constitute and here for the first time she speak of herself as chiefly concern in plan the future arrangement in private we occupy ourselves with discuss the very difficult choice which we shall have to make of the person whom we shall desire to call around we when we be at liberty i think that it will be best to place a single man at the head of affair as m maurepa be formerly and if it be settle in this way the king would thus escape have to transact business with each individual minister separately and affair would proceed more uniformly and more steadily tell I what you think of this idea the fit man be not easy to find and the more i look for he the greater inconvenience do i see in all that occur to I she proceed to discuss foreign affair the probable view and future conduct of almost every power in europe -- of holland prussium spain sweden england still show the linger jealousy which she entertain of the british government which she suspect of wish to detach the chivalrous gustavus from the alliance of france by the offer of a subsidy but she be sanguine that though some may he glad to see the influence of france diminish no wise statesman in any country can desire she ruin or dismemberment what be go on in france would be a example too dangerous to other country if it be leave unpunished they cause be the cause of all king and not a simple political difficulty -lrb- 13 -rrb- the whole letter be a most remarkable one and fully bear out the eulogy which all who have a opportunity of judge pronounced on she ability but the most striking reflection which it suggest be with what admirable sagacity the whole of the arrangement for the flight of the royal family have be concerted and with what judgment the agent have be choose since though the enterprise be not attempt till more than four month after this letter be write the secret be keep through the whole of that time without the slightest hint of it have be give or the slightest suspicion of it have be conceive by the most watchful or the most malignant of the king 's enemy yet during the winter and early spring the conduct of the jacobin party in the assembly and of the parisian mob whom they be keep in a constant state of excitement increase in violence while one occurrence which take place be in mirabeau 's opinion especially calculate to prompt a suspicion of the king 's intention loui have at last and with extreme reluctance sanction the bill which require the clergy to take a oath to comply with the new ecclesiastical arrangement in the vain hope that the framer of it would be content with they triumph and would forbear to enforce it by fix any precise date for administer the oath but at the end of January barnave obtain from the assembly a decree that it should be take within twenty-four hour under the penalty of deprivation of all they preferment to all who should refuse it the clerical member of the assembly be even threaten by the mob in the gallery with instant death if they decline or even delay to swear and as very few of any rank comply the main body of the clergy be instantly strip of all they appointment and reduce to beggary and a large proportion of they flee at once from the kingdom those who take the oath and who in consequence be appoint to the office thus vacate be immediately condemn and denounce by the pope and the consequence be that a great number of they flock flee with they old priest not be able to reconcile to they conscience to stay and receive the sacrament and rite of the church from minister under the ban of its head among those who thus flee be the king 's two aunt the princess adelaide and victoire bigotry be they only virtue and they determine to seek shelter in rome loui highly disapprove of the step which as mirabeau -lrb- 14 -rrb- in a very elaborate and forcible memorial which he draw up and submit to he point out might be very dangerous for the king and queen as well as for themselves since it could be easily represent by the evil-minded as a certain proof that they also be design to flee and he even recommend that loui should formally notify to the assembly that he disapprove of he aunt ' journey and should make it a pretext for demand a law which should give he the power of regulate the movement of the member of he family the flight of the princess however do not as it turn out cause any inconvenience to the king or queen though it do endanger themselves for though they be furnish with passport the municipal authority try to stop they at moret and at arnay-le-duc the mob unharness they horse and detain they by force they appeal to the assembly by letter alexander lameth on this occasion unite with the most violent jacobin be not ashamed to move that order should be dispatch to send they back to paris : but the body of the assembly have not yet descend to the baseness of war with woman and mirabeau who treat the proposal as ridiculous and overwhelm the mover with he wit have no difficulty in procure a order that the fugitive two princess of advanced age and timorous conscience as he call they should be allow to proceed on they journey chapter xxx the mob attack the castle at vincenne -- la fayette save it -- he insult the noble who come to protect the king -- perverseness of the count d'artoi and the emigrant -- mirabeau die -- general sorrow for he death -- he would probably not have be able to arrest the revolution -- the mob prevent the king from visit st cloud -- the assembly pass a vote to forbid he to go more than twenty league from paris the mob however be more completely under jacobin influence and at the end of February santerre collect he ruffian for a fresh tumult the object now be the destruction of the old castle of vincenne which for some time have be almost unoccupied la fayette whose object at this time be apparently regulate by a desire to make all party acknowledge he influence in a momentary fit of resolution march a body of he national guard down to save the old fortress in which he succeed though not without much difficulty and even some danger he find he have greatly miscalculate he influence not only over the populace but over he own soldier the rioter fire on he wound some of he staff and at first many of the soldier refuse to act against the people he officer however full of indignation easily quell the spirit of mutiny and when subordination be restore propose to the general to follow up he success by march at once back into the city and seize the jacobin demagogue who have cause the riot there be little doubt that the great majority of the citizen in they fear of santerre and he gang would joyfully have support he in such a measure but la fayette 's resolution be never very consistent nor very durable he become terrify not indeed so much at the risk to he life which he have incur as at the symptom that to resist the mob might cost he he popularity and to appease those whom he might have offend he proceed to insult the king a report have get abroad which be not improbably well found that loui 's life have be in danger and that a assassin have be detect while endeavor to make he way into the tuilery and the report have reach a number of noble among whom d'esprémesnil once so vehement a leader of the opposition in parliament be conspicuous who at once hasten to the palace to defend they sovereign it be not strange that he and marie antoinette should receive they graciously they have not of late be use to such warm-hearted and prompt display of attachment but the national guard who be on duty be jealous of the cordial and honorable reception which those noble meet with they declare that to they alone belong the task of defend the king though they take so little care to perform it that they have allow a gang of drunken desperado to get possession of the outer court of the palace where they be menace all aristocrat with death loui become alarmed for the safety of he friend and beg they to lay aside they arm and they have hardly do so when la fayette arrive he know that the mob be exasperate with he for he repression of they outrage in the morning and that some of he soldier have not be well please at be compel to act against the rioter so now to recover they good-will he hand over the weapon of the noble which be only pistol rapier and dagger to the national guard and after reproach d'esprémesnil and he companion for interfere with the duty of he troops he drive they down the stair unarmed and defenseless as they be among the drunken and infuriate mob they be hoot and ill-treated but not only do he make no attempt to protect they but the next day he offer they a gratuitous insult by the publication of a general order address to he own national guard in which he stigmatize they conduct as indecent they profess zeal as suspicious and enjoin all the official of the palace to take care that such person be not admit in future the king of the constitution he say ought to be surround by no defender but the soldier of liberty marie antoinette have good reason to speak as she do the next week to mercy though we can hardly fail to remark as a singular proof of the strength of she political prejudice and of the degree in which she allow they to blind she to the object and the worth of the few honest or able man whom the assembly contain that she still regard the constitutionalist as only one degree less unfavorable to the king 's legitimate authority than the jacobin and we shall hereafter see that to this mistaken estimate she adhere almost to the end mischief she say be make progress so rapid that there be reason to fear a speedy explosion which can not fail to be dangerous to we if we ourselves do not guide it there be no middle way either we must remain under the sword of the faction and consequently be reduce to nothing if they get the upper hand or we must submit to be fetter under the despotism of man who profess to be well-intentioned but who always have do and always will do we harm this be what be before we and perhaps the moment be nearer than we think if we can not ourselves take a decide line or lead man 's opinion by we own vigor and energetic action what i here say be not dictate by any exaggerated notion nor by any disgust at we position nor by any restless desire to be do something i perfectly feel all the danger and risk to which we be expose at this moment but i see that all around we affair be so full of terror that it be better to perish in try to save ourselves than to allow ourselves to be utterly crush in a state of absolute inaction -lrb- 1 -rrb- and she hold the same language to she brother the emperor assure he that the king and herself be both convinced of the necessity of act with prudence but there be case in which dilatoriness might ruin every thing and that the factious and disloyal be prosecute they object with such celerity aim at nothing less than the utter subversion of the kingly power that it would be extremely dangerous not to offer a resistance to they plan -lrb- 2 -rrb- and refer to she project of foreign aid she report to he that she have promise of assistance from both spain and switzerland if they could depend on the co-operation of the empire and still the emigrant prince be add to she perplexity by they perverseness she write herself to the count d'artoi to expostulate with he and to entreat he not to abandon himself to project of which the success to say the least be doubtful and which would expose himself to danger without the possibility of serve the king -lrb- 3 -rrb- no description of the relative influence of the king and queen at this time can be so forcible as the fact that it be she who conduct all the correspondence of the court even with the king 's brother but she remonstrance have no influence we may not impute to the king 's brother any intention to injure he but unhappily they have both not only a mean idea of he capacity but a very high one much worse found of they own and full of self-confidence and self-conceit they take they own line perfectly regardless of the suspicion to which they perverse and untractable conduct expose the king carry they obstinacy so far that it be not without difficulty that the emperor himself though they be in he dominion be able to restrain they machination meanwhile the queen be steadily carry on the necessary arrangement for flight money have to be provide for which trustworthy agent be negotiate in switzerland and holland while some the emperor might be expect to furnish mirabeau mark out for himself what he regard as a most important share in the enterprise undertaking to defend and justify they departure to the assembly and nothing doubt that he should be able to bring over the majority of the member to he view of that subject as he have before prevail upon they to sanction the journey of the princess but in the first day of April all the hope of success which have be found on he cooperation and support be suddenly extinguish by he death though he have hardly enter upon middle age a constant course of excess have make he a old man before he time in the latter part of march he be attack by a illness which he physician soon pronounce mortal and on the 2d of April he die he have bear the approach of death with firmness profess to regret it more for the sake of he country than for he own he be leave behind he no one as he affirm who would he able to arrest the revolution as he could have do and there can be no doubt that the great bulk of the nation do place confidence in he power to offer effectual resistance to the design of the jacobin the various party in the state show this feeling equally by the different manner in which they receive the intelligence the court and the royalist openly lament he the jacobin the follower of lameth and the partisan of the duke of orlean exhibit the most indecent exultation -lrb- 4 -rrb- but the citizen of pari mourn for he apparently without reference to party view they take no heed of the opposition with which he have of late often defeat the plot of the leader whom they have follow to riot and treason they cast aside all recollection of the denunciation of he as a friend to the court with which the street have lately ring in they eye he be the personification of the revolution as a whole to he as they view he career for the last two year they owe the independence of the assembly the destruction of the bastile and of all other abuse and through he they doubt not still to obtain every thing that be necessary for the completion of they freedom he remains be treat with honor never before pay to a subject he lay in state he have a public funeral he body be lay in the great church of st geneviève which the very day before have be rename the pantheon and appropriate as a cemetery for such of she illustrious son as france might hereafter think worthy of the national gratitude yet though he great confidant and panegyrist m dumont -lrb- 5 -rrb- have devote a elaborate argument to prove that he have not overestimate he power to influence the future and though the russian embassador m simolin a diplomatist of extreme acuteness seem to imply the same opinion by he pithy say that he ought to have live two year longer or die two year earlier we can hardly agree with they la marck as have be see even when first open the negotiation for he connection with the court doubt whether he would be able to undo the mischief which he have acquiesce in measure not of reform nor of reconstruction but of total abolition and destruction be in they very nature irrevocable and irremediable the nobility be go he have not resist its suppression the church be go he have himself be among the foremost of its assailant how even if he have wish it could he have undo these act and if he could not how without those indispensable pillar and support could any monarchy endure that he be now fully alive to the magnitude of the danger which encompass both throne and people and that he would have labor vigorously to avert they we may do he the justice to believe but it seem not so probable that he would have succeed as that he would have add one more to the list of these politician who have allow they own selfish aim to carry they beyond the limit of prudence and justice have afterward find it impossible to retrace they step but have learn to they shame and sorrow that they rashness have but lead to the disappointment of they hope the permanent downfall of they own reputation and the ruin of what they would gladly have defend and preserve and on the whole it be well that from time to time such lesson should be impress upon the world it be well that man of lofty genius and pure patriotism should learn equally with the most shallow empiric or the most self-seeking demagogue that false step in politics can rarely be retrace that concession once make can seldom if ever be recall but be usually the stepping-stone to other still more extensive that what it would have be easy to preserve it be commonly impossible to repair or to restore he have be lay in the grave only a fortnight when as if on purpose to show how utterly defenseless the king now be the jacobin excite the mob and the assembly to inflict greater insult on he than have be offer even by the attack on versaille or by any previous vote as easter which be unusually late this year approach loui become anxious to spend a short time in tranquillity and holy meditation and since the tumultuousness of the city be not very favorable for such a purpose he resolve to pass a fortnight at st cloud but when he be prepare to set out a furious mob seize the horse and unharnessed they the national guard unite with the rioter refuse to obey la fayette 's order to clear the way for the royal carriage and the king and queen be compel to dismount and to return to they apartment while a day or two afterward the assembly come to a vote which seem as if design for a express sanction of this outrage and which ordain that the king should not be permit ever to move more than twenty league from pari of all the decree which it have yet enact this in some sense may be regard as the most monstrous it be not only pass a penal sentence on the royal family such as in no country or age any but convict criminal have even be subject to but it be a insult and a injury to every part of the kingdom except the capital which by a intolerable assumption it treat as if it be the whole of france joseph as have be see have wisely point out to he brother-in-law that it be one and no unimportant part of a sovereign 's duty to visit the different province and chief city of he kingdom and loui have in one instance act on he advice we have see how gladly he be receive by the citizen of cherbourg and what advantage they promise themselves from he have thus make himself personally acquaint with they situation and want and prospects and we can not doubt that other town and city share this feeling nor that it be well found and that the acquisition by a king of a personal knowledge of the resource and capability and interest of the great city of agriculture manufacture and commerce be a benefit to the whole community but of this every province and every city but pari be now to be deprive it be to be a offense to visit rouen or lyon or bordeaux to examine riquet 's canal or vauban 's fortification the king be the only person in the kingdom to whom liberty of movement be to be deny and the peasant of every province and the citizen of every other town be to be refuse for a single day the presence of they sovereign whom the parisian thus claim a right to keep as a prisoner in they own district it be hardly strange that such open attack on they liberty make a deeper impression on the queen and even on the phlegmatic disposition of the king than any previous act of violence or that it increase they eagerness to escape with as little delay as possible indeed the queen regard the public welfare as equally concern with they own in they safe establishment in some town to which they should also be able to remove the assembly so that that body as well as themselves should be protect from the fatal influence of the club of pari and of the populace which be under the dominion of the club -lrb- 6 -rrb- accordingly on the 20th of April she write to the emperor -lrb- 7 -rrb- that the occurrence which have just take place have confirm they more than ever in they plan the very guard who surround they be the person who threaten they most they very life be not safe but they must appear to submit to every thing till the moment come when they can act and in the mean time they captivity prove that none of they action be do by they own accord and she urge she brother at once to move a strong body of troops toward some of he fortress on the belgian frontier -- arlon vitron or mon -- in order to give m de bouillé a pretext for collect troops and munitions of war at montmédy send I a immediate answer on this point let I know too about the money we position be frightful and we must absolutely put a end to it next month the king desire it even more than i do as may proceeds she press on she preparation and urge the emperor to accelerate he especially the movement of he troops but the count d'artoi and he follower be a terrible addition to she anxiety leopold have tell she that the ancient minister calonne always restless and always unscrupulous be now with the count and be busily stir he up to undertake some enterprise or other -lrb- 8 -rrb- and she reply show how justly she dread the result of such a alliance the prince the count d'artoi and all those whom they have about they seem determine to be do something they have no proper means of action and they will ruin we without we have the slightest connection with they plan they indiscretion and the man who be guide they will prevent we communicate we secret to they till the very last moment to mercy she be even more explicit in she description of the imminence of the danger to which the king and she be now expose than she have be to she brother as the time for attempt to escape grow nearer the embassador become the more painfully impressed with the danger of the attempt failure as it seem to he will be absolutely fatal he ask she anxiously whether the necessity be such that it have become indispensable to risk such a result -lrb- 9 -rrb- and she in a answer of considerable length and admirable clearness of expression and argument explain she reason for decide that it be absolutely unavoidable : the only alternative for we especially since the 18th of April -lrb- 10 -rrb- be either blindly to submit to all that the faction require or to perish by the sword which be forever suspend over we head believe I i be not exaggerate the danger you know that my notion use to be as long as i could cherish it to trust to gentleness to time and to public opinion but now all be change and we must either perish or take the only line which remain to we we be far from shut we eye to the fact that this line also have its peril but if we must die it will be at least with glory and in have do all that we could for we duty for honor and for religion i believe that the province be less corrupted than the capital but it be always pari which give the tone to the whole kingdom we should greatly deceive ourselves if we fancy that the event of the 18th of April horrible as they be produce any excitement in the province the club and the affiliation lead france where they please the right-thinking people and those who be dissatisfy with what be take place either flee from the country or hide themselves because they be not the stronger party and because they have no rallying-point but when the king can show himself freely in a fortify place people will be astonish to see the number of dissatisfied people who will then come forward who till that time be groan in silence but the longer we delay the less support we shall have let we resume you ask two question : 1st be it possible or useful to wait no by the explanation of we position which i give at the beginning of this letter i have sufficiently prove the impossibility as to the usefulness it could only be useful on the supposition that we could count on a new legislative body 2d admit the necessity of act promptly be we sure of means to escape of a place to retreat to and of have a party strong enough to maintain itself for two month by its own resource i have answer this question several time it be more than probable that the king once escape from here and in a place of safety will have and will very soon find a very strong party the means of escape depend on a flight the most immediate and the most secret there be only four person who be acquaint with we secret and those whom we mean to take with we will not know it till the very moment none of we own people will attend we and at a distance of only thirty or thirty-five league we shall find some troops to protect we march but not enough to cause we to be recognize till we reach the place of we destination i can easily conceive the repugnance which on political grounds the emperor would feel to allow he troops to enter france but if they movement be solicit by he brother-in-law he ally whose life existence and honor be in danger i conceive the case be very different and as to brabant that province will never be quiet till this country be bring back to a different state it be then for himself also that my brother will be work in give we this assistance which be so much the more valuable to we that he troops will serve as a example to ours and will even be able to restrain they and it be with this view that the person -lrb- 11 -rrb- of whom i speak to you in my letter in cipher demand they employment for a time we can not delay longer than the end of this month by that time i hope we shall have a decisive answer from spain but till the very instant of we departure we must do everything that be require of we and even appear to go to meet they it be one way perhaps the only one to lull the mob to sleep and to save we life chapter xxxi plan for the escape of the royal family -- danger of discovery -- resolution of the queen -- the royal family leave the palace -- they be recognize at ste menehould -- be arrest at varenne -- tumult in the city and in the assembly -- the king and queen be bring back to paris marie antoinette as we have see have be anxious that they departure from pari should not be delay beyond the end of may and de bouillé have agree with she but enterprise of so complicate a character can rarely be execute with the rapidity or punctuality that be desire and it be not till the 20th of June that this movement on which so much depend be able to be put in execution often during the precede week the queen 's heart sink within she when she reflect on the danger of discovery whether from the acuteness of she enemy or the treachery of pretended friend and even more when she ponder on the character of the king himself so singularly unfitted for a undertaking in which it be not the passive courage with which he be amply endowed but daring resolution promptitude and presence of mind which be requisite she be cheer however by repeat letter from the emperor show the warm and affectionate interest which he take in the result of the enterprise and promising with evident sincerity he own most cordial co-operation in all that could tend to she and she husband 's success when the time should come for he to show himself but she main reliance be on herself and all who be privy to the enterprise know well that it be on she forethought and courage that its success wholly depend those who be privy to it be very few and it be a singular proof how few frenchman even of the highest rank could be trust at this time that of these few two be foreigner -- a swede the count de fersen whose name have be mention in earlier chapter of this narrative and -lrb- a english writer may be proud to add -rrb- a englishman mr craufurd in such undertaking the simplest arrangement be the safest and those devise by the queen and she adviser the chief of whom be de fersen and de bouillé be as simple as possible the royal fugitive be to pass for a travel party of foreigner a passport sign by m montmorin who still hold the seal of the foreign department be provide for madame de tourzel who assume the name of madame de korff a russian baroness profess to be return to she own country with she family and she ordinary equipage the dauphin and he sister be describe as she child the queen as they governess while the king himself under the name of durand be to pass as they servant three of the old disbanded body-guard mm de valory de malden and de moustier be to attend the party in the disguise of courier and under the pretense of provide for the safe conveyance of a large sum of money which be require for the payment of the troops de bouillé undertake to post a detachment of soldier at each town between châlons and montmédy through which the traveler be to pass some of the other arrangement be more difficult as more likely to lead to a betrayal of the design it be of course impossible to use any royal carriage and no ordinary vehicle be large enough to hold such a party but in the preceding year de fersen have have a carriage of unusual dimension build for some friend in the south of europe so that he have no difficulty now in procure another of similar pattern from the same maker and mr craufurd agree to receive it into he stable and at the proper hour to convey it outside the barrier yet in spite of the care display in these arrangement and of the absolute fidelity observe by all to whom the secret be intrust some of the inferior attendant about the court suspect what be in agitation the queen herself with some degree of imprudence send away a large package to brussels one of she waiting-women discover that she and madame campan have spend a evening in pack up jewel and send warn to gouvion a aid-de-camp of la fayette and to bailly the mayor that the queen at last be prepare to flee luckily bailly have receive so many similar notice that he pay but little attention to this or perhaps he be already begin to feel the repentance which he afterward exhibit at he former insolence to he sovereign and be not unwilling to contribute to they safety by he inaction while gouvion be not anxious to reveal the source from which he have obtain he intelligence still though nothing precise be know the attention of more than one person be awaken to the movement of the royal family and especially that of la fayette who alarm lest he prisoner should escape he redouble he vigilance drive down to the palace every night and often visit they in they apartment to make himself certain of they presence six hundred of the national guard be on duty at the tuilery and sentinel be place at the end of every passage and at the foot of every staircase but fortunately a small room with a secret door which lead into the queen 's chamber as it have be for some time unoccupied have escape the observation of the officer on guard and that passage therefore offer a prospect of they be able to reach the courtyard without be perceive -lrb- 1 -rrb- on the morning of the day appoint for the great enterprise all in the secret be vividly excite except the queen she alone preserve she coolness no one could have guess from she demeanor that she be on the point of embark in a undertaking on which in she belief she own life and the life of all those dearest to she depend the child who know nothing of what be go on go to they usual occupation -- the dauphin to he garden on the terrace madame royale to she lesson and marie antoinette herself after give some order which be to be execute in the course of the next day or two go out ride with she sister-in-law in the bois de boulogne she conversation throughout the day be light and cheerful she jest with the officer on guard about the report which she understand to be in circulation about some intended flight of the king and be relieve to find that he totally disbelieve they she even venture on the same jest with la fayette himself who reply in he usual surly fashion that such a project be constantly talk of but even he rudeness could not discompose she as the hour draw near she begin to prepare she child the princess be old enough to be talk to reasonably and she contented herself therefore with warn she to show no surprise at any thing that she might see or hear the dauphin be to be disguise as a girl and it be with great glee that he let the attendant dress he say that he see that they be go to act a play the royal supper usually take place soon after nine at half-past ten the family separate for the night and by eleven they attendant be all dismiss and marie antoinette have fix that hour for depart because even if the sentinel should get a glimpse of they they would be apt to confound they with the crowd which usually quit the palace at that time accordingly at eleven o'clock the count de fersen dress as a coachman drive a ordinary job-carriage into the court-yard and marie antoinette who trust nothing to other which she could do herself conduct madame de tourzel and the child down-stair and seat they safely in the carriage but even she nerve nearly give way when la fayette 's coach brilliantly light drive by pass close to she as he proceed to the inner court to ascertain from the guard that every thing be in its usual condition in a agony of fright she sheltered herself behind some pillar and in a few minute the marquis drive back and she rejoin the king who be await she summons in he own apartment while one of the disguise body-guard go for the princess elizabeth even the child be inspire with they mother 's courage as the princess get into the carriage she tread on the dauphin who be lie in concealment at the bottom and the brave boy speak not a word while loui himself give a remarkable proof how in spite of the want of moral and political resolution which have bring such misery on himself and he country he could yet preserve in the most critical moment he presence of mind and kind consideration for other he be half way down-stair when he return to he room m valory who be escort he be dismay when he see he turn back and venture to remind he how precious be every instant i know that reply the kind-hearted monarch but they will murder my servant to-morrow for have aid my escape and sit down at he table he write a few line declare that the man have act under he peremptory order and give the note to he as a certificate to protect he from accusation when all the rest be seat the queen take she place de fersen drive they to the porte st martin where the great traveling-carriage be wait and have transfer they to it and take a respectful leave of they he flee at once to brussels which more fortunate than those for whom he have risk he life he reach in safety for a hundred mile the royal fugitive proceed rapidly and without interruption one of the suppose courier be on the box another ride by the side of the carriage and the third go on in advance to see that the relay be in readiness before midday they reach châlons the place where they be to be meet by the first detachment of de bouillé 's troops and when the well-known uniform meet she eye marie antoinette for the first time give full expression to she feeling thank god we be save she exclaim clasp she hand the fervor of she exclamation bearing undesigned testimony to the greatness of the fear which out of consideration for other she have hitherto keep to herself but in truth out of this employment of the troops arise all they subsequent disaster de bouillé have be unwilling to send he detachment so far forward point out that the notice which they arrival in the different town be sure to attract would do more harm than they presence as a protection could do good but he argument have be overrule by the king himself who apprehend the greatest danger from the chance of be overtake and expect it therefore to increase with every hour of the journey de bouillé 's fear however be find to be the best justify by the event in more than one town even in the few hour that have elapse since the arrival of the soldier there have be quarrel between they and the towns-people in other which be still worse the populace have make friend with they and seduce they from they loyalty so that the officer in command have find it necessary to withdraw they altogether and anxiety at they unexpected absence cause loui more than once to show himself at the carriage window more than once he be recognize by people who know he and keep he counsel but drouet the postmaster at ste menehould a town about one hundred and seventy mile from pari be of a less loyal disposition he have lately be in the capital where he have become infected with the jacobin doctrine he too see the king 's face and on compare he somewhat striking feature with the stamp on some public document which he chance to have in he pocket become convinced of he identity he at once report to the magistrate what he have see and with they sanction ride forward to the next town clermont hope to be able to collect a force sufficient to stop the royal carriage on its arrival there but the king travel so fast that he have quit clermont before drouet reach it and he even arrive at varenne before he pursuer have he quit that place also he would have be in safety for just beyond it de bouillé have post a strong division which would have be able to defy all resistance but varenne a town on the oise be so small as to have no post-house and by some mismanagement the royal party have not be inform at which end of the town they be to find the relay the carriage halted while m valory be make the necessary inquiry and while it be stand still drouet ride up and forbid the postilion to proceed he himself hasten on through the town collect a few of the towns-people and with they aid upset a cart or two on the bridge to block up the way and have thus make the road impassable he rouse the municipal authority for it be nearly midnight and then return to the royal carriage he compel the royal family to dismount and follow he to the house of the mayor a petty grocer whose name be strausse the magistrate sound the tocsin : the national guard beat to arm : the king and queen be prisoner how they be allow to remain so be still after all the explanation that have be give incomprehensible two officer with sixty hussar all well disposed and loyal be in a side street of the town wait for they arrival of which they be not aware six of the trooper actually pass the traveler in the street as they be proceed to the mayor 's house but no one not even the queen appeal to they for succor or they could have release they without a effort for drouet 's whole party consist of no more than eight unarmed man and when a hour afterward the officer in command learn that the king be in the town in the hand of he enemy instead of at once deliver he they be seize with a panic : they would not take on themselves the responsibility of act without express order but gallop back to de bouillé to report the state of affair in less than a hour three more detachment amount in all to above one hundred man also reach the town and they commander do make they way to the king and ask he order he could only reply that he be a prisoner and have no order to give and not one of the officer have the sense to perceive that the fact of he announce himself a prisoner be in itself a order to deliver he one word of command from loui to clear the way for he at the sword 's point would yet have be sufficient but he have still the same invincible repugnance as ever to allow blood to be shed in he quarrel he prefer peaceful means which could not but fail with a dignity arise from he entire personal fearlessness he announce he name and rank he reason for quit pari and proceed to montmédy declare that he have no thought of quit the kingdom and demand to be allow to proceed on he journey while the queen she fear for she child overpower all other feeling address herself with the most earnest entreaty to the mayor 's wife declare that they very live would be in danger if they should be take back to pari and implore she to use she influence with she husband to allow they to proceed neither strausse nor he wife be ill-disposed toward the king but have not the courage to comply with the request of the royal couple whom after a little time the mayor and he wife could not have allow to proceed however much they might have wish it for the tocsin have bring up number of the national guard who be all disloyal while some of the soldier begin to show a disinclination to act against they and so matter stand for some hour a crowd of towns-people peasant national guard and dragoon throng the room the king at time speak quietly to he captor the queen weep for the fatigue of the journey and the fearful disappointment at be thus baffle at the last moment after she have think that all danger be pass have break down even she nerve at first she have try to persuade loui to act with resolution but when as usual she fail she give way to despair and sit silent with touch helpless sorrow gaze on she child who have fall asleep at seven o'clock on the morning of the 22d a single horseman ride into the town he be a aid-de-camp of la fayette on the morning of the 21st the excitement have be great in pari when it become know that the king have flee the mob rise in furious tumult they force they way into the tuilery plunder the palace and destroy the furniture a fruit-woman take possession of the queen 's bed as a stall to range she cherry on say that to-day it be the turn of the nation and a picture of the king be tear down from the wall and after be stick up in derision outside the gate for some time be offer for sale to the highest bidder -lrb- 2 -rrb- in the assembly the most violent language be use a officer whose name have be preserve through the eminence which after he death be attain by he widow and he child general beauharnai be the president and as such he announce that m bailly have report to he that the enemy of the nation have carry off the king the whole assembly be rouse to fury at the idea of he have escape from they power a decree be at once draw up in form command that loui should be seize wherever he could be find and bring back to pari no one could pretend that the assembly have the slightest right to issue such a order but la fayette with the alacrity which he always display when any insult be to be offer to the king or queen at once send it off by he own aid-de-camp m romeuf with instruction to see that it be carry out the order be now deliver to strausse the king with scarcely a attempt at resistance declare he willingness to obey it and before eight o'clock he and he family with they faithful body-guard now in undisguised captivity be travel back to pari when be there ever a journey so miserable as that which now bring its sovereign back to that disloyal and hostile city the national guard of varenne and of other town through which they pass claim a right to accompany they and as they be all infantry the speed of the carriage be limit to they walk pace so slowly do the procession advance that it be not till the fourth day that it reach the barrier and in many place on the road a mob have collect in expectation of they arrival and aggravate the misery of they situation by ferocious threat address to the queen and even to the little dauphin but at châlons they be receive with respect by the municipal authority the hôtel de ville have be prepare for they reception : a supper have be provide the queen be even entreat to allow some of the principal lady of the city to be present to she and as the next day be the great roman catholic festival of the fête dieu they be escort with all honor to hear mass in the cathedral before they resume they journey even the national guard be not all hostile or insolent at épernay though a menacing crowd surround the carriage as they dismount the commanding officer take up the dauphin in he arm to carry he in safety to the door of the hotel comforting the queen at the same time with a loyal whisper well suit to she feeling despise this clamor madame there be a god above all but miserable as they journey be soon after leave châlons it become more wretched still they be no longer to be allow the privilege of suffer and grieve by themselves the assembly have send three of its member to take charge of they select as might have be expect two who be know as among they bitterest enemy -- barnave and a man name pétion the third m lator maubourg be a plain soldier who might be depend on for carry out he order with resolution in one respect those who make the choice be disappointed barnave whose hostility to the king and queen have be chiefly dictate by personal feeling be entirely convert by the dignified resignation of the queen and from this day renounce he republicanism and though he adhere to what be know as constitutionalist view be ever afterward a zealous advocate of both the monarch and the monarchy but pétion take every opportunity of insulting loui harangue he on the future abolition of royalty and reproach he for many of he action and for what he believe to be he feeling and view for the future it be the afternoon of the 25th when they come in sight of paris so great have be marie antoinette 's mental suffering that in those few day she hair have turn white and fresh and study humiliation be yet in store for she the carriage be not allow to take the shortest road but be conduct some mile round that it might be lead in triumph down the champ élysées where a vast mob be wait to feast they eye on the spectacle whose display of sullen ill-will have be bespeak by a notice prohibit any one from take off he hat to the king or utter a cheer the national guard be forbid to present arm to he and it seem as if they interpret this order as a prohibition also against use they in he defense for as the carriage approach the palace a gang of desperate ruffian some of whom be recognize as among the most ferocious of the former assailant of versaille force they way through they rank press up against the carriage and even mount on the step barnave and lator maubourg fear that they intend to break open the door place themselves against they but they contented themselves with look in at the window and utter sanguinary threat marie antoinette become alarmed -- not for herself but for she child they have so close up every avenue of air that those within be nearly stifle and the youngest of course suffer most she let down a glass and appeal to those who be crowd round : for the love of god she exclaim retire my child be choke we will soon choke you be the only reply they vouchsafe to she at last however la fayette come up with a armed escort and they be drive off but they still follow the carriage up to the very gate of the palace with yell of insult and it have a stranger follower still : behind the royal carriage come a open cabriolet in which sit drouet with a laurel crown on he head -lrb- 3 -rrb- as if the chief object of the procession wear to celebrate he triumph over he king the mob be even hope to add to its impressiveness by the slaughter of some immediate victim -- not of the king and queen for they believe they to be destine to public execution but they be eager to massacre the faithful body-guard who have be bring back bind on the box of the carriage and they would undoubtedly have carry out they bloody purpose have not the queen remember they and as she be dismount entreated barnave and la fayette to protect they though during the last three day many thing have have they name alter -lrb- 4 -rrb- the tuilery have be spare it be still in name a royal palace but those who now enter it know it for they prison the sun be set the emblem of the extinction of they royalty as they ascend the stair to find such rest as they might and to ponder in privacy for this one night over they fatal disappointment and they still more fatal future yet though they return be full of ignominy and wretchedness though they home have become a prison the only exit from which be to be the scaffold still if posthumous renown can compensate for misery endure in this life if it be worth while to purchase even by the most terrible and protracted suffering a undying unfading memory of the most admirable virtue -- of fidelity of truth of patience of resignation of disinterestedness of fortitude of all the quality which most ennoble and sanctify the heart -- it may be say now that she agony have long be terminate and that she have be long at rest that it be well for marie antoinette that she have fail to reach montmédy and that she have thus fall again without have to reproach herself in any single particular into the hand of she enemy as a prisoner to the basest of mankind as victim to the most ferocious monster that have ever disgraced humanity she have ever command and she will never cease to command the sympathy and admiration of every generous mind but the case would have be widely different have loui and she find the refuge which they seek with the loyal and brave de bouillé they arrival in he camp could not have fail to be a signal for civil war and civil war under such circumstance as those of france at that time could have have but one termination -- they defeat dethronement and expulsion from the country in a foreign land they might indeed have find security but they would have enjoy but little happiness wherever he may be the life of a depose and exile sovereign must be one of ceaseless mortification the greatest of the italian poet have well say that the recollection of former happiness be the bitterest aggravation of present misery and not only to the fugitive monarch himself but to those who still preserve they fidelity to he and to the foreign people to whom he be indebted for he asylum the recollection of he former greatness will ever be at hand to add still further bitterness to he present humiliation the most friendly feeling he misfortune can ever excite be a contemptuous pity such as noble and proud mind must find it harder to endure than the utmost virulence of hatred and enmity from such a fate at least marie antoinette be save during the remainder of she life she failure do indeed condemn she to a protraction of trial and agony such as no other woman have ever endure but she always prize honor far above life and it also open to she a immortality of glory such as no other woman have ever achieve chapter xxxii marie antoinette 's feeling on she return -- she see hope of improvement -- the 17th of July -- the assembly inquire into the king 's conduct on leave paris -- they resolve that there be no reason for take proceedings -- excitement in foreign country -- the assembly proceed to complete the constitution -- it declare all the member incapable of election to the new assembly -- letter of marie antoinette to the emperor and to mercy -- the declaration of pilnitz -- the king accept the constitution -- insult offer to he at the festival of the champ de mar -- and to the queen at the theater -- the first or constituent assembly be dissolve it be eminently characteristic of marie antoinette that she very first act the morning after she return be to write to de fersen to inform he that she be safe and well in health but though she have rouse herself for that effort of gratitude and courteous kindness for some day she seem stupefy by grief and disappointment and unable to speak or think for a single moment of any thing but the narrow chance which have crush she hope and change success when it have seem to be secure into ruin and if ever she could for a moment drive the feeling from she mind she enemy take care to force it back upon she every hour before they reach the tuilery la fayette have obtain from the assembly authority to place guard wherever he might think fit and no jailer ever take more rigorous precaution for the safe-keeping of the most desperate criminal than this man of noble birth but most ignoble heart -lrb- 1 -rrb- now practice toward he king and queen sentinel be place along every passage of the palace and that they might have they prisoner constantly in sight the door of every room be keep open day and night the queen be not allow even to close she bed-chamber and a soldier be place so as at all time to command a sight of the whole room the only moment that the door be permit to be shut be a short period each morning while she be dress but after a time she rally and even begin again to think the future not wholly desperate she always look at the most promising side of affair and the first shock of the anguish feel at varenne have scarcely pass away when with irrepressible sanguineness she begin to look around she and search for some foundation on which to build fresh hope she even think that she have find it in the division which be become daily more conspicuous in the assembly itself she have yet to learn that at such time violence always overpower moderation and that the worse man be the more certain be they to obtain the upper hand the division among she enemy be indeed so furious as to justify at one time the expectation that one party would destroy the other the jacobin summon a vast meeting whose member they fix beforehand at a hundred thousand citizen to meet on Sunday the 17th of July to petition the assembly to dethrone the king on the appoint day long before the hour fix for the meeting a fierce riot take place the cause and even the circumstance of which have never be clearly ascertain but which soon become marked with scene of extraordinary violence la fayette who try to crush it in the bud be pelt and fire at bailly hang out the red flag the token of martial law be proclaim at the hôtel de ville the mob pelt the national guard the national guard too much exasperated and alarmed to obey la fayette 's order to fire over the people 's head at one volley shoot down a hundred of the rioter the jacobin leader flee in alarm robespierre who have be one of the chief organizer of the tumult be also one of the basest of coward be the most terrify of all and flee for shelter to he admirer of congenial spirit madame roland whose protection he afterward repay by send she to the scaffold the riot be quell and the officer of the national guard urge la fayette to take advantage of the opportunity and lead they on to close by force the club of the jacobin and another of equal ferocity know as the cordelier -lrb- 2 -rrb- lately found by the fiercest of the jacobin danton and a butcher name legendre who boast of he ferocity as he only title to interfere in the government if he have be honest in he profession of a desire to save the monarchy la fayette would have adopt they advice for it have already become plain to every one that the existence of these club be incompatible with the preservation of the kingly authority but he imbecile love of popularity make he fear to offend even such a body of miscreant as the follower of danton and robespierre and he profess to believe that he have give they a sufficient lesson and have so convinced they of he power to crush they that they would be grateful to he for spare they and learn to act with more moderation in future the decision of the assembly also on the question of the king 's conduct in leave pari be not without its encouragement to one of the queen 's disposition she herself have be interrogate by commissioner appoint by the assembly to inquire into the circumstance connect with the transaction and she statement have be preserve with she habitual anxiety to conceal from other the king 's incapacity and want of resolution she represent herself as act wholly under he order i declare say she that as the king desire to quit pari with he child it would have be unnatural for I to allow any thing to prevent I from accompany he during the last two year i have sufficiently prove on several occasion that i should never leave he and what in this instance determine I most be the assurance which i feel that he would never wish to quit the kingdom if he have have such a desire all my influence would have be exert to dissuade he from such a purpose -lrb- 3 -rrb- and she proceed further to exculpate all they attendant she declare that madame de tourzel who have be ill for some week have never receive she order till the very day of the departure she know not whither she be go and have take no luggage so that the queen herself have be force to lend she some clothes the three body-guard be equally ignorant and the waiting-women though it be true she say that the count and countess de provence have go to flander they have only take that course to avoid interfere with the relay which be require by the king and have intend to rejoin he at montmédy the king 's own statement tally with hers in every respect though it be naturally more explicit as to he motive and intention and he innocence of purpose be so irresistibly demonstrate that though robespierre in the most sanguinary speech which he have ever yet utter demand that he should be bring to trial not conceal he desire that it should end in he condemnation and though pétion and a wretch name buzot a warm admirer and intimate friend of madame roland demand he deposition and the proclamation of a republic barnave have no difficulty in carry the assembly with he in opposition to they violence and it be finally resolve that nothing which have happen furnished grounds for take proceedings against any member of the royal family it be order at the same time that de bouillé should be arrest and impeach but when he find that nothing could be effect for the deliverance of the king he have flee across the frontier and be safe from they malice meanwhile the unconstitutional and unprecedented violence which have be offer to the king naturally create the greatest excitement and indignation in all foreign country a month before the late expedition the emperor have address a formal note to m montmorin as secretary of state declare that he would regard any ill-treatment of he sister as a injury do to himself -lrb- 4 -rrb- and now -lrb- 5 -rrb- the chivalrous gustavus of sweden propose to address to the assembly a joint letter of warn from all the sovereign of europe to declare that they would all make common cause with the king of france if any attempt be make to offer he further violence but even the austrian minister regard such a declaration as more likely to aggravate than to diminish the danger of those whom it be design to serve and the queen herself prefer wait for a time to see the result of the strife between the rival party in the assembly the assembly be at this time fully occupy with the completion of the constitution a work for which it have but little time leave since its own duration have be fix at two year which would expire in September and also with the consideration of a question concern the composition of the next assembly which have be lately bring forward and on which the queen be unfortunately mislead into use she influence to procure a decision which be undoubtedly in its eventual consequence as disastrous to the king 's fortune as it be irreconcilable with common sense robespierre bring forward a resolution that no member of the exist assembly should be eligible for a seat in that by which it be to be replace it be in reality a resolution to exclude from the new assembly not only every one who have any parliamentary or legislative experience but also all the adherent or friend of the throne and to place the come election wholly in the power of the jacobin robespierre be willing to be exclude himself from a conviction that with such a assembly as would surely be return the jacobin club would practically exercise all the power of the state but the constitutional party who see that it be aim at they oppose it with great vigor and would probably have be able to defeat it if the royalist member who still retain they seat would have consent to join they unhappily the queen take the opposite view with far more acuteness penetration and fertility of imagination than be usually give to woman or to man either she have still in some degree the defect common to she sex of be prone to confine she view to one side of a question and to overrule she reason by she feeling and prejudice though she acknowledge the service which barnave have render by defeat those who have wish to bring the king and herself to trial she nevertheless still regard the constitutionalist in general with deep distrust as the party which desire to lower and have lower the authority and dignity of the throne and view the whole assembly with not unnatural antipathy she fancy that one compose wholly of new member could not possibly be more unfriendly to the king 's person and government and might probably be far better disposed toward they she easily bring the king to adopt she view and exert the whole of she influence to secure the passing of the decree send agent to canvass those deputy who be oppose to it with the royalist member the extreme right she voice be law and by the unnatural union of they and the jacobin the resolution be carry it be the more singular that she should have be willing thus as it be to proscribe the member of the present assembly because in a very remarkable letter which she write to she brother the emperor at the end of July she found the hope for the future which she express with a degree of sanguineness which can hardly fail to be think strange when the event of June be remember on the conduct of the assembly itself the letter be too long to quote at full length but a few extract from it will help we in we task of form a proper estimate of she character from the unreserved exposition which it contain of she feeling both past and present with she view and hope for the future even while she keenly appreciate the difficulty of the king 's position and from the unabated eagerness for the welfare of france which it display in every reflection and suggestion that she still consider the imperial alliance of great importance to the welfare of both nation will surprise no one the suspension of the royal authority which the assembly have decree on the 26th of June have be remove on the decision that the king be not to be proceed against yet she first sentence show that she be still subject to cruel and lawless tyranny which even hinder she correspondence with she own relation a queen might have expect to be able to write in security to another sovereign a sister to a brother but la fayette and those in authority regard the rights of neither royalty nor kindred a friend my dear brother have undertake to convey this letter to you for i myself have no means of give you news of my health i will not enter into detail of what precede we departure you have already know all the reason for it during the event which befall we on we journey and in the situation in which we be immediately after we return to pari i be profoundly distressed after i recover from the first shock of the agitation which they produce i set myself to work to reflect on what i have see and i have endeavor to form a clear idea of what in the actual state of affair the king 's interest be and what the conduct be which they prescribe to I my idea have be form by a combination of motive which i will proceed to explain to you the situation of affair here have greatly change since we journey the national assembly be divide into a multitude of party far from order be re-establish every day seem to diminish the power of the law the king deprive of all authority do not even see any possibility of recover it on the completion of the constitution through the influence of the assembly since that body itself be every day lose more the respect of the people in short it be impossible to see any end to disorder to-day circumstance present much more hope the man who have the greatest influence in affair be unite together and have openly declare for the preservation of the monarchy and the king and for the re-establishment of order since they union the effort of the seditious have be defeat by a great superiority of strength the assembly have acquire a consistency and a authority in every part of the kingdom which it seem disposed to use to establish the observance of the law and to put a end to the revolution at this moment the most moderate man who have never cease to be oppose to revolutionary act be unite because they see in union the only prospect of enjoy in safety what the revolution have leave they and of put a end to the trouble of which they dread the continuance in short every thing seem at this moment to contribute to put a end to the agitation and commotion to which france have be give over for the last two year this termination of they however natural and possible as it be will not give the government the degree of force and authority which i regard as necessary but it will preserve we from greater misfortune it will place we in a situation of greater tranquillity and when man 's mind have recover from they present intoxication perhaps they will see the usefulness of give the royal authority a greater range this in the course which matter be now take be what one can foresee for the future and i compare this result with what we could promise ourselves from a line of conduct oppose to the wish which the nation display in that ease i see a absolute impossibility of obtain any thing except by the employment of a superior force and on this last supposition i will say nothing of the personal danger which the king my son and i myself may have to encounter but what could be the consequence but some enterprise the issue of which be uncertain and the ultimate result of which whatever it might be present disaster such as one can not endure to contemplate the army be in a bad state from want of leader and of subordination but the kingdom be full of armed man and they imagination be so inflamed that it be impossible to foresee what they might do and the number of victim who might be sacrifice it be impossible when one see what be go on here to calculate what might be the effect of they despair i only see in the event which might arise out of such a attempt but very doubtful prospects of success and the certainty of great misery for every one if the revolution should be terminate in the manner of which i have speak then it will be important that the king shall acquire in a solid manner the confidence and consideration which alone can give a real strength to the royal authority no means be so well calculate to procure they for he as the influence which we might have over one of you resolution -lrb- 6 -rrb- which would contribute to insure peace to france and to dispel disquietude which be so much the more grievous for the whole world that they be among the principal obstacle to the re-establishment of public tranquillity the share which in that way we should have in the termination of these trouble would win over to we all man of moderate temper while the other especially the chief of the revolution would attach themselves to we because of the sincere and efficacious inclination which we should have show to conduct matter to the end which they all wish for you own interest seem to I also to have a place in this system of conduct the national assembly before separate will desire in concert with the king to determine the alliance to which france be to continue attach and the power of europe which shall be the first to recognize the constitution after it have be accept by the king will undoubtedly be the one with which the assembly will be incline to form the closest alliance and to these general view i might add the means which i myself have to dispose man 's mind to maintain this alliance -- mean which will be extremely strengthen if you share my view of the present circumstance i can not doubt that the chief of the revolution who have support the king in the last crisis will be desirous to assure to he the consideration and respect necessary to the exercise of he authority and that they will see in a close alliance of france with that power with which he be connect by tie of blood a means of combine he dignity with the interest of the nation and in that way of consolidate and strengthen a constitution of which they all agree that the majesty of the king be one essential foundation i do not know if independently of all other reason the king will not find in that feeling and in the inclination of the nation when it have recover its calmness more deference and a temper more favorable to he than he could expect from the majority of those frenchman who be at present out of the kingdom -lrb- 7 -rrb- and a letter which she write to mercy a fortnight later be perhaps even more worthy of attention as supply abundant proof if proof be need of the good-will and good faith which be the lead principle of herself and the king in all they dealings with the assembly since she letter to she brother matter have be proceed rapidly she have find some means of treat more directly than on any previous occasion not only with barnave but with the far more unscrupulous a lameth and the assembly have make such progress in complete the constitution that it be on the point of submit it to the king for he acceptance we have see in marie antoinette 's letter to the emperor that she be convince of the necessity of loui signify that acceptance and she adhere to that view of the policy to be pursue though the last touch give to the constitution have render many of its article far more unreasonable than she have anticipate and though the great english statesman burke whose reflection of the preceding year have naturally cause he to be regard as one of the ablest adviser on whom she could rely forward to she a earnest exhortation to induce she husband to reject it he implore she to have nothing to do with traitor use the argument which to one so sensitive for she honor as marie antoinette be well calculate to exert a almost irresistible influence over she mind he declare that she resolution at this most critical moment be to decide whether she glory be to be maintain and she distress to cease or whether -lrb- and he beg pardon for ever mention such a alternative -rrb- shame and affliction be to be she portion for the rest of she life and he declare that if the king should accept the constitution both king and queen be ruin forever the great writer be as in more than one other instance of he career too earnest in he conviction that principle be at stake in the course which he recommend to consider whether that course be safe for those on whom he urge it or even practicable but marie antoinette as one on whose decision the very life of she husband and she child might depend feel bind to consider in the first place how far she adoption of the advice thus tender might endanger both and accordingly while express to mercy the full extent of she repugnance to the system of government if indeed it deserve the name of a system which the new constitution have frame she show that she disapproval of it have in no degree lead she to change she mind on the practical question of the course which the king should pursue she justify she decision to mercy in a most elaborate letter in which the whole position be survey with admirable good sense -lrb- 8 -rrb- we position be this : we be now on the point of have the constitution bring to we for acceptance it be in itself so monstrous that it be impossible that it should be long maintained but in the position in which we be can we risk refuse it no and i will prove it to you i be not speak of the personal danger which we should run we have fully show by the journey which we undertake two month ago that we do not take we own safety into account when the public welfare be at stake but this constitution be so intrinsically bad that it can only acquire consistence from any resistance which we might oppose to it we business therefore be to take a middle course which may save we honor and may put we in such a position that the people may come back to we when once they eye be open and they have become weary of the exist state of affair i think also that it be necessary that when they have present the act to the king he should keep it by he a few day for he be not suppose to know what it be till it have be present to he in all legal form and that then he should summon the commissioner before he not to make any comment not to demand any alteration which perhaps might not be admit and which would be interpret as a admission that he approve of the basis but to declare that he opinion be not change that in he declaration of the 20th of June -lrb- 9 -rrb- he prove the absolute impossibility of govern under the new system and that he be still of the same mind but that for the sake of the tranquillity of he country he sacrifice himself and that as he people and the nation stake they happiness on he accept it he do not hesitate to signify that acceptance and that the sight of they happiness will speedily make he forget the cruel and bitter grief which they have inflict on he and on he family but if we take this line we must adhere to it and above all thing we must avoid any step which can create distrust and we must move on so to say always with the law in we hand i promise you that this be the best way to give they a early disgust at the constitution the mischief be that for this we shall want a able and a trustworthy ministry several people urge we to reject the act and the king 's brother press upon he every day that it be indispensable to do so and affirm that we shall be support by whom and she proceed to examine the situation and policy of spain of the empire of england and of prussium to prove that from none of they be there any hope of active aid while to trust to the emigrant would be the worst expedient of all because we should then fall into a new slavery worse than the first since while we should appear to be in some degree indebted to they we should not be able to extricate ourselves from they toil they already prove this when they refuse to listen to the person who be in we confidence on the pretext that they do not trust they while they seek to force we to give ourselves up to m de calonne who i fear in all that he do be guide by nothing but he own ambition he private enmity and he habitual levity think every thing he wish not only possible but already do one circumstance worthy of remark be that in all these discussion on the constitution the people take no interest and concern themselves solely about they own affair limit they wish to have a constitution and get rid of the aristocrat as to we acceptance of the constitution it be impossible for any think be to avoid see that we be not free but it be essential that we should not awaken a suspicion of we feeling in the monster who surround we let I know where the emperor 's force be and what be they present position in every case the foreign power can alone save we the army be lose there be no money there be no bond no curb which can restrain the populace which be everywhere arm even the chief of the revolution when they wish to speak of order be not listen to this be the deplorable condition in which we be place add that we have not a single friend -- that every one betray we some out of hatred other out of weakness or ambition in short i actually be reduce to dread the day when they will have the appearance of give we a kind of freedom at least in the state of nullity in which we be at present no one can reproach we you know the character of the person with whom i have to do -lrb- 10 -rrb- at the last moment when one seem to have convince he a argument a word will make he change he mind before any one suspect it this be the reason why many expedient can not be even attempt on the 21st she hear that the charter will be present at the end of the week and she repeat she fear that the conduct of the emigrant may involve they in fresh trouble it be essential that the french and most especially the brother of the king should keep in the background and allow the foreign prince to act by themselves but no entreaty no argument from we will induce they to do so the emperor must insist upon it it be the only way in which he can serve we you know yourself the mischievous wrong-headedness and evil design of the emigrant the coward after have abandon we they seek to make we expose ourselves alone to danger and serve nothing but they interest i do not accuse the king 's brother i believe they heart and they intention to be pure but they be surround and guide by ambitious man who will ruin they after have first ruin we on the 26th she hear that it will still be a week before the constitution be bring to the king it be impossible consider we position that the king should refuse to accept it you may depend upon this be true since i say it you know my character sufficiently to be sure that it would incline I rather to a noble and bold course we have no resource but in the foreign power they must come to we assistance but it be the emperor who must put himself at the head of every thing and manage every thing i declare to you that matter be now come to such a state that it would be better to be king of a single province than of a kingdom so abandon and disorder as this i shall endeavor if i can to send the emperor information on all these matter but in the mean time do you tell he all that you consider necessary to prove to he that we have no longer any resource except in he and that we happiness we existence and that of my child depend on he alone and on he prudence and promptitude in action -lrb- 11 -rrb- and however she from time to time catch at momentary hope arise from other source the only one on which she place any permanent reliance be the affection and power of she brother and that hope in the course of the winter be cut from under she by he death -lrb- 12 -rrb- yet so correct be she judgment and appreciation of sound political principle or perhaps we might say so keen be she sense of what be due to the independence and dignity of france in spite of its present disloyalty that a report that the emperor and prussium have by implication claim a right to dictate to france in matter of she internal government draw from she a warm remonstrance as sovereign and brother she conceive that leopold have a right to interfere to insure the safety of he own sister and of a brother sovereign but she never desire he to interpose for any other object from she childhood as we have see more than once she have learn to regard the prussian character and prussian design with abhorrence and in a letter to mercy of the 12th of September after express a earnest hope that the emperor will not allow himself to be guide by the cunning of calonne and the detestable policy of prussium she add it be say here that in the agreement sign at pilnitz -lrb- 13 -rrb- the two power engage never to permit the new french constitution to be establish there certainly be thing which foreign power have a right to oppose but as to what concern the internal law of a country every nation have a right to adopt those which suit it they would be wrong therefore to intervene in such a matter and all the world would see in such a act a proof of the intrigue of the emigrant -lrb- 14 -rrb- she proceed to tell he that all be settle the king have adopt the line which she have mark out for he in she former letter the constitution have be present to he on the 3d of September he have take a few day to consider it not with the idea of propose the slightest alteration but in order to avoid the appearance of act under compulsion and on the same day on which she write to mercy he be draw up a letter to the assembly to announce he intention of visit the assembly to give it he royal assent in due form but though she would not have have he act otherwise she can not announce this apparent termination of the contest without some natural expression of grief and indignation at last the die be cast all that we have now to do be to regulate the future progress and conduct of affair as circumstance may permit i only wish that other would regulate they conduct by mine but even in we own inner circle we have great difficulty and great conflict pity I : i assure you that it require more courage to support the condition in which i be place than to encounter a pitched battle and the more so that i do not deceive myself and that i see nothing but misery in the want of energy show by some and the evil design of other my god be it possible that endowed as i be with force of character and feeling as i do so thoroughly the blood which run in my vein i should yet be destine to pass my day in such a age and with such man but for all this never believe that my courage be desert I not for my own sake but for the sake of my child i will support myself and i will fulfill to the end my long and painful career i can no longer see what i be write farewell -lrb- 15 -rrb- tear we may suppose be blind she eye in spite of all she fortitude there be no exaggeration in she declaration to the empress catherine of russium with whom at this time she be in frequent communication that the distrust which be show by all around they be a moral and continual death a thousand time worse than that physical death which be a release from all misery -lrb- 16 -rrb- and in the same letter she explain that to remove this distrust be one principal object which the king and she have in view in all they measure yet in spite of all he concession the week be not to pass without fresh insult be offer to the king which shock even he phlegmatic apathy the letter which he send to the assembly to announce he compliance with its wish be indeed receive with acclamation which if not sincere be at least loud and apparently unanimous and as if in reply to it la fayette propose and carry a motion that the assembly should pass a act of amnesty for all political offens and a magnificent festival be appoint to be hold in the champ de mar on the follow Sunday in celebration of the joyful event but after the first brief excitement have pass away the jacobin faction recover its ascendency and contrived to make that very festival which be design to express the gratitude of the nation a occasion of further humiliation to the unhappy loui every arrangement for the day be discuss in a spirit of the bitterest disloyalty when the question be raise which in any other assembly that ever meet in the world would have be think needless what attitude the member be to preserve while the king be take the prescribe oath to observe the constitution a hundred voice shout out that they should all keep they seat and that the king should swear standing and bare-headed and when one deputy of high reputation m malouet remonstrate against such a vote argue that so to treat the chief of the state would be a greater insult to the nation than even to himself a deputy from brittany cry out that m malouet and those who think with he might receive loui on they knee if they like but that the rest of the assembly should be seat and in accordance with the feeling thus show every mark of respect be studiously withhold from the unhappy monarch and every care be take to show he that every deputy consider himself he equal two chair exactly similar be provide for he and for the president and when after take the oath and affix he signature to the act the king resume he seat the president who have to reply to he in a short address have at first rise for that purpose on see that loui retain he seat sit down beside he and finish he speech in that position loui feel the affront he contain himself while in the hall and while the member be conduct he back to the palace which they presently do amidst the music of military band and the salute of artillery but when he escort have leave he and he reach he own apartment he pride give way the queen with the dauphin have be present in a box hastily fit up for she and have follow he back he feel for she more than for himself burst into tear he say it be all over you have see my humiliation why do i ever bring you into france for such degradation and the queen while endeavor to console he turn to madame de campan who have record the scene and dismiss she from she attendance -lrb- 17 -rrb- leave we she say leave we to ourselves she could not bear that even that faithful servant should remain to be a witness to the despair and prostration of she sovereign the very rejoicing be turn by the agent of the jacobin into occasion for further outrage the whole city be illuminate and the sovereign yield to the entreaty of the popular leader to drive through the street and the champ élysées to see the illumination the populace who believe the revolution at a end and they freedom secure cheer they heartily as they pass but at every cry of vive le rous a stentorian voice close to the royal carriage shout out not so : vive la nation and the queen though it be plain that the ruffian have be hire thus to outrage they almost faint with terror at he ferocity a few day afterward the insult be renew even more pointedly the royal family go in state to the opera where before they arrival the jacobin have pack the pit with a gang of they own hireling whose unpowdered hair make they conspicuous object -lrb- 18 -rrb- the opera be one of grétry 's les événements imprévus in which one of the duet contain the line ah comme j' aime ma maïtresse madame dugazon a popular singer of the day as she utter the word bow toward the royal box and instantly the whole pit be in a fury no mistress for we no master liberty the whole house be in a uproar the king 's partisan and adherent reply with loyal cheer vive le rous vive la reine the pit roar out no master no queen and the jacobin even proceed to act of violence toward all who refuse to join in they cry blow be strike and it become necessary to send for a company of the guard to restore order yet when on the last day of the month the king visit the assembly -lrb- 19 -rrb- to declare its dissolution the president address he in term of the most loyal gratitude affirm that by he acceptance of the constitution he have earn the blessing of all future generation and when he quit the hall the populace escort the royal carriage back to the palace with vociferous cheer though in the eye of impartial observer this display of return good-will be more than counterbalance when as the member of the assembly come out some of the royalist and constitutionalist be hoot and some of the fiercest jacobin be greet with still more enthusiastic acclamation chapter xxxiii composition of the new assembly -- rise of the girondin -- they corruption and eventual fate -- vergniaud 's motion against the king -- favorable reception of the king at the assembly and at the opera -- change in the ministry -- the king 's and queen 's language to m bertrand de moleville -- the count de narbonne -- pétion be elect mayor of paris -- scarcity of money and great hardship of the royal family -- present arrive from tippoo sahib -- the dauphin -- the assembly pass decree against the priest and the emigrant -- misconduct of the emigrant -- loui refuse he assent to the decree -- he issue a circular condemn emigration the new assembly meet on the 1st of October and its composition afford the royalist or even the constitutionalist the party that desire to stand by the constitution which have just be ratify very little prospect of a re-establishment of tranquillity the mischievous effect of the vote which exclude member of the last assembly from election be see in the very list of those who have be return in the whole number there be scarcely a dozen member of noble or gentle birth the number of ecclesiastic be equally small while property be as little represent as the nobility or the church it be reckon that of the whole body scarcely fifty possess two thousand franc a year the general youth of the member be as conspicuous as they poverty half of they have hardly attain middle age a great many be little more than boy the jacobin themselves who before the election have reckon on sway they decision by terror could hardly have anticipate a result which would place the entire body so wholly at they mercy but what be still move ominous of evil be the rise of a new party know as that of the girondin from the circumstance of some of its most influential member come from the gironde one of the department which the late assembly have carve out of the old province of gascony it be not absolutely a new party since the foundation of it have be lay during the last two month of the old assembly by pétion and a low-born pamphleteer name brissot who as editor of a newspaper to which he give the name of _ le patriote français _ rival the most blood-thirsty of the jacobin in exciting the worst passion of the populace but pétion and brissot have only sow the seed the opening of the new assembly at once give it growth and vigor when the deputy from the gironde plunge into the arena of debate and show a undeniable superiority in eloquence to every other party the chief vergniaud gensonné and gaudet be lawyer who have never obtain any practice isnard the first man to make a open profession of atheism in the assembly be the son of a perfumer in provence they be adventurer as utterly without principle as without resource and they first thought appear to have be to make money of the king 's difficulty and to sell themselves to he they apply to the minister of the interior m de lessart propose to place the whole of they influence at the service of the government on condition of he secure each of they a pension of six thousand franc a month -lrb- 1 -rrb- m de lessart would not have object to buy they but he think the price which they set upon themselves too high and as they adhere to they demand the negotiation go off and they resolve to revenge themselves on he royal master with all the malice of disappointed rapacity as none of they have any force of character they fall under the influence of the wife of one of they number a small manufacturer name roland the same who as we have already see be the first to raise the cry of blood in france and to recommend the assassination of the king and queen while they be still in fancied security at versaille under the direction of this fierce woman whose ferocity be render more formidable by she undoubted talent the girondin begin a internecine war with the king who have refuse they the wages which they have ask they plan and carry out the sanguinary attack on the palace in the summer of the next year they bring loui to the scaffold by the unanimity of they vote yet it would have be more fortunate for themselves as well as for he have they be less exorbitant in they demand and have they connect themselves with the government as they desire for though they succeed in they treason though madame roland see the accomplishment of she wish in the murder of the king and queen they success be equally fatal to themselves almost all of they perish on the same scaffold to which they have consign they virtuous sovereign meet a fate in one respect worse even than theirs from the infamy of the name which they have leave behind they yet for a few day it seem as if they malignity would miss its aim they do not wait a single day before display it but at the preliminary meeting of the assembly before it be open for the dispatch of business vergniaud propose to declare it illegal to speak of the king as he majesty or to address he as sire while another deputy name couthon who at first belong to the same party though he afterward join the jacobin carry a motion that when loui come to open the assembly the president should occupy the place of honor and the second seat should be allot to the sovereign still for a moment it seem as if they have overshoot they mark and as if the more loyal party would be able to withstand and defeat they the assembly itself be compel to repeal its recent vote since loui whom indignation for once inspire with greater firmness than he usually display refuse to open the new assembly in person unless he be to be receive with the honor to which he rank entitle he the offensive resolution be cancel and when he have therefore open the session in a dignified and conciliatory speech which be chiefly of he own composition the president m pastoret a member of the constitutional party reply in a language which be not only respectful but affectionate the constitution he say have give the king friend in those who be formerly only style he subject the assembly and the nation feel the need of he love as the constitution have render he the greatest monarch in the world so he attachment to it would place he among the king most beloved by they people and it seem as if the parisian in general share to the full the loyal sentiment utter by m pastoret write the same week to she brother marie antoinette with a confidence which could only spring from a sincere attachment to the whole nation reiterate she old opinion that the good citizen and good people have always in they heart be friendly to the king and herself -lrb- 2 -rrb- and express she belief that since the acceptance of the constitution the people have again learn to trust they she be far from give herself up to a blind confidence she know that the disaffected have not abandon they treasonable purpose but as the king and she herself be resolve to unite themselves in sincere good faith to the people it be impossible but that when they real feeling be know the bulk of the people should return to they the mischief be that the well-meaning know not how to act in concert it do seem as if she be correct in she estimate of the feeling of the citizen when in the evening of the day on which loui have open the assembly the whole royal family include the two child go to the opera and as if with express design to ratify the loyal language of the president of the assembly the whole audience greet they with a most enthusiastic reception more than once they interrupt the performance with loud cheer for both king and queen and as the pleasure of child be always a attractive sight they sympathize especially with the delight of the little dauphin they future king as they all then think he who be new to such a spectacle only take he eye off the stage to imitate the gesture of the actor to he mother and draw she attention to they in more than one of she letter the queen have vehemently deplore the want of a stronger ministry than of late have be in the king 's service it be a natural complaint though in fact the ability or want of ability display by the minister be a matter of but slight practical importance so completely have the assembly engross the whole power of the state but in the course of the autumn some change be make one of which for a time certainly add to the comfort of the sovereign m montmorin retire m de lessart be transfer to he office and m bertrand de moleville who be entirely new to official life become the minister of marine the whole kingdom do not contain a man more attach to the king and queen but he combine statesman-like prudence with he loyalty and he conduct before he take office elicit a very remarkable proof of the singleness of mind and purpose with which the king and queen have accept the constitution m bertrand have previously refuse office and be very unwilling to take it now and he frankly tell loui that he could not hope to be of any real service to he unless he know the plan which the king might have form with respect to the constitution and the line of conduct which he desire he minister to observe on the subject and loui tell he distinctly that though he be far from regard the constitution as a masterpiece and though he think it easy to reform it advantageously in many particulars yet he have swear to observe it as it be and that he be bind to be and resolve to be strictly faithful to he oath the more so because it seem to he that the most exact observance of the constitution be the surest method to lead the nation to understand it in all its bearing when the people themselves would perceive the character of the change in it which it be desirable to make m bertrand express he warm approval of the wisdom of such a policy but think it so important to know how far the queen coincide in she husband 's sentiment that he venture to put the question to he majesty the king assure he that he have be speak she sentiment as well as he own and that he should hear they from she own lip and accordingly the queen immediately grant the new minister a audience in which after express with she habitual grace and kindness she feeling that by accept office at such a time he be lay both the king and herself under a personal obligation she add the king have explain to you he intention with respect to the constitution do not you think that the only plan for he to follow be to be faithful to he oath undoubtedly madame well you may depend upon it that nothing will make we change have courage m bertrand i hope that with patience firmness and consistency all be not yet lose -lrb- 3 -rrb- nor be m bertrand the only one of the minister who receive proof of the resolution of the queen to adhere steadily to the constitution there be also a new minister of war the count de narbonne as firmly attach to the person of the sovereign as m bertrand himself though in political principle more inclined to the view of the constitutionalist than to those of the extreme royalist he be likewise a man of considerable capacity eloquent and fertile in resource but he be ambitious and somewhat vain and he be so elated at the approval express by the assembly of a report on the military resource of the kingdom which he lay before it soon after he appointment that he obtain a audience of the queen the object of which be to convince she that the only means of save the state be to confer on a man of talent energy sagacity and activity who enjoy the confidence of the assembly and of the nation the post of prime minister and he admit that he intend to designate himself by this description marie antoinette though fully aware of the desirableness of have a single man of ability and firmness at the head of the administration be for a moment surprise out of she habitual courtesy she could not forbear a smile and in plain term ask he if he be crazy -lrb- 4 -rrb- but she proceed with she usual kindness to explain to he the impracticability of the scheme which he have suggest and the foundation of she argument be a explanation that such a appointment would be a violation of the constitution which forbid the king to create any new ministerial office and the count deserve to have it mention to he honor that the rebuff which he have receive in no degree cool he attachment to the king and queen or the zeal with which he labor for they service we have no information how far the new minister coincide in a step which the queen take in the course of November and which be commonly ascribe to she judgment alone before its dissolution the late assembly have break up the national guard of pari into separate legion and have suppress the appointment of commander-in-chief of the force and la fayette whom this measure have leave without employment feeling keenly the diminution of he importance and instigate by the restlessness common to man of moderate capacity conceive the hope of succeed bailly in the mayoralty of pari which that magistrate be on the point of resign it have become a post of great consequence since the extent to which the authority of the crown have be pare away tend to make the mayor the absolute dictator of the capital and consequently the jacobin be anxious to secure the office for one of the extreme revolutionary party and set up pétion as a rival candidate the election belong to the citizen and as in the city the two party possess almost equal strength it be soon see that the court which have by no means lose its influence among the tradesman and shop-keeper have the power of decide the contest in favor of the candidate for whom it should pronounce marie antoinette declare for pétion she know he to be a jacobin -lrb- 5 -rrb- but he be so devoid of any reputation for ability that she do not fear he nor except that he have behave with boorish disrespect and ill-manners during they melancholy return from varenne have she any reason for suspect he of any special enmity to the king but la fayette though always loud in he profession of loyalty have never lose a opportunity of offer personal insult to both the king and herself it be to he shameful neglect -lrb- to put he conduct in the most favorable light -rrb- that she justly attribute the danger to which she have be expose at versaille and the compulsion which have be put upon the king to take up he residence in pari and not to mention a constant series of petty insult which he have heap on both loui and herself and on the royalist as a body he have give unmistakable proof of he personal animosity toward the king by he conduct on the 21st of June and by the indecent rigor with which he treat they both after they return from varenne even when he be loudest in the profession of he desire and power to influence the assembly in the king 's favor one of he own friend have tell he to he face that he be insincere -lrb- 6 -rrb- and that loui could not and ought not to trust he promise and every part of he conduct toward the royal pair be stamp with duplicity as well as with ill-will it be not strange therefore indeed it be fully consistent with the honest openness of marie antoinette 's own character that she should prefer a open enemy to a pretended friend she even believe what from the very commencement of the revolution many have suspect that la fayette cherish view of personal ambition and aim at revive the old authority of a maire du palais over a rous fainéant -lrb- 7 -rrb- she therefore direct she friend to throw they weight into the scale in favor of pétion who be accordingly elect by a great majority while the marquis greatly chagrin retire for a time to he estate in auvergne the victory however be a unfortunate one for the court it contribute to increase the confidence of its enemy and as they instinct show they that it be from the resolution of the queen that they have the most formidable opposition to dread it be against she that from they first entrance into the assembly vergniaud and he friend specially exert themselves vergniaud openly contend that the inviolability of the sovereign which be a article of the new constitution apply only to the king himself and in no degree to he consort while in the jacobin and cordelier club the coarsest libel be pour forth against she with unremitting perseverance to stimulate and justify the most obscene and ferocious threat the coarsest ruffian in a street quarrel never use fouler language of one another than these man of education apply to the pure-minded and magnanimous lady whose sole offense be that she be the wife of they kind-hearted king and in addition to this daily increase of they danger which such denunciation could not fail to augment the royal family be now suffer inconvenience which even those whose measure have cause they have never design they be in the most painful want of money the agitation of the last two year have render the treasury bankrupt the paper money which now compose almost the whole circulation of the country be valueless while as it be in this paper money -lrb- assignat as the note be call as be professedly secure by assignment on the royal domain and on the ecclesiastical property which have be confiscate -rrb- that the king 's civil list be pay at the latter end of each month it be not uncommon for he and the queen to be absolutely destitute it be with great reluctance that they accept loan from they loyal adherent because they see no prospect of be able to repay they but have they not avail themselves of this resource they would at time have want absolute necessaries -lrb- 8 -rrb- the royal couple still keep they health the king 's apathy be in this respect as beneficial as the queen 's courage : they still ride a great deal when the weather be favorable and on one occasion at the beginning of 1792 the queen with she sister-in-law and she daughter go again to the theater the opera be the same which have be perform at the visit in October but this time the jacobin have not be forewarn so as to pack the house and madame du gazon 's duet be receive with enthusiasm again as she sing ah que j' aime ma maîtresse she bow to the royal box and the audience cheer as if in reply to one verse il faut les rendre heureux ouus ouus with lively unanimity come from all part of the house and the singer be compel to repeat the duet four time it be a queer nation this of ours say the princess elizabeth in relate the scene to one of she correspondent but we must allow that it have very charming moment -lrb- 9 -rrb- a somewhat curious episode to divert they mind from these domestic anxiety be present by a embassy from the brave and intriguing sultan of mysore the celebrated tippoo sahib who seek to engage loui to lend he six thousand french troops with whose aid he trust to break down the ascendency which england be rapidly establish in indium tippoo back he request in the oriental fashion by present though not such as in the opinion of m bertrand be quite worthy of the giver or of the receiver to the king he send some diamond but they be yellow ill-cut and ill-set and the rest of the offering be compose of a few piece of embroidered silk striped cloth and cambric : while the queen 's present consist of nothing more valuable than a few bottle of perfume of no very exquisite quality and a few box of powdered scent pastil and match the king and queen give nearly the whole present to m bertrand for he grandchild the queen only reserve a bottle of attar of rose and a couple of piece of cambric and that chiefly to afford a pretext for see m bertrand once or twice without he reception be imputed to a desire to promote some austrian intrigue for the jacobin have lately revive the clamor against austrian influence with greater vehemence than ever as m bertrand have grandchild he could well appreciate the pleasure of the queen at a incident which close one of he audience while he be thus receive she command the little dauphin beautiful as a angel as the minister describe he be caper about the room in high delight brandish a wooden sword a new toy which have just be give he a attendant call he to go to supper and he bound toward the door how be this my boy say marie antoinette call he back be you go off without make m bertrand a bow oh mamma say the little prince still skip about and smile that be because i know well that m bertrand be one of we friend good-evening m bertrand be not he a nice child -lrb- 10 -rrb- say the queen after he have leave the room he be very happy to be so young he do not feel what we suffer and he gayety do we good alas that which be now perhaps she only pleasure -- the contemplation of she child 's opening grace and amiability -- before long become even a addition to she affliction as the probability increase that the madness of the people and the wickedness of they leader would deprive he of the inheritance to preserve which to he be the principal object of all she care and exertion but these moment of gratification be become fewer as time go on each month each week bring fresh and increase anxiety to engross all she thought as the girondin leader begin to feel they strength the vote of the assembly become more violent one day it pass a fresh decree against the priest deprive all who refuse to take the oath to the new ecclesiastical constitution of the stipend for which they former preferment have be commute place they under strict supervision and declare they liable to instant banishment if they should venture to exercise they function in private another day it vent its wrath upon the emigrant summon the count de provence by name to return at once to france and with respect to the rest of the body now very numerous declare they conduct in be assemble on the frontier of the kingdom in a state of readiness for war in itself a act of treason and condemn to death and confiscation of they estate all who should fail to return to they native land before a state day but in these decree the advocate of violence have for the moment go too far -- they have outrun the feeling of the nation the emigrant indeed neither deserve nor find sympathy in any quarter the main body of they be at this time settle at coblentz where they conduct be such that it be hard to say whether it be more offensive to they country more injurious to they king or more discreditable to themselves they could not even act in harmony the king 's two brother establish rival court with a mistress at the head of each madame de balbi still rule the count de provence madame de polastron be the preside genius of the coterie of the count d'artoi the two lady regard each other with bitter jealousy agitate the whole town with they rivalry and wrangling and agree in nothing but in they endeavor to excite some foreign sovereign or other to make war upon they native land it be in vain that loui himself first entreat they and when he find he entreaty be disregard command he brother to return they positively refuse obedience to he order tell he in language which can only be characterize as that of study insult that he be write under coercion that he letter do not express he real view and that they honor they duty even they affection for he alike forbid they to obey he -lrb- 11 -rrb- the queen could not command but she write to they more than one letter of most earnest entreaty and as the prince found part of they hope on the co-operation of the northern sovereign she write also to the empress and to gustavus press both and especially the king of sweden -lrb- 12 -rrb- to restrain they but they be too headstrong and full of they own project to listen to she entreaty any more than to the king 's command and do not even take the trouble to conceal they negotiation with foreign power nor they object which could be nothing but war it be impossible that such conduct steadily pursue by the king 's own brother could be any thing but most pernicious to he cause it could not fail to excite suspicion of he own good faith it supply the jacobin with pretext for put fresh restraint on he authority and it frighten even the constitutionalist since it be plain that civil war must ensue with very probably the addition of foreign war also if these machination of the emigrant be not suppress still these sweeping proscription of entire class be not yet to the taste of the nation petition from the country and even one from the department of the seine be present to loui beg he to refuse he assent to the decree against the priest and the feeling which they represent be so strong and the reputation of some of the petitioner stand so high for ability and influence that the minister believe that he could safely refuse he sanction to both the vote even without they advice he would have reject the decree against the priest as one absolutely incompatible with he reverence for religion and its minister and he conduct on this subject supplies one more striking parallel to the history of the great english rebellion since there can hardly be a more precise resemblance between event occur in different age and different country than be afford by the resistance make by charle to the last vote of the london parliament against the bishop and this resistance of loui to the will of the assembly on behalf of the priest and by the fatal effect which in each case they conscientious and courageous determination have upon the fortune of the two sovereign loui therefore put he veto on both the decree with the exception of that clause in the act against the emigrant which summon he brother to return to the kingdom but that no one might pretend to fancy that he either approve of the conduct of the emigrant or sympathize with they principle or design he issue a circular letter to the governor of the different sea-port in which he remonstrate most earnestly with the sailor number of whom as it be report in pari be prepare to follow they example he point out in it that those who thus desert they country mistake they duty to that country to he as they king and to themselves that the present aspect of the nation desirous to return to order and to submission to the law remove every pretext for such conduct he set before they he own example and bid they remain at they post as he be remain at he and in language more impressive than that of command he exhort they not to turn a deaf ear to he prayer and at the same time he address letter to the elector of trèves and mayence and to the other petty german prince whose territory border on the rhine be the principal resort of the emigrant require they to cease to give they shelter and announce that if they should refuse to remove they from they dominion he should consider they refusal a sufficient ground for war while to show that he do not intend this menace to be a dead letter he soon afterward announce to the assembly that he have order a powerful army of a hundred and fifty thousand man to be move toward the frontier under the command of marshal luckner marshal rochambeau and general la fayette and he invite the member to vote a levy of fifty thousand more man to raise the force of the nation to its full complement chapter xxxiv death of leopold -- murder of gustavus of sweden -- violence of vergniaud -- the minister resign -- a girondin ministry be appoint -- character of dumouriez -- origin of the name sans-culotte -- union of different party against the queen -- war be declare against the empire -- operation in the netherland -- unskillfulness of la fayette -- the king fall into a state of torpor -- fresh libel on the queen -- barnave 's advice -- dumouriez have a audience of the queen -- dissolution of the constitutional guard -- formation of a camp near paris -- loui adhere to he refusal to assent to the decree against the priest -- dumouriez resign he office and take command of the army war of some kind -- foreign war civil war or both combine -- have apparently become inevitable and marie antoinette deceive herself if she think that the armed congress of sovereign for which she be above all thing anxious could lead to any other result in any ease a congress must have produce one consequence which she deprecate as much as any other a waste of time while as she truly say she enemy never waste a moment nor with the very different view of the policy to be pursue which the emperor and the king of prussium entertain -lrb- frederick be a advocate of a armed intervention in the affair of france which leopold oppose as impracticable and if practicable impolitic -rrb- be it easy to see how a congress could have bring those monarch to agree on any united system of action but all project of that kind necessarily fall to the ground in consequence of the death of the emperor which take place after a very short illness on the 1st of march 1792 and before the end of the same month the royal family lose another warm friend in gustavus of sweden who be assassinate in the very midst of preparation which he confidently hope might contribute to deliver he brother sovereign from he trouble marie antoinette speak truly when she say that the enemy of the crown never lose time the very prospect of war increase the division of the assembly since the jacobin be undisguisedly averse to it not one of they body have any reputation for skill in arm so that in the event of war it be evident that the chief command both in army and navy must be confer on person unconnected with they while the girondin though as far as be yet know equally destitute of member possess of any military ability look on war as favorable to they design whatever might be the issue of a campaign they be above all thing eager for the destruction of the monarchy and they reckon that if the french army be victorious its success would disable those who be most willing and might be most able to support the throne while if the enemy should prevail it would be easy to represent they triumph as the fruit of the mismanagement if not of the treachery of the king 's general and minister and the opposition of these two party be at this time so notorious that the queen think it favorable to the king since each would be eager to preserve he as a possible ally against its adversary it be for she husband 's and she child 's safety that she express anxiety never for she own with respect to herself she uniform language be that of fearlessness she do not for a moment conceal from she correspondent she sense of the danger which surround she she have not only open hostility to fear but treachery which be far worse and she declare that a perpetual imprisonment in a solitary tower on the sea-shore would be a less cruel fate than that which she daily endure from the wickedness of she enemy and the weakness of she friend every thing menace a inevitable catastrophe but she be prepare for every thing she have learn from she mother not to fear death that may as well come to-day as to-morrow she only fear for she dear child and for those she love and high among those whom she love she place she sister-in-law elizabeth who be always a angel aid she to support she sorrow and who with she poor dear child never quit she -lrb- 1 -rrb- a long continuance of sorrow and fear such as have now for nearly three year press upon the writer of this letter would so wear away and break down ordinary soul that when a crisis come they would be find wholly unequal to grapple with it and we may therefore the better form some idea of the strength of mind and almost superhuman fortitude of this admirable queen if from time to time we fix we attention on these not exaggerated complaint for indeed the misfortune that elicit they admit of no exaggeration and then remember that after so long a period of such uninterrupted suffer she spirit be so far from be break that as increase danger and horror thicken around she she courage seem to increase also she faithful attendant madame de campan have remark that she trouble have not even affect she temper that no one ever see she out of humor in every respect to the very last she show herself superior to the utmost malice of she enemy the news of the death of leopold whose son and successor franci be but three-and-twenty year of age give fresh encouragement to he sister 's enemy the intelligence have hardly reach pari when vergniaud begin to prepare the way for a fresh assault on the crown by a denunciation of the minister while the jacobin and cordelier make a open attack upon another club which the constitutionalist have lately form under the name of les feuillants hold its meeting in a convent of the monk of st bernard -lrb- 2 -rrb- and close it by main force though several soldier and la fayette among they be member of the feuillant they make no resistance they only apply to pétion as mayor of the city for protection and that worthy magistrate refuse they aid tell they that though the law forbid they to be attack the voice of the people be against they and to that voice he be bind to listen the minister fall before vergniaud and the unhappy king have no resource but to choose they successor from the party which have triumph over they the absurd law by which the last assembly have exclude its member from office be still in force so that the orator himself and he colleague could obtain no personal promotion but they be able to nominate the new minister who with but one exception be all man equally devoid of ability and reputation and therefore be the better fit to be the tool of those to whom they owe they preferment the name of three be lacoste degrave and duranton of whom nothing beyond they name be know a fourth be roland who be indeed know though not for any ability of he own but as the husband of the woman who as have be already mention be the first person in the whole nation to raise the cry for the murder of the king and queen and whose fierce thirst for blood so predominate over every other feeling that a few week afterward she even begin to urge the assassination of the only one among she husband 's colleague who be possess of the slightest ability because he view do not altogether coincide with she own general dumouriez whom she thus honor by single he out for she especial hatred be a exception to he colleague in several point he be a man of middle age who enjoy a good reputation not only for military skill but also for diplomatic sagacity and address earn as far back as the latter year of the precede reign and he be so far from be originally imbue with revolutionary principle that when in the summer of 1789 a mutinous spirit first appear among the troops in pari he volunteer to place he service at the king 's disposal recommend measure of vigor and resolution which if they have be adopt might have quell the spirit of rebellion and have change the whole subsequent history of the nation but as necker have reject mirabeau a few week before so he also reject dumouriez and discontent at the treatment which he receive from the minister and which seem to prove that active employment of which he be desirous could only be obtain through some other influence drive the general into the rank of the revolutionary party he now accept the post of foreign secretary in the new ministry but the connection with the enemy of the monarchy be uncongenial to he taste and after a short time the frequent intercourse with loui which be the necessary consequence of he appointment and the conviction of the king 's perfect honesty and patriotism which this intercourse force upon he revive he old feeling of loyalty and so long as he remain in office he honestly endeavor to avert the evil which he foresee and to give the advice and to support the policy by which in he honest belief it be alone possible for loui to preserve he authority dumouriez be a gentleman in birth and manners but he colleague have so little of either the habit or appearance of decent society that the attendant on the royal family give they the name of the sans-culotte and this name mean originally to describe the absence of the ordinary court dress without which no previous minister have ever venture to appear in the presence of royalty be presently adopt as a distinctive title by the whole body of the extreme revolutionist who know the value of a name under which to bind they follower together -lrb- 3 -rrb- the attack on the ministry be accompany with more direct attack on the king and queen themselves than have ever be venture on in the former assembly by this time the system of espial and treachery by which they be surround have become so systematic that they could not even send a messenger to they nephew the emperor except under a feigned name -lrb- 4 -rrb- and the baron de breteuil who announce he mission to franci report to he at the same time that the chief of the assembly be propose to pass vote suspend the king from he function and to separate the queen from he on the ground that a impeachment be to be present against both as have solicit the late emperor to form a confederacy among the great power of europe in favor of the royal prerogative the queen be in fact now as always more the object of they hatred than she husband and toward the end of march a reconciliation of all she enemy take place that the attack upon she might be combine with a strength that should insure its success the marquis de condorcet a man of some eminence in philosophy as the word have be understand since the reign of the encyclopedist and closely connect with the girondin though not formally enrol in they party give a supper at which the duc d'orléans formally reconcile himself to la fayette and both in company with brissot and the abbé siéyes who of late have scarcely be hear of draw up a indictment against the queen -lrb- 5 -rrb- they malignity even go the length of resolve to separate the dauphin from he mother on the plea of provide for he education but the means which the girondin take to secure they triumph for the moment defeat they la fayette do not keep the secret one of he friend give information to the king of the plot that be in contemplation and the next day the constitutionalist muster in the assembly in such strength that neither girondin nor jacobin dare bring forward the infamous proposal but loui and marie antoinette reasonably regard the attack on they as only postpone not as defeat or abandon they begin to prepare for the worst they burn most of they papers and remove into the custody of friend whom they could trust those which they regard as too valuable to destroy and at the same time they send notice to they partisan to cease write to they they could neither venture to send nor to receive letter they believe that at this time the plan of they enemy be to terrify they into repeat they attempt to escape a attempt of which the espial and treachery with which they be surround would have insure the failure but which would have give the jacobin a pretext for they trial and condemnation but this scheme they could themselves defeat by remain at they post patience and courage be they only possible defense and with those quality they be richly endowed a vital difference of principle distinguish the old from the new ministry : the former have wish to preserve the majority of the latter be resolve to destroy the throne and the means by which each seek to attain its end be as diametrically opposite as the end themselves bertrand and de lessart the minister who in the late administration have enjoy most of the king and queen 's confidence have be studious to preserve peace believe that policy to be absolutely essential for the safety of loui himself because they entertain the same opinion the new minister be eager for war and unhappily dumouriez in spite of he desire to uphold the throne be animated by the same feeling he own talent and taste be warlike and he office enable he to gratify they in this instance for the conciliatory tone which de lessart have employ toward the imperial government he now substitute a language not only imperious but menacing prince kaunitz who still preside over the administration at vienna attach though he be to the system of policy which he have inaugurate under marium teresa could not avoid reply in a similar strain until at last on the 20th of April loui sorely against he will be compel to announce to the assembly that all he effort for the preservation of peace have fail and to propose a instant declaration of war the declaration be vote with enthusiasm but for some time it bring nothing but disaster the campaign be open in the netherland where the austrian take by surprise be so weak in number that it seem certain that they would be drive from the country without difficulty or delay marshal beaulieu they commander-in-chief have scarcely twenty thousand man while the count de narbonne have leave the french army in so good a condition that degrave he successor be able to send a hundred and thirty thousand man against he and dumouriez furnish he with a plan for a invasion of the netherland which if properly carry out would have make the french master of the whole country in a few day but the largest division of the army to which the execution of the most important portion of the intended operation be intrust have be place under the command of la fayette who prove equally devoid of resolution and of skill some of he regiment show a disorderly and insubordinate temper one battalion first mutiny and murder some of its officer and then disgrace itself by cowardice in the field another display a almost equal want of courage and la fayette dishearten and perplex though the number of he troops still more than double those oppose to he retreat into france and remain there in a state of complete inactivity but as have be say before disaster be almost as favorable to the political view of the girondin as success while it add to the danger of the sovereign by encourage the jacobin who be elate at the failure of a general so hateful to they as la fayette they now adopt a party emblem a red cap and the duc d'orléans and he son the duc de chartre -lrb- 6 -rrb- assume it and with study insult parade in it up and down the garden of the palace under the queen 's window and if the two faction do not formally coalesce they both proceed with greater boldness than ever toward they desire object not greatly differ as to the means by which it be to be attain the palace be now indeed a scene of misery the king 's apathy be degenerate into despair at one time he be so utterly prostrate that he remain for ten day absolutely silent never utter a word except to name he throw when play at backgammon with elizabeth at last the queen rouse he from he torpor throw herself at he foot and mingle caress with she expostulation entreat he to remember what he owe to he family and remind he that if they must perish it be better at least to perish with honor and be king to the last than to wait passively till assassin should come and murder they in they own room she herself be in a condition in which nothing but she indomitable courage prevent she from utterly break down sleep have desert she by day she rarely venture out-of-doors ride she have give up and she fear to walk in the garden of the tuilery even in the little portion mark off for the dauphin 's playground lest she should expose herself to the coarse insult which the basest of hireling be ever on the watch to offer she -lrb- 7 -rrb- she could not even venture to go openly to mass at easter but be force to arrange for one of she chaplain to perform the service for she before daylight balk of they wish to offer she personal insult she enemy redouble they diligence in invent and spread libel the demagogue of the palais royal revive the story of she subservience to the interest of austrium and even send letter forge in she name to different member of the assembly invite they to private conference with she in the apartment of madame de lamballe but she treat all such attack with lofty disdain and be even greatly annoy when she learn that the chief of the police with the king 's sanction have buy up a life of madame la mothe in which that infamous woman pretend to give a true account of the affair of she necklace and have have it burn in the manufactory of sèvres she think with some reason that to take a step which seem to show a dread of such attack be the surest way to encourage more of they and that apparent indifference to they be the only line of action consistent with she innocence or with she dignity the increase danger of she position move the pity of some who have once be she enemy and sharpen they desire to serve she barnave who probably overrate he present influence -lrb- 8 -rrb- in many letter press he advice upon she of which the substance be that she should lay aside she distrust of the constitutionalist party and with the king throw herself wholly on the constitution to which the nation be profoundly attach he even admit that it be not without defect but hold out a hope that with the aid of the royalist he and he friend might be able to amend they and in time to re-invest the throne with all necessary splendor and the queen be so touch by he evident earnestness that she grant he a audience and assure he of she esteem and confidence barnave be partly correct in he judgment but he overlook one all-essential circumstance there be no doubt that he speak truly when he declare that the nation in general be attach to the constitution but he fail to give sufficient weight to the consideration that the jacobin and girondin be agree in seek to overthrow it and that for that object they be act with a concert and a energy to which he and he party be stranger dumouriez too be equally earnest in he desire to serve the king and she with far greater power to be useful than barnave he too be admit to a audience of which he have leave we a account which while it show both he notion of the state of the country and of the rival party and also he own sincerity be no less characteristic of the queen herself admit to she presence he find she as he describe the interview look very red walk up and down the room with impetuous stride in a agitation which presage a stormy discussion the different event which have take place since the king in the precede autumn have ratify the constitution the furious language hold in and the violent measure carry by the assembly have evidently change she belief in the possibility of attempt even for a short time to carry on the government under the condition impose by that act she come toward he with a air which be at once majestic and yet show irritation and say : you sir be all-powerful at this moment but it be only by the favor of the people which soon break its idol to piece you existence depend on you conduct you be say to have great talent you must see that neither the king nor i can endure all these novelty nor the constitution i tell you this frankly now choose you side to this fervid apostrophe dumouriez reply in a tone which he intend to combine a sorrowful tenderness with loyal respect : madame say he i be overwhelm with the painful confidence which you majesty have repose in I i will not betray it but i be place between the king and the nation and i belong to my country permit I to represent to you that the safety of the king of yourself and of you August child be bind up with the constitution as well as be the re-establishment of the king 's legitimate authority you be both surround with enemy who be sacrifice you to they own interest the unfortunate queen shock as well as surprised at this opposition to she view reply raise she voice that will not last take care of yourself madame reply he in he turn i be more than fifty year old my life have be pass in countless danger and when i take office i reflect deeply that its responsibility be not the greatest of its peril this be alone want cry out the queen with a accent of indignant grief and as if astonished herself at she own vehemence this alone be want to calumniate I you seem to suppose that i be capable of cause you to be assassinate and she burst into tear dumouriez be as agitate as she be god forbid he reply that i should do you such a injustice and he add some flattering expression of attachment such as he think calculate to soothe a mind so proud yet so crushed and presently she calm herself and come up to he put she hand on he arm and he resume : believe I madame i have no object in deceive you i abhor anarchy and crime as much as you do believe I i have experience i be better place than you majesty for judge of event this be not a short-lived popular movement as you seem to think it be the almost unanimous insurrection of a great nation against inveterate abuse there be great faction which fan this flame in all faction there be many scoundrel and many madman in the revolution i see nothing but the king and the entire nation every thing which tend to separate they tend to they mutual ruin : i be labor as much as i can to reunite they it be for you to help I if i be a obstacle to you design and if you persist in think so tell I so and i will at once send in my resignation to the king and will retire into a corner to grieve over the fate of my country and of you and he conclude he narrative by express he belief that he have regain the queen 's confidence by he frank explanation of he view while he himself in he turn be evidently fascinate by the affability with which after a brief further conversation she dismiss he -lrb- 9 -rrb- though if we may trust madame de campan marie antoinette be not as satisfied as she have seem to be but declare that it be not possible for she to place confidence in he protestation when she recollect he former language and act and the party with which he be even now act madame de campan probably give a more correct report of the queen 's feeling than the general himself whom the consciousness of he own integrity of purpose very probably mislead into believe that he have convince she of it but though if marie antoinette do listen to he profession and advice with some degree of mistrust she undoubtedly do he less than justice : she can hardly be blame for indulge such a feeling when it be remember in what a atmosphere of treachery she have live for the last three year undoubtedly dumouriez though not a thorough-going royalist like m bertrand be not only in intention a honest and friendly counselor but be by far the ablest adviser who have have access to she since the death of mirabeau and in one respect be a more judicious and trustworthy adviser than even that brilliant and fertile statesman since he do not fall into the error of miscalculate what be practical or of overrate he own influence with the assembly or the nation yet have the king and queen adopt he view ever so unreservedly it may well be doubt whether they would have avert or even defer the fate which await they the leader of the two party before whose union they fall have as little attachment to the new constitution as the queen the moment that they obtain the undisputed ascendency they trample it underfoot in every one of its provision constitution or no constitution they be determine to overthrow the throne and to destroy those to whom it belong and to man animated with such a resolution it signify little what pretext might be afford they by any action of they destine victim the wolf never yet want a plea for devour the lamb one of the first fruit of the union between the jacobin and the girondin be the preparation of a insurrection the assembly do not move fast enough for they it might be still useful as a auxiliary but the lead in the movement the club assume to themselves they first care be to deprive the king of all means of resistance and with this view to get rid of the constitutional guard the commander of which be still the gallant duke de brissac a noble-minded and faithful adherent of loui amidst all he distress but it be not easy to find any ground for disband a force which be too small to be formidable to any but traitor and the pretext which be put forward be so preposterous that it could excite no feeling but that of amusement if the object aim at be not too serious and shocking for laughter at easter the dauphin have present the mess of the regiment with a cake one of the ornament of which be a small white flag take from among he own toy pétion now issue order to search the officer ' quarter for this child 's flag and when it be find one of the jacobin member be not ashamed to produce it to the assembly as a proof that the court be meditate a counter - revolution and a massacre of the patriot and to propose the instant dissolution of the guard the motion be carry though some of the constitutionalist party have the honesty to oppose it as one which could have only regicide for its object and loui do not dare refuse it he assent he be now wholly disarm to render he defeat in the impending struggle more certain one of the minister servan himself propose a levy of twenty thousand fresh soldier to be station permanently at pari and this motion also be pass again loui could not venture to withhold he sanction from the bill though he comfort himself by dismiss the mover with two of he colleague roland and clavière roland 's dismissal have indeed become indispensable since on the precede day he have have the audacity to write he a insolent letter compose by he ferocious wife which in express term threaten he with death if he do not give satisfaction to the revolution -lrb- 10 -rrb- nor be madame roland incline to be satisfy with the murder of the king and queen as have be already mention she at the same time urge upon she submissive husband the assassination of dumouriez who have intelligence of she enmity begin in self-defense to connect himself with the jacobin on the dismissal of roland and the other he have exchange the foreign port-folio for that of war and be practically the prime minister be in fact the only one whom loui admit to any degree of confidence but this arrangement last less than a single week loui have yield to and adopt he advice on every point but one he have sanction the dismissal of the constitutional guard and the formation of the new body of troops which no one doubt be intend to be use against himself but he be as firmly convince as ever that he religious duty bind he to refuse he assent to the decree against the priest and he refuse to do a violence to he conscience and to commit what he regard as a sin but this very decree be the one which dumouriez regard as the most dangerous one for he to reject as be that which the assembly be most firmly resolve to make law and as he most vigorous remonstrance fail to shake the king 's resolution on this point he resign he post as a minister and repair to the flemish frontier to take the command of the army which greatly need a able leader chapter xxxv the insurrection of June 20th both jacobin and girondin feel that the departure of dumouriez from paris have remove a formidable obstacle from they path and they at once begin to hurry forward the preparation for they meditate insurrection the general give in he resignation on the 15th of June and the 20th be fix for a attack on the palace by which its contriver design to effect the overthrow of the throne if not the destruction of the entire royal family it be organize with unusual deliberation the meeting of conspirator be attend not only by the girondin leader to whom madame roland have recently add a new recruit a young barrister from the south name barbaroux remarkable for he personal beauty and as be soon see for a pitiless hardness of heart and energetic delight in deed of cruelty that even in that blood-thirsty company be equal by few with they meet all those as yet most notorious for ferocity -- danton and legendre the founder of the cordelier marat daily in he obscene and blasphemous newspaper clamor for wholesale bloodshed santerre odious as the sanguinary leader of the very first outbreak of the revolution rotondo already as we have see detect in attempt to assassinate the queen and pétion who thus repay she preference of he to la fayette which have place he in the mayoralty whose duty he be now betray some too bear a part in the foul conspiracy as partisan of the duc d'orléans who be generally understand to have instruction to be lavish of they master 's gold the vile prince hope that the result of the outbreak would be the assassination of he cousin and he own elevation to the vacant throne in they speech they give loui the name of monsieur veto in allusion to the still legal exercise of he prerogative by which he have seek to protect the priest while the queen be call madame veto though in fact she have finally join dumouriez in urge she husband to give he royal assent to the decree against they not as think it on any pretense justifiable but as believe with the general in the impossibility of maintain its rejection yet nothing could more completely prove the absolute innocence and unimpeachable good faith of both king and queen than the act of he enemy in give they this nickname so clear a evidence be it that they could allege nothing more odious against they than the possession by loui in a most modify degree of a prerogative which without any modification at all have in every country be at all time regard as indispensable to and inseparable from royalty and the exercise of it for the defense of a body of man of whom none could deny the entire harmlessness on the night of the 19th the appoint leader of the different band into which the insurgent be to be divide separate the watch-word destruction to the palace be give out and all pari wait in anxious terror for the event of the morrow loui be as well aware as any of the citizen of the intended attack and prepare for it as for death on the afternoon of the 19th he write to he confessor to desire he to come to he at once he have never he say have such need of he consolation he have do with this world and he thought be now fix on heaven alone great calamity be announce for the morrow but he feel that he have courage to meet they and after the holy man have leave he as he gaze on the setting sun he once more give utterance to he foreboding who can tell say he whether it be not the last that i shall ever see the royalist feel he danger almost as keenly as himself but be powerless to prevent it by any means of they own the duke de liancourt who have some title to be listen to by the revolutionary party since no one have be more zealous in promote the most violent measure of the first assembly press earnestly on pétion that he duty as mayor bind he to call out the national guard and so prevent the intended outbreak but be answer by sarcasm and insult while vergniaud from the tribune of the assembly itself dare to deride all who apprehend danger on the morning of the 20th daylight have scarcely dawn when twenty thousand man the greater part of whom be arm with some weapon or other -- musket pike hatchet crowbar and even spit from the cook-shop form part of they equipment -- assemble on the place where the bastile have stand santerre be already there on horseback as they appoint leader and when all be collect and marshal in three division they begin they march one division have for its chief the marquis de st huruge a intimate friend and adherent of the duc d'orléans at the head of another a woman of notorious infamy know as la belle liégeoise clothe in male attire ride astride upon a cannon while as it advance the crowd be every moment swell by vast body of recruit among whom be number of woman whose imprecation in ferocity and foulness surpass even the foulest threat of the man the ostensible object of the procession be to present petition to the king and the assembly on the dismissal of roland and he colleague from the administration and on the refusal of the royal assent to the decree against the priest the real design of those who have organize it be more truthfully show by the banner and emblem bear aloft in the rank beware the lamp -lrb- 1 -rrb- be the inscription on one death to veto and he wife be read upon another a gang of butcher carry a calf 's heart on the point of a pike with the heart of a aristocrat for a motto a band of crossing-sweeper or of man who profess to be such though the fineness of they linen be

of a guillotine another bear aloft a miniature gallows with a effigy of the queen herself hang from it so great be the crowd that it be nearly three in the afternoon before the head of it reach the assembly where its approach have raise a debate on the propriety of receive any petition at all which be to be present in so menace a guise m roederer the procurator-syndic or chief legal officer of the department of pari recommend its rejection on the ground that such a procession be illegal not only because of its avowed object of force its way to the king but also because it be likely to lead into act of violence even if it have not premeditate they he argument be earnestly support by the constitutionalist and oppose and ridicule by vergniaud but before the discussion be over the rioter who have now reach the hall take the decision into they own hand force open the door and put forward a spokesman to read what they call a petition but which be in truth a sanguinary denunciation of those whom it proclaim the enemy of the nation and of whom it demand that the land should be purge insolent and ferocious as it be it however coincide with the feeling of the girondin who be now the master of the assembly one orator carry a motion that the petitioner should receive what be call the honor of the assembly or in other word should be allow to enter the hall with they arm and defile before they they pour in with exult uproar song half blood-thirsty and half obscene gesture indicative some of murder some of debauchery cry of vive la nation intersperse with inarticulate yell be the sound the guillotine and the queen upon the gallows be the sight which be think in character with the legislature of a people which still claim to be regard as the pattern of civilization by all europe evening approach before the last of the rabble have pass through the hall and by that time the lead rank be in front of the tuilery there be but scanty means of resist they a few company of the national guard form the whole protection of the palace and with they the agent of orlean and the girondin have be briskly tamper all the morning many have be seduce a few remain firm in they loyalty but those on whom the royal family have the best reason to rely be a band of gentleman with the veteran marshal de noaille at they head who have repair to the tuilery in the morning to furnish to they sovereign such defense as could be find in they loyal and devoted gallantry some of they besides the old marshal the count d'hervilly who have command the cavalry of the constitutional guard and m d'acloque a officer of the national guard bring military experience to aid they valor and make such arrangement as the time and character of the building render practicable to keep the rioter at bay but the utmost bravery of such a handful of man for they be no more and even the more solid resistance of iron gate and barrier be unavail against the thousand that assail they exasperate at find the gate close against they the rioter begin to beat upon they with sledge-hammer presently they be join by sergent and pani two of the municipal magistrate who order the sentinel to open the gate to the sovereign people the sentinel flee the gate be open or break down the mob seize one of the cannon which stand in the place du carrousel carry it up the stair of the palace and plant it against the door of the royal apartment and while they shout out a demand that the king should show himself they begin to batter the door as before they have batter the gate and threaten if it should not yield to they hatchet to blow it down with cannon-shot fear of personal danger be not one of the king 's weakness the hatchet beat down the outer door and as it fall he come forth from the room behind and with unruffled countenance accost the ruffian who be pour through it he sister the princess elizabeth be at he side he have charge those around he to keep the queen back and she know how special a object of the popular hatred and fury she be with a fortitude beyond that which defy death remain out of sight lest she should add to he danger for a moment the mob respect in spite of themselves the calm heroism with which they be confront pause in they onset but those in front be push on by those behind and pike be level and blow be aim at both the king and the princess whom they mistake for the queen at first there be but one or two attendant at the king 's side but they be faithful and brave man one strike down a ruffian who be lift he weapon to aim a blow at loui himself a pike be even level at he sister when she equerry m bousquet too far off to bring she the aid of he right hand call out spare the princess delicate as be she frame and feature elizabeth be worthy of she blood and as dauntless as the rest she turn to she preserver almost reproachfully : why do you undeceive he it might have save the queen but after a few seconds acloque with some grenadier of the national guard on whom he could still rely hasten up by a back staircase to defend he sovereign and with the aid of some of the gentleman who have come with the marshal de noaille draw the king back into a recess form by a window and raise a rampart of bench in front of he and one still more trustworthy of they own body they would gladly have attack the rioter and drive they back but be restrain by loui himself put up you sword say he this crowd be excite rather than wicked and he address those who have force they way into the room with word of condescend conciliation they reply with threat and imprecation and seek to force they way onward press back by they mere number and weight the small group of loyal champion who by this time have gather in front of he so great be the uproar that presently a report reach the main body of the insurgent who be still in the garden beneath that loui have be kill and they mingle shout of triumph with cheer for orlean as they new king and demand that the head of the king and queen should be throw down to they from the window but no actual injury be inflict on loui though he owe he safety more to he own calmness than even to the devotion of he guard one ruffian threaten he with instant death if he do not at once grant every prayer contain in they petition he reply as composedly as if he have be on he throne at versaille that the present be not the time for make such a demand nor be this the way in which to make it the dignity of the answer seem to imply a contempt for the threatener and the mob grow more uproarious fear not sire say one of acloque 's grenadier we be around you the king take the man 's hand and place it on he heart which be beat more calmly than that of the soldier himself judge yourself say he if i fear legendre the butcher raise he pike as if to strike he while he reproach he as a traitor and the enemy of he country i be not and never have be aught but the sincerest friend of my people be the gentle but fearless answer if it be so put on this red cap and the butcher thrust one into he hand on the end of he pike prepare as loui believe to plunge the weapon itself into he breast if he refuse the king put it on and so little regarded it that he forget to remove it again as he afterward repent that he have not do thinking that he conduct in allow it to remain on he head bear too strong a resemblance to fear or to a unworthy compromise of he dignity but still the uproar increase and above it rise loud cry for the queen till at last she also come forward as yet from the motive that have already be mention she have consent to remain out of sight but each explosion of the mob increase she unwillingness to keep back it be she feel she duty to be always at the king 's side if need be to die with he to stand aloof be infamy and at last as the demand for she appearance increase even those around she confess that it might be safer for she to show herself the door be throw open and leading forth she child from whom she refuse to part and accompany by madame de tourzel madame de lamballe and other of she lady the most timid of whom seem as if inspire by she example marie antoinette advance and take she place by the side of she husband and with head erect and color heighten by the sight of she enemy face they disdainfully as lion in they utmost rage have recoil before a man who have look they steadily in the face so do even those miscreant quail before they pure and high-minded queen at first it seem as if she bitterest enemy be to be find among she own sex the man be for a moment silence but a young girl whose appearance be not that of the lowest class come forward and abuse she in coarse and furious language especially revile she as the austrian the queen astonish at find such animosity in one apparently tender and gentle condescend to expostulate with she why do you hate I i have never injure you you have not injure I but it be you who cause the misery of the nation poor child reply marie antoinette they have deceive you i be the wife of you king the mother of you dauphin who will be you king i be a frenchwoman in every feeling of my heart i shall never again see austrium i can only be happy or unhappy in france and i be happy when you love I the girl be melt by she patience and gentleness she burst into tear of shame and begged pardon for she previous conduct i do not know you she say i see now that you be good -lrb- 2 -rrb- another ask she how old be you girl she be old enough reply the queen to feel acutely such scene as these but while these brief conversation be go on the crowd keep press forward one officer have draw a table in front of the queen as she advance so as to screen she from actual contact with any of the rioter but more than one of they stretch across it as if to reach she one fellow demand that she should put a red cap which he throw to she on the head of the dauphin and as she see the king wear one she consent but it be too large and fall down the child 's face almost stifle he with its thickness santerre himself reach across and remove it and lean with he hand on the table which shake beneath he vehemence address she with what he mean for courtesy princess say he do not fear the french people do not wish to slay you i promise this in they name marie antoinette have long ago declare that she heart have become french it be too much so for she to allow such a man 's claim to be the spokesman of the nation it be not by such as you she reply with lofty scorn it be not by such as you that i judge of the french people but by brave man like these and she point to the gentleman who be stand round she as she champion and to the faithful grenadier the well-timed and well-deserved compliment rouse they to still greater enthusiasm but already the danger be pass away the assembly have see with indifference the departure of the mob to attack the tuilery and have proceed with its ordinary business as if nothing be likely to happen which could call for its interference but when the uproar within the palace become audible in the hall the count de duma one of the very few man of noble birth who have be return to this second assembly with a few other deputy of the better class hasten to see what be take place and quickly return report the king 's imminent danger to they colleague duma give such offense by the boldness of he language that some of the jacobin threaten he with violence but he refuse to be silence and he firmness prevail as firmness nearly always do prevail in a assembly where though there be many fierce and vehement blusterer there be very few man of real courage in compliance with he vehement demand for instant action a deputation of member be send to take measure for the king 's safety and then at last pétion who have carefully keep aloof while there seem to be a chance of the king be murder now that he could no longer hope for such a consummation repair to the palace and present himself before he to he he have the effrontery to declare that he have only just become apprise of he situation from the assembly at a later hour in the evening he claim the credit of have organize the riot but loui would not condescend to pretend to believe he it be extraordinary he reply that pétion should not have earlier know what have last so long even he could not but be for a moment abashed at the king 's unwonted expression of indignation but he soon recover himself and with unequaled impudence turn and thank the crowd for the moderation and dignity with which they have exercise the right of petition and bid they finish the day in similar conformity with the law and retire to they home they obey the interference of the deputy have convince they leader that they could not succeed in they purpose now santerre whose softer mood such as it have be have soon pass away mutter with a deep oath that they have miss they blow but must try it again hereafter for the present he lead off he brigand the palace and garden be restore to quiet though the trace of the assault to which they have be expose could not easily be efface and loui and he family be leave in tranquillity to thank god for they escape but to forebode also that similar trial be in store for they all of which it be not likely would have so innocent a termination -lrb- 3 -rrb- chapter xxxvi feeling of marie antoinette -- different plan be form for she escape -- she hope for aid from austrium and prussium -- la fayette come to pari -- he mismanagement -- a attempt be make to assassinate the queen -- the motion of bishop lamourette -- the feast of the federation -- la fayette propose a plan for the king 's escape -- bertrand propose another -- both be reject by the queen we can do little more than guess at the feeling of marie antoinette after such a day of horror she could scarcely venture to write a letter lest it should fall into hand for which it be not intend and be misinterpret so as to be mischievous to herself and to she correspondent and two brief note -- one on the 4th of July to mercy and one write a day or two later to the landgravine of hesse-darmstadt -- be all that so far as we know proceed from she pen in the sad period between the two attack on the palace brief as they be they be characteristic as show she unshaken resolution to perform she duty to she family and prove at the same time how absolutely free she be from any delusion as to the certain event of the struggle in which she be engage no courage be ever more entirely found on high and virtuous principle for no one be ever less sustain by hope to mercy she say : July 4th 1792 you know the occurrence of the 20th of June we position become every day more critical there be nothing but violence and rage on one side weakness and inactivity on the other we can reckon neither on the national guard nor on the army we do not know whether to remain in pari or to throw ourselves into some other place it be more than time for the power to speak out boldly the 14th of July and the day which will follow it may become day of general mourning for france and of regret to the power who will have be too slow in explain themselves all be lose if the faction be not arrest in they wickedness by fear of impend chastisement they be resolve on a republic at all risk to arrive at that they have determine to assassinate the king it would be necessary that any manifesto -lrb- 1 -rrb- should make the national assembly and pari responsible for he life and the life of he family in spite of all these danger we will not change we resolution you may depend on this as much as i depend on you attachment it be a pleasure to I to believe that you allow I a share of the attachment which bind you to my mother and this be a moment to give I a great proof of it in save I and mine if there be still time -lrb- 2 -rrb- the letter to the landgravine be one of reply to a proposal which that princess who have long be one of she most attach friend have lately make to she that she should allow she brother prince george of darmstadt to carry out a plan by which as he conceive he could convey the queen and she child safely out of paris the enterprise be as both he and he sister flatter themselves greatly facilitate by the circumstance that the prince 's person be wholly unknown in the french capital July 1792 -lrb- 3 -rrb- you friendship and you anxiety for I have touch my very inmost soul the person -lrb- 4 -rrb- who be about to return to you will explain the reason which have detain he so long he will also tell you that at present i do not dare to receive he in my own apartment yet it would have be very pleasant to talk to he about you to whom i be so tenderly attach no my princess while i feel all the kindness of you offer i can not accept they i be vow for life to my duty and to those beloved person whose misfortune i share and who whatever people may say of they deserve to be regard with interest by all the world for the courage with which they support they position the bearer of this letter will be able to give you a detailed account of what be go on at present and of the spirit of this place where we be live i hear that he have see much and have form very correct idea may all that we be now do and suffer one day make we child happy this be the only wish that i allow myself farewell my princess they have take from I every thing except my heart which will always remain constant in its love for you be sure of this the loss of you love would be a evil which i could not endure i embrace you tenderly a thousand compliment to all yours i be prouder than ever of have be bear a german in she mention of the 14th of July as likely to bring fresh danger she be allude to the announcement of a intention of the jacobin to hold a fresh festival to commemorate the destruction of the bastile on the anniversary of that exploit a celebration which she have ample reason to expect would furnish occasion for some fresh tumult and outrage and we may remark that in one of these letter she rest she whole hope on foreign assistance while in the other she reject foreign aid to escape from she almost hopeless position but the key to she feeling in both case be one and the same above all thing she be a devoted faithful wife and mother to herself and she own safety she never give a think she first duty she rightly judge be to the king and she look to such a manifesto as she desire austrium and prussium to issue back by the movement of a powerful army as the measure which afford the best prospect of save she husband who could hardly be trust to save himself while for the very same reason she refuse to fly without he even though flight might have save she child she son and heir as well as herself because it would have increase she husband 's danger in each case she decision be that of a brave and devoted wife not perhaps in both instance judicious for when prussium do mingle in the contest as it do in the first week in July it evidently increase the peril of loui if indeed they be capable of aggravation by give the jacobin a plea for raise the cry that the country be in danger but in the second case in she refusal to flee and to leave she husband by himself to confront the exist and impend danger she judge rightly and worthily of herself and the only circumstance that have prevent she from receive the credit due for she refusal to avail herself of prince george 's offer be that throughout the whole period of the revolution she act of disinterestedness and heroism be so incessant that single deed of the kind be lose in the contemplation of she entire career during this long period of trial it be the peculiar ill-fortune of loui that more than once the very effort make by people who desire to assist he increase he peril the event of the 20th of June have shock and alarm even la fayette from the beginning of the revolution he have vacillate between a desire for a republic and for a limited monarchy on something like the english pattern without be able to decide which to prefer he have show himself willing to court a base popularity with the mob by heap uncalled-for insult on the king and queen but though he have coquet with the ultra - revolutionist and allow they to make a tool of he he have not nerve for the villainy which it be now clear that they meditate he have no taste for bloodshed and though gifted with but little acuteness he see that the success of the jacobin and girondin would lead neither to a republic nor to a limited monarchy but to anarchy and he have discernment enough to dread that he therefore now sincerely desire to save the king 's life and even what remain of he authority especially if he could so order matter that they preservation should be see to be he own work he be conscious also that he could reckon on many ally in any effort which he might make for the prevention of further outrage the more respectable portion of the parisian view the recent outrage with disgust sharpen by personal alarm the dominion of santerre and he gang of destitute desperado be manifestly fraught with destruction to themselves as well as to the king the greater part of the army under he command share these feeling and would gladly have follow he to pari to crush the revolutionary club and to inflict condign punishment on the author and chief agent in the late insurrection if he have but have the skill to avail himself of this favorable state of feeling there can be little doubt that it be in he power at this moment to have establish the king in the full exercise of all the authority vest in he by the constitution or even to have induce the assembly to enlarge that authority he so mismanaged matter that he only increase the king 's danger and bring general contempt and imminent danger on himself likewise he enemy have more than once accuse he of wish to copy cromwell he friend have boast that he would emulate monk but if he be too scrupulous for the audacious wickedness of the one he prove himself equally devoid of the well-calculating shrewdness of the other if subsequently he have any reason to congratulate himself on the result of he conduct it be that like the stork in the fable after be have thrust he head into the mouth of the wolf he be allow to draw it out again in safety loui 's enemy have abundantly show that they do not lack boldness if they be to be defeat it could only be by action as bold as they own unhappily la fayette 's courage have usually find vent rather in bluster word than in stout deed and those be the only weapon he could bring himself to employ now he resolve to remonstrate with the assembly but instead of bring up he army or even a detachment to back he remonstrance he come to pari with a single aid-de-camp and on the 28th of June present himself at the bar of the assembly and demand a audience a fortnight before he have write a letter to the president in which he have denounce alike the jacobin leader of the club and the girondin minister and have call on the assembly to suppress the club a letter which have produce no effect except to unite the two party against whom it be aim more closely together and also to give they a warning of he hostility to they which till he be in a position to show it by deed it would have be wiser to have avoid he now repeat by word of mouth the statement and argument which he have previously advance in write with the addition of a denunciation of the recent insurrection and its author whom he insist the assembly be bind instantly to prosecute he speech be not ill receive for the constitutionalist who know what he design to say have muster in full force and have pack the gallery beforehand with hire clappers and many even of the deputy who do not belong to that party cheer he so obvious to all but the most desperate be the danger to the whole state if santerre and he brigand should be allow to become its master but they care little for a barren indignation which have no more effectual weapon than reproach he have say enough to exasperate but have not do enough to intimidate while those whom he denounce have greater boldness and presence of mind than he and have the force on which they rely for support at hand and available they instantly turn the latter on himself and in they turn denounce he for have leave he army without leave he be frightened or at least perplexed by such a charge he make no reply but seem like one stupefied and it be only through the eloquence of one of he friend m ramond that he be save from the impeachment with which guadet and vergniaud openly threaten he for quit the army without leave ramond 's oratory succeed in carry through the assembly a motion in he favor and several company of the national guard and a vast multitude of the citizen show they sympathy with he view by escort he with acclamation to he hotel but neither they evident inclination to support he nor even the danger with which he himself have be threaten could give he resolution and firmness in action for a moment he make a demonstration as if he be prepare to secure the success of he design by force he propose that the king should the next morning review acloque 's company of the national guard after which he himself would harangue they on they duty to the king and constitution but the girondin persuade pétion to exert he authority as mayor to prohibit the review la fayette be weak enough to submit to the prohibition and quicken it be say by intelligence that pétion be prepare to arrest he the next day retire in haste from pari and rejoin the army he have do the king nothing but harm he have show to all the world that though the royalist and constitutionalist might still be numerically the stronger party for all purpose of action they be by far the weaker he have encourage those whom he have intend to daunt and strengthen those whom he have hope to crush and they in consequence proceed in they treason with greater boldness and openness than ever marie antoinette as we have see have express she belief that they design to assassinate loui and she now employ herself as she have do once before in quilting he a waistcoat of thickness sufficient to resist a dagger or a bullet though so incessant be the watch which be set on all they movement that it be with the greatest difficulty that she could find a opportunity of try it on he but it be not the king but she herself who be the victim whom the traitor propose to take off in such a manner and in the second week of July a man be detect at the foot of the staircase lead to she apartment disguise as a grenadier and sufficiently equip with murderous weapon he be seize by the guard who have previous warning of he design but be instantly rescue by a gang of ruffian like himself who be on the watch to take advantage of the confusion which might be expect to arise from the accomplishment of he crime meanwhile the assembly waver hesitated and do nothing the girondin and jacobin be fertile in devise plot and active in carry they out one day as if seize with a panic at some report of the strength of the austrian and prussian army the assembly again pass a vote declare the country in danger on another rouse by a letter which a madame gouges a daughter of a fashionable dress-maker a lady of more notoriety than reputation but who cultivate a character for philosophy take upon herself to write to they and still more by a curiously sentimental speech of the bishop of lyon with the appropriate name of lamourette -lrb- 5 -rrb- the member bind themselves to have for the future but one heart and one sentiment and for some minute jacobin girondin constitutionalist and royalist be rush to and fro across the floor of the hall in a frenzy of mutual benevolence embrace and kiss one another and swearing a eternal friendship they even send a message to loui to beg he to come and witness this new harmony he come at once with he disposition it be not strange that he yield to the illusion of the strange spectacle which he behold he shed tear of joy declare the complete agreement of he sentiment with theirs and predict that they union would save france they escort he back to the tuilery with cheer and the very same evening after a stormy debate which be a remarkable commentary on the affection which they have just vow to one another they set he at defiance insulting he by annul some decree to which he have give he assent and pass a vote of confidence in pétion as mayor the feast of the federation as it be call pass off quietly the king again recognize the constitution before the altar erect in the champ de mar and as he drive back to the palace the populace accompany he the whole way never cease they acclamation of vivent le rous et la reine -lrb- 6 -rrb- till they have dismount and return to they apartment such a close of the day have be expect by no one la fayette who seem at last to have become really anxious to save the life of the king and queen and to have be seriously convinced that they be in danger have now formally open a communication with the court he concerted he plan with marshal luckner and have learn so much wisdom from he recent failure that he now place no reliance on any thing but a display of superior force he accordingly propose to loui to bring up a battalion of pick man from he and the marshal 's army to escort he to the champ de mar and judge that even if the feast should pass off without any fresh danger the king could never be consider permanently safe while he remain in paris he recommend that on the next day loui still under the protection of the same troops should announce to the assembly he departure for compiègne and should at once quit the capital for that town to which trusty officer would in the mean time have bring up other division of the army in sufficient strength to set all disaffected and seditious spirit at defiance the plan be at all event well conceive but it be decline loui do not apparently distrust the marquis 's good faith but he doubt he ability to carry out a enterprise require a energy and decision of which no part of la fayette 's career have give any indication while the queen distrust he loyalty even more than he capacity one of those with whom she take counsel express he opinion of the marquis 's real object by say that he might save the monarch but not the monarchy and she reply that he head be still full of republican notion which he have bring from america and refuse to place the slightest confidence in he we may suspect that she do not do he entire justice and may rather believe with loui that he be now act in good faith but with a recollection of all that she have suffer at he hand we can not wonder at she continued distrust of he -lrb- a7 -rrb- but he be not the only plan propose for the escape of the royal family bertrand de moleville though no longer loui 's minister retain he undiminished confidence and he have find a place which he regard as admirably suit for a temporary retreat -- the castle of gaillon near the left bank of the seine in normandy the people of which province be almost universally loyal it be within the twenty league from pari which the assembly have fix for the limit of the royal journey while yet in case of the worst it be likewise within easy distance of the coast a able engineer officer have pronounce it to be thoroughly defensible and the count d'hervilly with other officer of proved courage and presence of mind undertake the arrangement of all the military measure necessary for the safe escort of the entire royal family which they themselves be willing to conduct with the aid of some detachment of the swiss guard while the necessary fund be provide by the loyal devotion of the duke de liancourt who place a million of franc at he sovereign 's disposal and of one or two other noble who come forward with almost equally lavish offering loui certainly at first regard the plan with favor and in the opinion of m bertrand it would not have be difficult to induce he to adopt it if the queen could have be bring over to a similar view unhappily several motive combine to disincline she to it the insurrection which the girondin -lrb- 8 -rrb- be prepare have originally be fix for the 29th of July but a few day before m bertrand learn that it have be postpone till the 10th of August this give he time to mature he arrangement all of which as he reckon could be complete in time for the king to leave paris on the evening of the 8th but before that day arrive news have reach the court that the duke of brunswick the prussian commander-in-chief have put he army in motion and that he be not likely to meet any obstacle sufficient to prevent he from march at once on pari a measure which to quote the language of m bertrand the queen be too anxious to see accomplish to hesitate at believe in its execution -lrb- 9 -rrb- and at the same time some of the jacobin leader -- danton pétion and santerre -- have open communication with the government and have undertake for a large bribe to prevent the threaten outbreak the money have be pay to they and marie antoinette more than once boast to she attendant that they be now safe as have gain over danton place the firmer reliance on this mode of extrication because it coincide with she belief that the mutual jealousy of the two party would dispose one of they at least eventually to embrace the cause of the king as they beat ally against the other the result seem to show that the jacobin only take the bribe the more effectually to lull they destine victim into a false security a third consideration and that apparently not the weakest be marie antoinette 's rooted dislike of the constitutionalist party in they rant the duc de liancourt have take he seat in the first assembly though as he assure m bertrand the king himself be aware that he object in so do have be to serve he majesty in the most effectual manner and he be also the statesman whose advice have mainly contribute to induce the king to visit pari after the destruction of the bastile a step which she have always regard as the forerunner and cause of some of the most irremediable encroachment of the revolutionist even the duke 's present devotion to the king 's cause could not entirely efface from she mind the impression that he be not in he heart friendly to the royal authority she urge these argument on the king the last probably weigh with he but little : the two former he feel as strongly as the queen herself and he delay he decision send word to m bertrand that he have resolve to defer he departure till the last extremity -lrb- 10 -rrb- he faithful servant be in amazement when he exclaim be the last extremity to be look for if it have not already come but he astonishment be turn to absolute despair when the next day m montmorin inform he that the project have be entirely give up the queen herself remark that m bertrand overlook the circumstance that he be throw they altogether into the hand of the constitutionalist she have be commonly blame for this decision as that which be the chief cause of all the subsequent calamity which overwhelm she and the whole family yet it be not difficult to understand the motive which influence she and it be impossible to refrain from regard they with sympathy she be now at the decisive moment of a crisis which might well perplex the clearest head there could be no doubt that the come insurrection would be the turning-point of the long conflict which have now last three year and it be a conflict in which she husband 's throne be certainly at stake perhaps even he and she own life they have indeed be so for three year and throughout the whole contest she view have constantly be that honor be still dearer than life and honor she identify with the preservation of she husband 's crown she child 's inheritance mirabeau have say that she would not care to save she life if she could not save the crown also and though she can not have decide without a terrible conflict of feel she decision be now in conformity with mirabeau 's judgment of she in the preceding year the journey to varenne have be treat by the republican as a plea for pronounce the deposition of the king and though they be defeat then they be undoubtedly stronger in the new assembly on the other hand she suspect that they themselves have some misgiving as to the chance of a second attack on the palace be more successful than the former one have prove and that the openness with which the preparation for it be announce be intend to terrify loui and herself into a second flight and she might not unreasonably infer that what they enemy desire be not the wisest course for they to adopt to fly would evidently be to leave the whole field in both the assembly and the city open to they enemy it might save they life but it would almost to a certainty forfeit the crown to stay and face the come danger might indeed lose both but it might also save both and she determine rather to risk all both crown and life in the endeavor to save all rather than to save the one by the deliberate sacrifice of the other it be a gallant and unselfish determination : if in one point of view it be unwise it be at least become she lofty lineage and consistent with she heroic character chapter xxxvii preparation for a new insurrection -- barbaroux bring up a gang from marseille -- the king 's last levee -- the assembly reject a motion for the impeachment of la fayette -- it remove some regiment from paris -- preparation of the court for defense -- the 10th of August -- the city be in insurrection -- murder of mandat -- loui review the guard -- he take refuge with the assembly -- massacre of the swiss guard -- sack of the tuilery

madame de staël have say that there never can be a conspiracy in the proper sense of the word in pari and that if there could be one it would be superfluous since every one at all time follow the majority and no one ever keep a secret but on this occasion the chief mover of sedition studiously discard all appearance of concealment vergniaud guadet and gensonné write the king a letter couch in term of the most insolent defiance and sign with all they name in which they openly announce to he that a insurrection be organize which should be abandon if he replace roland and he colleague in the ministry but which should surely break on the palace and overwhelm it if he refuse and barbaroux who have promise madame roland to bring up from marseille and other town in the south a band of man capable of any atrocity have collect a gang of five hundred miscreant the refuse of the galley and the jail and parade they in triumph through the street which they arrival be destine and intend to deluge with blood and yet loui or to speak more correctly marie antoinette for it be with she that every decision rest prefer to face the impending struggle in paris she still believe that the king have many friend in whose devotion and gallantry he could confide to the very death on Sunday the 5th of August the very last Sunday which he be ever to behold as the acknowledged sovereign of the land he levee be attend by a more than usually numerous and brilliant company though the gayety appropriate to such a scene be on this occasion cloud over by the anxiety for they royal master and mistress which sober every one 's demeanor and spread a gloom over every countenance and three day later both the assembly and the national guard display feeling which to so sanguine a temper as hers seem to show a disposition to make a stout resistance to the further progress of disorder the assembly by a majority of more than two to one reject a motion make by vergniaud for the impeachment of la fayette for he conduct in June and when the mob fall upon those who have vote against it as they come out of the hall the national guard come promptly to they rescue and inflict severe chastisement on the foremost of the rioter the vote of the assembly may be say to have be the last it ever give for any object but the promotion of anarchy it more than neutralize its effect the very next day when it pass a decree for the immediate removal of three regiment of the line which be quarter in paris it even at first include in its resolution the swiss guard also but be subsequently compel to withdraw that clause since a old treaty with switzerland expressly secure to the republic the right of always furnish a regiment for the honorable service of guard the palace and at the same time as if to punish the national guard for its conduct on the previous day another vote break up the staff of that force cashier its finest company the grenadier and the mount trooper on the plea that such distinction be inconsistent with equality and fill up the vacancy with man who be the very dregs of the city many of whom be in fact secret agent of the jacobin by whose aid they hope to spread disaffection through the entire force the afternoon of the 9th be pass in anxious preparation by both the conspirator and those whom they be about to attack the king and queen be not destitute of faithful adherent whom they very danger only render the more zealous to place all they strength they valor and as they truly forebode they life at the disposal of they honor and threaten sovereign the veteran marshal de mailly one of those gallant noble whose devoted loyalty have be so scandalously insult by la fayette -lrb- 1 -rrb- in the spring of the preceding year though now eighty year of age hasten to the defense of he royal master and mistress and bring with he a chivalrous phalanx of above a hundred gentleman all animated with the same self-sacrificing heroism as he own to fight or if need should be to die for they king and queen though they have no arm but they sword it seem fortunate too that the command of the national guard for the day fall by rotation to a officer name mandat a man of high professional skill intrepid courage and unshaken in he zeal for the royal cause though in former day the constitutionalist have reckon he among they adherent he brigade number about two thousand four hundred man on most of whom he could thoroughly rely and it be no slight proof of he force of character and energy as well as of he address that as the national guard could not be employ out of the routine of they regular duty without a special authorisation from the civil power he contrived to extort from pétion as mayor of the city a formal authority to augment he brigade for the special occasion and if force should be use against he to repel it by force the swiss guard of about a thousand man be all trustworthy and there be also a small body of heavy cavalry of the gendarmery who have prove true enough to resist all the seduction of the conspirator there be likewise a few cannon in all nearly four thousand man could be muster for the defense of the palace a force if well equip and well lead not inadequate to the task of hold it out for some time against any number of undisciplined assailant but they be not well arm they be nearly destitute of ammunition and mandat be most vehement entreaty and remonstrance could not wring out from pétion a order for a supply of cartridge though as he tell he several company have not four round leave some have only one and though it be notorious that the police have serve out ammunition to the marseillese who have no claim to a single bullet still less be they well lead for at such a crisis every thing depend on the king 's example and loui be utterly want to himself as night approach the agitation in the palace and still more in the city grow more and more intense it be a brilliant and a warm night by ten o'clock the mob begin to cluster in the street many only curious and anxious from uncertain fear those in the secret hasten toward the point of rendezvous the rioter also have cannon and by eleven they artillery-man have take charge of they gun the conspirator have get possession of all the church and as the hour of midnight strike a single cannon-shot give the signal and from every steeple and tower in the city the fatal tocsin begin to peal the insurrection be begin pétion who from some motive which be not very intelligible wish to save appearance and who though in fact he have be eager in promote the insurrection pretend innocence of all complicity in it even to the assembly whom he be aware that he be not deceive on the first sound of the bell repair to the hôtel de ville he find as indeed he be aware that he should find a strange addition to the municipal council the majority of the section of the city have declare themselves in insurrection have pass resolution that they would no longer obey the exist magistrate and have appoint a body of commissioner to overbear they trust in the cowardice of the majority and in the willing acquiescence and co-operation of danton and the other member of the party of violence the commissioner seize on a room in the hôtel by the side of the regular council-room and they first measure be mark with a cunning and unscrupulousness which largely contribute to the success of they more active comrade in the street even pétion himself be not wicked enough or resolute enough for they the authority which mandat have wring from he on the previous morning be in they eye a proof of unpardonable weakness he might be terrify into issue some other order which might disconcert or at least impede they plan and accordingly they put he under a kind of honorable arrest and send he to he own house under the guard of a armed force which be instruct to allow no one access to he and at the same time they send a order in he name to mandat to repair to the hôtel de ville to concert with they the measure necessary for the safety of the city have he act on he own judgment mandat would have disregard the summons but m roederer urge upon he that he be bind to comply with a order bring in the name of the mayor accordingly he repair to the hôtel de ville and give to the municipal council so distinct a account of he measure and of he reason for take they that though danton and some of he more factious colleague reproach he for exhibit what they call a needless distrust of the people the majority of the council approve of he conduct and dismiss he to return to he duty but as he quit they chamber he be drag before the other body the commissioner of the section -lrb- 2 -rrb- and subject to another examination which as a matter of course they conduct with every kind of insult and violence the municipal council send down a deputation to remonstrate with they they rise on the council and expel they from they own council-chamber by main force and then send off mandat to prison whither a few minute later they dispatch a gang of assassin to murder he the news of he death soon reach the tuilery where it strike a chill even into the firm heart of the queen -lrb- 3 -rrb- who have deservedly place great reliance on he fidelity and resolution she have now to trust to the valor and loyalty of the troops themselves though thus deprive of they commander and as a last hope she persuade the king to go down and review they hope that he presence might animate the faithful and perhaps fix the waverer loui consent as he would have consent to any course that be recommend to he but on such occasion more depend on the grace and spirit with which a thing be do than on the act itself and grace and spirit be now less than ever to be look for in the unhappy loui he visit first the court of the palace and the carrousel and then the garden at whose different entrance strong detachment of troops be station when he first appear he be greet by one general cheer of vive le rous but as he pass along the rank the unanimity and loyalty begin to disappear even of those regiment which be still true to he the cheer be faint as if half suppress by alarm while many company mingle shout for the nation with those for himself and individual soldier murmur audibly down with the veto or long live the sans-culottes secure that they officer would not venture to reprove much less to chastise they the swiss guard alone show enthusiasm in they loyalty and resolution in they demeanor but when he reach the artillery on whom perhaps most depend many of the gunner make no secret of they disaffection some even quit they rank to offer he personal insult double they fist in he face and shout out the coarsest threat which the revolution have yet teach they both cheer and insult the hapless king receive with almost equal apathy the despair which be in he heart be show in he dress which have no military character or decoration but be a suit of plain violet such as be never worn by king of france but on occasion of mourn it be to no purpose that the queen put a sword into he hand and exhort he to take the command of the troops himself and to show himself ready to fight in person for he crown it be only once or twice that he could even be bring to utter a few word of acknowledgment to those who treat he with respect of expostulation to those who insult and threaten he and presently pale and as it seem exhaust with that slight effort he return to he apartment the queen be almost in despair she tell madame de campan that all be lose that the king have show no energy that such a review as that have do harm rather than good all that could now be do be for she to show herself not want to the occasion nor to he she courage rise with the imminence of the danger those who behold she as with dilate eye and heighten color she listen to the unceasing tumult and repress every appearance of alarm strove with unabated energy to rouse she husband and to fortify the good disposition of the loyal friend around she have describe in term of enthusiastic admiration the majestic dignity of she demeanor at this try moment she have need of all she presence of mind for even among those who be most faithful to she dissension be spring up at the first alarm marshal de mailly and he company of gallant noble and gentleman have hasten to she side but the national guard be jealous of they it seem as if they expect to be allow to remain nearest to the royal person and the soldier disdain to yield the post of honor to man who be not in uniform and whom as they be mostly in court dress they even dislike as aristocrat they beseech the queen to dismiss they never she reply and trust rather that the example of they self-sacrificing devotion might stimulate those who thus complain and full of that royal magnanimity which feel that it confer honor on those whom it trust and that it have a right to look for the loyalty of its servant even to the death she add they will serve with you and share you danger they will fight with you in the van in the rear where you will they will show you how man can die for they king but meanwhile the insurgent be rapidly approach the palace and already the tramp of the lead column might be hear the tocsin have continue its ominous sound throughout the night and at six in the morning the main body of the insurgent twenty thousand strong and well arm -- for the new council have open to they the store of the arsenal -- begin they march under the command of santerre as they advance they be join by the marseillese who have be quarter in a barrack near the hall of the cordelier and they number be further swell by thousand of the populace soon after eight they reach the carrousel force the gate and press on to the royal court the national guard and swiss fall back before they to the entrance to the royal apartment where the more confine space seem to afford a better prospect of make a effectual resistance but already the palace be desert by those who be the intended object of the attack roederer and one or two of the municipal magistrate in whom the indignity with which the new commissioner of the section have treat they have excite a feeling of personal indignation have be actively endeavor to rouse the national guard to a energetic resistance but they have wholly fail those who listen to they most favorably would only promise to defend themselves if attack while some of the artillery-men draw the charge from they gun and extinguish they match roederer whom the strange vicissitude of the crisis have for the moment render the king 's chief adviser though there seem no reason to doubt he good faith be not a man of that fiery courage which hope against hope and can stimulate waverer by its example he see that if the rioter should succeed in storm the palace and should find the king and he family there the moment that make they master of they person would be the last of they life and of the monarchy he return into the palace to represent to loui the utter hopelessness of make any defense and to recommend he as he sole resource to claim the protection of the assembly the queen who to use she own word would have prefer be nail to the wall of the palace to seek a refuge which she deem degrading pointed to the soldier and show by she gesture that they be the only protector whom it become they to look to roederer assure she that they could not he rely on she seem unconvinced he almost forget he respect in he earnestness if you refuse madame you will be guilty of the blood of the king of you two child you will destroy yourself and every soul within the palace while she be still hesitate between she feeling of shame and she anxiety for those dearest to she the king give the word let we go say he let we give this last proof of we devotion to the constitution the princess speak could roederer answer for the king 's life he affirm that he would answer for it with he own the queen repeat the question madame he reply we will answer for die at you side -- that be all that we can promise let we go say loui and move toward the door even at the last moment one officer m boscarus commander of a battalion of the national guard know as that of les filles st thomas whose loyalty no disaster have ever be able to shake implored he to change he mind he man unite to the swiss would be able he say to cut a way for the royal family to the rouen road the insurgent be all on the other side of the city and nothing could resist he but again as on all previous occasion loui reject the brave advice he plead the risk to which he should expose those dearest to he and lead they to almost certain death in commit they to the assembly some of de mailly 's gentleman gather round he to accompany he but such a escort seem to roederer likely to provoke additional animosity and at he entreaty loui trust himself to a company of he faithful swiss and to a detachment of the national guard who form themselves into a escort to conduct he to the assembly whose hall look into one side of the palace garden the minister for foreign affair walk at he side the queen lean on the arm of m dubouchage the minister of marine and with the other hand lead the dauphin the princess elizabeth and the princess royal follow with another minister and thus with the princess de lamballe madame de tourzel and one or two other minister and attendant the royal family leave the palace of they ancestor which only one of they be ever to behold again as they quit the saloon move down the stair and cross the garden they every step be one toward a downfall and a destruction which could never be retrace marie antoinette feel it to be so and as she reach the foot of the staircase cast restless and anxious glance around look perhaps even then for any prospect of succor or of effectual resistance which might present itself one of the swiss misunderstand she and with rude fidelity endeavor to encourage she fear nothing madame say he you majesty be surround by honest citizen she lay she hand on she heart i do fear nothing and pass on without another word as they cross the garden the king break the silence how unusually early he remark the leaf fall this year to those who hear he the bareness which he remark seem a omen of the fate which await himself about to be strip of he royal dignity perhaps even like some superfluous crowder of the grove to fall beneath the axe the assembly have already be deliberate whether it should invite he to take refuge with they when they hear that he be approach it be instantly vote that a deputation should be send to meet he which after a few word of respectful salutation fall in behind a vast crowd be collect outside the door of the hall they hoot the king and still more bitterly the queen as they advance down with veto be the chief cry but mingle with it be still more unmanly insult invoke more especially death on all the woman but the guard keep the mob at a distance though when they reach the hall the jacobin make a effort to deprive they of that protection they declare that it be illegal for soldier to enter the hall as indeed it be yet without they the prince must at the last moment have be expose to all the fury of the mob at this critical moment roederer show both fidelity and presence of mind he implore the deputy to suspend the law which forbid the entrance of the troops and while the jacobin be revile he and he proposal he pretend to suppose that it have be agree to and lead forward a detachment of soldier who clear the way one grenadier look up the dauphin in he arm and carry he in and although the pressure of the crowd be extreme at last the whole family be place within the hall in such safety as the assembly be able or disposed to afford they loui bear himself not without dignity he word be few but calm i be come here to prevent a great crime i think i can not be better place nor more safely gentleman than among you the president who happen to be vergniaud while appear to desire to give he confidence yet avoid utter a single word except the simple address of sire which should be a recognition of the royal dignity if indeed he speech be not a study disavowal of it loui might reckon he say on the firmness of the national assembly : its member have swear to die in support of the rights of the people and of the constitute authority : and then on the plea that the assembly must continue its deliberation and that the law forbid they to be conduct in the presence of the sovereign he assign he and he family a little box behind the president 's chair which be usually set apart for the reporter of the debate a jacobin deputy propose they removal into one of the committee-room with the idea as he afterward boast that it would be easy there to admit a band of assassin to murder they all but vergniaud and he party divine he object and overrule he it might seem that the girondin though they have be the original promoter and chief organizer of the insurrection be as yet dispose to be content with the overthrow of the throne and have not arrive at the hardihood which can not be sate without murder and it be a remarkable instance of the rapidity with which unprincipled man sink deeper and deeper into iniquity that they who now exert themselves successfully to save the life of loui five month afterward be as unanimous as the most ferocious jacobin in destroy he one object of loui in abandon he palace have be to save the life of the national guard and of the swiss by withdraw they from what he regard as a unequal combat with the infuriate multitude and of the national guard the greater part do escape draw off silently in small detachment when the sovereign whom it have be they duty to defend seem no longer to require they service but the swiss remain bravely at they post around the royal staircase though as they abstain from provoke the rioter by any active opposition which now seem to have no object they hope that they might escape attack but the mob and santerre be bent on they destruction some of the insurgent try to provoke they by threat some endeavor to tamper with they to desert they allegiance but a accidental interruption suddenly terminate they brief period of inaction in the confusion a pistol go off and the swiss fancy it be mean as a signal for a assault upon they think that the time be come to defend they own life they level they musket and fire : they charge down the step drive the insurgent before they like sheep they clear the inner or royal court force they way into the carrousel recover the cannon which be post in the large square and be so completely victorious that have there be any superior officer at hand to direct they movement they might even now have check the insurrection there might even have be some hope have not loui himself actually interfere to check they exertion hear what they have accomplish the gallant d'hervilly make he way to they and call on they to follow he to the rescue of the king they hesitate unwilling to leave they wounded comrade to the mercy of they enemy but they hesitation be brief for it be put a end to by the wound man themselves who bid they hasten forward they duty they tell they be to save the king for themselves they could but die where they lay -lrb- 4 -rrb- there be still plenty of gallant spirit to do they duty to the king if he could but have be persuade to take a right view of he duty to himself and to they the swiss gladly obey d'hervilly 's summons form in close order and as steady as on parade they march through the garden one battalion move toward the end opposite to the palace where there be a draw-bridge which it be essential to secure the other follow d'hervilly to the assembly hall nothing could resist they advance : they force they way up the stair and in a few moment a young officer m de sali at the head of a small detachment sword in hand enter the chamber some of the deputy shriek and flee while other more calm remind he that armed man be forbid to enter the hall and order he to retire he refuse and send he subaltern to the king for order but loui still hold to he strange policy of non-resistance even the terrible scene of the morning and the deliberate attack of a armed mob upon he palace have fail to eradicate he unwillingness to authorize he own guard to fight in he behalf or to convince he that when he throne -lrb- perhaps even he life and the life of all he family -rrb- be at stake it be nobler to struggle for victory and if defeat to die with arm in he hand than tamely to sit still and be strip of he kingly dignity by brigand and traitor could he but have summon energy to put himself at the head of he faithful guard as we may be sure that he brave wife urge he to do could he have even send they one encouraging order one cheer word there still might have be hope for they have already prove that no number of santerre 's ruffian could stand before they -lrb- 5 -rrb- but loui could not even now bring himself to act he could only suffer he command to the officer the last he ever issue be for the whole battalion to lay down they arm to evacuate the palace and to retire to they barracks he would not he say that such brave man should die they know that in fact he be consign they to death without honor but they be loyal to the last they obey though they obedience to the first part of the order render the last part impracticable they lay down they arm and be at once make prisoner and the fate of prisoner in such hand as those of they captor be certain a small handful consist it be say of fourteen man escape through the courage of one or two friend who presently bring they plain clothes to exchange for they uniform but before night all the rest be massacre not more fortunate be they comrade of the other battalion except in fall by a more soldier-like death though no longer support by the detachment under d'hervilly they succeed in force they way to the draw-bridge it be hold by a strong detachment of the national guard who ought to have receive they as comrade but who have now catch the contagion of successful treason and fire on they as they advance but the gallant swiss in spite of they diminish number still invincible charge through they force they way across the bridge into the place loui xv and there form themselves into square resolve to sell they life dearly it be all that be leave to they to do the mount gendarmery too come up and turn against they hem in on all side they fall one after another loui who have refuse to let they die for he have only give they death the additional pang that it have be of no service to he the retreat of the king have leave the tuilery at the mercy of the rioter furious to find that he have escape they they wreak they rage on the lifeless furniture break hewing and destroy in every way that wantonness or malice could devise different article which have belong to the queen be the especial object of they wrath crowd of the vilest woman array themselves in she dress or defile she bed she looking-glass be break with imprecation because they have reflect she feature she footman be pursue and slaughter because they have be wont to obey she nor be the monster who slew they contented with murder they tear the dead body into piece devour the still bleed fragment or deliberately light fire and cook they or hoist the sever limb on pike carry they in fiendish triumph through the street and while these horror be go on in the palace the tumult in the assembly be scarcely less furious the majority of the member -- all indeed except the girondin and jacobin who be secure in they alliance with the ringleader -- be panic-stricken many flee but the rest sit still and in terrify helplessness vote whatever resolution the fiercest of the king 's enemy choose to propose it be a ominous preliminary to they deliberation that they admit a deputation from the commissioner of the section into the hall where guadet to whom vergniaud have surrender the president 's chair thank they for they zeal and assure they that the assembly regard they as virtuous citizen only anxious for the restoration of peace and order they be even formally recognize as the municipal council and then on the motion of vergniaud the assembly pass a series of resolution order the suspension of loui from all authority he confinement in the luxembourg palace the dismissal and impeachment of he minister the re-appointment of roland and those of he colleague whom he have dismiss and the immediate election of a national convention a large pecuniary reward be even vote for the marseillese and for similar gang from one or two other department which have be bring up to pari to take a part in the insurrection yet so deeply seat be hope and confidence in the queen 's heart so sanguine be she trust that out of the mutual enmity of the populace and the assembly safety would still be work for the king and the monarchy that even while the din of battle be rage outside the hall and inside deputy after deputy be rise to heap insult on the king and on herself or to second vergniaud 's resolution for he formal degradation she could still believe that the tide be about to turn in she favor while the uproar be at its height she turn to d'hervilly who still keep he post faithful and fearless at he master 's side well m d'hervilly say she with a air as m bertrand who tell the story describe it of the most perfect security do we not do well not to leave paris i pray god say the brave noble that you majesty may be able to ask I the same question in six month ' time -lrb- 6 -rrb- he foreboding be truer than she hope in less than six month she be a desolate imprison widow helplessly await she own fate from she husband 's murderer all these resolution of vergniaud all the ribald abuse with which different member support they the unhappy sovereign be condemn to hear in the narrow box to which they have be remove they bear the insult the queen with she habitual dignity the king with he inveterate apathy loui even speak occasionally with apparent cheerfulness to some of the deputy the constant interruption protracted the discussion through the entire day it be half-past three in the morning before the assembly adjourn when the king and he family be remove to the adjacent convent of the feuillant where four wretched cell have be hastily furnish with camp-bed and a few other necessaries of the coarsest description so little be any attempt make to disguise the fact that they be prisoner that they own domestic servant be not allow the next day to attend they till they have receive a formal ticket of admittance from the president yet even in this extremity of distress marie antoinette thought of other rather than of herself and when at last she faithful attendant madame de campan obtain access to she she first word express how greatly she own sorrow be aggravate by the thought that she have involve in they those loyal friend whose attachment merit a very different recompense -lrb- 7 -rrb- chapter xxxviii indignity to which the royal family be subject -- they be remove to the temple -- division in the assembly -- flight of la fayette -- advance of the prussian -- lady sutherland supply the dauphin with clothes -- mode of life in the temple -- the massacre of September -- the death of the princess de lamballe -- insult be heap on the king and queen -- the trial of the king -- he last interview with he family -- he death from the 11th of August the life of marie antoinette be almost a blank to we we may be even thankful that it be so and that we be spare the detail in all they accumulate misery of a series of event which be a disgrace to human nature for month after month the gentle benevolent king whom no sovereign ever exceed in love for he people or in the exercise of every private virtue the equally pure-minded charitable and patriotic queen who to the somewhat passive excellence of she husband add fascinating grace and lofty energy of which he be unhappily destitute be subject to the most disgusting indignity to the tyranny of the vilest monster who ever usurp authority over a nation and to the daily insult of the meanest of they former subject who think to make a merit with they new master of they brutality to those whose birthright have be the submission and reverence of all around they vergniaud 's motion have only extend to the suspension of the king from he function till the meeting of the convention but no one could doubt that that suspension would never be take off and that loui be in fact dethrone marie antoinette never deceive herself on the point and retain the opinion as to the fate of depose monarch which she have express three year before pronounced that all be over with they my poor child say she apostrophize the little dauphin and he sister it be cruel to give up the hope of transmit to you so noble a inheritance and to have to say that all be at a end with ourselves and lest any one else should have any doubt on the subject the assembly no longer head its decree with any royal title but publish they in the name of the nation in one point the resolution of the 10th be slightly depart from the municipal authority report that the luxembourg have so many outlet and subterranean passage that it would be difficult to prevent the escape of a prisoner from that palace and accordingly the destination of the royal family be change to the temple thither after have be compel to spend two more day in the assembly listen to the denunciation and threat of they enemy whom even the knowledge that they be wholly in they power fail to pacify they be convey on the 13th and they never quit it till they be drag forth to die the temple have be as its name import the fortress and palace of the knight templar and have be erect by they in the palmy day of they wealth and magnificence contain spacious apartment and extensive garden protect from intrusion by a lofty wall which surround the whole it be not unfit for nor unaccustomed to the reception of prince for the count d'artoi have fit up a portion of it for himself whenever he visit the capital and to he apartment those who have the custody of the king and queen at first conduct they but the new municipal council whom the recent event have make the real master of pari consider those room too comfortable or too honorable a lodging for any prisoner however royal and the same night before they could retire to rest and while loui be still occupy himself in distribute the different apartment among the member of he family and the few attendant who be allow to share he captivity a order be send down to remove they all into a small dilapidated tower which have be use as a lodging for some of the count 's footman but whose bad wall and broken window render it unfit for even the servant of a prince besides they meanness and ruinous condition the number of the room it contain be so scanty that for the first few day the only room that could be find for the princess elizabeth be a old disused kitchen and even after that be remedy she be force to share she new chamber though it be both small and dark with she niece madame royale while the dauphin 's bed be place by the side of the queen 's in one which be but little large -lrb- 1 -rrb- and the dungeon-like appearance of the entire place impress the whole family with the idea that it be not intend that they should remain there long but that a early death be prepare for they even this distress be speedily aggravate by a fresh severity four day afterward a order be send down which command the removal of all they attendant with the exception of one or two menial servant madame de tourzel the governess of the royal child be drive away with the coarsest insult the princess de lamballe that most faithful and affectionate friend of the queen be rudely tear from she embrace by the municipal officer and though no offense be even imputed to she be drag off to a prison where she be soon to pay the forfeit of she loyalty with she blood from this time forth the king and queen be completely cut off from the outer world they be treat with a rigor which in happier country be not even experience by convict criminal they be forbid to receive letter or newspaper and presently they be deprive of pen ink and paper though they would neither have desire to write nor receive letter which would have be read by they jailer and could only have expose they correspondent to danger after a few day they be even deprive of the attendance of all they servant but two -lrb- 2 -rrb- -- a faithful valet name cléry -lrb- fidelity such as he may well immortalize he name -rrb- to whom we be indebted for the greater part of the scanty knowledge which we possess of the fate of the captive prince as long as loui himself be permit to live and turgy a cook who by a act of faithful boldness have obtain a surreptitious entrance into the temple and whose service seem to have escape notice though at a later period they prove of no trivial importance have they but know what be pass in the assembly marie antoinette would in all probability have still find matter for some comfort and hope in the fierce mutual strife of the jacobin and girondin which for some week keep the assembly in a constant state of agitation and she would have find even greater encouragement in the dissatisfaction which in many department the people express at the late event and in the conduct of la fayette 's army which at first cordially approve of and support the town-council and magistrate of sedan who arrest and throw into prison the commissioner whom the assembly have send to announce the suspension of the royal authority but the intelligence of that demonstration in they favor never reach they nor that of its suppression a few day later when la fayette who as on a former occasion have commit himself to measure beyond he strength to carry out be force to fly from the country and by a strange violation of military law be throw into a austrian prison nor again when for a moment the duke of brunswick appear likely to realize the hope on which marie antoinette have build so confidently and by the capture of longwy seem to have open to himself the road to pari do any tiding of he achievement come to the ear of those who have feel such deep interest in he operation after a time the ingenuity of cléry find a mode of obtain for they some little knowledge of what be pass outside by contrive that some of he friend should send crier to cry a abstract of the news contain in the daily journal under he window which he in he turn faithfully report to they while employ in such menial office about they person as take off the attention of they guard who day and night maintain a unceasing espial on all they action and even word from the very first they have to endure strange privation for prince they have not a sufficient supply of clothes the little dauphin in particular would have be wholly unprovided have not the english embassadress lady sutherland whose son be of a similar age and size send in a stock of such as she think might be want but as the garment thus receive wear out and as all means of replace they be refuse the queen and princess be reduce to ply they own needle diligently to mend the clothes of the whole family that they might not appear to they jailer or to the occupant of the surround house who from they window could command a view of the garden in which they take they daily walk absolutely ragged such enforced occupation must indeed in some degree have be welcome as a relief from thought which they unbroken solitude leave they but too much leisure to indulge cléry have give we a account of the manner in which they day be parcel out -lrb- 3 -rrb- the king rise at six and cléry after dress he hair descend to the queen 's chamber which be on the story below to perform the same service for she and for the rest of the family and the hour so spend bring with it some slight comfort as he could avail himself of that opportunity to mention any thing that he might have learn of what be pass out-of-door or to receive any instruction which they might desire to give he at nine they breakfast in the king 's room at ten they come down-stair again to the queen 's apartment where loui occupy himself in give the dauphin lesson in geography while marie antoinette busy herself in a corresponding manner with madame royale but in whatever room they be they guard be always present and when at one o'clock they go down-stair to walk in the garden they be still accompany by soldier : the only member of the family who be not expose to they ceaseless vigilance be the little dauphin who be allow to run up and down and play at ball with cléry without a soldier think it necessary to watch all he movement or listen to all he childish exclamation at two dinner be serve and regularly at that hour the odious santerre with two other ruffian of the same stamp whom he call he aids-de-camp visit they to make sure of they presence and to inspect they room and cléry remark that the queen never break she disdainful silence to he though loui often speak to he generally to receive some answer of brutal insult after dinner loui and marie antoinette would play piquet or backgammon as while they be thus engage the vigilance of they keeper relax and the noise of shuffling the card or rattle the dice afford they opportunity of say a few word in whisper to one another which at other time would have be overhear in the evening the queen and the princess elizabeth read aloud the book choose be chiefly work of history or the masterpiece of corneille and racine as be most suitable to form the mind and taste of the child and sometimes loui himself would seek to divert they from they sorrow by ask the child riddle and find some amusement in they attempt to solve they at bed-time the queen herself make the dauphin say he prayer teach he especially the duty of pray for other for the princess de lamballe and for madame de tourzel he governess though even those petition the poor boy be compel to utter in whisper lest if they be repeat to the municipal council he should bring ruin on those whom he regard as friend at ten the family separate for the night a sentinel make he bed across the door of each of they chamber to prevent the possibility of any escape in this way they pass a fortnight when the monotony of they life be fearfully disturb the jacobin have establish they ascendency they have create a revolutionary tribunal which at once begin its course of wholesale condemnation send almost every one who be bring before it to the scaffold with merely a form of trial the guillotine be erect as it be say _ en permanence _ that the death of the victim might never be delay for want of means to execute they while that a succession of victim might never be want danton in he new character of minister of justice institute a search of every house for arm or papers or any thing which might afford evidence or even suggest a suspicion that the owner dislike or fear the new authority but it be not enough to strike terror into all the peaceful citizen the girondin have always be object of jealous rivalry to the jacobin fanatical and relentless as they be in they cruelty they have recently give proof that they disapprove of the furious blood-thirstiness that be begin to decimate the city and they have carry the assembly with they in a vote for the dissolution of the new municipal council at the same time intelligence of the prussian success ready the capital intelligence which it seem possible might animate the royalist to some fresh effort and lest they should find means of reconcile themselves to vergniaud and he party the jacobin and cordelier resolve to give both a lesson by a deed of blood which should strike terror into they we may spare ourselves the pain of relate the horror of the September massacre when for more than four day gang of man worse than devil and of woman unsexed by profligacy and cruelty till they have become worse even than the man give themselves up to the work of indiscriminate slaughter deluge the street with blood and where they could spare time aggravate the pang of death by superfluous torture it will be sufficient for we purpose to record the fate of one of the most innocent of all the victim who owe she death to the fact that she have long be the queen 's most choose friend and whose murder be gloat over with special ferocity by the monster who perpetrate it as enable they to inflict a additional pang on she wretched friend and mistress madame de lamballe as we have see have accompany the queen to the temple on the first day of she captivity and have subsequently be remove to one of the city prison know as la force it be on the prisoner in the different place of confinement that the work of death be to be do : and she have be specially mark out for slaughter not solely because she be beloved by marie antoinette but also it be understand because as she be very rich and sister-in-law to the duc d'orléans that detestable prince desire to add she inheritance to he owd already vast riches she be drag before hébert one of the foulest of the jacobin crew who have take he seat at the gate of the prison to preside over the trial as they be call of the prisoner in la force swear say he devotion to liberty and to the nation and hatred to the king and queen and you shall live i will take the first oath she reply but the second never it be not in my heart the king and queen i have ever love and honor almost before she have finish speak she be push into the gate-way one ruffian strike she from behind with he sabre she fall they tear she into piece a letter of the queen 's fall from she hair in which she have hide it the sight of it redouble the assassin ' fury they stick she head on a pike and carry it in triumph to the palais royal to display it to d'orléans who be feast with some of the companion of he daily orgy and then proceed to the temple to brandish it before the eye of the queen it be about three o'clock -lrb- 4 -rrb- dinner have just be remove and the king and queen be sit down to play backgammon when horrid shout be hear in the street one of the soldier on guard in the room who have not yet lay aside every feeling of humanity close the window and even draw the curtain another of different temper insist that loui should come to the window and show himself as the uproar increase the queen rise from she seat and the king ask what be the matter well say the man since you wish to know they want to show you the head of madame de lamballe no event that have yet occur have strike the queen with such anguish the uproar increase those who bear the head have wish even to force the door and bring they trophy still bleed into the very room where the royal family be and be only prevent by a compromise which permit they to parade it round they tower in triumph as the shout die away pétion 's secretary arrive with a small sum of money which have be issue for the king 's use he notice that the queen stand all the time that he be in the room and fancy she assume that attitude out of respect to the mayor she have never stir since she have hear of the princess 's death but have stand root as it be to the ground stupefy and speechless with horror and anguish it be long before she could be restore and all through the night the rest of the princess if at least they could have sleep be break by she sob which never cease as time pass on the prospects of the unhappy prisoner become still more gloomy on the 21st of September the convention meet and its first act be to abolish royalty and declare the government a republic and a officer be instantly send to make proclamation of the event under the temple wall and as if the establishment of a republic authorize a increase of insolence on the part of the guard of the prisoner the insult to which they be subject grow more frequent and more gross sentence both menacing and indecent be write on the wall where they must catch they eye : the soldier puff they tobacco-smoke in the queen 's face as she pass or place they seat in the passage so much in she way that she could hardly avoid stumble over they leg as she go down to the garden sometimes they even assail she with direct abuse call she the assassin of the people who in they turn would assassinate she more than once the whole family have to submit to a personal search and to empty they pocket when the officer who make the search carry off whatever they choose to term suspicious especially they knife and scissors so that when at work the queen and princess be force to bite off the thread with they tooth and amidst all this misery no one ever hear marie antoinette utter a word to lament she own fate or to ask pity for herself she mourn over she husband 's fall she pity elizabeth to whom malice itself could not impute a share in the wrong of which danton and vergniaud have teach the people to complain most of all do she bewail the ruin prospects of she son and more than once she bring tear into cléry 's eye by the earnest tenderness with which she implore he to provide for the safety of the noble child after he parent should have be destroy the insult increase each be a additional omen of the future the most painful injury be reserve for the queen toward the end of October the dauphin be remove from she apartment to that of the king that she might thus be deprive of the comfort of minister to he daily want but loui himself be not spare one day a order come down to deprive he of he sword on another he be strip of he different decoration and order of knighthood the system of espial too be carry out with increase severity they linen when it come hack from the washer-woman and even they washing-bill be hold to the fire to see if any invisible ink have be employ to communicate with they they loaf and biscuit be cut asunder lest they should contain note the end be approach a week or two later the king be remove to another tower and be only permit to see he family during a certain portion of the day at last it be determine to bring he to trial on the 11th of December he be suddenly inform that he be to be bring before the convention and from that day forth he be cut off from all intercourse with he family even he wife be forbid to see or hear from he the barbarous restriction afford he one more opportunity of show he amiable unselfishness and fortitude the regulation have be make by the municipal council not by the assembly and its inhuman and unprecedented severity couple with a jealousy of the council as seek to usurp the whole authority of the state induce the assembly to rescind it and to grant permission for loui to have the dauphin and he sister with he yet lest these innocent child should prove messenger of conspiracy between he and the queen and elizabeth it be order at the same time that so long as they be allow to visit he they should be separate from they mother and they aunt and loui though never in greater need of comfort think it so much better for the child themselves that they should be with the queen that for they sake he renounce they society and allow the decree of the council to be carry out in all its pitiless cruelty and again we may spare ourselves from dwelling on the detail of what in hideous mockery be call the king 's trial though it be in fact a mere ceremonious prelude to he murder which have be determine on before it begin deep as be the disgrace with which it have forever cover the nation which tolerate such a abomination it be relieve by some incident which do honor to the country and to human nature the murderer of loui in they ignoble pedantry weary the ear with appeal to the example of the ancient roman of decius -lrb- 5 -rrb- and of brutus but no roman ever give a nobler proof of contempt of danger and devotion to duty than be afford by the intrepid lawyer malesherbe de séze and tronchet who voluntarily undertake the king 's defense though loui himself warn they that they utmost effort would be fruitless and would only bring destruction on themselves without save he one member too of the convention lanjuinai though originally he have be a member of the breton club and have latterly be generally regard as connect with the girondin make more than one eloquent effort in the king 's behalf provoke the jacobin and girondin to they very wildest fury by he contemptuous defiance of they menace and even when the verdict be be give when jacobin girondin and cordelier robespierre vergniaud danton and the infamous duc d'orléans be vie with one another in the eagerness with which they push forward to record they vote of condemnation and when a mob of hire ruffian who throng the hall be cheer every vote for death and hold dagger to the throat of every one from whom they apprehend a contrary judgment one noble of frail body but of a spirit worthy of he birth and rank the marquis de villette laugh in the face of he threatener look the assassin in the face and tell they that he would not obey they order and that they dare not kill he and with a loud voice pronounce a vote of acquittal but no courage or devotion of a few honest man could save loui one vote by a immense majority pronounce he guilty a second refuse all appeal to the people a third by a majority of fifty voice condemn he to death and on the morning of the 20th of January 1793 loui be rouse from he bed to hear he sentence and to learn that it be to be carry out the next day while the trial last the queen and those with she have be keep in almost absolute ignorance of what be take place they never however doubt what the result would be -lrb- 6 -rrb- so that it be scarcely a shock to they when they hear the news-men cry the sentence under they window -- the only mercy that be show to either the prisoner who be to die or to those who be to survive he be that they be allow once more to meet on earth at eight in the evening the queen he child and he sister be to be allow to visit he he prepare for the interview with astonishing calmness make the arrangement so deliberately that when he notice that cléry have place a bottle of iced water on the table he bid he change it lest if the queen should require any the chill should prove injurious to she health even that last interview be not allow to pass wholly without witness since the municipal council refuse even on such a occasion to relax they regulation that they guard be never to lose sight-of the king and all that be permit be that he might retire with he family into a inner room which have a glass door so that though what pass must be see they last word might not be overhear he daughter madame royale now a girl of fourteen and old enough as she mother have say a few month before to realize the misery of the scene which she daily see around she have leave we a account of the interview necessarily a brief one for the queen and princess be too wretched to say much loui weep when he announce to they how short be the time which he have to live but he tear be those of pity for the desolation of those he love and not of fear for himself he be even in some sense a willing victim for as he tell they it have be propose to save he by appeal to the primary assembly of the nation but he have refuse he consent to a step which must throw the whole country into confusion and might be the cause of civil war he would rather die than risk the bringing of such calamity on he people he even seek to comfort the queen by make some excuse for the monster who have condemn he and he last word to he family be a entreaty to forgive they to he son a injunction never to seek to revenge he death even if some change of fortune should enable he to do so the queen say nothing but sit cling to he in speechless agony at last he beg they to retire that he might seek rest to prepare himself for the morrow and then she speak to beg that at least they might meet again the next morning yes say he at eight o'clock why not at seven ask she well then at seven but after she have leave he he determine to avoid this second meeting not so much because he fear its unnerving himself but because he feel that the second parting must be too terrible for she when she return to she own chamber she have scarcely strength leave to place the dauphin in he bed she throw herself dress as she be on she own bed where she sister-in-law and daughter hear she as the little princess describe she state shiver with cold and grief the whole night long -lrb- 7 -rrb- even if she could have sleep she rest would soon have be disturb by the movement of troops the beating of the drum and the heavy roll of the cannon pass through the street for the miscreant who bear sway in the city know well that the crime which they be about to commit be view with horror by the great majority of the nation and even of the parisian and to the last moment be afraid of a rescue but no one could interpose between loui and he doom and the next intelligence of he that reach he wife who be wait the whole morning in painful anxiety for the summons to see he once more be that he have perish beneath the fatal guillotine and that she be a widow chapter xxxix the queen be refuse leave to see cléry -- madame royale be take ill -- plan be form for the queen 's escape by mm jarjaye toulan and by the baron de batz -- marie antoinette refuse to leave she son -- illness of the young king -- overthrow of the girondin -- insanity of the woman tison -- kindness of the queen to she -- she son be take from she and intrust to simon -- he ill-treatment -- the queen be remove to the conciergerie -- she be try before the revolutionary tribunal -- she be condemn -- she last letter to the princess elizabeth -- she death and character shout in the street announce to she and those around she that all be over all the morning she have alarm the princess by the speechless tearless stupor into which she seem plunge but at last she rouse herself and beg to see cléry who have be with loui till he leave the temple and who therefore she hope might have some last message for she some last word of affection some parting gift and so indeed he have -lrb- 1 -rrb- for the last act of loui have be to give that faithful servant he seal for the dauphin and he ring for the queen with a little packet contain portion of she hair and those of he child which he have be in the habit of wear and he have bid he tell they all -- the queen he dear child and he sister -- that he have promise to see they that morning but that he have desire to save they the pain of so cruel a separation how much he continue do it cost I to go without receive they last embrace you must bear to they my last farewell but even the poor consolation of receive these sad token of unchanged affection be refuse to she the council refuse cléry admittance to she and seize the little trinket and the packet of hair the king 's last word never reach she but a few day afterward toulan one of the commissioner of the council who sympathize with she bereavement find means to send she the ring and seal -lrb- 2 -rrb- she sister and she daughter be the more anxious that she should see cléry from the hope that conversation with he might bring on a flood of tear which would have give she some relief but she own fortitude be she best support miserable as she be hopeless as she be it be characteristic of she magnanimous courage that she do not long give way to womanly lamentation she recollect that she have still duty to perform to the live to she daughter and sister and above all to she son now she king whom if some happier change of fortune when the nation should have recover from its present madness should replace he on he father 's throne it must be she care to render worthy of such a restoration she begin to apply herself diligently to the work of give he lesson such as he father have give he mingle they with the constant reference to that father 's example which she never cease to hold up to he dwelling with the emphatic exaggeration of lasting affection on he gentleness he benevolence he love for he subject quality which in truth he have possess in sufficient abundance have he but be gifted with the courage and firmness indispensable to secure to he people the benefit he wish they to enjoy she have too for a time another occupation the princess royal be as she have say not long before of a age to feel keenly the misery of she parent and the agitation into which she have be throw have its natural effect upon she health she own language on the subject afford a striking proof how well marie antoinette have succeed in imbue she with she own forgetfulness of self as she have record the occurrence in she journal fortunately she affliction increase she illness to so serious a degree as to cause a favorable diversion to she mother 's despair -lrb- 3 -rrb- youth however and a strong constitution prevail and the little princess recover while other matter also for a time claim a large share of she mother 's attention for herself marie antoinette feel as she well might feel that come what would happiness and she be forever part and the death to which she never doubt that she enemy destine she could hardly have be anticipate by she as any thing but a relief if she have think only of she own feeling but again she have other to think of besides herself -- of she child and she presently learn that other be think of she and be willing -lrb- it should rather be say be eager and proud -rrb- to encounter any danger if they might only have the happiness and honor of secure and save she whom they still regard as they queen two have long be attach to the royal household : the wife of m de jarjaye a gentleman of ancient family in dauphiné have be one of marie antoinette 's waiting-woman and he himself since the fatal expedition to varenne have be employ by loui on several secret mission from the moment that he royal master be bring before the convention he have despair of he life and have therefore bent all he thought on the preservation of the queen m turgy the second be in a humbler rank of life he be as we have see one of the officer of the kitchen but in the household of a king of france even the cook have pretension to gentle blood a third be a man name toulan who have originally be a music-seller in pari but have subsequently obtain employment under the municipal council and be now a commissioner with duty which bring he into constant contact with the imprison queen either he have never in he heart be she enemy or he have be convert by the dignified fortitude with which she bear she misery and by the irresistible fascination which even in prison she still exercise over all whose heart have not be harden by fanatical wickedness against every manly or honest feeling he win the queen 's confidence by the most welcome service which have be already mention of convey to she she husband 's seal and ring she give he a letter to recommend he to the confidence of jarjaye and they combined ingenuity devise a plan for the escape of the whole family it be in they favor that a man who come daily to look to the lamp usually bring with he he two son who nearly match the size of the royal child and jarjaye and toulan aid by another of the municipal commissioner name lepitre who have also learn to abhor the indignity practice on fall royalty have prepare full suit of male attire for the queen and princess with red scarf and sash as be worn by the different commissioner of whom there be too many for all of they to be know to the sentinel and also clothes for the two child ill-fitting and shabby to resemble the dress of the lamp-lighter 's boy passport too by the aid of lepitre whose duty lay in the department which issue they be provide for the whole family and after careful discussion of the arrangement to be adopt when once the prisoner be clear of the temple it be settle that they should take the road to normandy in three cabriolet which would be less likely to attract notice than any larger and less ordinary carriage the end of February or the beginning of march be fix for the attempt but before that time the government and the people have become greatly disquiet by the operation of the german army which be about to receive the powerful assistance of england prussium have gain decide advantage on the rhine a austrian army under the archduke charle be make formidable progress in the netherland rumor also which soon prove to be well found of a approach insurrection in the western department of france reach the capital the vigilance with which the royal prisoner be watch be increase information too though of no precise character that they have obtain means of communicate with they partisan who be at liberty be convey to the magistrate and at last jarjaye and toulan be force to abandon the idea of effect the escape of the whole family though they be still confident that they could accomplish that of the queen which they regard as the most important since it be plain that it be she who be in the most immediate danger elizabeth as disinterested as herself beseech she to embrace they offer and to let she and the child as be less obnoxious to the jacobin take they chance of some subsequent means of escape or perhaps even mercy but such a flight be forbid alike by marie antoinette 's sense of duty and by she sense of honor if indeed the two be ever separate in she mind honor forbid she to desert she companion in misery whose danger might even be increase by the rage of she jailer exasperate at she escape duty to she boy forbid it still more emphatically as he guardian she ought not to leave he as he mother she could not and she renunciation of the whole design be convey to m jarjaye in a letter which do honor alike to both by the noble gratitude which it express and which be long cherish by he heir as one of they most precious possession till it be destroy with many another valuable record when pari a second time fall under the rule of wretch scarcely less detestable than the jacobin whom they imitate -lrb- 4 -rrb- it be write by stealth with a pencil but no difficulty or hurry as no acuteness of disappointment or depth of distress could rob marie antoinette of she desire to confer pleasure on other or of she inimitable gracefulness of expression thus she write : we have have a pleasant dream that be all i have gain much by still find on this occasion a new proof of you entire devotion to I my confidence in you be boundless and on all occasion you will always find strength of mind and courage in I but the interest of my son be my sole guide and whatever happiness i might find in be out of this place i can not consent to separate myself from he in what remain i thoroughly recognize you attachment to I in all that you say to I yesterday rely upon it that i feel the kindness and the force of you argument as far as my own interest be concerned and that i feel that the opportunity can not recur but i could enjoy nothing if i be to leave my child and this idea prevent I from even regret my decision -lrb- 5 -rrb- and to toulan she say that she sole desire be to be reunite to she husband whenever heaven should decide that she life be no longer necessary to she child he be greatly afflict but he could no longer be of use to she she last commission to he be to convey to she eldest brother-in-law the count de provence she husband 's ring and seal that they might be in safer custody than she own and that she or she son might reclaim they if either should ever be at liberty she give toulan also as a memorial of she gratitude a small gold box one of the few trinket which she still possess and which unhappily prove a fatal present in the summer of the next year it be find in he possession its history be ascertain and he be send to the scaffold for the sole offense of have and value a relic of he murder sovereign nor be this the only plan form for the queen be rescue the baron de batz be a noble of the purest blood in france seneschal of the duchy of albret and bind by ancient tie of hereditary friendship to the king as the heir of henry iv whose most intimate confidence have be enjoy by he ancestor he be still animated by all the antique feeling of chivalrous loyalty and from the first breaking-out of the trouble of the revolution he have bring to the service of he sovereign the most absolute devotion which be render doubly useful by a inexhaustible fertility of resource and a presence of mind that nothing could daunt or perplex on the fatal 21st of January he have even form a project of rescue loui on he way to the scaffold which fail partly from the timidity of some on whose co-operation he have reckon and partly it be say from the reluctance of loui himself to countenance a enterprise which whatever might be its result must tend to fierce conflict and bloodshed since he sovereign 's death he have bent all the energy of he mind to contrive the escape of the queen and he have so far succeed that he have enlist in she cause two man whose post enable they to give must effectual resistance : michoni who like toulan be one of the commissioner of the council and cortey a captain of the national guard whose company be one of those most frequently on duty at the temple it seem as if all that be necessary to be do be to select a night for the escape when the chief outlet of the temple should be guard by cortey 's man and de batz who be at home in every thing that require maneuver or contrivance have provide dress to disguise the person of the whole family while in the temple and passport and conveyance to secure they escape the moment they be outside the gate every thing seem to promise success when at the last moment secret intelligence that some plan or other be in agitation be convey to the council it be not sufficient to enable they to know whom they be to guard against or to arrest but it be enough to lead they to send down to the temple another commissioner whose turn of duty do not require he presence there but whose ferocious surliness of temper point he out as one not easily to be either trick or overborne he be a cobbler name simon the very same to whose cruel superintendence the little king be presently intrust he come down the very evening that every thing be arrange for the escape of the hapless family de batz see that all be over if he staid and hesitate for a moment whether he should blow out he brain and try to accomplish the queen 's deliverance by force but a little reflection show he that the noise of fire-arm would bring up a crowd of enemy beyond he ability to overpower and it soon appear that it would tax all he resource to secure he own escape he achieve that hope still to find some other opportunity of be useful to he royal mistress but none offer the assembly do he the honor to set a price on he head and at last he think himself fortunate in be able to save himself those who have co-operate with he have worse fortune those in authority have no proof on which to condemn they but in those day suspicion be a sufficient death-warrant michoni and cortey be suspect and in the course of the next year a belief that they have at least sympathize with the queen 's sorrow send they both to the scaffold with the failure of de batz every project of escape be abandon and a few week later the queen congratulate herself that she have refuse to flee without she boy since in the course of may he be seize with illness which for some day threaten to assume a dangerous character with a brutality which even in such monster as the jacobin ruler of the city seem almost inconceivable they refuse to allow he the attendance of m brunier the physician who have have the charge of he infancy it would be a breach of the principle of equality they say if any prisoner be permit to consult any but the prison doctor but the prison doctor be a man of sense and humanity as well as of professional skill he of he own accord seek the advice of brunier and the poor child recover to be reserve for a fate which even in the next few week be so foreshadow that he own mother must almost have begin to doubt whether he restoration to health have be a blessing to she or to himself the spring be mark by important event have one so high-minded be capable of exult in the misfortune of even she worst enemy marie antoinette might have triumph in the knowledge that the murderer of she husband be already begin that work of mutual destruction which in little more than a year send almost every one of they to the same scaffold on which he have perish the jealousy which from the first have set the jacobin and girondin at variance have reach a height at which they could only be extinguish by the annihilation of one party or the other they have be partner in crime and so far be equal in infamy but the jacobin be the fiercer and the readier ruffian and after nearly two month of vehement debate in the convention in which robespierre denounce the whole body of the girondin leader as plotter of treason against the state and vergniaud in reply revile robespierre as a coward the jacobin work up the mob to rise in they support the convention which hitherto have be divide in something like equality between the two faction yield to the terror of a new insurrection and on the 2d of June order the arrest of the girondin leader a very few escape the search make for they by the officer -- roland to commit suicide barbaroux to attempt it pétion and buzot reach the forest to be devour by congenial wolf lanjuinai -lrb- 6 -rrb- whom the decree of the convention have identify with they but who even in the moment of the greatest excitement have keep himself clear of they wickedness and crime be the only one of the whole body who completely elude the rage of he enemy the rest with madame roland the first prompter of deed of blood languish in they well-deserved prison till the close of autumn when they all perish on the same scaffold to which they have send they innocent sovereign -lrb- 7 -rrb- but it may be that marie antoinette never learn they fall though that if she have pity would at least have mingle with if it have not predominate over she natural exultation she give a striking proof in she conduct toward one from whom she have suffer great and constant indignity from the time that she own attendant be dismiss the only person appoint to assist cléry in he duty be a man and woman name tison choose for that task on account of they surly and brutal temper in which the wife exceed she husband both and especially the woman have take a fiendish pleasure in heap gratuitous insult on the whole family but at last the dignity and resignation of the queen awaken remorse in the woman 's heart which presently work upon she to such a degree that she become mad in the first day of she frenzy she rave up and down the courtyard declare herself guilty of the queen 's murder she throw herself at marie antoinette 's foot implore she pardon and marie antoinette not only raise she up with she own hand and speak gentle word of forgiveness and consolation to she but after she have be remove to a hospital show a kind interest in she condition and amidst all she own trouble find time to write a note to express she anxiety that the invalid should have proper attention -lrb- 8 -rrb- but very soon a fresh blow be strike at the hapless queen which make she indifferent to all else that could happen and even to she own fate of which it may be regard as the precursor at ten o'clock on the 3d of July when the little king be sleep calmly he mother have hang a shawl in front of he bed to screen he eye from the light of the candle by which she and elizabeth be mend they clothes the door of they chamber be violently throw open and six commissioner enter to announce to the queen that the convention have order the removal of she boy that he might he commit to the care of a tutor -- the tutor name be the cobbler simon whose savageness of disposition be sufficiently attest by the fact of he have be choose on the recommendation of marat at this unexpected blow marie antoinette 's fortitude and resignation at last give way she weep she remonstrate she humble herself to entreat mercy she throw she arm around she child and declare that force itself should not tear he from she the commissioner be not man likely to feel or show pity they abuse she they threaten she she beg they rather to kill she than take she son they would not kill she but they swear that they would murder both he and she daughter before she eye if he be not at once surrender there be no more resistance he aunt and sister take he from the bed and dress he he mother with a voice choke by she sob address he the last word he be ever to hear from she my child they be take you from I never forget the mother who love you tenderly and never forget god be good gentle and honest and you father will look down on you from heaven and bless you have you do with this preaching say the chief commissioner you have abuse we patience finely another add the nation be generous and will take care of he education but she have faint and hear not these word of mock cruelty nothing could touch she further if it be not also a mockery to speak of happiness in connection with this most afflict queen she be happy in at least not know the detail of the education which be in store for the noble boy whose birth have apparently secure for he the most splendid of position and whose opening virtue seem to give every promise that he would be worthy of he rank and of he mother a few day afterward simon receive he instruction from a committee of the convention of which drouet the postmaster of ste menehould be the chief how be he to treat the wolf cub he ask -lrb- it be one of the mildest name he ever give he -rrb- be he to kill he no to poison he no what then he be to get rid of he -lrb- 9 -rrb- and simon carry out this instruction by the most unremitting ill-treatment of he pupil he impose upon he the most menial office he make he clean he shoe he revile he he beat he he compel he to wear the red cap and jacket which have be adopt as the revolutionary dress and one day when he mother obtain a glimpse of he as he be walk on the lead of the tower to which he have be transfer it cause she a additional pang to see that he have be strip of the suit of mourning for he father and have be clothe in the garment which in she eye be the symbol of all that be most impious and most loathsome all these outrage be but the prelude of the final blow which be to fall on herself and it show how great be the fear with which she lofty resolution have always have inspire the jacobin -- fear with such nature be always the greatest exasperation of hatred and the keenest incentive to cruelty -- that when they have resolve to consummate she injury by she murder they do not leave she in the temple as they have leave she husband but remove she to the conciergerie which in those day fitly denominate the reign of terror rarely lead but to the scaffold on the night of the 1st of August -lrb- the darkest hour be appropriately choose for deed of such darkness -rrb- another body of commissioner enter she room and wake she up to announce that they have come to conduct she to the common prison she sister and she daughter beg in vain to be allow to accompany she she herself scarcely speak a word but dress herself in silence make up a small bundle of clothes and after a few word of farewell and comfort to those dear one who have hitherto be she companion follow she jailer unresistingly know and for she own sake certainly not grieve that she be go to meet she doom as she pass through the outer door it be so low that she strike she head one of the commissioner have so much decency leave as to ask if she be hurt no she reply nothing now can hurt I -lrb- 10 -rrb- six week later a english gentleman see she in she dungeon she be freely exhibit to any one who desire to behold she on the sole condition -- a condition worthy of the monster who exact it and of they alone -- that he should show no sign of sympathy or sorrow -lrb- 11 -rrb- she be sit on a old worn-out chair make of straw which scarcely support she weight dress in a gown which have once be white she attitude bespoke the immensity of she grief which appear to have create a kind of stupor that fortunately render she less sensible to the injury and reproach which a number of inhuman wretch be continually vomit forth against she even after all the atrocity and horror of the last twelve month the news of the resolution to bring she to a trial which it be impossible to doubt it be intend to follow up by she execution be receive as a shake by the great bulk of the nation as indeed by all europe and necker 's daughter madame de staël who as we have see have be formerly desirous to aid in she escape now address a energetic and eloquent appeal to the entire people call on all person of all party republican constitutionalist and aristocrat alike to unite for she preservation she leave unemployed no fervor of entreaty no depth of argument she remind they of the universal admiration which the queen 's beauty and grace have formerly excite when all france think itself lay under a obligation by she charm -lrb- 12 -rrb- of the affection that she have win by she ceaseless act of beneficence and generosity she show the absurdity of denounce she as the austrian -- she who have leave vienna while still little more than a child and have ever since fix she heart as well as she home in france she argue truly that the vagueness the ridiculousness the notorious falsehood of the accusation bring against she be in themselves she all-sufficient defense she show how useless to every party and in every point of view must be she condemnation what danger could any one apprehend from restore to liberty a princess whose every thought be tenderness and pity she reproach those who now hold sway in france with the barbarity of they proscription with govern by terror and by death with have overthrow a throne only to erect a scaffold in its place and she declare that the execution of the queen would exceed in foulness all the other crime that they have yet commit she be a foreigner she be a woman to put she to death would be a violation of all the law of hospitality as well as of all the law of nature the whole universe be interesting itself in the queen 's fate woe to the nation which know neither justice nor generosity freedom would never be the destiny of such a people -lrb- 13 -rrb- it have not be from any feeling of compunction or hesitation that those who have she fate in they hand leave she so long in she dungeon but from the absolute impossibility of invent a accusation against she that should not be utterly absurd and palpably groundless so difficult do they find they task that the jailer a man name richard who when alone venture to show sympathy for she misery seek to encourage she by the assurance that she would be replace in the temple but marie antoinette indulge in no such illusion she never doubt that she death be resolve on no she reply to he well-meant word of hope they have murder the king they will kill I in the same way never again shall i see my unfortunate child my tender and virtuous sister and the tear which she own suffering could not wring from she flow freely when she think of what they be still endure but at last the eagerness for she destruction overcome all difficulty or scruple the principal article of the indictment charge she with help to overthrow the republic and to effect the reestablishment of the throne with have exert she influence over she husband to mislead he judgment to render he unjust to he people and to induce he to put he veto on law of which they desire the enactment with have cause scarcity and famine with have favor aristocrat and with have keep up a constant correspondence with she brother the emperor and the preamble and the peroration compare she to messalina agrippina brunehaut and catherine de ' medici -- to all the wickedest woman of whom ancient or modern history have preserve a record have she be guide by she own feeling alone she would have probably disdain to defend herself against charge whose very absurdity prove that they be only put forward as a pretense for a judgment that have be previously decide on but still as ever she think of she child she fair and good son she gentle infant she king while life last she could never wholly relinquish the hope that she might see he once again perhaps even that some unlooked-for chance -lrb- none could be so unexpected as almost every occurrence of the last four year -rrb- might restore he and she to freedom and he to he throne and for he sake she resolve to exert herself to refute the charge and at least to establish she right to acquittal and deliverance loui have be try before the convention marie antoinette be to be condemn by the if possible still more infamous court that have be establish in the spring under the name of the revolutionary tribunal and on the 13th of October she be at last conduct before a small sub-committee and subject to a private examination to every question she give firm and clear answer -lrb- 14 -rrb- she declare that the french people have indeed be deceive but not by she or by she husband she affirm that the happiness of france always have be and still be the first wish of she heart and that she should not even regret the loss of she son 's throne if it lead to the real happiness of the country she be take back to she cell the next day the four judge of the tribunal take they seat in the court fouquier-tinville the public prosecutor a man whose greed of blood stamp he with a especial hideousness even in those day of universal barbarity take he seat before they and eleven man the greater part of whom have be carefully pick from the very dregs of the people -- journeyman carpenter tailor blacksmith and discharge policeman -- be constitute the jury before this tribunal -- we will not dignify it with the name of a court of justice -- marie antoinette the widow capet as she be call in the indictment be now bring clothe in deep mourning for she murder husband and aged beyond she year by she long series of sorrow she still preserve the fearless dignity which become she race and rank and character as she take she place at the bar and cast she eye around the hall even the woman who throng the court debase as they be be strike by she lofty demeanor how proud she be be the exclamation the only sign of nervousness that she give be that as those who watch she closely remark she move she finger up and down on the arm of she chair as if she have be play on the harpsichord the prosecutor bring up witness after witness some whom it be believe that some ancient hatred other whom it be expect that some hope of pardon for themselves might induce to give evidence such as be require the count d'estaing have always be connect with she enemy bailly once mayor of pari as have be see have seek a base popularity by the wantonness of the unprovoked insult which he have offer to the king michoni know that he head be imperil by suspicion of he recent desire to assist she but one and all testify to she entire innocence of the different charge which they have be bring forward to support and to the falsehood of the statement contain in the indictment she own reply when any question be address to herself be equally in she favor when accuse of have be the prompter of the political mesure of the king 's government she answer could not be deny to be in accordance with the law : that she be the wife and subject of the king and could not be make responsible for he resolution and action when charge with general indifference or hostility to the happiness of the people she affirm with equal calmness as she have previously declare at she private examination that the welfare of the nation have be and always be the first of she wish once only do a question provoke a answer in any other tone than that of a lofty imperturbable equanimity she have not know till that moment the depth of she enemy ' wickedness or the cruelty with which she son 's mind have be deal with worse ten thousand time than the foulest torture that could be apply to the body both she child have be subject to a examination in the hope that something might be find to incriminate she in the word of those who might hardly be able to estimate the exact value of they expression the princess have be old enough to baffle the utmost malice of she questioner and the boy have give short and plain reply from which nothing to suit they purpose could be extract till they force he to drink brandy and when he be stupefy with drink compel he to sign deposition in which he accuse both the queen and elizabeth of have train he in lesson of vice at first horror at so monstrous a charge have seal the queen 's lip but when she give no denial a juryman question she on the subject and insist on a answer then at last marie antoinette speak in sublime indignation if i have not answer it be because nature itself reject such a accusation make against a mother i appeal from it to every mother who hear I marie antoinette have be allow two counsel who perilous as be the duty impose upon they cheerfully accept it as a honor but it be not intend that they assistance should be more than nominal she have only know they name on the evening precede the trial but when she address a letter to the president of the convention demand a postponement of the trial for three day as indispensable to enable they to master the case since as yet they have not have time even to read the whole of the indictment add that she duty to she child bind she to leave nothing undo which be requisite for the entire justification of they mother the request be rudely refuse and all that the lawyer could do be to address eloquent appeal to the judge and juryman be utterly unable on so short notice to analyze as they deserve the argument of the prosecutor or the testimony by which he have profess to support they but before such a tribunal it signify little what be prove or disprove or what be the strength or weakness of the argument employ on either side it be long after midnight of the second day that the trial conclude the jury at once pronounce the prisoner guilty the judge as instantly pass sentence of death and order it to be execute the next morning it be nearly five in the morning of the 16th of October when the favorite daughter of the great empress-queen herself queen of france be lead from the court not even to the wretched room which she have occupy for the last ten week but to the condemn cell never tenant before by any but the vilest felon though greatly exhaust by the length of the proceedings she have hear the sentence without betray the slightest emotion by any change of countenance or gesture on reach she cell she at once ask for write material they have be withhold from she for more than a year but they be now bring to she and with they she write she last letter to that princess whom she have long learn to love as a sister of she own who have share she sorrow hitherto and who at no distant period be to share the fate which be now await herself 16th October 430 be it be to you my sister that i write for the last time i have just be condemn not to a shameful death for such be only for criminal but to go and rejoin you brother innocent like he i hope to show the same firmness in my last moment i be calm as one be when one 's conscience reproach one with nothing i feel profound sorrow in leave my poor child : you know that i only live for they and for you my good and tender sister you who out of love have sacrifice everything to be with we in what a position do i leave you i have learn from the proceedings at my trial that my daughter be separate from you alas poor child i do not venture to write to she she would not receive my letter i do not even know whether this will reach you do you receive my blessing for both of they i hope that one day when they be older they may be able to rejoin you and to enjoy to the full you tender care let they both think of the lesson which i have never cease to impress upon they that the principle and the exact performance of they duty be the chief foundation of life and then mutual affection and confidence in one another will constitute its happiness let my daughter feel that at she age she ought always to aid she brother by the advice which she greater experience and she affection may inspire she to give he and let my son in he turn render to he sister all the care and all the service which affection can inspire let they in short both feel that in whatever position they may be place they will never be truly happy but through they union let they follow we example in we own misfortune how much comfort have we affection for one another afford we and in time of happiness we have enjoy that doubly from be able to share it with a friend and where can one find friend more tender and more united than in one 's own family let my son never forget the last word of he father which i repeat emphatically let he never seek to avenge we death i have to speak to you of one thing which be very painful to my heart i know how much pain the child must have cause you forgive he my dear sister think of he age and how easy it be to make a child say whatever one wish especially when he do not understand it -lrb- 15 -rrb- it will come to pass one day i hope that he will better feel the value of you kindness and of you tender affection for both of they it remain to confide to you my last thought i should have wish to write they at the beginning of my trial but besides that they do not leave I any means of write event have pass so rapidly that i really have not have time i die in the catholic apostolic and roman religion that of my father that in which i be bring up and which i have always profess have no spiritual consolation to look for not even know whether there be still in this place any priest of that religion -lrb- 16 -rrb- -lrb- and indeed the place where i be would expose they to too much danger if they be to enter it but once -rrb- i sincerely implore pardon of god for all the fault which i may have commit during my life i trust that in he goodness he will mercifully accept my last prayer as well as those which i have for a long time address to he to receive my soul into he mercy i beg pardon of all whom i know and especially of you my sister for all the vexation which without intend it i may have cause you i pardon all my enemy the evil that they have do I i bid farewell to my aunt and to all my brother and sister i have friend the idea of be forever separate from they and from all they trouble be one of the greatest sorrow that i suffer in die let they at least know that to my latest moment i thought of they farewell my good and tender sister may this letter reach you think always of I i embrace you with all my heart as i do my poor dear child my god how heart-rending it be to leave they forever farewell farewell i must now occupy myself with my spiritual duty as i be not free in my action perhaps they will bring I a priest but i here protest that i will not say a word to he but that i will treat he as a person absolutely unknown she foreboding be realize she letter never reach elizabeth but be carry to fouquier who place it among he special record yet if in those who have thus work the writer 's destruction there have be one human feeling it might have be awaken by the simple dignity and unaffected pathos of this sad farewell no line that she ever write be more thoroughly characteristic of she the innocence purity and benevolence of she soul shine through every sentence even in that awful moment she never lose she calm resign fortitude nor she consideration for other she speak of and feel for she child for she friend but never for herself and it be equally characteristic of she that even in she own hopeless situation she still can cherish hope for other and can look forward to the prospect of those whom she love be hereafter unite in freedom and happiness she think it may be that she own death would be the last sacrifice that she enemy would require and for even she enemy and murderer she have a word of pardon and could address a message of mercy for they to she son who she trust might yet some day have power to show that mercy she enjoin or to execute the vengeance which with she last breath she deprecate she throw herself on she bed and fall asleep at seven she be rouse by the executioner the street be already throng with a fierce and sanguinary mob whose shout of triumph be so vociferous that she ask one of she jailer whether they would tear she to piece she be assure that as he express it they would do she no harm and indeed the jacobin themselves would have protect she from the populace so anxious be they to heap on she every indignity that would render death more terrible loui have be allow to quit the temple in he carriage marie antoinette be to be draw from the prison to the scaffold in a common cart seat on a bare plank the executioner by she side hold the cord with which she hand be already bind with a refinement of barbarity those who conduct the procession make it halt more than once that the people might gaze upon she point she out to the mob with word and gesture of the vilest insult she hear they not she thought be with god : she lip be utter nothing but prayer once for a moment as she pass in sight of the tuilery she be observe to cast a agonize look toward its tower remember perhaps how reluctantly she have quit it fourteen month before it be midday before the cart reach the scaffold as she descend she tread on the executioner 's foot it might seem to have be ordain that she very last word might be word of courtesy excuse I sir she say i do not do it on purpose and she add make haste in a few moment all be over she body be throw into a pit in the common cemetery and cover with quicklime to insure its entire destruction when more than twenty year afterward she brother-in-law be restore to the throne and with pious affection desire to remove she remains and those of she husband to the

while still a boy at versaille thus miserably perish by a death fit only for the vilest of criminal marie antoinette the daughter of one sovereign the wife of another who have never wrong or injure one human be no one be ever more richly endowed with all the charm which render woman attractive or with all the virtue that make she admirable even in she earliest year she careless and occasionally undignified levity be but the joyous outpouring of a pure innocence of heart that as it mean no evil suspect none while it be ever blended with a kindness and courtesy which spring from a genuine benevolence as queen though still hardly beyond girlhood when she ascend the throne she set herself resolutely to work by she admonition and still more effectually by she example to purify a court of which for century the most shameless profligacy have be the rule and boast discountenancing vice and impiety by she marked reprobation and reserve all she favor and protection for genius and patriotism and honor and virtue surround at a later period by unexampled danger and calamity she show herself equal to every vicissitude of fortune and superior to its worst frown if she judgment occasionally err it be in case where alternative of evil be alone offer to she choice and in which it be even now scarcely possible to decide what course would have be wiser or safer than that which she adopt and when at last the long conflict be terminate by the complete victory of she combined enemy -- when she with she husband and she child be bereft not only of power but even of freedom and be a prisoner in the hand of those whose unalterable object be she destruction -- she bear she accumulate misery with a serene resignation a intrepid fortitude a true heroism of soul of which the
