introduction the romantic figure of antar or antarah take the same place in arabian literature as that of achille among the greek the cid in spain orlando in italy and arthur in england be similar example of national ideal put forth by poet and romance writer as embodiment of a certain half-mythic age of chivalry when personal valor prudence generosity and high feeling give the warrior a admit preeminence among he fellow the literature of arabium be indeed rich in novel and tale the thousand and one night be of world-wide reputation but the romance of antar be much less artificial more expressive of high moral principle and certainly superior in literary style to the fantastic recital of the coffee house and bazaar in which sindbad and morgiana figure a true picture of bedouin society in the century before mohamm have conquer the arabian peninsula be give we in the charming episode of antar we see the encampment of the tribe the camel yield milk and flesh for food the woman friend and councillor of they husband the boy inure to arm from early day the careful breeding of horse the song of poet and minstrel stir all heart the mail-clad line of warrior with lance and sword the supreme power of the king -- often deal out justice with stern sudden and inflexible ferocity among these surroundings antar appear a dazzling and irresistible warrior and a poet of wonderful power the arab classic in year long before mohamm have take the kaaba and make it the talisman of he creed be hang in the little shrine where the black volcanic stone be keep they be know as maallakat or suspend book which have the same meaning among arabian literati as the term classic bear among the italian scholar of the renaissance number with these book of the kaaba be the poem of antar who be thus the taliessin of arabian chivalry it be indeed necessary to recollect that in read the episode of antar we have be take back to the heroic age in the arabian peninsula war be consider the noblest occupation of a man and khale despise the love of a noble maiden from pride in he passion for war antar have he famous horse as the cid have he babicca and he irresistible sword as arthur he excalibur the wealth of chief and king consist in horse and camel there be no mention of money or jewelry when a wager be make the stake be a hundred camel the commercial spirit of the arabian night be want in this spirited romance of chivalry the arab have sink to a race of mere trader when aladdin become possess of he lamp and the trickery greed and avarice of peddler and merchant be exhibit in incident after incident of the thousand and one night war be despise or fear courage less to be rely upon than astute knavery and one of the fact that strike we be the general frivolity dishonesty and cruelty which prevail through the tale of bagdad the opposite be the case with antar natural passion have full play but nobility of character be take seriously and generosity and sensibility of heart be portray with truthfulness and naiveté of course the whole romance be a collection of many romantic story : it have no epic unity it will remind the reader of the morte d'arthur of sir thoma malory rather than of the iliad we have choose the most striking of these episode as best calculate to serve as genuine specimen of arabian literature they will transport the modern reader into a new world -- which be yet the old long vanish world of pastoral simplicity and warlike enthusiasm in primitive arabium but the novelty lie in the plot of the tale djaida and khale antar and iblum and the race between shidoub and the great racer dahir and ghabra bring before we eye with singular freshness the character of a civilization a domestic life a political system which be not want in refinement purity and justice the conception of such a dramatic personage as antar would be original in the highest degree if it be not base upon historic fact antar be a more real personage than arthur and quite as real and historic as the cid yet he adventure remind we very much of those which run through the story of the round table the arab in the day of romance be a collection of tribe and family whose tent and village be spread along the red sea between egypt and the indian ocean there be some tribe more powerful than other and the result of they tyranny be often bitter war there be no central monarchy no priesthood and no written law the only stable and independent unit be the family domestic life with its purest virtue constitute the strong point amongst the arabian tribe where gentleness free obedience and forbearance be conspicuous each tribe bear the name of its first ancestor and from he and he successor come down a traditionary unwritten law the violation of which be consider the most heinous of offence there be no settle religion before the conquest of mohammed each tribe and each family worship whom they would -- celestial spirit sun and moon or certain idol in the account give in antar of the council of war the ancient or old man of the tribe come forth with idol or amulet round they neck and the whole account of the council in which the bard as well as the orator address the people be strictly accurate in historic detail the custom of infanticide in the case of female child be perfectly authorize among the arab and illustrate the motive of the pretty episode of khale and djaida war be individual and personal among the arab and murder be atone for by murder or by the price of a certain number of camel raise of horse peaceful contest in arm or poetic competition where each bard recite in public he composition form they amusement they be very sensible to the charm of music poetry and oratory and as a general rule the arab chieftain be brave generous and munificent all these historic fact be fully reflect in the highly emotional tale of antar which be the greatest of all the national romance of arabia it would scarcely be possible to fix upon any individual writer as its author for it have be edit over and over again by arabian scribe each add he own gloss and enrich it with incident its original date may have be the sixth century of we era about five hundred year before the production of the thousand and one night ew the early fortune of antar at the time the romance of antar open the most powerful and the best govern of the

among they begin to eat with they like a noble arab cousin say hadifah to he jokingly what large mouthful you take heaven preserve I from have a appetite like yours it be true say cai that i be die of

of you to cancel this bet for all that be utter over cup and flagon be of no serious account and ought to be forget i would have you to know be the answer that i will not withdraw from the challenge unless you forfeit the camel which be stake if you accept this condition i shall be perfectly indifferent to everything else nevertheless if you wish it i will seize the camel by force or if it be you good pleasure i will waive every claim save as a debt of honor in spite of all that cai could say hadifah remain firm in he resolution and as he brother begin to deride cais the latter lose he temper and with a face blaze with wrath he ask of hadifah what stake do you offer in you wager with my cousin twenty she-camel say hadifah as for this first wager answer cais i cancel it and propose another one in its stead : i will bet thirty camel and i forty reply hadifah i make it fifty be the retort of cais sixty quickly add the other and they continue raise the term of the wager until the number of camel stake be one hundred the contract of the bet be deposit in the hand of a man name sabic son of wahhab and in the presence of a crowd of youth and old man what shall be the length of the race ask hadifah of cais one hundred bow-shot reply cai and we have a archer here aya the son of mansor who will measure the ground aya be in fact the strongest and most accomplished archer then live among the arab king cai by choose aya wish the course to be make long know the endurance of he horse and the longer distance dahir have to travel the more he gain speed from the increase excitement of he spirit well now we have better fix the day for the race say cai to hadifah forty day will be require reply hadifah to bring the horse into condition you be right say cai and they agree that the horse should be train for forty day that the race should take place by the lake zatalirsad and that the horse that first reach the goal should be declare winner all these preliminary have be arrange cai return to he tent meanwhile one of the horseman of the tribe of fazarah say to he neighbor : kinsman you may rest assure that there be go to be a breach between the tribe of ab and that of fazarah as a result of this race between dahir and ghabra the two tribe you must know will be mutually estrange for king cai have be there in person now he be a prince and the son of a prince he have make every effort to cancel the bet but hadifah would by no means consent all this be the beginning of a broil which may be follow by a war possibly lasting fifty year and many a one will fall in the struggle hadifah hearing this prediction say : i do not trouble myself much about the matter and you suggestion seem to I absurd o hadifah exclaim aya i be go to tell you what will be the result of all you obstinacy towards cai then he recite some verse with the follow meaning : in thee o hadifah there be no beauty and in the purity of cais there be not a single blot how sincere and honest be he counsel although they be lack in prudence and dignity make a wager with a man who do not possess even a ass and whose father have never be rich enough to buy a horse let cai alone he have wealth land horse a proud spirit and he be the owner of this dahir who be always first on the day of a race whether he be rest or run -- this dahir a steed whose foot even appear through the obscurity of night like burn brand aya reply hadifah do you think i would break my word i will take the camel of cai and will not permit my name to be inscribe among the number of those who have be vanquish let thing run they course as soon as king cai have regain he tent he hasten to tell he slave to begin the training of he horse and to pay especial attention to dahir then he tell he kinsman all that have take place between himself and hadifah antar be present at this recital and as he take great interest in all that concern the king he say cai calm you fear keep you eye well open run the race and have no fear for by the faith of a arab if hadifah make any trouble or misunderstanding i will kill he as well as the whole tribe of fazarah the conversation on this subject continue until they reach the tent which antar decline to enter before see dahir he walk several time round this animal and see at a glance that the horse actually possess quality which astonish any one who see he hadifah quickly learn the return of antar and know that the hero be encouraging king cai to run the race haml hadifah 's brother have also hear the news and in the distress which he feel remark to hadifah i fear lest antar should fall upon I or some one of the family of beder and kill we and thus render we disgraced give up this race or we be ruin let I go to king cai and i will not leave he until he promise to come to you and cancel the contract do as you please answer hadifah thereupon haml take horse and go immediately to king cai he find he with he uncle assye a wise and prudent man haml approach cai salute he by kiss he hand and after say that he be the bearer of a important message add : kinsman you know that my brother hadifah be a low fellow whose mind be full of intrigue i have spend the last three day in try to persuade he to cancel this wager at last he have say : ` very good if cai come to I and wish to be release from the contract i will annul it but do not let any arab think that i abandon the bet through fear of antar ' now you cais be aware that the greatest proof of attachment between kinsman be they willingness to give way to one another so i be here to beg that you will come to the dwelling of my brother hadifah and ask he to give up the race before it cause trouble and the tribe be utterly drive away from its territory at this address of haml cai become flush with shame for he be trust and generous he at once arise and leave he uncle assye in charge of he domestic business he accompany haml to the land of fazarah when they be midway on they journey haml begin to utter lavish praise of cai to the latter 's face and to blame he own brother 's fault in the follow term : o cai do not let you wrath be stir up against hadifah for he be verily a man headstrong and unjust in he action o cais if you persist in hold to the bet great disaster will follow both you and he be impulsive and passionate and this be what cause I to feel anxiety about you cai put aside you private feeling be kind and generous and it will come to pass that the oppressor himself will become the oppressed haml continue to abuse he brother and to flatter cai with expression of admiration all the way until in the evening they arrive at the tribe of fazarah hadifah who at the moment be surround by many powerful chief upon whose aid he depend in the hour of need have change he mind since he brother haml 's departure and in place of come to term and make peace with cai he have determine to yield in nothing but to maintain rigorously the condition of the come race he be speak of this very matter with one of the chief at the moment when cai and haml present themselves before he as soon as hadifah see cais he resolve to cover he with shame turn therefore to he brother he ask : who order you to go to this man by the faith of a noble arab even if all the man who cover the surface of the earth be to come and importune I say ' o hadifah give up one hair of these camel ' i would not yield until a lance have pierce my heart and a sword stricken the head from my shoulder cai crimsoned and immediately remount he horse bitterly reproach haml he return home with the utmost haste and find he uncle and brother wait for he in extreme anxiety o my son say he uncle assye as soon as he see he you have have a disastrous journey for it have cause you to be disgrace if hadifah have not be surround by certain chief who give he treacherous counsel i could have arrange the whole affair answer cais there be now nothing leave but to carry out the race and the bet king cai do not sleep the whole of that night on the morrow he think of nothing but the training of he horse during the forty day ' interval before the race all the arab of the land agree to come to the pasture and see the race and when the forty day have expire the horseman of the two tribe come in a crowd to the bank of lake zatalirsud next arrive the archer aya who turn he back to the lake at the point where the horse be to start draw he bow as he walk toward the north a hundred time and measure out to the goal the course of a hundred bow-shot soon the horseman of ghitfan and dibyan arrive for they be of the same territory and because of they friendly relation and kinship be comprise as one tribe under the name of adnan king cai have beg antar not to show himself on this occasion fear that he appearance might cause dissension antar listen to this advice but be unable to rest quiet in the tent the interest he feel in cai and the deep distrust with which the falseness of the fazarean -- who be always ready for treason -- inspire he induce he to show himself gird on he sword dhamus and mount he famous charger abjer he take with he he brother shidoub and reach the spot fix upon for the race in order that he might watch over the safety of king zoheir 's son on he arrival he seem to excel all that crowd like a lion clothe in coat of mail he carry he naked sword and he eye flash like blaze coal as soon as he have reach the middle of the crowd he cry out with a loud voice that strike terror to all heart : hearken noble arabian chieftain and man of renown assemble here -- all of you know that i be support and favor by king zoheir father of king cai that i be a slave bind to he by he goodness and munificence that it be he who cause my parent to acknowledge I and give I my rank make I to be number among arab chief although he be no longer live i wish to show my gratitude to he and bring the king of the land into subjection to he even after he death he have leave a son whom he brother have acknowledge and have set on the throne of he father this son be cai whom they have thus distinguish because of he wisdom rectitude and noble heart i be the slave of cai and be he property i intend to be the supporter of he whom i love and the enemy of whosoever resist he it shall never be say as long as i live that i have suffer a enemy to affront he as to the condition of this wager it be we duty to see they observe the best thing accordingly to do be to let the horse race unobstructed for victory come from the creator of day and night i make a oath therefore by the holy house at mecca by the temple by the eternal god who never forget he servant and never sleep that if hadifah commit any act of violence i will make he drink the cup of vengeance and of death and will make the whole tribe of fazarah the byword of all the world and you arab chieftain if you sincerely desire the race to take place conduct yourselve with justice and impartiality otherwise by the eye of my dear ibla i will make the horse run the race in blood antar be right the horseman shout on all side hadifah choose as the rider of ghabra a groom of the tribe of dibyan this man have pass all he day and many of he night in rearing and tend horse cai on the other hand choose as rider of dahir a groom of the tribe of ab much better trained and experienced in he profession than be the dibyanian when the two contestant have mount they horse king cai give this parting instruction to he groom : do not let the rein hang too loosely in manage dahir if you see he flag stand up in you stirrup and press he flank gently with you leg do not urge he too much or you will break he spirit hadifah hear this advice and repeat it word for word to he rider antar begin to laugh by the faith of a arab he say to hadifah you will be beat be word so scarce that you be oblige to use exactly those of cai but as a matter of fact cai be a king the son of a king he ought always to be imitate by other and since you have follow word by word he speech it be a proof that you horse will follow he in the desert at these word the heart of hadifah swell with rage and indignation and he swear with a oath that he would not let he horse run that day but that he wish the race to take place at sunrise next morning this delay be indispensable to he in prepare the act of perfidy which he meditate for he have no sooner see dahir than he be speechless with astonishment at the beauty and perfection of the horse the judge have already dismount and the horseman of the various tribe be prepare to return home when shidoub begin to cry out with a loud voice tribe of ab of adnan of fazarah and of dibyan and all here present attend to I for a instant and listen to word which shall be repeat from generation to generation all the warrior stand motionless speak on they cry what be you will perhaps there may be something good in you word illustrious arab continue shidoub you know what happen in consequence of the match between dahir and ghabra : i assure you on my life that i will outstrip both of they in run even be they swifter than the wind but listen to the condition i offer if i be the winner i be to take the hundred camel which be at stake but if i be beat i be to forfeit fifty upon this one of the sheik of fazarah exclaim what be that you be say vile slave why should you receive a hundred camel if you win and only forfeit fifty if you lose do you ask why ancient mire of a dunghill reply shidoub because i have but two leg to run on and a horse have four not count he tail all the arab burst out laugh yet as they be astonish at the condition propose by shidoub and extremely curious to see he run the race they agree that he should make the hazardous experiment when all have return to the tent antar say to shidoub : come now thou son of a cursed mother how dare thou say that thou couldst outstrip these two horse whose race all horseman of we tribe have assemble to see and who all the world admit have no equal in speed not even among the bird of the air by he who create the spring in the rock and who know all thing reply shidoub i will outstrip those two horse be they fleet as the wind yes and my victory will have a advantageous result for when the arab hear of it they will give up all idea of pursue I when i run across the desert antar laugh for he be in doubt about shidoub 's plan the latter go to find king cai and he brother and the other witness of the race and make oath on he life that he would outstrip the two horse all present acknowledge themselves witness of the oath and leave the spot fill with astonishment at the proposition as for the trickster hadifah in the evening he summon one of he slave name dame a rascal if ever there be one o dame he say you frequently boast of you cunning but hitherto i have have no opportunity of put it to the proof my lord answer the slave tell I in what way i can be useful to you i desire say hadifah that you go and post yourself in the great pass remain in this place and go and hide yourself there in the morning watch the horse well and see if dahir be in advance if he be show yourself suddenly strike he on the head and cause he to stop so that ghabra may outstrip he and we may not incur the disgrace of defeat for i confess that since i have see dahir he excellent point have make I doubt the superiority of ghabra and i fear my mare will be beat and we shall become the laugh stock of all the arab but sir how shall i distinguish dahir from ghabra when they advance both of they wrap in a cloud of dust hadifah reply i be go to give you a sign and to explain how the matter may be free from difficulty as he speak he pick up some stone from the ground and say : take these stone with you at sunrise begin to count they and throw they to the earth four at a time you must repeat the operation five time and the last time ghabra will arrive that be the calculation i have make so that if a cloud of dust present itself to you and some of the stone a third or a half of they still remain in you hand you may be sure that dahir have gain first place and be before you eye you must then hurl a stone at he head as i say and stop he run so that my mare may gain the lead the slave agree to do so he provide himself with stone and go to hide himself at the great pass and hadifah feel confident of gain the wager at the dawn of day the arab come from all quarter be assemble on the race ground the judge give the signal for the start and the two rider utter loud shout the racer start like flash of lightning which dazzle the sight and seem like the wind when as it blow it increase in fury ghabra pass ahead of dahir and distance he now you be lose my brother of the tribe of ab cry the fazarean groom to the absian try and console yourself for this defeat you lie retort the absian and in a few moment you will see how completely you be mistaken wait till we have pass this uneven ground mare always travel faster on rough road than on smooth country and so it happen for when they arrive in the plain dahir shot forward like a giant leave a trail of dust behind he it seem as if he go on wing not leg in the twinkling of a eye he have outstrip ghabra here cry the absian to the fazarean groom send a messenger from I to the family of beder and you yourself drink the bitter cup of patience behind I meanwhile shidoub swift as the north wind keep ahead of dahir bound like a fawn and run like a ostrich until he reach the defile where dame be hide the slave have only throw down less than a third of he pebble when he look up and see dahir approach he wait till the horse pass close by he and suddenly show himself with a shout and hit the racer violently between the eye with a stone the horse rear stop one moment and the rider be on the point of be unseated shidoub be a witness to the incident and have look at the slave recognize he as belong to the treacherous hadifah in the violence of he rage he fling himself upon dame and strike he dead with he sword : then he approach dahir for the purpose of speak soothingly to he and start he again on the race but alas the mare ghabra rush up like the wind then shidoub fear defeat thinking of the camel he would forfeit set out run at full speed towards the lake where he arrive two bow-shot in advance of the horse ghabra follow then dahir last bearing on he forehead the mark of the missile he cheek be cover with blood and tear all the spectator be astounded on see the agility and endurance of shidoub but as soon as ghabra have reach the finish the fazarean utter loud shout of joy dahir be lead home all bleeding and he rider tell the man of the tribe of ab what the slave have do cai examine the wound of he horse and ask for full detail of the occurrence antar grow crimson with anger and lay he hand upon he invincible sword as if impatient to annihilate the tribe of the fazarean but the sheik restrain he although with difficulty after which they go to hadifah to cover he with shame and to reproach he with the infamous deed he have do hadifah deny it with false oath affirm that he know nothing of the blow deal to dahir then he add i demand the camel which be due to I and i do not admit the treacherous pretext on which they be be withhold that blow be doubtless of evil augury for the tribe of fazarah say cais god will certainly give we victory and triumph and destroy they for hadifah only desire this race to take place in order that it might cause trouble and discord and the disturbance which this contest be sure to excite will stir up one tribe against another so that there will be many man kill and child make orphan the conversation which follow among the tribesman become more and more excited confusion follow shout ring out on all side and draw sword flash bloodshed would have result have not the sheik and wise man dismount and with bared head mingle with the crowd with humble mien implore they until at last the matter be settle as harmoniously as possible it be agree that shidoub should receive the amount of the wager -- a hundred camel from the tribe of fazarah and that hadifah should abandon he claim and refrain from all dispute such be the measure take to extinguish the hostility and disorder which threaten to burst out among the tribe then the different family retire to they own dwelling but the heart of all be fill with bitter hatred one whose resentment seem keenest be hadifah especially when he learn of the slave dame 's death as for cais he be also fill with mute rage and intense hatred yet antar try to reassure he king he say to he do not let you heart be a prey to mortification for i swear by the tomb of king zoheir you father that i will cause disgrace and infamy to fall on hadifah and it be only from regard for you that i have up to this time delay action soon after all return to they tent the following morning shidoub kill twenty of the camel he have win the day before and cause the meat to be distribute among the widow and those who have be wound and cripple in war he slaughter twenty other which he use in entertain the tribe of ab include woman and slave finally the next day he kill the rest of the camel and make a great feast near the lake zatalirsad to which he invite the son of king zoheir and he noblest chieftain at the end of this banquet when the wine circulate among the guest all praise the behavior of shidoub but the news of the camel slaughter and of all the feast be soon know to the tribe of fazarah all the enraged tribesman hasten to seek hadifah what say they while we be first in the race slave and traitorous absian have eat we camel send for a equal number of camel by all means but if he refuse they let we make a terrible war upon the absian hadifah raise he eye upon he son abou-firacah mount horse at once he say to he and go and say to cai : my father say that you must this instant pay the wager or he will come and seize the amount by main force and will bring trouble upon you there be then present a chief among the sheik who hear the order that hadifah have give to he son say : o hadifah be you not ashamed to send such a message to the tribe of the absian be they not we kindred and ally do this proposal harmonize with the counsel and desire of allay dissension the genuine man show gratitude

bath in he slavish blood i beg you to listen to none but wise counsel act nobly and abandon base design while you be thus forewarn as to you situation keep a prudent eye on you affair this discourse render hadifah furious contemptible sheik dog of a traitor he exclaim what must i be in fear of cai and the whole tribe of the absian by the faith of a arab i will let all man of honor know that if cai refuse to send the camel i will not leave one of he tent stand the sheik be indignant and to increase the fear he would cast into the heart of hadifah he speak to he in verse to the following effect : insult be cowardliness for it take by surprise he who be not expect it as the night enwrap those who wander in the desert when the sword shall once be draw look out for blow be just and do not clothe thyself with dishonor enquire of those who know the fate of themond and he tribe when they commit act of rebellion and tyranny they will tell you that a command of god from on high destroy they in one night and on the morrow they lay scatter on the ground they eye turn towards the sky hadifah dissemble he contempt for these verse and the sheik who have pronounce they but he order he son

when he re-enter he home he learn from he wife that abou-firacah have come to ask for the camel by the faith of a arab he say if i have be here i would have slay he but the matter be close let we think no more of it yet king cai pass the night in grief and annoyance until sunrise at which time he betake himself to he tent antar come to see he cais rise and make he take a seat mention the name of hadifah would you believe he have the shamelessness to send he son to demand the camel of I ah if i have be present i would have slay the messenger scarcely have he finish utter these word when abou-firacah present himself on horseback without dismount and utter no word of salutation or preface he say : cais my father desire that you send he that which be he due by so do you conduct will be that of a generous man but if you refuse my father will come against you carry off he property by force and plunge you into misfortune on hear these word cai feel the light change to darkness before

messenger lose control of he horse -- antar drag he down and fling he on the ground then turn the horse 's head away from the direction of fazarah he strike he on the flank with a holly-stick and the horse take the road towards the pasture and finally enter he stable all cover with blood the shepherd at once lead he to the tent cry out misfortune misfortune hadifah become furious he smite upon he breast repeat the word : tribe of fazarah to arm to arm to arm and all the disaffected come to hadifah once more beg he to declare war on the absian and to take vengeance on they kinsman reply hadifah with alacrity let none of we sleep to-night without we armor on and so it happen at break of day hadifah be on horseback the warrior be ready and only woman and child and the feeble be leave in the tent cai on the other hand after slaying abou-firacah expect that the fazarean would come and attack himself and he warrior he therefore prepare for battle antar be charge with take the necessary reconnoitre he leave in the tent only woman child and those too feeble to bear the sword then he put himself in command of the hero of carad nothing could be more brilliant than the rank of the absian in they coat of mail and gleaming weapon these preparation cause a anxious moment for both party they march forth against each other and the sun have scarcely appear before scimitar flash and the whole country be in a turmoil antar be impatient to press forward and satisfy he thirst for battle but lo hadifah dress in a black robe advance he heart break by the death of he son son of zoheir he cry to cai it be a base action to slay a child but it be good to meet in battle to decide with these lance which shall predominate you or I these word cut cai to the quick hurry along by passion he leave he standard and rush against hadifah then the two chief spur on by mutual hatred fight together on they noble charger until nightfall cai be mount on dahir and hadifah on ghabra in the course of this combat the exploit of the past be eclipse each tribe despair of he chieftain 's safety and they be eager to make a general attack in order to stop the struggle of the chieftain and the fury with which they contend cry begin to be hear in the air scimitar be draw and lance advance over the ear of arabian charger antar approach certain absian chief and say let we attack the traitor he prepare to charge when the ancient of the two tribe come forth into the middle of the plain with head uncover they foot bare and they idol hang from they shoulder stand between the two army they speak as follow : kinsman and ally in the name of that harmony which have hitherto prevail among we let we do nothing that will make we the byword of we slave let we not furnish we enemy with ground for reproach we let we forget all matter of dispute and dissension let we not turn wife into widow and we child into orphan satisfy you warlike ardor by attack those among the arab who be you real foe and you kinsman of fazarah show yourselve more humble and less haughty towards you brethren the absian above all forget not that insolent wrong have often cause the destruction of many tribe which have have sore reason to regret they impious action in this way many man have be deprive of they possession and a vast number be plunge into the gulf of despair and regret expect the fatal hour of death the day of dissolution for it be upon you you will be rent asunder by the threatening eagle of destruction and enclose in the dark prison-house of the tomb take care that when you body be separate from life man may think about you without any other memory than that of you virtue the sheik talk together for a long time and meanwhile the flame of passion which have be kindle in the soul of the two hero cai and hadifah become quench hadifah withdraw from the fight and it be agree that cai should pay as the price of abou-firacah 's blood a quantity of cattle and a string of camel the sheik do not wish even then to quit the field of battle until cai and hadifah embrace each other and have agree to all the arrangement antar be crimson with rage o king cai he exclaim what have you do what while we sword flash in we hand shall the tribe of fazarah exact a price for the blood of its dead and we never be able to obtain retaliation except with we spear point the blood of we dead be shed and shall we not avenge it hadifah be beside himself on hear these word and you vile bastard say antar to he you son of a vile mother must you honor be purchase at the expense of we disgrace but for the presence of these noble sheik i would annihilate you and all you people this very instant then hadifah 's indignation and anger overleap all bound by the faith of a arab he say to the sheik i wish to hear no talk of peace at the moment that the enemy be ready to spear I do not talk in that way dear son of my mother say haml to he brother do not dart away on the path of imprudence abandon these gloomy resolution remain in peace with the ally of the absian for they be shine star : the burnish sun that guide all arab who love glory it be but the other day that you wrong they by cause the horse dahir to be wound and thus err from the path of justice as for you son he be justly slay for you have send he to demand something that be not due you after all nothing be so proper as to make peace for he who would seek and stir up war be a tyrant and a oppressor accept therefore the compensation offer you or you be likely to call up around we a fire which will burn we in the flame of hell haml conclude with verse of the follow import : by the truth of he who have root firm the mountain without foundation if you decline to accept the compensation offer by the absian you be in the wrong they acknowledge hadifah as they chief be a chief in very deed and be content with the cattle and camel offer you dismount from the horse of outrage and mount it not again for it will carry you to the sea of grief and calamity hadifah renounce like a generous man all violence but particularly the idea of contend with the absian make of they and of they leader a powerful rampart against the enemy that may attack we make of they friend that will remain faithful for they be man of the noblest intention such be the absian and if cai have act unjustly towards you it be you who first set he the example some day ago when haml finish these verse the chief of the different tribe thank he and hadifah have consent to accept the compensation offer all the arab renounce violence and war all who carry arm remain at home cai send to hadifah two hundred camel six men-slave ten women-slave and ten horse thus peace be reestablish and every one rest in tranquillity throughout the land selection from arabian poetry -lrb- _ translation by jd carlyle _ -rrb- introduction the essential quality of arabian poetry appear in the romance of antar and the tale of the thousand and one night for such a blending of prose and verse be the favorite form of arabian literature in its highest and severest form even in the drama but the character of the people be most clearly show in the lyrical poem of the bedouin country the pastoral poetry of the peninsula be so local in its allusion that it can not adequately be translate into english it be in the lyric that we find that touch of nature which make the whole world kin the gorgeousness of hindoo literature with its lavish description of jewelry and gold precious stone and marble hideous demon and mighty god be not to be look for in arabium there the horizon be clear and the plain have nothing but human occupant the common passion of man be the only power at work love war sorrow and wine be the subject of these little song some of which might have be write by anacreon moore and other by catullus the influence of greek poetry be indeed manifest in these light and sometimes frivolous effusion the sweetness and grace which distinguish some be only equal by the wit of other for wit be the prevail characteristic of arabian poetry which be attractive for its cleverness its brightness the alternate smile and tear which shine through it and make the present selection so refreshing and interesting a revelation of the national heart and intellect i use the word refreshing because some of the imagery of these lyric be new to I and quite unparalleled in european literature what can be more novel and at the same time more charming than the follow simile with which a short elegy conclude : -- but though in dust thy relic lie thy virtue mano ne'er shall die though nile 's full stream be see no more that spread he wave from shore to shore still in the verdure of the plain he vivify smile remain the praise of a humble lot have be sing from háfiz to horace but never illustrate by a prettier conceit than the arabic poet have recourse to in this stanza : -- not always wealth not always force a splendid destiny command the lordly vulture gnaw the corse that rot upon yon barren sand nor want nor weakness still conspire to bind we to a sordid state the fly that with a touch expire sip honey from the royal plate this be undoubtedly a very original way of state the philosophic axiom of the augustan poet the lord of boundless revenue do not salute as happy i have speak of the wit of these verse which be certainly one of they distinguishing quality it be quite attic in its flavor and exquisitely delicate in its combined good-humor and freedom from rancor a epigram accord to the old definition should be like a bee it should carry the sweetness of honey although it bear a sting at the end sometimes the end have a point which do not sting as in the follow quatrain of a arabic poet : -- when i send you my melon you cry out with scorn they ought to be heavy and wrinkled and yellow when i offer myself whom those grace adorn you flout and call I a ugly old fellow martial himself could not have excel the wit of a epigram address to a very little man who wear a very big beard which thus conclude : -- surely thou cherishest thy beard in hope to hide thyself behind it to study a literature like that of the arabian even partially and in a translation be one of those experience which enlarge and stimulate the mind and expand its range of impression with a distinctly elevate and liberalize effect it have the result of genuine education in that it increase we capacity for sympathy for other people make we better acquaint with the language in which they reveal that common human heart which they share with we ew a

cool breeze be blow he set he burden upon the ground and sit down to rest in the shade of a grand house very soon he decide that he could not have choose a pleasanter place a delicious perfume of aloes-wood and pastille come from the open window and mingle with the scent of the rose-water which steam up from the hot pavement within the palace he hear some music as of many instrument cunningly play and the melodious warble of nightingale and other bird and by this and the appetizing smell of many dainty dish of which he presently become aware he judge that feast and merry-making be go on he wonder who live in this magnificent house which he have never see before the street in which it stand be one which he seldom have occasion to pass to satisfy he curiosity he go up to some splendidly dress servant who stand at the door and ask one of they the name of the master of the mansion what reply he do you live in bagdad and not know that here live the noble sindbad the sailor that famous traveller who sail over every sea upon which the sun shine the porter who have often hear people speak of the immense wealth of sindbad could not help feeling envious of one whose lot seem to be as happy as he own be miserable cast he eye up to the sky he exclaim aloud : -- consider mighty creator of all thing the difference between sindbad 's life and mine every day i suffer a thousand hardship and misfortune and have hard work to get even enough bad barley bread to keep myself and my family alive while the lucky sindbad spend money right and leave and live upon the fat of the land what have he do that you should give he this pleasant life -- what have i do to deserve so hard a fate so say he stamp upon the ground like one beside himself with misery and despair just at this moment a servant come out of the palace and take he by the arm say come with I the noble sindbad my master wish to speak to you hindbad be not a little surprised at this summons and fear that he unguarded word might have draw upon he the displeasure of sindbad so he try to excuse himself upon the pretext that he could not leave the burden which have be intrust to he in the street however the lackey promise he that it should be take care of and urge he to obey the call so pressingly that at last the porter be oblige to yield he follow the servant into a vast room where a great company be seat round a table cover with all sort of delicacy in the place of honor sit a tall grave man whose long white beard give he a venerable air behind he chair stand a crowd of attendant eager to minister to he want this be the famous sindbad himself the porter more than ever alarm at the sight of so much magnificence tremblingly salute the noble company sindbad make a sign to he to approach cause he to be seat at he right hand and himself heap choice morsel upon he plate and pour out for he a draught of excellent wine and presently when the banquet draw to a close speak to he familiarly ask he name and occupation my lord reply the porter i be call hindbad i be glad to see you here continue sindbad and i will answer for the rest of the company that they be equally pleased but i wish you to tell I what it be that you say just now in the street for sindbad passing by the open window before the feast begin have hear he complaint and therefore have send for he at this question hindbad be cover with confusion and hang down he head reply my lord i confess that overcome by weariness and ill-humor i utter indiscreet word which i pray you to pardon I oh reply sindbad do not imagine that i be so unjust as to blame you on the contrary i understand you situation and can pity you only you appear to be mistaken about I and i wish to set you right you doubtless imagine that i have acquire all the wealth and luxury that you see I enjoy without difficulty or danger but this be far indeed from be the case i have only reach this happy state after have for year suffer every possible kind of toil and danger yes my noble friend he continue address the company i assure you that my adventure have be strange enough to deter even the most avaricious man from seek wealth by traverse the sea since you have perhaps hear but confuse account of my seven voyage and the danger and wonder that i have meet with by sea and land i will now give you a full and true account of they which i think you will be well pleased to hear as sindbad be relate he adventure chiefly on account of the porter he order before begin he tale that the burden which have be leave in the street should be carry by some of he own servant to the place for which hindbad have set out at first while he remain to listen to the story first voyage i have inherit considerable wealth from my parent and be young and foolish i at first squander it recklessly upon every kind of pleasure but presently find that riches speedily take to themselves wing if manage as badly as i be manage mine and remember also that to be old and poor be misery indeed i begin to bethink I of how i could make the best of what still remain to I i sell all my household goods by public auction and join a company of merchant who trade by sea embark with they at balsora in a ship which we have fit out between we we set sail and take we course towards the east indy by the persian gulf have the coast of persium upon we left hand and upon we right the shore of arabium felix i be at first much trouble by the uneasy motion of the vessel but speedily recover my health and since that hour have be no more plague by sea-sickness from time to time we land at various island where we sell or exchange we merchandise and one day when the wind drop suddenly we find ourselves becalm close to a small island like a green meadow which only rise slightly above the surface of the water we sail be furl and the captain give permission to all who wish to land for a while and amuse themselves i be among the number but when after stroll about for some time we light a fire and sit down to enjoy the repast which we have bring with we we be startle by a sudden and violent tremble of the island while at the same moment those leave upon the ship set up a outcry bidding we come on board for we life since what we have take for a island be nothing but the back of a sleep whale those who be nearest to the boat throw themselves into it other spring into the sea but before i could save myself the whale plunge suddenly into the depths of the ocean leave I cling to a piece of the wood which we have bring to make we fire meanwhile a breeze have spring up and in the confusion that ensue on board we vessel in hoist the sail and take up those who be in the boat and cling to its side no one miss I and i be leave at the mercy of the wave all that day i float up and down now beat this way now that and when night fall i despair for my life but weary and spend as i be i clung to my frail support and great be my joy when the morning light show I that i have drift against a island the cliff be high and steep but luckily for I some tree-root protrude in place and by they aid i climb up at last and stretch myself upon the turf at the top where i lay more dead than alive till the sun be high in the heaven by that time i be very hungry but after some search i come upon some eatable herb and a spring of clear water and much refresh i set out to explore the island presently i reach a great plain where a grazing horse be tethered and as i stand look at it i hear voice talk apparently underground and in a moment a man appear who ask I how i come upon the island i tell he my adventure and hear in return that he be one of the groom of mihrage the king of the island and that each year they come to feed they master 's horse in this plain he take I to a cave where he companion be assemble and when i have eat of the food they set before I they bid I think myself fortunate to have come upon they when i do since they be go back to they master on the morrow and without they aid i could certainly never have find my way to the inhabit part of the island early the next morning we accordingly set out and when we reach the capital i be graciously receive by the king to whom i related my adventure upon which he order that i should be well care for and provide with such thing as i need be a merchant i seek out man of my own profession and particularly those who come from foreign country as i hope in this way to hear news from bagdad and find out some means of return thither for the capital be situate upon the sea-shore and visit by vessel from all part of the world in the meantime i hear many curious thing and answer many question concern my own country for i talk willingly with all who come to I also to while away the time of wait i explore a little island name cassel which belong to king mihrage and which be suppose to be inhabit by a spirit name deggial indeed the sailor assure I that often at night the playing of timbal could be hear upon it however i see nothing strange upon my voyage save some fish that be full two hundred cubit long but be fortunately more in dread of we than even we be of they and flee from we if we do but strike upon a board to frighten they other fish there be only a cubit long which have head like owl one day after my return as i go down to the quay i see a ship which have just cast anchor and be discharge she cargo while the merchant to whom it belong be busily direct the removal of it to they warehouse draw nearer i presently notice that my own name be mark upon some of the package and after have carefully examine they i feel sure that they be indeed those which i have put on board we ship at balsora i then recognize the captain of the vessel but as i be certain that he believe I to be dead i go up to he and ask who own the package that i be look at there be on board my ship he reply a merchant of bagdad name sindbad one day he and several of my other passenger land upon what we suppose to be a island but which be really a enormous whale float asleep upon the wave no sooner do it feel upon its back the heat of the fire which have be kindle than it plunge into the depths of the sea several of the people who be upon it perish in the water and among other this unlucky sindbad this merchandise be he but i have resolve to dispose of it for the benefit of he family if i should ever chance to meet with they captain say i i be that sindbad whom you believe to be dead and these be my possession when the captain hear these word he cry out in amazement lackaday and what be the world come to in these day there be not a honest man to be meet with do i not with my own eye see sindbad drown and now you have the audacity to tell I that you be he i should have take you to be a just man and yet for the sake of obtain that which do not belong to you you be ready to invent this horrible falsehood have patience and do I the favor to hear my story say i speak then reply the captain i be all attention so i tell he of my escape and of my fortunate meeting with the king 's groom and how kindly i have be receive at the palace very soon i begin to see that i have make some impression upon he and after the arrival of some of the other merchant who show great joy at once more see I alive he declare that he also recognize I throw himself upon my neck he exclaim heaven be praise that you have escape from so great a danger as to you goods i pray you take they and dispose of they as you please i thank he and praise he honesty beg he to accept several bale of merchandise in token of my gratitude but he would take nothing of the choicest of my goods i prepare a present for king mihrage who be at first amaze have know that i have lose my all however when i have explain to he how my bale have be miraculously restore to I he graciously accept my gift and in return give I many valuable thing i then take leave of he and exchange my merchandise for sandal and aloes-wood camphor nutmeg clove pepper and ginger i embark upon the same vessel and trade so successfully upon we homeward voyage that i arrive in balsora with about one hundred thousand sequin my family receive I with as much joy as i feel upon see they once more i buy land and slave and build a great house in which i resolve to live happily and in the enjoyment of all the pleasure of life to forget my past suffering here sindbad pause and command the musician to play again while the feast continue until evening when the time come for the porter to depart sindbad give he a purse contain one hundred sequin say take this hindbad and go home but to-morrow come again and you shall hear more of my adventure the porter retire quite overcome by so much generosity and you may imagine that he be well receive at home where he wife and child thank they lucky star that he have find such a benefactor the next day hindbad dress in he best return to the voyager 's house and be receive with open arm as soon as all the guest have arrive the banquet begin as before and when they have feast long and merrily sindbad address they thus : -- my friend i beg that you will give I you attention while i relate the adventure of my second voyage which you will find even more astonishing than the first second voyage i have resolve as you know on my return from my first voyage to spend the rest of my day quietly in bagdad but very soon i grow tired of such a idle life and long once more to find myself upon the sea i procured therefore such goods as be suitable for the place i intend to visit and embark for the second time in a good ship with other merchant whom i know to be honorable man we go from island to island often make excellent bargain until one day we land at a spot which though cover with fruit-tree and abound in spring of excellent water appear to possess neither house nor people while my companion wander here and there gather flower and fruit i sit down in a shady place and have heartily enjoy the provision and the wine i have bring with I i fall asleep lull by the murmur of a clear brook which flow close by how long i sleep i know not but when i open my eye and start to my foot i perceive with horror that i be alone and that the ship be go i rush to and fro like one distract utter cry of despair and when from the shore i see the vessel under full sail just disappear upon the horizon i wish bitterly enough that i have be content to stay at home in safety but since wish could do I no good i presently take courage and look about I for a means of escape when i have climb a tall tree i first of all direct my anxious glance towards the sea but find nothing hopeful there i turn landward and my curiosity be excite by a huge dazzling white object so far off that i could not make out what it might be descend from the tree i hastily collect what remain of my provision and set off as fast as i could go towards it as i draw near it seem to I to be a white ball of immense size and height and when i could touch it i find it marvellously smooth and soft as it be impossible to climb it -- for it present no foothold -- i walk round about it seek some opening but there be none i count however that it be at least fifty pace round by this time the sun be near setting but quite suddenly it fall dark something like a huge black cloud come swiftly over I and i see with amazement that it be a bird of extraordinary size which be hover near then i remember that i have often hear the sailor speak of a wonderful bird call a roc and it occur to I that the white object which have so puzzle I must be its egg sure enough the bird settle slowly down upon it cover it with its wing to keep it warm and i cower close beside the egg in such a position that one of the bird 's foot which be as large as the trunk of a tree be just in front of I take off my turban i bind myself securely to it with the linen in the hope that the roc when it take flight next morning would bear I away with it from the desolate island and this be precisely what do happen as soon as the dawn appear the bird rise into the air carry I up and up till i could no longer see the earth and then suddenly it descend so swiftly that i almost lose consciousness when i become aware that the roc have settle and that i be once again upon solid ground i hastily unbound my turban from its foot and free myself and that not a moment too soon for the bird pounce upon a huge snake kill it with a few blow from its powerful beak and seize it rise up into the air once more and soon disappear from my view when i have look about I i begin to doubt if i have gain anything by quit the desolate island the valley in which i find myself be deep and narrow and surround by mountain which tower into the cloud and be so steep and rocky that there be no way of climb up they side as i wandered about seek anxiously for some means of escape from this trap i observe that the ground be strew with diamond some of they of a astonishing size this sight give I great pleasure but my delight be speedily dampen when i saw also number of horrible snake so long and so large that the smallest of they could have swallow a elephant with ease fortunately for I they seem to hide in cavern of the rock by day and only come out by night probably because of they enemy the roc all day long i wander up and down the valley and when it grow dusk i creep into a little cave and have block up the entrance to it with a stone i eat part of my little store of food and lay down to sleep but all through the night the serpent crawl to and fro hissing horribly so that i could scarcely close my eye for terror i be thankful when the morning light appear and when i judge by the silence that the serpent have retreat to they den i come tremblingly out of my cave and wander up and down the valley once more kick the diamond contemptuously out of my path for i feel that they be indeed vain thing to a man in my situation at last overcome with weariness i sit down upon a rock but i have hardly close my eye when i be startle by something which fall to the ground with a thud close beside I it be a huge piece of fresh meat and as i stare at it several more piece roll over the cliff in different place i have always think that the story the sailor tell of the famous valley of diamond and of the cunning way which some merchant have devise for get at the precious stone be mere traveller ' tale invent to give pleasure to the hearer but now i perceive that they be surely true these merchant come to the valley at the time when the eagle which keep they eyrie in the rock have hatch they young the merchant then throw great lump of meat into the valley these fall with so much force upon the diamond be sure to take up some of the precious stone with they when the eagle pounce upon the meat and carry it off to they nest to feed they hungry brood then the merchant scare away the parent bird with shout and outcry would secure they treasure until this moment i have look upon the valley as my grave for i have see no possibility of get out of it alive but now i take courage and begin to devise a means of escape i begin by pick up all the largest diamond i could find and store they carefully in the leathern wallet which have hold my provision this i tie securely to my belt i then choose the piece of meat which seem most suit to my purpose and with the aid of my turban bind it firmly to my back this do i lay down upon my face and await the come of the eagle i soon hear the flap of they mighty wing above I and have the satisfaction of feel one of they seize upon my piece of meat and I with it and rise slowly towards he nest into which he presently drop I luckily for I the merchant be on the watch and set up they usual outcry they rush to the nest scare away the eagle they amazement be great when they discover I and also they disappointment and with one accord they fall to abuse I for have rob they of they usual profit address myself to the one who seem most aggrieved i say : -- i be sure if you know all that i have suffer you would show more kindness towards I and as for diamond i have enough here of the very best for you and I and all you company so say i show they to he the other all crowd around I wonder at my adventure and admire the device by which i have escape from the valley and when they have lead I to they camp and examine my diamond they assure I that in all the year that they have carry on they trade they have see no stone to be compare with they for size and beauty i find that each merchant choose a particular nest and take he chance of what he might find in it so i begged the one who own the nest to which i have be carry to take as much as he would of my treasure but he contented himself with one stone and that by no mean the largest assure I that with such a gem he fortune be make and he need toil no more i stay with the merchant several day and then as they be journey homewards i gladly accompany they we way lay across high mountain infested with frightful serpent but we have the good luck to escape they and come at last to the seashore thence we sail to the isle of roha where the camphor-tree grow to such a size that a hundred man could shelter under one of they with ease the sap flow from a incision make high up in the tree into a vessel hang there to receive it and soon harden into the substance call camphor but the tree itself wither up and die when it have be so treat in this same island we see the rhinoceros a animal which be smaller than the elephant and larger than the buffalo it have one horn about a cubit long which be solid but have a furrow from the base to the tip upon it be trace in white line the figure of a man the rhinoceros fight with the elephant and transfix he with he horn carry he off upon he head but become blind with the blood of he enemy he fall helpless to the ground and then come the roc and clutch they both up in he talon and take they to feed he young this doubtless astonish you but if you do not believe my tale go to roha and see for yourself for fear of weary you i pass over in silence many other wonderful thing which we see in this island before we leave i exchange one of my diamond for much goodly merchandise by which i profit greatly on we homeward way at last we reach balsora whence i hasten to bagdad where my first action be to bestow large sum of money upon the poor after which i settle down to enjoy tranquilly the riches i have gain with so much toil and pain have thus related the adventure of he second voyage sindbad again bestow a hundred sequin upon hindbad invite he to come again on the follow day and hear how he fare upon he third voyage the other guest also depart to they home but all return at the same hour next day include the porter whose former life of hard work and poverty have already begin to seem to he like a bad dream again after the feast be over do sindbad claim the attention of he guest and begin the account of he third voyage third voyage after a very short time the pleasant easy life i lead make I quite forget the peril of my two voyage moreover as i be still in the prime of life it please I better to be up and do so once more provide myself with the rarest and choicest merchandise of bagdad i conveyed it to balsora and set sail with other merchant of my acquaintance for distant land we have touch at many port and make much profit when one day upon the open sea we be catch by a terrible wind which blow we completely out of we reckoning and last for several day finally drive we into harbor on a strange island i would rather have come to anchor anywhere than here quoth we captain this island and all adjoining it be inhabit by hairy savage who be certain to attack we and whatever these dwarf may do we dare not resist since they swarm like locust and if one of they be kill the rest will fall upon we and speedily make a end of we these word cause great consternation among all the ship 's company and only too soon we be to find out that the captain speak truly there appear a vast multitude of hideous savage not more than two foot high and cover with reddish fur throw themselves into the wave they surround we vessel chatter meanwhile in a language we could not understand and clutch at rope and gangway they swarm up the ship 's side with such speed and agility that they almost seem to fly you may imagine the rage and terror that seize we as we watch they neither daring to hinder they nor able to speak a word to deter they from they purpose whatever it might be of this we be not leave long in doubt hoist the sail and cut the cable of the anchor they sail we vessel to a island which lay a little further off where they drive we ashore then take possession of she they make off to the place from which they have come leave we helpless upon a shore avoid with horror by all mariner for a reason which you will soon learn turn away from the sea we wander miserably inland find as we go various herb and fruit which we eat feeling that we might as well live as long as possible though we have no hope of escape presently we see in the far distance what seem to we to be a splendid palace towards which we turn we weary step but when we reach it we see that it be a castle lofty and strongly build push back the heavy ebony door we enter the courtyard but upon the threshold of the great hall beyond it we pause freeze with horror at the sight which greet we on one side lay a huge pile of bone -- human bone and on the other numberless spit for roast overcome with despair we sink tremble to the ground and lay there without speech or motion the sun be set when a loud noise arouse we the door of the hall be violently burst open and a horrible giant enter he be as tall as a palm tree and perfectly black and have one eye which flame like a burning coal in the middle of he forehead he tooth be long and sharp and grin horribly while he lower lip hang down upon he chest and he have ear like elephant 's ear which cover he shoulder and nail like the claw of some fierce bird at this terrible sight we sens leave we and we lay like dead man when at last we come to ourselves the giant sit examine we attentively with he fearful eye presently when he have look at we enough he come towards we and stretch out he hand take I by the back of the neck turn I this way and that but feel that i be mere skin and bone he set I down again and go on to the next whom he treat in the same fashion at last he come to the captain and find he the fattest of we all he take he up in one hand and stick he upon a spit and proceed to kindle a huge fire at which he presently roasted he after the giant have sup he lay down to sleep snore like the loudest thunder while we lay shiver with horror the whole night through and when day break he awake and go out leave we in the castle when we believe he to be really go we start up bemoan we horrible fate until the hall echo with we despairing cry though we be many and we enemy be alone it do not occur to we to kill he and indeed we should have find that a hard task even if we have think of it and no plan could we devise to deliver ourselves so at last submit to we sad fate we spend the day in wander up and down the island eat such fruit as we could find and when night come we return to the castle have seek in vain for any other place of shelter at sunset the giant return sup upon one of we unhappy comrade sleep and snore till dawn and then leave we as before we condition seem to we so frightful that several of my companion think it would be better to leap from the cliff and perish in the wave at once rather than await so miserable a end but i have a plan of escape which i now unfold to they and which they at once agree to attempt listen my brother i add you know that plenty of driftwood lie along the shore let we make several raft and carry they to a suitable place if we plot succeed we can wait patiently for the chance of some pass ship which would rescue we from this fatal island if it fail we must quickly take to we raft frail as they be we have more chance of save we life with they than we have if we remain here all agree with I and we spend the day in building raft each capable of carry three person at nightfall we return to the castle and very soon in come the giant and one more of we number be sacrifice but the time of we vengeance be at hand as soon as he have finish he horrible repast he lay down to sleep as before and when we hear he begin to snore i and nine of the boldest of my comrade rise softly and take each a spit which we make red-hot in the fire and then at a give signal we plunge it with one accord into the giant 's eye completely blind he utter a terrible cry he spring to he foot clutch in all direction to try to seize one of we but we have all flee different way as soon as the deed be do and throw ourselves flat upon the ground in corner where he be not likely to touch we with he foot after a vain search he fumble about till he find the door and flee out of it howling frightfully as for we when he be go we make haste to leave the fatal castle and station ourselves beside we raft we wait to see what would happen we idea be that if when the sun rise we see nothing of the giant and no longer hear he howl which still come faintly through the darkness grow more and more distant we should conclude that he be dead and that we might safely stay upon the island and need not risk we life upon the frail raft but alas morning light show we we enemy approach we support on either hand by two giant nearly as large and fearful as himself while a crowd of other follow close upon they heel hesitate no longer we clamber upon we raft and row with all we might out to sea the giant see they prey escape they seize up huge piece of rock and wade into the water hurl they after we with such good aim that all the raft except the one i be upon be swamp and they luckless crew drown without we be able to do anything to help they indeed i and my two companion have all we could do to keep we own raft beyond the reach of the giant but by dint of hard rowing we at last gain the open sea here we be at the mercy of the wind and wave which toss we to and fro all that day and night but the next morning we find ourselves near a island upon which we gladly land there we find delicious fruit and have satisfy we hunger we presently lay down to rest upon the shore suddenly we be arouse by a loud rustling noise and start up saw that it be cause by a immense snake which be glide towards we over the sand so swiftly it come that it have seize one of my comrade before he have time to fly and in spite of he cry and struggle speedily crush the life out of he in its mighty coil and proceed to swallow he by this time my other companion and i be run for we life to some place where we might hope to be safe from this new horror and see a tall tree we climb up into it have first provide ourselves with a store of fruit off the surround bush when night come i fall asleep but only to be awaken once more by the terrible snake which after hiss horribly round the tree at last rear itself up against it and find my sleep comrade who be perch just below I it swallow he also and crawl away leave I half dead with terror when the sun rise i creep down from the tree with hardly a hope of escape the dreadful fate which have overtake my comrade but life be sweet and i determine to do all i could to save myself all day long i toil with frantic haste and collect quantity of dry brushwood reed and thorn which i bind with fagot and make a circle of they under my tree i pile they firmly one upon another until i have a kind of tent in which i crouch like a mouse in a hole when she see the cat come you may imagine what a fearful night i pass for the snake return eager to devour I and glide round and round my frail shelter seek a entrance every moment i fear that it would succeed in push aside some of the fagot but happily for I they hold together and when it grow light my enemy retire baffle and hungry to he den as for I i be more dead than alive shake with fright and half suffocate by the poisonous breath of the monster i come out of my tent and crawl down to the sea feeling that it would be better to plunge from the cliff and end my life at once than pass such another night of horror but to my joy and relief i see a ship sailing by and by shout wildly and wave my turban i manage to attract the attention of she crew a boat be send to rescue I and very soon i find myself on board surround by a wonder crowd of sailor and merchant eager to know by what chance i find myself in that desolate island after i have tell my story they regale I with the choicest food the ship afford and the captain see that i be in rag generously bestow upon I one of he own coat after sail about for some time and touch at many port we come at last to the island of salahat where sandal-wood grow in great abundance here we anchor and as i stand watch the merchant disembark they goods and prepare to sell or exchange they the captain come up to I and say : -- i have here brother some merchandise belong to a passenger of mine who be dead will you do I the favor to trade with it and when i meet with he heir i shall be able to give they the money though it will be only just that you shall have a portion for you trouble i consent gladly for i do not like standing by idle whereupon he point the bale out to I and send for the person whose duty it be to keep a list of the goods that be upon the ship when this man come he ask in what name the merchandise be to be register in the name of sindbad the sailor reply the captain at this i be greatly surprised but look carefully at he i recognize he to be the captain of the ship upon which i have make my second voyage though he have alter much since that time as for he believe I to be dead it be no wonder that he have not recognize I so captain say i the merchant who own those bale be call sindbad yes he reply he be so name he belong to bagdad and join my ship at balsora but by mischance he be leave behind upon a desert island where we have land to fill up we water-cask and it be not until four hour later that he be miss by that time the wind have freshen and it be impossible to put back for he you suppose he to have perish then say i alas yes he answer why captain i cry look well at I i be that sindbad who fall asleep upon the island and awake to find himself abandon the captain stare at I in amazement but be presently convince that i be indeed speak the truth and rejoice greatly at my escape i be glad to have that piece of carelessness off my conscience at any rate say he now take you goods and the profit i have make for you upon they and may you prosper in future i take they gratefully and as we go from one island to another i lay in store of clove cinnamon and other spice in one place i see a tortoise which be twenty cubit long and as many broad also a fish that be like a cow and have skin so thick that it be use to make shield another i see that be like a camel in shape and color so by degree we come back to balsora and i return to bagdad with so much money that i could not myself count it besides treasure without end i give largely to the poor and buy much land to add to what i already possess and thus end my third voyage when sindbad have finish he story he give another hundred sequin to hindbad who then depart with the other guest but next day when they have all reassemble and the banquet be end they host continue he adventure fourth voyage rich and happy as i be after my third voyage i could not make up my mind to stay at home altogether my love of trading and the pleasure i take in anything that be new and strange make I set my affair in order and begin my journey through some of the persian province have first send off store of goods to await my come in the different place i intend to visit i take ship at a distant seaport and for some time all go well but at last be catch in a violent hurricane we vessel become a total wreck in spite of all we worthy captain could do to save she and many of we company perish in the wave i with a few other have the good fortune to be wash ashore cling to piece of the wreck for the storm have drive we near a island and scramble up beyond the reach of the wave we throw ourselves down quite exhaust to wait for morning at daylight we wander inland and soon see some hut to which we direct we step as we draw near they black inhabitant swarm out in great number and surround we and we be lead to they house and as it be divide among we captor i with five other be take into a hut where we be make to sit upon the ground and certain herb be give to we which the black make sign to we to eat observe that they themselves do not touch they i be careful only to pretend to taste my portion but my companion be very hungry rashly eat up all that be set before they and very soon i have the horror of see they become perfectly mad though they chatter incessantly i could not understand a word they say nor do they heed when i speak to they the savage now produce large bowl full of rice prepare with cocoanut oil of which my crazy comrade eat eagerly but i only taste a few grain understand clearly that the object of we captor be to fatten we speedily for they own eating and this be exactly what happen my unlucky companion have lose they reason feel neither anxiety nor fear and eat greedily all that be offer they so they be soon fat and there be a end of they but i grow leaner day by day for i eat but little and even that little do I no good by reason of my fear of what lay before I however as i be so far from be a tempting morsel i be allow to wander about freely and one day when all the black have go off upon some expedition leave only a old man to guard I i manage to escape from he and plunge into the forest run faster the more he cry to I to come back until i have completely distance he for seven day i hurry on rest only when the darkness stop I and live chiefly upon cocoanut which afford I both meat and drink and on the eighth day i reach the sea-shore and see a party of white man gather pepper which grow abundantly all about reassure by the nature of they occupation i advance towards they and they greet I in arabic ask who i be and whence i come my delight be great on hear this familiar speech and i willingly satisfy they curiosity tell they how i have be shipwreck and capture by the black but these savage devour man say they how do you escape i repeat to they what i have just tell you at which they be mightily astonished i stay with they until they have collect as much pepper as they wish and then they take I back to they own country and present I to they king by whom i be hospitably receive to he also i have to relate my adventure which surprise he much and when i have finish he order that i should be supply with food and raiment and treat with consideration the island on which i find myself be full of people and abound in all sort of desirable thing and a great deal of traffic go on in the capital where i soon begin to feel at home and contented moreover the king treat I with special favor and in consequence of this everyone whether at the court or in the town seek to make life pleasant to I one thing i remark which i think very strange this be that from the greatest to the least all man ride they horse without bridle or stirrup i one day presume to ask he majesty why he do not use they to which he reply you speak to I of thing of which i have never before hear this give I a idea i find a clever workman and make he cut out under my direction the foundation of a saddle which i wadded and cover with choice leather adorning it with rich gold embroidery i then get a locksmith to make I a bit and a pair of spur after a pattern that i draw for he and when all these thing be complete i present they to the king and show he how to use they when i have saddle one of he horse he mount it and ride about quite delighted with the novelty and to show he gratitude he reward I with large gift after this i have to make saddle for all the principal officer of the king 's household and as they all give I rich present i soon become very wealthy and quite a important person in the city one day the king send for I and say sindbad i be go to ask a favor of you both i and my subject esteem you and wish you to end you day amongst we therefore i desire that you will marry a rich and beautiful lady whom i will find for you and think no more of you own country as the king 's will be law i accept the charming bride he present to I and live happily with she nevertheless i have every intention of escape at the first opportunity and go back to bagdad thing be thus go prosperously with I when it happen that the wife of one of my neighbor with whom i have strike up quite a friendship fall ill and presently die i go to he house to offer my consolation and find he in the depths of woe heaven preserve you say i and send you a long life alas he reply what be the good of say that when i have but a hour leave to live come come say i surely it be not so bad as all that i trust that you may be spare to I for many year i hope answer he that you life may be long but as for I all be finish i have set my house in order and to-day i shall be bury with my wife this have be the law upon we island from the earliest age -- the living husband go to the grave with he dead wife the living wife with she dead husband so do we father and so must we do the law change not and all must submit to it as he speak the friend and relation of the unhappy pair begin to assemble the body deck in rich robe and sparkling with jewel be lay upon a open bier and the procession start take its way to a high mountain at some distance from the city the wretched husband clothe from head to foot in a black mantle follow mournfully when the place of interment be reach the corpse be lower just as it be into a deep pit then the husband bidding farewell to all he friend stretch himself upon another bier upon which be lay seven little loaf of bread and a pitcher of water and he also be let down-down-down to the depths of the horrible cavern and then a stone be lay over the opening and the melancholy company wend its way back to the city you may imagine that i be no unmoved spectator of these proceedings to all the other it be a thing to which they have be accustom from they youth up but i be so horrify that i could not help tell the king how it strike I sire i say i be more astonished than i can express to you at the strange custom which exist in you dominion of bury the living with the dead in all my travels i have never before meet with so cruel and horrible a law what would you have sindbad he reply it be the law for everybody i myself should be bury with the queen if she be the first to die but you majesty say i dare i ask if this law apply to foreigner also why yes reply the king smile in what i could but consider a very heartless manner : they be no exception to the rule if they have marry in the country when i hear this i go home much cast down and from that time forward my mind be never easy if only my wife 's little finger ache i fancy she be go to die and sure enough before very long she fall really ill and in a few day breathe she last my dismay be great for it seem to I that to be bury alive be even a worse fate than to be devour by cannibal nevertheless there be no escape the body of my wife array in she richest robe and deck with all she jewel be lay upon the bier i follow it and after I come a great procession head by the king and all he noble and in this order we reach the fatal mountain which be one of a lofty chain border the sea here i make one more frantic effort to excite the pity of the king and those who stand by hope to save myself even at this last moment but it be of no avail no one speak to I they even appear to hasten over they dreadful task and i speedily find myself descend into the gloomy pit with my seven loaf and pitcher of water beside I almost before i reach the bottom the stone be roll into its place above my head and i be leave to my fate a feeble ray of light shone into the cavern through some chink and when i have the courage to look about I i could see that i be in a vast vault bestrewn with bone and body of the dead i even fancy that i hear the expire sigh of those who like myself have come into this dismal place alive all in vain do i shriek aloud with rage and despair reproach myself for the love of gain and adventure which have bring I to such a pass but at length grow calmer i take up my bread and water and wrap my face in my mantle i groped my way towards the end of the cavern where the air be fresher here i live in darkness and misery until my provision be exhaust but just as i be nearly dead from starvation the rock be roll away overhead and i see that a bier be be lower into the cavern and that the corpse upon it be a man in a moment my mind be make up the woman who follow have nothing to expect but a linger death i should be do she a service if i shorten she misery therefore when she descend already insensible from terror i be ready arm with a huge bone one blow from which leave she dead and i secure the bread and water which give I a hope of life several time do i have recourse to this desperate expedient and i know not how long i have be a prisoner when one day i fancy that i hear something near I which breathe loudly turn to the place from which the sound come i dimly see a shadowy form which flee at my movement squeeze itself through a cranny in the wall i pursue it as fast as i could and find myself in a narrow crack among the rock along which i be just able to force my way i follow it for what seem to I many mile and at last saw before I a glimmer of light which grow clearer every moment until i emerge upon the sea-shore with a joy which i can not describe when i be sure that i be not dream i realize that it be doubtless some little animal which have find its way into the cavern from the sea and when disturb have flee show I a means of escape which i could never have discover for myself i hastily survey my surroundings and see that i be safe from all pursuit from the town the mountain slope sheer down to the sea and there be no road across they be assure of this i return to the cavern and amass a rich treasure of diamond ruby emerald and jewel of all kind which strew the ground these i make up into bale and store they into a safe place upon the beach and then wait hopefully for the passing of a ship i have look out for two day however before a single sail appear so it be with much delight that i at last see a vessel not very far from the shore and by wave my arm and utter loud cry succeed in attract the attention of she crew a boat be send off to I and in answer to the question of the sailor as to how i come to be in such a plight i reply that i have be shipwreck two day before but have manage to scramble ashore with the bale which i point out to they luckily for I they believe my story and without even look at the place where they find I take up my bundle and row I back to the ship once on board i soon see that the captain be too much occupy with the difficulty of navigation to pay much heed to I though he generously make I welcome and would not even accept the jewel with which i offer to pay my passage we voyage be prosperous and after visit many land and collect in each place great store of goodly merchandise i find myself at last in bagdad once more with unheard-of riches of every description again i give large sum of money to the poor and enriched all the mosque in the city after which i give myself up to my friend and relation with whom i pass my time in feast and merriment here sindbad pause and all he hearer declare that the adventure of he fourth voyage have please they better than anything they have hear before they then take they leave follow by hindbad who have once more receive a hundred sequin and with the rest have be bid to return next day for the story of the fifth voyage when the time come all be in they place and when they have eat and drunk of all that be set before they sindbad begin he tale fifth voyage not even all that i have go through could make I contented with a quiet life i soon wearied of its pleasure and long for change and adventure therefore i set out once more but this time in a ship of my own which i build and fit out at the nearest seaport i wish to be able to call at whatever port i choose take my own time but as i do not intend carry enough goods for a full cargo i invite several merchant of different nation to join I we set sail with the first favorable wind and after a long voyage upon the open sea we land upon a unknown island which prove to be uninhabited we determine however to explore it but have not go far when we find a roc 's egg as large as the one i have see before and evidently very nearly hatch for the beak of the young bird have already pierce the shell in spite of all i could say to deter they the merchant who be with I fall upon it with they hatchet break the shell and kill the young roc then light a fire upon the ground they hack morsel from the bird and proceed to roast they while i stand by aghast scarcely have they finish they ill-omened repast when the air above we be darken by two mighty shadow the captain of my ship know by experience what this mean cry out to we that the parent bird be come and urge we to get on board with all speed this we do and the sail be hoist but before we have make any way the roc reach they despoil nest and hover about it utter frightful cry when they discover the mangled remains of they young one for a moment we lose sight of they and be flattering ourselves that we have escape when they reappear and soar into the air directly over we vessel and we see that each hold in its claw a immense rock ready to crush we there be a moment of breathless suspense then one bird loose its hold and the huge block of stone hurtle through the air but thanks to the presence of mind of the helmsman who turn we ship violently in another direction it fall into the sea close beside we cleave it asunder till we could nearly see the bottom we have hardly time to draw a breath of relief before the other rock fall with a mighty crash right in the midst of we luckless vessel smash it into a thousand fragment and crush or hurl into the sea passenger and crew i myself go down with the rest but have the good fortune to rise unhurt and by hold on to a piece of driftwood with one hand and swimming with the other i keep myself afloat and be presently wash up by the tide on to a island its shore be steep and rocky but i scramble up safely and throw myself down to rest upon the green turf when i have somewhat recover i begin to examine the spot in which i find myself and truly it seem to I that i have reach a garden of delight there be tree everywhere and they be laden with flower and fruit while a crystal stream wander in and out under they shadow when night come i sleep sweetly in a cosey nook though the remembrance that i be alone in a strange land make I sometimes start up and look around I in alarm and then i wish heartily that i have stay at home at ease however the morning sunlight restore my courage and i once more wander among the tree but always with some anxiety as to what i might see next i have penetrate some distance into the island when i see a old man bent and feeble sit upon the river bank and at first i take he to be some shipwrecked mariner like myself go up to he i greet he in a friendly way but he only nod he head at I in reply i then ask what he do there and he make sign to I that he wish to get across the river to gather some fruit and seem to beg I to carry he on my back pity he age and feebleness i take he up and wade across the stream i bent down that he might more easily reach the bank and bid he get down but instead of allow himself to be set upon he foot -lrb- even now it make I laugh to think of it -rrb- this creature who have seem to I so decrepit leap nimbly upon my shoulder and hook he leg round my neck grip I so tightly that i be well-nigh choke and so overcome with terror that i fall insensible to the ground when i recover my enemy be still in he place though he have release he hold enough to allow I breathe space and see I revive he prod I adroitly first with one foot and then with the other until i be force to get up and stagger about with he under the tree while he gather and eat the choicest fruit this go on all day and even at night when i throw myself down half dead with weariness the terrible old man hold on tight to my neck nor do he fail to greet the first glimmer of morning light by drum upon I with he heel until i perforce awake and resume my dreary march with rage and bitterness in my heart it happen one day that i pass a tree under which lay several dry gourd and catch one up i amuse myself with scoop out its contents and press into it the juice of several bunch of grape which hang from every bush when it be full i leave it prop in the fork of a tree and a few day later carry the hateful old man that way i snatch at my gourd as i pass it and have the satisfaction of a draught of excellent wine so good and refreshing that i even forget my detestable burden and begin to sing and caper the old monster be not slow to perceive the effect which my draught have produce and that i carry he more lightly than usual so he stretch out he skinny hand and seize the gourd first taste its contents cautiously then drain they to the very last drop the wine be strong and the gourd capacious so he also begin to sing after a fashion and soon i have the delight of feel the iron grip of he goblin leg unclasp and with one vigorous effort i throw he to the ground from which he never move again i be so rejoice to have at last get rid of this uncanny old man that i run leap and bound down to the sea-shore where by the greatest good luck i meet with some mariner who have anchor off the island to enjoy the delicious fruit and to renew they supply of water they hear the story of my escape with amazement say you fall into the hand of the old man of the sea and it be a mercy that he do not strangle you as he have everyone else upon whose shoulder he have manage to perch himself this island be well-known as the scene of he evil deed and no merchant or sailor who land upon it care to stray far away from he comrade after we have talk for awhile they take I back with they on board they ship where the captain receive I kindly and we soon set sail and after several day reach a large and prosperous-looking town where all the house be build of stone here we anchor and one of the merchant who have be very friendly to I on the way take I ashore with he and show I a lodging set apart for strange merchant he then provide I with a large sack and point out to I a party of other equip in like manner go with they say he and do as they do but beware of lose sight of they for if you stray you life would be in danger with that he supply I with provision and bid I farewell and i set out with my new companion i soon learn that the object of we expedition be to fill we sack with cocoa-nut but when at length i see the tree and note they immense height and the slippery smoothness of they slender trunk i do not at all understand how we be to do it the crown of the cocoa-palm be all alive with monkey big and little which skip from one to the other with surprising agility seem to be curious about we and disturb at we appearance and i be at first surprised when my companion after collect stone begin to throw they at the lively creature which seem to I quite harmless but very soon i see the reason of it and join they heartily for the monkey annoy and wish to pay we back in we own coin begin to tear the nut from the tree and cast they at we with angry and spiteful gesture so that after very little labor we sack be fill with the fruit which we could not otherwise have obtain as soon as we have as many as we could carry we go back to the town where my friend buy my share and advise I to continue the same occupation until i have earn money enough to carry I to my own country this i do and before long have amass a considerable sum just then i hear that there be a trading ship ready to sail and take leave of my friend i go on board carry with I a goodly store of cocoanut and we sail first to the island where pepper grow then to comari where the best aloes-wood be find and where man drink no wine by a unalterable law here i exchange my nut for pepper and good aloes-wood and go a-fishing for pearl with some of the other merchant and my diver be so lucky that very soon i have a immense number and those very large and perfect with all these treasure i come joyfully back to bagdad where i dispose of they for large sum of money of which i do not fail as before to give the tenth part to the poor and after that i rest from my labor and comfort myself with all the pleasure that my riches could give I have thus end he story sindbad order that one hundred sequin should be give to hindbad and the guest then withdraw but after the next day 's feast he begin the account of he sixth voyage as follow sixth voyage it must be a marvel to you how after have five time meet with shipwreck and unheard-of peril i could again tempt fortune and risk fresh trouble i be even surprised myself when i look back but evidently it be my fate to reeve and after a year of repose i prepare to make a sixth voyage regardless of the entreaty of my friend and relation who do all they could to keep I at home instead of go by the persian gulf i travel a considerable way overland and finally embark from a distant indian port with a captain who mean to make a long voyage and truly he do so for we fall in with stormy weather which drive we completely out of we course so that for many day neither captain nor pilot know where we be nor where we be go when they do at last discover we position we have small ground for rejoice for the captain cast he turban upon the deck and tear he beard declare that we be in the most dangerous spot upon the whole wide sea and have be catch by a current which be at that moment sweep we to destruction it be too true in spite of all the sailor could do we be drive with frightful rapidity towards the foot of a mountain which rise sheer out of the sea and we vessel be dash to piece upon the rock at its base not however until we have manage to scramble on shore carry with we the most precious of we possession when we have do this the captain say to we : -- now we be here we may as well begin to dig we grave at once since from this fatal spot no shipwrecked mariner have ever return this speech discourage we much and we begin to lament over we sad fate the mountain form the seaward boundary of a large island and the narrow strip of rocky shore upon which we stand be strew with the wreckage of a thousand gallant ship while the bone of the luckless mariner shine white in the sunshine and we shudder to think how soon we own would be add to the heap all around too lay vast quantity of the costliest merchandise and treasure be heap in every cranny of the rock but all these thing only add to the desolation of the scene it strike I as a very strange thing that a river of clear fresh water which gush out from the mountain not far from where we stand instead of flow into the sea as river generally do turn off sharply and flow out of sight under a natural archway of rock and when i go to examine it more closely i find that inside the cave the wall be thick with diamond ruby and mass of crystal and the floor be strew with ambergris here then upon this desolate shore we abandon ourselves to we fate for there be no possibility of scale the mountain and if a ship have appear it could only have share we doom the first thing we captain do be to divide equally amongst we all the food we possess and then the length of each man 's life depend on the time he could make he portion last i myself could live upon very little nevertheless by the time i have bury the last of my companion my stock of provision be so small that i hardly think i should live long enough to dig my own grave which i set about do while i regret bitterly the rove disposition which be always bring I into such strait and think longingly of all the comfort and luxury that i have leave but luckily for I the fancy take I to stand once more beside the river where it plunge out of sight in the depths of the cavern and as i do so a idea strike I this river which hide itself underground doubtless emerge again at some distant spot why should i not build a raft and trust myself to its swiftly flow water if i perished before i could reach the light of day once more i should be no worse off than i be now for death stare I in the face while there be always the possibility that as i be bear under a lucky star i might find myself safe and sound in some desirable land i decide at any rate to risk it and speedily build myself a stout raft of drift-wood with strong cord of which enough and to spare lay strew upon the beach i then make up many package of ruby emerald rock crystal ambergris and precious stuff and bind they upon my raft be careful to preserve the balance and then i seat myself upon it have two small oar that i have fashion lay ready to my hand and loose the cord which hold it to the bank once out in the current my raft fly swiftly under the gloomy archway and i find myself in total darkness carry smoothly forward by the rapid river on i go as it seem to I for many night and day once the channel become so small that i have a narrow escape of be crush against the rocky roof and after that i take the precaution of lie flat upon my precious bale though i only eat what be absolutely necessary to keep myself alive the inevitable moment come when after swallow my last morsel of food i begin to wonder if i must after all die of hunger then wear out with anxiety and fatigue i fall into a deep sleep and when i again open my eye i be once more in the light of day a beautiful country lay before I and my raft which be tie to the river bank be surround by friendly look black man i rise and salute they and they speak to I in return but i could not understand a word of they language feel perfectly bewildered by my sudden return to life and light i murmured to myself in arabic close thine eye and while thou sleepest heaven will change thy fortune from evil to good one of the native who understand this tongue then come forward say : -- my brother be not surprise to see we this be we land and as we come to get water from the river we notice you raft float down it and one of we swim out and bring you to the shore we have wait for you awakening tell we now whence you come and where you be go by that dangerous way i reply that nothing would please I better than to tell they but that i be starve and would fain eat something first i be soon supply with all i need and have satisfy my hunger i tell they faithfully all that have befall I they be lose in wonder at my tale when it be interpret to they and say that adventure so surprising must be relate to they king only by the man to whom they have happen so procure a horse they mount I upon it and we set out follow by several strong man carry my raft just as it be upon they shoulder in this order we march into the city of serendib where the native present I to they king whom i saluted in the indian fashion prostrate myself at he foot and kiss the ground but the monarch bid I rise and sit beside he ask first what be my name i be sindbad i reply whom man call ` the sailor ' for i have voyage much upon many sea and how come you here ask the king i tell my story conceal nothing and he surprise and delight be so great that he order my adventure to be write in letter of gold and lay up in the archive of he kingdom presently my raft be bring in and the bale open in he presence and the king declare that in all he treasury there be no such ruby and emerald as those which lay in great heap before he see that he look at they with interest i venture to say that i myself and all that i have be at he disposal but he answer I smile : -- nay sindbad heaven forbid that i should covet you riches i will rather add to they for i desire that you shall not leave my kingdom without some token of my good-will he then command he officer to provide I with a suitable lodging at he expense and send slave to wait upon I and carry my raft and my bale to my new dwelling-place you may imagine that i praise he generosity and give he grateful thanks nor do i fail to present myself daily in he audience-chamber and for the rest of my time i amuse myself in see all that be most worthy of attention in the city the island of serendib be situate on the equinoctial line the day and night there be of equal length the chief city be place at the end of a beautiful valley form by the highest mountain in the world which be in the middle of the island i have the curiosity to ascend to its very summit for this be the place to which adam be banish out of paradise here be find ruby and many precious thing and rare plant grow abundantly with cedar-tree and cocoa-palm on the sea-shore and at the mouth of the river the diver seek for pearl and in some valley diamond be plentiful after many day i petition the king that i might return to my own country to which he graciously consent moreover he load I with rich gift and when i go to take leave of he he intrust I with a royal present and a letter to the commander of the faithful we sovereign lord say i pray you give these to the caliph

with pirate who seize we vessel kill all who resist and make prisoner of those who be prudent enough to submit at once of whom i be one when they have despoil we of all we possess they force we to put on vile raiment and sailing to a distant island there sell we for slave i fall into the hand of a rich merchant who take I home with he and clothe and feed I well and after some day send for I and question I as to what i could do i answer that i be a rich merchant who have be capture by pirate and therefore i know no trade tell I say he can you shoot with a bow i reply that this have be one of the pastime of my youth and that doubtless with practice my skill would come back to I upon this he provide I with a bow and arrow and mount I with he upon he own elephant take the way to a vast forest which lay far from the town when we have reach the wildest part of it we stop and my master say to I : this forest swarm with elephant hide yourself in this great tree and shoot at all that pass you when you have succeed in kill one come and tell I so say he give I a supply of food and return to the town and i perched myself high up in the tree and keep watch that night i see nothing but just after sunrise the next morning a large herd of elephant come crash and trample by i lose no time in let fly several arrow and at last one of the great animal fall to the ground dead and the other retreat leave I free to come down from my hiding-place and run back to tell my master of my success for which i be praise and regale with good thing then we go back to the forest together and dig a mighty trench in which we bury the elephant i have kill in order that when it become a skeleton my master might return and secure its tusk for two month i hunt thus and no day pass without my secure a elephant of course i do not always station myself in the same tree but sometimes in one place sometimes in another one morning as i watch the come of the elephant i be surprise to see that instead of pass the tree i be in as they usually do they pause and completely surround it trumpet horribly and shake the very ground with they heavy tread and when i see that they eye be fix upon I i be terrify and my arrow drop from my tremble hand i have indeed good reason for my terror when a instant later the largest of the animal wind he trunk round the stem of my tree and with one mighty effort tear it up by the root bring I to the ground entangled in its branch i think now that my last hour be surely come but the huge creature pick I up gently enough set I upon its back where i clung more dead than alive and follow by the whole herd turn and crash off into the dense forest it seem to I a long time before i be once more set upon my foot by the elephant and i stand as if in a dream watch the herd which turn and trample off in another direction and be soon hide in the dense underwood then recover myself i look about I and find that i be stand upon the side of a great hill strew as far as i could see on either hand with bone and tusk of elephant this then must be the elephant ' burying-place i say to myself and they must have bring I here that i might cease to persecute they see that i want nothing but they tusk and here lie more than i could carry away in a lifetime whereupon i turn and make for the city as fast as i could go not see a single elephant by the way which convince I that they have retire deeper into the forest to leave the way open to the ivory hill and i do not know how sufficiently to admire they sagacity after a day and a night i reach my master 's house and be receive by he with joyful surprise ah poor sindbad he cry i be wonder what could have become of you when i go to the forest i find the tree newly uproot and the arrow lie beside it and i fear i should never see you again pray tell I how you escape death i soon satisfied he curiosity and the next day we go together to the ivory hill and he be overjoy to find that i have tell he nothing but the truth when we have load we elephant with as many tusk as it could carry and be on we way back to the city he say : -- my brother -- since i can no longer treat as a slave one who have enrich I thus -- take you liberty and may heaven prosper you i will no longer conceal from you that these wild elephant have kill number of we slave every year no matter what good advice we give they they be

to my own country it be well he answer the monsoon will soon bring the ivory ship hither then i will send you on you way with somewhat to pay you passage so i stay with he till the time of the monsoon and every day we add to we store of ivory till all he warehouse be overflow with it by this time the other merchant know the secret but there be enough and to spare for all when the ship at last arrive my master himself choose the one in which i be to sail and put on board for I a great store of choice provision also ivory in abundance and all the costliest curiosity of the country for which i could not thank he enough and so we part i leave the ship at the first port we come to not feel at ease upon the sea after all that have happen to I by reason of it and have dispose of my ivory for much gold and buy many rare and costly present i load my pack animal and join a caravan of merchant we journey be long and tedious but i bear it patiently reflect that at least i have not to fear tempest nor pirate nor serpent nor any of the other peril from which i have suffer before and at length we reach bagdad my first care be to present myself before the caliph and give he a account of my embassy he assure I that my long absence have disquiet he much but he have nevertheless hope for the best as to my adventure among the elephant he hear it with amazement declare that he could not have believe it have not my truthfulness be well-known to he by he order this story and the other i have tell he be write by he scribe in letter of gold and lay up among he treasure i take my leave of he
