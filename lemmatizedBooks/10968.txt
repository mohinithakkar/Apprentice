carter g woodson to my father jame woodson who make it possible for I to enter the literary world a century of negro migration preface in treat this movement of the negro the writer do not presume to say the last word on the subject the exodus of the negro from the south have just begin the black have recently realize that they have freedom of body and they will now proceed to exercise that right to presume therefore to exhaust the treatment of this movement in its incipiency be far from the intention of the writer the aim here be rather to direct attention to this new phase of negro american life which will doubtless prove to be the most significant event in we local history since the civil war many of the fact herein set forth have see light before the effort here be direct toward a original treatment of fact many of which have already periodically appear in some form as these work however be too numerous to be consult by the layman the writer have endeavor to present in succinct form the lead fact as to how the negro in the united state have struggle under adverse circumstance to flee from bondage and oppression in quest of a land offering asylum to the oppressed and opportunity to the unfortunate how they have often be deceive have be carefully note with the hope that this volume may interest another worker to the extent of publish many other fact in this field

county in southern state in which negro form 50 per cent of the total population chapter i find a place of refuge the migration of the black from the southern state to those offer they better opportunity be nothing new the objective here therefore will be not merely to present the cause and result of the recent movement of the negro to the north but to connect this event with the periodical movement of the black to that section from about the year 1815 to the present day that this movement should date from that period indicate that the policy of the commonwealth towards the negro must have then begin decidedly to differ so as to make one section of the country more congenial to the despise black than the other as a matter of fact to justify this conclusion we need but give pass mention here to development too well know to be discuss in detail slavery in the original thirteen state be the normal condition of the negro when however jame otis patrick henry and thoma jefferson begin to discuss the natural rights of the colonist then say to be oppress by great britain some of the patriot of the revolution carry they reasoning to its logical conclusion contend that the negro slave should be free on the same grounds as they rights be also found in the law of nature -lrb- 1 -rrb- and so it be soon do in most northern commonwealth vermont new hampshire and massachusett exterminate the institution by constitutional provision and rhode island connecticut new jersey new york and pennsylvanium by gradual emancipation act -lrb- 2 -rrb- and it be think that the institution would soon thereafter pass away even in all southern commonwealth except south carolina and georgia where it have seemingly become profitable there come later the industrial revolution follow the invention of watt 's steam engine and mechanical appliance like whitney 's cotton gin all which change the economic aspect of the modern world make slavery a institution offering mean of exploitation to those engage in the production of cotton this revolution render necessary a large supply of cheap labor for cotton culture out of which the plantation system grow the negro slave therefore lose all hope of ever win they freedom in south carolina and georgia and in maryland virginium and north carolina where the sentiment in favor of abolition have be favorable there be a decide reaction which soon blighted they hope -lrb- 3 -rrb- in the northern commonwealth however the sentiment in behalf of universal freedom though at time dormant be ever apparent despite the attachment to the south of the trading class of northern city which profit by the slave trade and they commerce with the slaveholding state the northern state maintain this liberal attitude develop therefore into a asylum for the negro who be oppress in the south the negro however be not generally welcome in the north many of the northerner who sympathize with the oppressed black in the south never dream of have they as they neighbor there be consequently always two class of anti-slavery people those who advocate the abolition of slavery to elevate the black to the dignity of citizenship and those who merely hope to exterminate the institution because it be a economic evil -lrb- 4 -rrb- the latter generally believe that the black constitute a inferior class that could not discharge the duty of citizenship and when the proposal to incorporate the black into the body politic be clearly present to these agitator they anti-slavery ardor be decidedly dampened unwilling however to take the position that a race should be doom because of personal objection many of the early anti-slavery group look toward colonization for a solution of this problem -lrb- 5 -rrb- some thought of africa but since the deportation of a large number of person who have be bring under the influence of modern civilization seem cruel the most popular colonization scheme at first seem to be that of settle the negro on the public land in the west as this region have be lately cede however and no one could determine what use could be make of it by white man no such policy be generally accept when this territory be cede to the united state a effort to provide for the government of it finally culminate in the propose ordinance of 1784 carry the provision that slavery should not exist in the northwest territory after the year 1800 -lrb- 6 -rrb- this measure finally fail to pass and fortunately too think some because have slavery be give sixteen year of growth on that soil it might not have be abolish there until the civil war or it might have cause such a preponderance of slave commonwealth as to make the rebellion successful the ordinance of 1784 be antecedent to the more important ordinance of 1787 which carry the famous sixth article that neither slavery nor involuntary servitude except as a punishment for crime should exist in that territory at first it be generally deem feasible to establish negro colony on that domain yet despite the assurance of the ordinance of 1787 condition be such that one could not determine exactly whether the northwest territory would be slave or free -lrb- 7 -rrb- what then be the situation in this partly unoccupied territory slavery exist in what be now the northwest territory from the time of the early exploration and settlement of that region by the french the first slave of white man be indian though it be true that the red man usually choose death rather than slavery there be some of they that bow to the yoke so many pawnee indian become bondsman that the word _ panus _ become synonymous with slave in the west -lrb- 8 -rrb- western indian themselves follow the custom of white man enslave they captive in war rather than choose the alternative of put they to death in this way they be know to hold a number of black and whites the enslavement of the black man by the whites in this section date from the early part of the eighteenth century be a part of the louisiana territory which under france extend over the whole mississippus valley as far as the allegheny mountain it be govern by the same colonial regulation -lrb- 9 -rrb- slavery therefore have legal standing in this territory when antoine crozat upon be place in control of louisiana be authorize to begin a traffic in slave crozat himself do nothing to carry out he plan but in 1717 when the control of the colony be transfer to the _ compagnie de l'occident _ step be take toward the importation of slave in 1719 when 500 guinea negro be bring over to serve in lower louisiana philip francis renault import 500 other bondsman into upper louisiana or what be later include in the northwest territory slavery then become more and more extensive until by 1750 there be along the mississippus five settlement of slave kaskaskia kaokia fort chartre st phillipe and prairie du rocher -lrb- 10 -rrb- in 1763 negro be relatively numerous in the northwest territory but when this section that year be transfer to the british the number be diminish by the action of those frenchman who unwilling to become subject of great britain move from the territory -lrb- 11 -rrb- there be no material increase in the slave population thereafter until the end of the eighteenth century when some negro come from the original thirteen the ordinance of 1787 do not disturb the relation of slave and master some pioneer think that the sixth article exterminate slavery there other contend that it do not the latter believe that such expression in the ordinance of 1787 as the free inhabitant and the free male inhabitant of full size imply the continuance of slavery and other find ground for its perpetuation in that clause of the ordinance which allow the people of the territory to adopt the constitution and law of any one of the thirteen state student of law see protection for slavery in jay 's treaty which guarantee to the settler they property of all kind -lrb- 12 -rrb- when therefore the slave question come up in the northwest territory about the close of the eighteenth century there be three class of slave : first those who be in servitude to french owner previous to the cession of the territory to england and be still claim as property in the possession of which the owner be protect under the treaty of 1763 second those who be hold by british owner at the time of jay 's treaty and claim afterward as property under its protection and third those who since the territory have be control by the united state have be bring from the commonwealth in which slavery be allow -lrb- 13 -rrb- freedom however be recognize as the ultimate status of the negro in that territory this question have be seemingly settle anthony benezet who for year advocate the abolition of slavery and devoted he time and mean to the preparation of the negro for live as freedman be practical enough to recommend to the congress of the confederation a plan of colonize the emancipated black on the western land -lrb- 14 -rrb- jefferson incorporate into he scheme for a modern system of public school the training of the slave in industrial and agricultural branch to equip they for a higher station in life he believe however that the black not be equal to the white race should not be assimilate and should they be free they should by all means be colonize afar off -lrb- 15 -rrb- think that the western land might be so use he say in write to jame monroe in 1801 : a very great extent of country north of the ohio have be lay off in township and be now at market accord to the provision of the act of congress there be nothing say he which would restrain the state of virginium either in the purchase or the application of these land -lrb- 16 -rrb- yet he raise the question as to whether the establishment of such a colony within we limit and to become a part of the union would be desirable he think then of procure a place beyond the limit of the united state on we northern boundary by purchase the indian land with the consent of great britain he then doubt that the black race would live in such a rigorous climate this plan do not easily pass from the mind of the friend of the slave for in 1805 thoma brannagan assert in he _ serious remonstrance _ that the government should appropriate a few thousand acre of land at some distant part of the national domain for the negro ' accommodation and support he believe that the new state might be establish upward of 2000 mile from we frontier -lrb- 17 -rrb- a copy of the pamphlet contain this proposition be send to thoma jefferson who be impressed thereby but not have the courage to brave the torture of be brand as a friend of the slave he fail to give it he support -lrb- 18 -rrb- the same question be bring prominently before the public again in 1816 when there be present to the house of representative a memorial from the kentucky abolition society pray that the free people of color be colonize on the public land the committee to whom the memorial be refer for consideration report that it be expedient to refuse the request on the ground that as such land be not grant to free white man they see no reason for grant they to other -lrb- 19 -rrb- some negro slave unwilling to wait to be carry or invite to the northwest territory escape to that section even when it be control by the french prior to the american revolution slave who reach the west by this route cause trouble between the french and the british colonist advertising in 1746 for jame wenyam a slave richard colgate he master say that he swear to a negro whom he endeavor to induce to go with he that he have often be in the backwoods with he master and that he would go to the french and indian and fight for they -lrb- 20 -rrb- in a advertisement for a mulatto slave in 1755 thoma ringold he master express fear that he have escape by the same route to the french he therefore say : it seem to be the interest at least of every gentleman that have slave to be active in the beginning of these attempt for whilst we have the french such near neighbor we shall not have the least security in that kind of property -lrb- 21 -rrb- the good treatment which these slave receive among the french and especially at pittsburgh the gateway to the northwest territory tend to make that city a asylum for those slave who have sufficient spirit of adventure to brave the wilderness through which they have to go negro even then have the idea that there be in this country a place of more privilege than those they enjoy in the seaboard colony know of the likelihood of the negro to rise during the french and indian war governor dinwiddie write fox one of the secretary of state in 1756 : we dare not venture to part with any of we white man any distance as we must have a watchful eye over we negro slave who be upward of one hundred thousand -lrb- 22 -rrb- brissot de warville mention in he _ travels of 1788 _ several example of marriage of white and black in pittsburgh he note the case of a negro who marry a indentured french servant woman out of this union come a desirable mulatto girl who marry a surgeon of nante then station at pittsburgh he family be consider one of the most respectable of the city the negro refer to be do a creditable business and he wife take it upon herself to welcome foreigner especially the french who come that way along the ohio also there be several case of woman of color living with unmarried white man but this be look upon by the negro as detestable as be evidence by the fact that if black woman have a quarrel with a mulatto woman the former would reproach the latter for be of ignoble blood -lrb- 23 -rrb- these tendency however could not assure the negro that the northwest territory be to be a asylum for freedom when in 1763 it pass into the hand of the british the promoter of the slave trade and later to the independent colony two of which have no desire to exterminate slavery furthermore when the ordinance of 1787 with its famous sixth article against slavery be proclaim it be soon discover that this document be not necessarily emancipatory as the right to hold slave be guarantee to those who own they prior to the passage of the ordinance of 1787 it be to be expect that those attach to that institution would not indifferently see it pass away various petition therefore be send to the territorial legislature and to congress pray that the sixth article of the ordinance of 1787 be abrogate -lrb- 24 -rrb- no formal action to this effect be take but the practice of slavery be continue even at the wink of the government some slave come from the canadian who in accordance with the slave trade law of the british empire be supply with bondsman it be the canadian themselves who provide by act of parliament in 1793 for prohibit the importation of slave and for gradual emancipation when it seem later that the cause of freedom would eventually triumph the proslavery element undertake to perpetuate slavery through a system of indentured servant labor in the formation of the state of indiana and illinoi the question as to what should be do to harmonize with the new constitution the system of indenture to which the territorial legislature have be commit cause heated debate and at time almost conflict both indiana -lrb- 25 -rrb- and illinoi -lrb- 26 -rrb- finally incorporate into they constitution compromise provision for a nominal prohibition of slavery modify by clause for the continuation of the system of indenture labor of the negro hold to service the proslavery party persistently struggle for some year to secure by the interpretation of the law by legislation and even by amend the constitution so to change the fundamental law as to provide for actual slavery these state however gradually work toward freedom in keep with the spirit of the majority who frame the constitution despite the fact that the indenture system in southern illinoi and especially in indiana be at time tantamount to slavery as it be practice in part of the south it must be bear in mind here however that the north at this time be far from become a place of refuge for negro in the first place the industrial revolution have not then have time to reduce the negro to the plane of beast in the cotton kingdom the rigorous climate and the industry of the northern people moreover be not invite to the black and the development of the carry trade and the rise of manufacture there do not make that section more attractive to unskilled labor furthermore when we consider the fact that there be many thousand of negro in the southern state the presence of a few in the north must be regard as insignificant this paucity of black then obtain especially in the northwest territory for its french inhabitant instead of be a exploit people be pioneering have little use for slave in carry out they policy of merely hold the country for france moreover like certain gentleman from virginium who after the american revolution be afraid to bring they slave with they to occupy they bounty land in ohio few enterprising settler from the slave state have invade the territory with they negro not know whether or not they would be secure in the possession of such property when we consider that in 1810 there be only 102137 negro in the north and no more than 3454 in the northwest territory we must look to the second decade of the nineteenth century for the beginning of the migration of the negro in

and some sixty red slave or savage unlike the condition of the slave in lower louisiana where the rigid enforcement of the slave code make they life almost intolerable the slave of the northwest territory be for many reason much more fortunate in the first place subject to the control of a mayor-commandant appoint by the governor of new orlean the early dweller in this territory manage they plantation about as they please moreover as there be few planter who own as many as three or four negro slavery in the northwest territory do not get far beyond the patriarchal stage slave be usually

have to comply with contract for term of service when they master register they within thirty day from the time he bring they into the territory indentured black servant be not exactly sell but the law permit the transfer from one owner to another when the slave acquiesce in the transfer before a notary but it be often do without regard to the slave they be even bequeath and sell as personal property at auction notice for sale be frequent there be reward for runaway slave negro whose term have almost expire be kidnap and sell to new orlean the legislature impose a penalty for such but it be not generally enforce they be taxable property value accord to the length of service negro serve as laborer on farm house servant and in salt mine the latter be a excuse for hold they as slave person of color could purchase servant of they own race the law provide that the justice of the county could on complaint from the master order that a lazy servant be whip in this frontier section therefore where man often take the law in they own hand slave be often punish and abuse just as they be in the southern state the law deal with fugitive be somewhat harsh when apprehend fugitive have to serve two day extra for each day they lose from they master 's service the harboring of a runaway slave be punishable by a fine of one day for each the slave might be conceal consistently too with the provision of the law in most slave state slave could retain all goods or money lawfully acquire during they servitude provide they master give he consent upon the demonstration of proof to the county court that they have serve they term they could obtain from that tribunal certificate of freedom see _ the law of indiana _ -rrb- -lrb- footnote 26 : master have to provide adequate food and clothing and good lodging for the slave but the penalty for fail to comply with this law be not clear and even if so it happen that many master never observe it there be also a effort to prevent cruelty to slave but it be difficult to establish the guilt of master when the slave could not bear witness against he owner and it be not likely that the neighbor equally guilty or indifferent to the complaint of the black would take they petition to court under this system a large number of slave be bring into the territory especially after 1807 there be 135 in 1800 this increase come from kentucky and tennessee as those bring be largely boy and girl with a long period of service this form of slavery be assure for some year the child of these black be often register for thirty-five instead of thirty year of service on the ground that they be not bear in illinois no one thought of persecute a master for hold servant unlawfully and negro themselves could be easily deceive very few settler bring they slave there to free they there be only 749 in 1820 if one consider the proportion of this to the number bring there for manumission this seem hardly true it be better to say that during these first two decade of the nineteenth century some settler come for both purpose some to hold slave some as edward cole to free they it be not only practice in the southern part along the mississippus and ohio but as far north in illinoi as sangamon county be find servant know as yellow boy and colored girl -- see the _ law of illinois _ -rrb- chapter ii a transplantation to the north just after the settlement of the question of hold the western post by the british and the adjustment of the trouble arise from they capture of slave during we second war with england there start a movement of the black to this frontier territory but as there be few town or city in the northwest during the first decade of the new republic the flight of the negro into that territory be like that of a fugitive take he chance in the wilderness have lose they pioneering spirit in pass through the ordeal of slavery not many of the bondman take flight in that direction and few free negro venture to seek they fortune in those wild during the period of the frontier condition especially when the country have not then undergo a thorough reaction against the negro the migration of the negro however receive a impetus early in the nineteenth century this come from the quaker who by the middle of the eighteenth century have take the position that all member of they sect should free they slave -lrb- 1 -rrb- the quaker of north carolina and virginium have as early as 1740 take up the serious question of humanely treat they negro the north carolina quaker advise friend to emancipate they slave later prohibit traffic in they forbid they member from even hire the black out in 1780 and by 1818 have exterminate the institution among they communicant -lrb- 2 -rrb- after healing themselves of the sin they have before the close of the eighteenth century militantly address themselves to the task of abolish slavery and the slave trade throughout the world differ in they scheme from that of most anti-slavery leader they be advocate the establishment of the freedman in society as good citizen and to that end have provide for the religious and mental instruction of they slave prior to emancipate they -lrb- 3 -rrb- despite the fact that the quaker be not free to extend they operation throughout the colony they do much to enable the negro to reach free soil as the quaker believe in the freedom of the will human brotherhood and equality before god they do not like the puritan find difficulty in solve the problem of elevate the negro whereas certain puritan be afraid that conversion might lead to the destruction of caste and the incorporation of undesirable person into the body politick the quaker proceed on the principle that all man be brethren and be equal before god should be consider equal before the law on account of unduly emphasize the relation of man to god the puritan atrophy they social humanitarian instinct and develop into a race of self-conscious saint believe in human nature and lay stress upon the relation between man and man the quaker become the friend of all humanity -lrb- 4 -rrb- in 1693 george keith a lead quaker of he day come forward as a promoter of the religious training of the slave as a preparation for emancipation william penn advocate the emancipation of slave that they might have every opportunity for improvement in 1695 the quaker while protest against the slave trade denounce also the policy of neglect they moral and spiritual welfare -lrb- 5 -rrb- the grow interest of this sect in the negro be show later by the development in 1713 of a definite scheme for free and return they to africa after have be educate and train to serve as missionary on that continent when the manumission of the slave be check by the reaction against that class and it become more of a problem to establish they in a hostile environment certain quaker of north carolina and virginium adopt the scheme of settle they in northern state -lrb- 6 -rrb- at first they send such freedman to pennsylvanium but for various reason this do not prove to be the best asylum in the first place pennsylvanium border on the slave state maryland and virginium from which agent come to kidnap free negro furthermore too many negro be already rush to that commonwealth as the negro ' heaven and there be the chance that the negro might be settle elsewhere in the north where they might have better economic opportunity -lrb- 7 -rrb- a committee of forty be accordingly appoint by north carolina quaker in 1822 to examine the law of other free state with a view to determine what section would be most suitable for colonize these black this committee recommend in its report that the black be colonize in ohio indiana and illinoi the yearly meeting therefore order the removal of such negro as fast as they be willing or as might be consistent with the profession of they sect and instruct the agent effect the removal to draw on the treasury for any sum not exceed two hundred dollar to defray expense a increase number reach these state every year but owe to the inducement offer by the american colonization society some of they go to liberia when liberium however develop into every thing but a haven of rest the number send to the settlement in the northwest greatly increase the quarterly meeting succeed in send to the west 133 negro include 23 free black and slave give up because they be connect by marriage with those to be transplant -lrb- 8 -rrb- the negro colonist seem to prefer indiana -lrb- 9 -rrb- they go in three company and with suitable young friend to whom be execute power of attorney to manumit set free settle and bind they out -lrb- 10 -rrb- thirteen cart and wagon be buy for these three company $ 1250 be furnish for they travel expense and clothing the whole cost amount to $ 2490 it be plan to send forty or fifty to long island and twenty to the interior of pennsylvanium but they fail to prosper and report concern they stamp they as destitute and deplorably ignorant those who go to ohio and indiana however do well -lrb- 11 -rrb- later we receive another interesting account of this exodus david white lead a company of fifty-three into the west thirty-eight of whom belong to friend five to a member who have order that they be take west at he expense six of these slave belong to samuel lawrence a negro slaveholder who have purchase himself and family white pathetically report the case of four of the woman who have marry slave husband and have twenty child for the possession of whom the friend have to stand a lawsuit in the court the woman have decide to leave they husband behind but the thought of separation so torment they that they make a effort to secure they liberty upon appeal to they master for term the owner somewhat move by compassion sell they for one half of they value white then go west and leave four in chillicothe twenty-three in leesburg and twenty-six in wayne county indiana without encounter any material difficulty -lrb- 12 -rrb- other have think of this plan but the quaker actually carry it out on a small scale here we see again not only they desire to have the negro emancipate but the vital interest of the quaker in success of the black for member of this sect not only liberate they slave but sell out they own holding in the south and move with these freedman into the north quaker who then live in free state offer fugitive material assistance by open and clandestine method -lrb- 13 -rrb- the most prominent leader develop by the movement be levus coffin whose daring deed in behalf of the fugitive make he the reputed president of the underground railroad most of the quaker settlement of negro with which he be connect be make in what be now hamilton howard wayne randolph vigo gibson grant rush and tipton county indiana and darke county ohio the promotion of this movement by the quaker be well on its way by 1815 and be not materially check until the fifty when the operation of the drastic fugitive slave law interfere and even then the movement have gain such momentum and the execution of that mischievous measure have produce in the north so much reaction like that express in the personal liberty law that it could not be stop the negro find home in western new york western pennsylvanium and throughout the northwest territory the negro population of york harrisburg and philadelphium rapidly increase a settlement of negro develop at sandy lake in northwestern pennsylvanium -lrb- 14 -rrb- and there be another near berlin cross road in ohio -lrb- 15 -rrb- a group of negro migrate to this same state find home in the van buren township of shelby county -lrb- 16 -rrb- a more significant settlement in the state be make by samuel gist a englishman possess extensive plantation in hanover amherst and henrico county virginia he provide in he will that he slave should be free and send to the north he further provide that

wattle a quaker from connecticut make a settlement in mercer county ohio early in the nineteenth century in the winter of 1833-4 he providentially become acquaint with the color people of cincinnatus find there about 4000 totally ignorant of every thing calculate to make good citizen as most of they have be slave exclude from every avenue of moral and mental improvement he establish for they a school which he maintain for two year he then propose to these negro to go into the country and purchase land to remove they from those contaminate influence which have so long crushed they in we city and village -lrb- 18 -rrb- they consent on the condition that he would accompany they and teach school he travel through canada michigan and indiana look for a suitable location and finally select for settlement a place in mercer county ohio in 1835 he make the first purchase of land there for this purpose and before 1838 negro have buy there about 30000 acre at the earnest appeal of this benefactor who have travel into almost every neighborhood of the black in the state and lay before they the benefit of a permanent home for themselves and of education for they child -lrb- 19 -rrb- this settlement be further increase in 1858 by the manumitted slave of john harper of north carolina -lrb- 20 -rrb- john randolph of roanoke endeavor to establish he slave as freeman in this county but the german who have settle in that community a little ahead of they start such a disturbance that randolph 's executor could not carry out he plan although he have purchase a large tract of land there -lrb- 21 -rrb- it be necessary to send these freeman to miamus county theodoric h gregg of dinwiddie county virginium liberate he slave in 1854 and send they to ohio -lrb- 22 -rrb- nearer to the civil war when public opinion be proscribe the uplift of negro in kentucky noah spear secure near xenia greene county ohio a small parcel of land for sixteen of he former bondsman in 1856 -lrb- 23 -rrb- other freedman find they way to this community in later year and it become so prosperous that it be select as the site of wilberforce university this transplantation extend into michigan with the help of person philanthropically incline there spring up a flourish group of negro in detroit early in the nineteenth century they begin to acquire property and to provide for the education of they child they record be such as to merit the encomium of they fellow white citizen in later year this group in detroit be increase by the operation of law hostile to free negro in the south in that life for this class not only become intolerable but necessitate they expatriation because of the virginium drastic law and especially that of 1838 prohibit the return to that state of such negro student as have be accustom to go north to attend school after they be deny this privilege at home the father of richard debaptiste and marie loui more the mother of fannie m richard lead a colony of free negro from fredericksburg to detroit -lrb- 24 -rrb- and for about similar reason the father of robert a pelham conduct other from petersburg virginium in 1859 -lrb- 25 -rrb- one saunder a planter of cabell county west virginium liberate he slave some year later and furnish they home among the negro settle in cass county michigan about ninety mile east of chicago and ninety-five mile west of detroit this settlement have become attractive to fugitive slave and freedman because the quaker settle there welcome they on they way to freedom and in some case encourage they to remain among they when the increase of fugitive be render impossible during the fifty when the fugitive slave law be be enforce there be still a steady growth due to the manumission of slave by sympathetic and benevolent master in the south -lrb- 26 -rrb- most of these negro settle in calvin township in that county so that of the 1376 reside there in 1860 795 be establish in this district there be only 580 whites disperse among they the negro settler do not then obtain control of the government but they early purchase land to the extent of several thousand acre and develop into successful small farmer be a little more prosperous than the average negro community in the north the cass county settlement not only attract negro flee from hardship in the south but also those who have for some year unsuccessfully endeavor to establish themselves in other community on free soil -lrb- 27 -rrb- these settlement be duplicate a little farther west in illinois edward cole a virginian who in 1818 emigrate to illinoi of which he later serve as governor and as liberator from slavery settle he slave in that commonwealth he bring they to edwardsville where they constitute a community know as cole ' negro -lrb- 28 -rrb- there be another community of negro in illinoi in what be now call brooklyn situate north of east st loui this town be a center of some consequence in the thirty it become a station of the underground railroad on the route to alton and to canada as all of the negro who emerge from the south do not go farther into the north the black population of the town gradually grow despite the fact that slave hunter capture and reenslave many of the negro who settle there -lrb- 29 -rrb- these settlement together with favorable community of sympathetic whites promote the migration of the free negro and fugitive from the south by serve as center offer assistance to those flee to the free state and to canada the fugitive usually find friend in philadelphium columbium pittsburgh elmira rochester buffalo gallipoli portsmouth akron cincinnatus and detroit they pass on the way to freedom through columbium philadelphium elizabethtown and by way of sea to new york and boston from which they proceed to permanent settlement in the north -lrb- 30 -rrb- in the west the migration of the black be further facilitate by the peculiar geographic condition in that the appalachian highland extend like a peninsula into the south have a natural endowment which produce a class of white citizen hostile to the institution of slavery these mountaineer come later to the colony have to go to the hill and mountain because the first comer from europe have take up the land near the sea being of the german and scotch-irish presbyterian stock they have ideal differ widely from those of the seaboard slaveholder -lrb- 31 -rrb- the mountaineer believe in civil liberty in fee simple and a open road to civil honor secure to the poorest and feeblest member of society the eastern element have for they ideal a government of interest for the people they believe in liberty but that of king lord and common not of all the people -lrb- 32 -rrb- settle along the appalachian highland these new stock continue to differ from those dwelling near the sea especially on the slavery question -lrb- 33 -rrb- the natural endowment of the mountainous section make slavery there unprofitable and the mountaineer bear it grievously that they be attach to commonwealth dominate by the radical pro-slavery element of the south who sacrifice all other interest to safeguard those of the peculiar institution there develop a number of clash in all of the legislature and constitutional convention of the southern state along the atlantic but in every case the defender of the interest of slavery win when therefore slave with the assistance of anti-slavery mountaineer begin to escape to the free state they have little difficulty in make they way through the appalachian region where the love of freedom have so set the people against slavery that although some of they yield to the inevitable sin they never make any systematic effort to protect it -lrb- 34 -rrb- the development of the movement in these mountain be more than interesting during the first quarter of the nineteenth century there be many ardent anti-slavery leader in the mountain these be not particularly interested in the negro but be determine to keep that soil for freedom that the settler might there realize the ideal for which they have leave they home in europe when the industrial revolution with the attendant rise of the plantation cotton culture make abolition in the south improbable some of they become colonizationist hope to destroy the institution through deportation which would remove the objection of certain master who would free they slave provide they be not leave in the state to become a public charge -lrb- 35 -rrb- some of this sentiment continue in the mountain even until the civil war the highlander therefore find themselves involve in a continuous embroglio because they be not move by reactionary influence which be unifying the south for its bold effort to make slavery a national institution -lrb- 36 -rrb- the other member of the mountaineer anti-slavery group become attach to the underground railroad system endeavor by secret method to place on free soil a sufficiently large number of fugitive to show a decide diminution in the south -lrb- 37 -rrb- john brown who communicate with the south through these mountain think that he work would be a success if he could change the situation in one county in each of these state the line along which these underground railroad operator move connected naturally with the quaker settlement establish in free state and the favorable section in the appalachian region many of these worker be quaker who have already establish settlement of slave on estate which they have purchase in the northwest territory among these be john rankin jame gilliland jesse lockehart robert dobbin samuel crother hugh l fullerton and william dickey thus they connect the heart of the south with the avenue to freedom in the north -lrb- 38 -rrb- there be route extend from this section into ohio indiana illinoi and pennsylvanium over the ohio and kentucky route culminate chiefly in cleveland sandusky and detroit however more fugitive make they way to freedom than through any other avenue -lrb- 39 -rrb- partly too because they find the limestone cave very helpful for hide by day these operation extend even through tennessee into northern georgium and alabama dillingham josiah henson and harriet tubman use these route to deliver many a negro from slavery the opportunity thus offer to help the oppressed bring forward a class of anti-slavery man who go beyond the limit of merely express they horror of the evil they believe that something should be do to deliver the poor that cry and to direct the wanderer in the right way -lrb- 40 -rrb- translate into action what have long be restrict to academic discussion these philanthropic worker usher in a new era in the uplift of the black make abolition more of a reality the abolition element of the north then could no longer be consider a insignificant minority advocate a hopeless cause but a factor in draw from the south a part of its slave population and at the same time offer asylum to the free negro whom the southerner consider undesirable -lrb- 4l -rrb- prominent among those who aid this migration in various way be benjamin lundy of tennessee and jame g birney a former slaveholder of huntsville alabama who manumit he slave and apprentice and educate some of they in ohio this exodus of the negro to the free state promote the migration of other of they race to canada a more congenial part beyond the border of the united state the movement from the free state into canada moreover be contemporary with that from the south to the free state as will be evidence by the fact that 15000 of the 60000 negro in canada in 1860 be free bear as detroit be the chief gateway for they to canada most of these refugee settle in town of southern ontario not far from that city these be dawn colchester elgin dresden windsor sandwich bush wilberforce hamilton st catherine chatham riley anderton london malden and gonfield -lrb- 42 -rrb- and they come to canada be not check even by request from they enemy that they be turn away from that country as undesirable for some of the white people there welcome and assist they canadian later experience a change in they attitude toward these refugee but these british american never make the life of the negro there so intolerable as be the case in some of the free state it should be observe here that this movement unlike the exodus of the negro of today affect a unequal distribution of the enlighten negro -lrb- 43 -rrb- those who be flee from the south today be largely laborer seek economic opportunity the motive at work in the mind of the antebellum refugee be higher in 1840 there be more intelligent black in the south than in the north but not so after 1850 despite the vigorous execution of the fugitive slave law in some part of the north while the free negro population of the slave state increase only 23736 from 1850 to 1860 that of the free state increase 29839 in the south only delaware maryland and north carolina show a noticeable increase in the number of free person of color during the decade immediately precede the civil war this element of the population have only slightly increase in alabama kentucky missourus tennessee virginium louisiana south carolina and the district of columbium the number of free negro of florida remain constant those of arkansa mississippus and texa diminish in the north of course the migration have cause the tendency to be in the other direction with the exception of maine new hampshire vermont and new york which have about the same free color population in 1860 as they have in 1850 there be a general increase in the number of negro in the free state ohio lead in this respect have have during this period a increase of 11394 -lrb- 44 -rrb- a glance at the table on the accompany page will show in detail the result of this migration statistics of the free color population of the united state state population 1850 1860

increase influx of refugee from the south to be receive in the free state in the older northern state where there could be no danger of a africanization of a large district the come of the negro do not cause general excitement though at time the feeling in certain locality be sufficient to make one think so -lrb- 1 -rrb- fear that the immigration of the negro into the north might so increase they number as to make they constitute a rather important part in the community however some free state enact law to restrict the privilege of the black free negro have vote in all the colony except georgium and south carolina if they have the property qualification but after the sentiment attendant upon the struggle for the rights of man have pass away there set in a reaction -lrb- 2 -rrb- delaware maryland virginium and kentucky disfranchise all negro not long after the revolution they vote in north carolina until 1835 when the state feeling that this privilege of one class of negro might affect the enslavement of the other prohibit it the northern state follow in they wake set up the same barrier against the black they be disfranchise in new jersey in 1807 in connecticut in 1814 and in pennsylvanium in 1838 in 1811 new york pass a act require the production of certificate of freedom from black or mulatto offer to vote the second constitution adopt in 1823 provide that no man of color unless he have be for three year a citizen of that state and for one year next precede any election should be seize and possess of a freehold estate should be allow to vote although this qualification be not require of the whites a act of 1824 relate to the government of the stockbridge indian provide that no negro or mulatto should vote in they council -lrb- 3 -rrb- that increase prejudice be to a great extent the result of the immigration into the north of negro in the rough be nowhere better illustrated than in pennsylvanium prior to 1800 and especially after 1780 when the state provide for gradual emancipation there be little race prejudice in pennsylvanium -lrb- 4 -rrb- when the reactionary legislation of the south make life intolerable for the negro debase they to the plane of beast many of the free people of color from virginium maryland and delaware move or escape into pennsylvanium like a steady stream during the next sixty year as these negro tend to concentrate in town and city they cause the supply of labor to exceed the demand lower the wages of some and drive out of employment a number of other who become pauper and consequently criminal there set in too a intense struggle between the black and white laborer -lrb- 5 -rrb- immensely accelerate the growth of race prejudice especially when the abolitionist and quaker be give negro industrial training the first exhibition of this prejudice be see among the lower class of white people largely irish and german who devote to menial labor compete directly with the negro it do not require a long time however for this feeling to react on the higher class of whites where negro settle in large group a strong protest arise from the menace of negro pauper a attempt be make in 1804 to compel free negro to maintain those that might become a public charge -lrb- 6 -rrb- in 1813 the mayor alderman and citizen of philadelphium ask that free negro be tax to support they poor -lrb- 7 -rrb- two philadelphium representative in the pennsylvania legislature have a committee appoint in 1815 to consider the advisability of prevent the immigration of negro -lrb- 8 -rrb- one of the cause then at work there be that the black population have recently increase to four thousand in philadelphium and more than four thousand other have come into the city since the previous registration they be arrive much faster than they could be assimilate the state of pennsylvanium have about exterminate slavery by 1840 have only 40 slave that year and only a few hundred at any time after 1810 many of these of course have not have time to make they way in life as freedman to show how much the rapid migration to that city aggravate the situation under these circumstance one need but note the statistics of the increase of the free people of color in that state there be only 22492 such person in pennsylvanium in 1810 but in 1820 there be 30202 and in 1830 as many as 37930 this number increase to 47854 by 1840 to 53626 by 1850 and to 56949 by 1860 the undesirable aspect of the situation be that most of the migrate black come in crude form -lrb- 9 -rrb- on arrive therefore say a contemporary they abandon themselves to all manner of debauchery and dissipation to the great annoyance of many citizen -lrb- 10 -rrb- thereafter follow a number of clash develop finally into a series of riot of a grave nature innocent negro attack at first for purpose of sport and later for sinister design be often badly beat in the street or even cut with knife the offender be not punish and if the negro defend themselves they be usually severely penalize in 1819 three white woman stone a woman of color to death -lrb- 11 -rrb- a few youth enter a negro church in philadelphium in 1825 and by throw pepper to give rise to suffocating fume cause a panic which result in the death of several negro -lrb- 12 -rrb- when the citizen of new haven connecticut array themselves in 1831 against the plan to establish in that city a negro manual labor college there be hold in philadelphium a meeting which pass resolution enthusiastically endorse this effort to rid the community of the evil of the immigration of free negro there arise also the custom of drive negro away from independence square on the fourth of July because they be neither consider nor desire as a part of the body politic -lrb- 13 -rrb- it be think that in the state of feeling of the thirty that the negro would be annihilate de tocqueville also observe that the negro be more detest in the free state than in those where they be hold as slave -lrb- 14 -rrb- there have be such a reaction since 1800 that no position of consequence be open to negro however well educate they might be and the education of the black which be once vigorously prosecute there become unpopular -lrb- 15 -rrb- this be especially true of harrisburg and philadelphium but by no means confine to large city the philadelphium press say nothing in behalf of the race it be generally think that freedom have not be a advantage to the negro and that instead of make progress they have fill jail and almshouse and multiply pest hole to afflict the city with disease and crime the negro of york carefully work out in 1803 a plan to burn the city incendiary set on fire a number of house eleven of which be destroy whereas there be other attempt at a general destruction of the city the authority arrest a number of negro but run the risk of have the jail break open by they sympathizing fellowman after a reign of terror for half a week order be restore and twenty of the accuse be convict of arson in 1820 there occur so many conflagration that a vigilance committee be organize -lrb- 16 -rrb- whether or not the negro be guilty of the crime be not know but number of they leave either on account of the fear of punishment or because of the indignity to which they be subject numerous petition therefore come before the legislature to stop the immigration of negro it be propose in 1840 to tax all free negro to assist they in get out of the state for colonization -lrb- 17 -rrb- the citizen of lehigh county ask the authority in 1830 to expel all negro and person of color find in the state -lrb- 18 -rrb- another petition pray that they be deprive of the freedom of movement bill embody these idea be frequently consider but they be never pass stronger opposition than this however be manifest in the form of actual outbreak on a large scale in philadelphium the immediate cause of this first real clash be the abolition agitation in the city in 1834 follow the exciting news of other such disturbance a few month prior to this date in several northern city a group of boy start the riot by destroy a negro resort a mob then proceed to the negro district where white and color man engage in a fight with club and stone the next day the mob ruin the african presbyterian church and attack some negro destroy they property and beat they mercilessly this riot continue for three day a committee appoint to inquire into the cause of the riot report that the aim of the rioter have be to make the negro go away because it be believe that they labor be deprive they of work and because the black have shield criminal and have make such noise and disorder in they church as to make they a nuisance it seem that the most intelligent and well-to-do people of philadelphium keenly feel it that the city have thus be disgrace but the mob spirit continue -lrb- 19 -rrb- the very next year be mark by the same sort of disorder because a half-witted negro attempt to murder a white man a large mob stir up the city again there be a repetition of the beating of negro and of the destruction of property while the police as the year before be so inactive as to give rise to the charge that they be accessory to the riot -lrb- 20 -rrb- in 1838 there occur another outbreak which develop into a anti-abolition riot as the public mind have be much exercise by the discussion of abolitionist and by they close social contact with the negro the clash come on the seventeenth of may when pennsylvanium hall the center of abolition agitation be burn fight between the black and whites ensue the follow night when the color orphan asylum be attack and a negro church burn order be finally restore for the good of all concerned but that a majority of the people sympathize with the rioter be evidence by the fact that the committee charge with investigate the disturbance report that the mob be compose of stranger who could not be recognize -lrb- 21 -rrb- it be well to note here that this riot occur the year the negro in pennsylvanium be disfranchise follow the example of philadelphium pittsburgh have a riot in 1839 result in the maltreatment of a number of negro and the demolish of some of they house when the negro of philadelphium parade the city in 1842 celebrate the abolition of slavery in the west indy there ensue a battle lead by the whites who undertake to break up the procession along with the beating and killing of the usual number go also the destruction of the new african hall and the negro presbyterian church the grand jury charge with the inquiry into the cause report that the procession be to be blame for several year thereafter the city remain quiet until 1849 when there occur a raid on the black by the _ killer of moyamense _ use firearm with which many be wound this disturbance be finally quell by aid of the militia -lrb- 22 -rrb- these clash sometimes reach farther north than the free state border on the slave commonwealth mob break up abolition meeting in the city of new york in 1834 when there be send to congress numerous petition for the abolition of slavery this mob even assail such eminent citizen as arthur and lewi tappan mainly on account of they friendly attitude toward the negro -lrb- 23 -rrb- on October 21 1834 the same feeling develop in utica where be to be hold a anti-slavery meeting accord to previous notice the six hundred delegate who assemble there be warn to disband a mob then organize itself and drive the delegate from the town that same month the people of palmyra new york hold a meeting at which they adopt resolution to the effect that owner of house or tenement in that town occupy by black of the character complain of be request to use all they rightful means to clear they premise of such occupant at the earliest possible period and that it be recommend that such proprietor refuse to rent the same thereafter to any person of color whatever -lrb- 24 -rrb- in new york negro be exclude from place of amusement and public conveyance and segregate in place of worship in the draft riot which occur there in 1863 one of the aim of the mob be to assassinate negro and to destroy they property they burn the color orphan asylum of that city and hang negro to lamp-post the situation in part of new england be not much better for fear of the evil of a increase population of free person of color the people of canaan new hampshire break up the noye academy because it decide to admit negro student think that many of the race might thereby be encourage to come to that state -lrb- 25 -rrb- when prudence crandall establish in canterbury connecticut a academy to which she decide to admit negro the mayor selectman and citizen of the city protest and when they protest fail to deter this heroine they induce the legislature to enact a special law cover the case and invoke the measure to have prudence crandall imprison because she would not desist -lrb- 26 -rrb- this very law and the argument uphold it justify the drastic measure on the ground that a increase in the color population would be a injury to the people of that state in the new commonwealth form out of western territory there be the same fear as to negro domination and consequently there follow the wave of legislation intend in some case not only to withhold from the negro settler the exercise of the rights of citizenship but to discourage and even to prevent they from come into they territory -lrb- 27 -rrb- the question as to what should be do with the negro be early a issue in ohio it come up in the constitutional convention of 1803 and provoke some discussion but that body consider it sufficient to settle the matter for the time be by merely leave the negro indian and foreigner out of the pale of the newly organize body politic by conveniently incorporate the word white throughout the constitution -lrb- 28 -rrb- it be soon evident however that the matter have not be settle and the legislature of 1804 have to give serious consideration to the immigration of negro into that state it be therefore enact that no negro or mulatto should remain there permanently unless he could furnish a certificate of freedom issue by some court that all negro in that commonwealth should be register before the follow June and that no man should employ a negro who fail to comply with these condition should one be detect in hire harboring or hinder the capture of a fugitive black he be liable to a fine of $ 50 and he master could recover pay for the service of he slave to the amount of fifty cent a day -lrb- 29 -rrb- as this legislature do not meet the demand of those who desire further to discourage negro immigration the legislature of 1807 be induce to enact a law to the effect that no negro should be permit to settle in ohio unless he could within 20 day give a bond to the amount of $ 500 for he good behavior and assurance that he would not become a public charge this measure provide also for raise the fine for conceal a fugitive from $ 50 to $ 100 one half of which should go to the person upon the testimony of whom the conviction should be secure -lrb- 30 -rrb- negro evidence in a case to which a white be a party be declare illegal in 1830 negro be exclude from service in the state militia in 1831 they be deprive of the privilege of serve on jury and in 1838 they be deny the right of have they child educate at the expense of the state -lrb- 31 -rrb- in indiana the situation be worse than in ohio we have already note above how the settler in the southern part endeavor to make that a slave state when that have after all but be successful seem impossible the state enact law to prevent or discourage the influx of free negro and to restrict the privilege of those already there in 1824 a stringent law for the return of fugitive be pass -lrb- 32 -rrb- the expulsion of free negro be a matter of concern and in 1831 it be provide that unless they could give bond for they behavior and support they could be remove otherwise the county overseer could hire out such negro to the highest bidder -lrb- 33 -rrb- negro be not allow to attend school maintain at the public expense might not give evidence against a white man and could not intermarry with white person they might however serve as witness against negro -lrb- 34 -rrb- in the same way the free negro meet discouragement in illinoi they suffer from all the disability impose on they class in ohio and indiana and be deny the right to sue for they liberty in the court when there arise many abolitionist who encourage the come of the fugitive from labor in the south one element of the citizen of illinoi unwilling to accept this unusual influx of member of another race pass the drastic law of 1853 prohibit the immigration it provide for the prosecution of any person bring a negro into the state and also for arrest and fine any negro $ 50 should he appear there and remain longer than ten day if he prove to be unable to pay the fine he could be sell to any person who could pay the cost of the trial -lrb- 35 -rrb- in michigan the situation be a little better but with the wave of hostile legislation then sweep over the new -lrb- 36 -rrb- commonwealth michigan be not allow to constitute altogether a exception some of this intense feeling find expression in the form of a law hostile to the negro this be the act of 1827 which provide for the registration of all free person of color and for the exclusion from the territory of all black who could not produce a certificate to the effect that they be free free person of color be also require to file bond with one or more freehold surety in the penal sum of $ 500 for they good behavior and the bondsman be expect to provide for they maintenance if they fail to support themselves failure to comply with this law mean expulsion from the territory -lrb- 37 -rrb- the opposition to the negro immigrate into the new west be not restricted to the enactment of law which in some case be never enforce several community take the law into they own hand during these year when the negro be seek freedom in the northwest territory and when free black be be establish there by philanthropist it seem to the southern uplander flee from slavery in the border state and foreigner seek fortune in the new world that they might possibly be crowd out of this new territory by the negro frequent clash therefore follow after they have pass through a period of toleration and dependence on the execution of the hostile law the clash of the greatest consequence occur in the northwest territory where a larger number of uplander from the south have go some to escape the ill effect of slavery and other to hold slave if possible and when that seem impossible to exclude the black altogether -lrb- 38 -rrb- this persecution of the negro receive also the hearty cooperation of the foreign element who be a undeveloped class have to do menial labor in competition with the black the feeling of the foreigner be especially mischievous for the reason that they be like the negro at first settle in large number in urban community generally speak the feeling be like that exhibit by the german in mercer county ohio the citizen of this frontier community in register they protest against the settling of negro there adopt the follow resolution : _ resolve _ that we will not live among negro as we have settle here first we have fully determine that we will resist the settlement of black and mulatto in this county to the full extent of we means the bayonet not except _ resolve _ that the black of this county be and they be hereby respectfully request to leave the county on or before the first day of march 1847 and in the case of they neglect or refusal to comply with this request we pledge ourselves to _ remove they peacefully if we can forcibly if we must _ _ resolve _ that we who be here assemble pledge ourselves not to employ or trade with any black or mulatto person in any manner whatever or permit they to have any grind do at we mill after the first day of January next -lrb- 39 -rrb- in 1827 there arise a storm of protest on the occasion of the settling of seventy freedman in lawrence county ohio by a philanthropic master of pittsylvanium county virginium -lrb- 40 -rrb- on _ black Friday _ January 1 1830 eighty negro be drive out of portsmouth ohio at the request of one or two hundred white citizen set forth in a urgent memorial -lrb- 41 -rrb- so many negro during these year concentrate at cincinnatus that the labor element force the execution of the almost dead law require free negro to produce certificate and give bond for they behavior and support -lrb- 42 -rrb- a mob attack the home of the black kill a number of they and force twelve hundred other to leave for canada west where they establish the settlement know as wilberforce in 1836 another mob attack and destroy there the press of jame g birney the editor of the _ philanthropist _ because of the encouragement he abolitionist organ give to the immigrate negro -lrb- 43 -rrb- but in 1841 come a decidedly systematic effort on the part of foreigner and proslavery sympathizer to kill off and drive out the negro who be become too well establish in that city and who be give offense to white man who desire to deal with they as negro be treat in the south the city continue in this excited state for about a week there be bring into play in the upheaval the police of the city and the state militia before the shooting of the negro and burning of they home could be check so far as be know no white man be punish although a few of they be arrest some negro be commit to prison during the fray they be thereafter either discharge upon produce certificate of nativity or give bond or be indefinitely hold -lrb- 44 -rrb- in southern indiana and illinoi the same condition obtain observe the situation in indiana a contributor of _ nile register _ remark in 1818 upon the arrival there of sixty or seventy liberate negro send by the society of friend of north carolina that they be a species of population that be not acceptable to the people of that state nor indeed to any other whether free or slaveholding for they can not rise and become like other man unless in country where they own color predominate but must always remain a degraded and inferior class of person without the hope of much better they condition -lrb- 45 -rrb- the _ indiana farmer _ voice the sentiment of that same community regret the increase of this population that seem to be enlarge the number send to that territory the editor insist that the community which enjoy the benefit of the black ' labor should also suffer all the consequence since the people of indiana derive no advantage from slavery he beg that they be excuse from its inconvenience most of the black that migrate there moreover possess think he feeling quite unprepared to make good citizen a sense of inferiority early impressed on they mind destitute of every thing but bodily power and have no character to lose and no prospect of acquire one even do they know its value they be prepare for the commission of any act when the prospect of evading punishment be favorable -lrb- 46 -rrb- with the exception of such center as eden upper alton bellville and chicago this antagonistic attitude be general also in the state of illinoi the negro be despise abused and maltreat as person who have no rights that the white man should respect even in detroit michigan in 1833 a fracas be start by a attack on negro because a courageous group of they have effect the rescue and escape of one thornton blackburn and he wife who have be arrest by the sheriff as alleged fugitive from kentucky the citizen invoke the law of 1827 to require free negro to produce a certificate and furnish bond for they behavior and support -lrb- 47 -rrb- the anti-slavery

iv colonization as a remedy for migration because of these untoward circumstance consequent to the immigration of free negro and fugitive into the north they enemy and in some case they well-intentioned friend advocate the diversion of these element to foreign soil benezet and brannagan have the idea of settle the negro on the public land in the west largely to relieve the situation in the north -lrb- 1 -rrb- certain anti-slavery man of kentucky as we have observe recommend the same but this be hardly advocate at all by the farseeing white man after the close of the first quarter of the nineteenth century it be by that time very clear that white man would want to occupy all land within the present limit of the united state few statesman dare to encourage migration to canada because the large number of fugitive who have already escape there have attach to that region the stigma of be a asylum for fugitive from the slave state the most influential people who give think to this question finally decide that the colonization of the negro in africa be the only solution of the problem the plan of african colonization appeal more generally to the people of both north and south than the other effort which at best could do no more than to offer local or temporary relief the african colonizationist proceed on the basis that the negro have no chance for racial development in this country they could secure no kind of honorable employment could not associate with congenial white friend whose mind and pursuit might operate as a stimulus upon they industry and could not rise to the level of the successful professional or business man find around they in short they must ever be hewer of wood and drawer of water -lrb- 2 -rrb- to emphasize further the necessity of emigration to africa the advocate of deportation to foreign soil generally refer to the condition of the migrate negro as a case in evidence so long say one as you must sit stand walk ride dwell eat and sleep _ here _ and the negro _ there _ he can not be free in any part of the country -lrb- 3 -rrb- this idea work through the mind of northern man who have for year think merely of the injustice of slavery begin to change they attitude toward the abolitionist who have never undertake to solve the problem of the black who be seek refuge in the north many thinker control public opinion then give audience to the colonizationist and circle once close to they be thereafter open -lrb- 4 -rrb- there be therefore a tendency toward a more systematic effort than have hitherto characterize the endeavor of the colonizationist the object of they philanthropy be not to be steal away and hurry off to a uncongenial land for the oppress they be in accordance with the exigency of they new situation to be prepare by instruction in mechanic art agriculture science and biblical literature that some might lead in the higher pursuit and other might skilfully serve they fellow -lrb- 5 -rrb- private enterprise be at first depend on to carry out the scheme but it soon become evident that a better method be necessary finally out of the proposal of various thinker and out of the actual colonization feat of paul cuff a negro come a national meeting for this purpose hold in washington December 1816 and the organization of the american colonization society this meeting be attend by some of the most prominent man in the united state among whom be henry clay franci s key bishop william meade john randolph and judge bushrod washington the american colonization society however fail to facilitate the movement of the free negro from the south and do not promote the general welfare of the race the reason for these failure be many in the first place the society be all thing to all man to the anti-slavery man whose ardor have be dampen by the meager result obtain by he agitation the scheme be the next best thing to remove the objection of slaveholder who have say they would emancipate they bondsman if they could be assure of they be deport to foreign soil to the radical proslavery man and to the northerner hate the negro it be well adapt to rid the country of the free person of color whom they regard as the pariah of society -lrb- 6 -rrb- furthermore although the colonization society become seemingly popular and the various state organize branch of it and raise money to promote the movement the slaveholder as a majority never reach the position of parting with they slave and the country would not take such radical action as to compel free negro to undergo expatriation when militant abolitionist be fearlessly denounce the scheme -lrb- 7 -rrb- the free people of color themselves be not only not anxious to go but bear it grievously that any one should even suggest that they should be drive from the country in which they be bear and for the independence of which they father have die they hold indignation meeting throughout the north to denounce the scheme as a selfish policy inimical to the interest of the people of color -lrb- 8 -rrb- brand thus as the inveterate foe of the black both slave and free the american colonization society effect the deportation of only such negro as southern master feel disposed to emancipate from time to time and a few other induce to go as the industrial revolution early change the aspect of the economic situation in the south so as to make slavery seemingly profitable few master ever think of liberating they slave scarcely any intelligent negro except those who for economic or religious reason be interested avail themselves of this opportunity to go to the land of they ancestor from the report of the colonization society we learn that from 1820 to 1833 only 2885 negro be send to africa by the society furthermore more than 2700 of this number be take from the slave state and about two third of these be slave manumit on the condition that they would emigrate -lrb- 9 -rrb- later statistics show the same tendency by 1852 7836 have be deport from the united state to liberia 2720 of these be bear free 204 purchase they freedom 3868 be emancipate in view of they go to liberium and 1044 be liberate african return by the united state government -lrb- 10 -rrb- consider the fact that there be 434495 free person of color in this country in 1850 and 488070 in 1860 the colonizationist see that the very element of the population which the movement be intend to send out of the country have increase rather than decrease it be clear then that the american colonization society though regard as a factor to play a important part in promote the exodus of the free negro to foreign soil be a inglorious failure colonization in other quarter however be not abandon a colony of negro in texa be contemplate in 1833 prior to the time when the republic become independent of mexico as slavery be not at first assure in that state the _ new york commercial advertiser _ have no objection to the enterprise but feel that there be natural obstacle such as a more expensive conveyance than that to monrovia the high price of land in that country the catholic religion to which negro be not accustom to conform and they lack of knowledge of the spanish language the editor observe that some who have emigrate to hayti a few year before become discontented because they do not know the language louisiana a slave state moreover would not suffer near its border a free negro republic to serve as a asylum for refugee -lrb- 11 -rrb- the richmond whig see the actual situation in dub the scheme as chimerical for the reason that a more unsuitable country for the black do not exist socially and politically it would never suit the negro already a great number of adventurer from the united state have go to texa and fugitive from justice from mexico a fierce lawless and turbulent class would give the negro little chance there as the negro could not contend with the spaniard and the creole the editor believe that a inferior race could never exist in safety surround by a superior one despise they colonization in africa be then urge and the effort of the black to go elsewhere be characterize as do mischief at every turn to defeat the enlighten plan for the amelioration of the negro -lrb- 12 -rrb- it be still think possible to induce the negro to go to some congenial foreign land although few of they would agree to emigrate to africa not a few negro begin during the two decade immediately precede the civil war to think more favorably of african colonization and a still larger number in view of the increase disability fix upon they class thought of migrate to some country nearer to the united state much be say about central america but british guiana and the west indy prove to be the most invite field to the latter-day negro colonizationist this idea be by no means new for jefferson in he foresight have in a letter to governor edward cole of illinoi in 1814 show the possibility of colonization in the west indy he feel that because santo domingo have become a independent negro republic it would offer a solution of the problem as to where the negro should be colonize in this way these island would become a sort of safety valve for the united state he become more and more convinced that all the west indy would remain in the hand of the people of color and a total expulsion of the whites sooner or later would take place it be high time he think that american should foresee the bloody scene which they child certainly and possibly they themselves would have to wade through -lrb- 13 -rrb- the movement to the west indy be accelerate by other factor after the emancipation in those island in the thirty there have for some year be a dearth of labor desire to enjoy they freedom and living in a climate where there be not much struggle for life the freedman either refuse to work regularly or wander about purposely from year to year the island in which sugar have once play a conspicuous part as the foundation of they industry decline and something have to be do to meet this exigency in the forty and fifty therefore there come to the united state a number of labor agent whose aim be to set forth the invite aspect of the situation in the west indy so as to induce free negro to try they fortune there to this end meeting be hold in baltimore philadelphium new york and boston and even in some of the city of the south where these agent appeal to the free negro to emigrate -lrb- l4 -rrb- thus before the american colonization society have get well on its way toward accomplish its purpose of deport the negro to africa the west indy and british guiana claim the attention of free people of color in offer there unusual opportunity after the consummation of british emancipation in those island in 1838 the english nation come to he regard by the negro of the united state as the exclusive friend of the race the negro press and church vie with each other in praise british emancipation as a act of philanthropy and point to the english dominion as a asylum for the oppress so disturbed be the whites by this grow feeling that riot break out in northern city on occasion of negro celebration of the anniversary of emancipation in the west indy -lrb- l5 -rrb- in view of these fact the colonizationist have to redouble they effort to defend they cause they find it a little difficult to make a good case for liberium a land far away in a unhealthy climate so much unlike that of the west indy and british guiana where negro have be declare citizen entitle to all privilege afford by the government the colonizationist could do no more than to express doubt that the negro would have there the opportunity for mental moral and social betterment which be offer in liberium the promoter of the enterprise in africa do not believe that the west indian planter who have have emancipation force upon they would accept black from the united state as they equal nor that they far from receive the consideration of freedman would be there any more than menial when tell of the establishment of school and church for the improvement of the freedman the colonizationist reply that school might be provide but the planter could have no interest in encouraging education as they do not want a elevated class of people but bone and muscle as a evidence of the truth of this statement it be assert that newspaper of the country be fill with disastrous account of the fall off of crop and the scarcity of labor but have little to say about those force instrumental in the uplift of the people -lrb- 16 -rrb- a effort be make also to show that there would be no economic advantage in go to the british dominion it be think that as soon as the first demand for labor be supply wages would be reduce for no new plantation could be open there as in a grow country like liberium it would be impossible therefore for the negro immigrate there to take up land and develop a class of small farmer as they be do in africa under such circumstance they contend the negro in the west indy could not feel any of the elevate influence of nationality of character as the white man would limit the influence of the negro by retain practically all of the wealth of the island the inducement therefore offer the free negro in the united state be merely intend to use they in supply in the british dominion the need of man to do drudgery scarcely more elevate than the toil of slave -lrb- l7 -rrb- determine to interest a larger number of person in divert the attention of the free negro from the west indy the colonizationist take higher ground they assert that the interest of the million of white man in this country be then at stake and even if it would be better for the three million negro of the country gradually to emigrate to the british dominion it would eventually prove prejudicial to the interest of the united state they show how the negro immigrate into the west indy would be make to believe that the refusal to extend to they here social and political equality be cruel oppression and the immigrant therefore would carry with they no good will to this country when they arrive in the west indy they circumstance would increase this hostility alienate they affection and estrange they wholly from the united state teach to regard the british as the exclusive friend of they race devote to its elevation they would become british in spirit as such these negro would be control by british influence and would increase the wealth and commerce of the british and as soldier would greatly strengthen british power -lrb- l8 -rrb- it be better therefore they argue to direct the negro to liberia for those who go there with a feeling of hostility against the white people be place in circumstance operate to remove that feeling in that the kind solicitude for they welfare would be extend they in they new home so as to overcome they prejudice win they confidence and secure they attachment look to this country as they fatherland and the home of they benefactor the liberian would develop a nation take the religion custom and law of this country as they model market they produce in this country and purchase we manufacture in spite of its independence therefore liberium would be american in feel language and interest afford a means to get rid of a class undesirable here but desirable to we there in they power to extend american influence trade and commerce -lrb- l9 -rrb- negro migrate to the west indy in spite of this warning and protest haytus at first look upon with fear of have a free negro government near slaveholding state become fix in the mind of some as a desirable place for the colonization of free person of color -lrb- 20 -rrb- this be due to the apparent natural advantage in soil climate and the situation of the country over other place in consideration it be think that the island would support fourteen million of people and that once open to immigration from the united state it would in a few year fill up by natural increase it be remember that it be formerly the emporium of the western world and that it supply both hemisphere with sugar and coffee it have rapidly recover from the disaster of the french revolution and lack only capital and education which the united state under these circumstance could furnish furthermore it be argue that something in this direction should be immediately do as european nation then seek to establish friendly relation with the island would secure there commercial advantage which the united state should have and could establish by send to that island free negro especially devote to agriculture in 1836 z kingsley a florida planter -lrb- 2l -rrb- actually undertake to carry out such a plan on a small scale he establish on the northeast side of haytus near port plate he son george kingsley a well-educated color man of industrious habit and uncorrupted moral together with six prime african man slave liberate for that express purpose there he purchase for they 35000 acre of land upon which they engage in the production of crop indigenous to that soil haytus however be not to be the only island to get consideration in 1834 two hundred color emigrant go from new york alone to trinidad under the superintendence and at the expense of planter of that island it be later report that every one of they find employment on the day of arrival and in one or two instance the most intelligent be place as overseer at the salary of $ 500 per annum no one receive less than $ 100 a day and most of they earn $ 150 the trinidad press welcome these immigrant and speak in the highest term of the valuable service they render the country -lrb- 22 -rrb- other follow from year to year one of these negro appreciate so much this new field of opportunity that he return and induce twenty intelligent free person of color living in annapoli maryland also to emigrate to trinidad -lrb- 23 -rrb- _ the new york sun _ report in 1840 that 160 color person leave philadelphium for trinidad they have be hire by a eminent planter to labor on that island and they be encourage to expect that they should have privilege which would make they residence desirable the editor wish a few dozen trinidad planter would come to that city on the same business and on a much larger scale -lrb- 24 -rrb- nw pollard agent of the government of trinidad come to baltimore in 1851 to make he appeal for emigrant offer to pay all expense -lrb- 25 -rrb- at a meeting hold in baltimore in 1852 the parent of mr stanbury boyce now a retired merchant in washington district of columbium be also induce to go they find there opportunity which they have never have before and well establish themselves in they new home the account which mr boyce give in a letter to the writer corroborate the newspaper report as to the success of the enterprise -lrb- 26 -rrb- the _ new york journal of commerce _ report in 1841 that accord to advice receive at new orlean from jamaica there have arrive in that island fourteen negro emigrant from the united state be the first fruit of mr barclay 's mission to this country a much larger number of negro be expect and various application for they service have be receive from respectable party -lrb- 27 -rrb- the product of soil be report as much reduce from former year and to meet its demand for labor some freedman from sierra leone be induce to emigrate to that island in 1842 -lrb- 28 -rrb- one mr anderson a agent of the government of jamaica contemplated visit new

national council call in 1853 to promote more effectively the amelioration of the color people the question of emigration and that only be take up for serious consideration but those who desire to introduce the question of liberian colonization or who be especially interested in that scheme be not invite among the person who promote the calling of this council be william webb martin r delaney j

these thousand of negro do on free soil to estimate these achievement the casual reader of contemporary testimony would now as such person do then find it decidedly easy he would say that in spite of the unfailing aid which philanthropist give the black they seldom keep themselves above want and therefore become a public charge afflict they community with so much poverty disease and crime that they be consider the leper of society the student of history however must look beyond these comment for the whole truth one must take into consideration the fact that in most case these negro escape as fugitive without sufficient food and clothing to comfort they until they could reach free soil lack the small fund with which the pioneer usually provide himself in go to establish a home in the wilderness and lack above all initiative of which slavery have deprive they furthermore these refugee with few exception have to go to place where they be not wanted and in some case to point from which they be drive as undesirable although preparation for they come have sometimes go to the extent of purchase home and make provision for employment upon arrival -lrb- 1 -rrb- several well-established negro settlement in the north moreover be break up by the slave hunter after the passing of the fugitive slave law of 1850 -lrb- 2 -rrb- the increase intensity of the hatred of the negro must be understand too both as a cause and result of they intolerable condition prior to 1800 the negro of the north be in fair circumstance until that time it be generally believe that the whites and the black would soon reach the advanced stage of live together on a basis of absolute equality -lrb- 3 -rrb- the negro have not at that time exceed the number that could be assimilate by the sympathize community in that section the intolerable legislation of the south however force so many free negro in the rough to crowd northern city during the first four decade of the nineteenth century that they could not be easily readjust the number seek employment far exceed the demand for labor and thus multiply the number of vagrant and pauper many of whom have already be force to this condition by the irish and german then immigrate into northern city at one time as in the case of philadelphium the negro constitute a small fraction of the population furnish one half of the criminal -lrb- 4 -rrb- a radical opposition to the negro follow therefore arouse first the labor class and finally alienate the support of the well-to-do people and the press this condition obtain until 1840 in most northern community and until 1850 in some place where the negro population be considerable we must also take into account the critical labor situation during these year the northern people be divide as to the way the negro should be encourage the mechanic of the north raise no objection to have the negro free and enlighten but do not welcome they to that section as competitor in the struggle of life when therefore the black convert to the doctrine of train the hand to work with skill begin to appear in northern industrial center there arise a formidable prejudice against they -lrb- 5 -rrb- negro and white mechanic have once work together but during the second quarter of the nineteenth century when labor become more dignified and a larger number of white person devote themselves to skilled labor they adopt the policy of eliminate the black this opposition to be sure be not a mere harmless sentiment it tend to give rise to the organization of labor group and finally to that of trade union the beginning of those control this country today carry the fight against the negro still further these labor class use they influence to obtain legislation against the employment of negro in certain pursuit maryland and georgium pass law restrict the privilege of negro mechanic and pennsylvanium follow they example -lrb- 6 -rrb- even in those case when the negro be not disturb in they new home on free soil it be with the exception of the quaker and a few other community merely a act of toleration -lrb- 7 -rrb- it must not be conclude however that the negro then migrate to the north do not receive considerable aid the fact to be note here be that because they be not well receive sometimes by the people of they new environment the help which they obtain from friend afar off do not suffice to make up for the deficiency of community cooperation this of course be a unusual handicap to the negro as he life as a slave tend to make he a dependent rather than a pioneer it be evident however from accessible statistics that wherever the negro be adequately encourage he succeed when the urban negro in northern community have emerge from they crude state they easily learn from the white man they method of solve the problem of life this tendency be apparent after 1840 and striking result of they effort be note long before the civil war they show a inclination to work when position could be find purchase home acquire other property build church and established school go even further than this some of they take advantage of they opportunity in the business world accumulate considerable fortune just as have be do in certain center in the south where negro have be give a chance -lrb- 8 -rrb- in city far north like boston not so much difference as to the result of this migration be note some economic progress among the negro have early be observe there as a result of the long residence of negro in that city as in the case of lewi hayden who establish a successful clothing business -lrb- 9 -rrb- in new york such evidence be more apparent there be in that city not so many negro as frequent some other northern community of this time but enough to make for that city a decidedly perplexing problem it be the usual situation of ignorant helpless fugitive and free negro go they know not where to find a better country the situation at time become so grave that it not only cause prejudice but give rise to intense opposition against those who defend the cause of the black as in the case of the abolition riot which occur at several place in the state in 1834 -lrb- 10 -rrb- to relieve this situation gerrit smith a unusually philanthropic gentleman come forward with a interesting plan have large tract of land in the southeastern county of new york he propose to settle on small farm a large number of those negro huddle together in the congested district of new york city desire to obtain only the best class he request that the negro to be thus colonize be recommend by reverend charle b ray reverend theodore s wright and dr j mccune smith three negro of new york city know to be representative of the best of the race upon they recommendation he deed unconditionally to black man in 1846 three hundred small farm in franklin essex hamilton fulton oneida delaware madison and ulster county give to each settler beside $ 1000 to enable he to visit he farm -lrb- 11 -rrb- with these holding the black would not only have a basis for economic independence but would have sufficient property to meet the special qualification which new york by the law of 1823 require of negro offer to vote this experiment however be a failure it be not successful because of the intractability of the land the harshness of the climate and in a great measure the inefficiency of the settler they have none of the quality of farmer furthermore have be disable by infirmity and vice they could not as beneficiary answer the call of the benefactor peterboro the town open to negro in this section do maintain a school and serve as a station of the underground railroad but the agricultural result expect of the enterprise never materialize the main difficulty in this case be the impossibility of substitute something foreign for individual enterprise -lrb- 12 -rrb- progressive negro do appear however in other part of the state in penyan western new york william platt and joseph c cassey be successful lumber merchant -lrb- 13 -rrb- mr wh topp of albany be for several year one of the lead merchant tailor of that city -lrb- 14 -rrb- henry scott of new york city develop a successful pickling business supply most of the vessel enter that port -lrb- 15 -rrb- thoma down for thirty year run a creditable restaurant in the midst of the wall street bank where he make a fortune -lrb- 16 -rrb- edward v clark conduct a thriving business handle jewelry and silverware -lrb- 17 -rrb- the negro as a whole moreover have show progress aid by the government and philanthropic white people they have before the civil war a school system with primary intermediate and grammar school and a normal department they then have considerable property several church and some benevolent institution in southern pennsylvanium nearer to the border between the slave and free state the effect of the achievement of these negro be more apparent for the reason that in these urban center there be sufficient negro for one to be helpful to the other philadelphium present then the most striking example of the remaking of these people here the handicap of the foreign element be greatest especially after 1830 the philadelphium negro moreover be further impede in he progress by the presence of southerner who make philadelphium they home and still more by the prejudice of those philadelphium merchant who sustain such close relation to the south hate the negro and the abolitionist who antagonize they customer in spite of these untoward circumstance however the negro of philadelphium achieve success negro who have formerly be able to toil upward be still restricted but they have learn to make opportunity in 1832 the philadelphium black have $ 350000 of taxable property $ 359626 in 1837 and $ 400000 in 1847 these negro have 16 church and 100 benevolent society in 1837 and 19 church and 106 benevolent society in 1847 philadelphium then have more successful negro school than any other city in the country there be also about 500 negro mechanic in spite of the opposition of organize labor -lrb- 18 -rrb- some of these negro of course be native of that city chief among those who have accumulate considerable property be mr jame forten the proprietor of one of the lead sail manufactory constantly employ a large number of man black and white joseph casey a broker of considerable acumen also accumulate desirable property worth probably $ 75000 -lrb- 19 -rrb- crowd out of the higher pursuit of labor certain other enterprising business man of this group organize the guild of caterer this be compose of such man as bogle prosser dorsey jone and minton the aim be to elevate the negro waiter and cook from the plane of menial to that of progressive business man then come stephen smith who amass a large fortune as a lumber merchant and with he whipper vidal and purnell still and bower be reliable coal merchant adger a success in handle furniture bowser a well-known painter and william h riley the intelligent boot-maker -lrb- 20 -rrb- there be a few such successful negro in other community in the state mr william goodrich of york acquire considerable interest in the branch of the baltimore and ohio railroad extend to lancaster -lrb- 21 -rrb- benjamin richard of pittsburgh amass a large fortune

indispensable to pittsburgh by run the concert hall cafe where he serve president william henry harrison in 1840 -lrb- 25 -rrb- the field of greatest achievement however be not in the conservative east where the people have well establish they go toward a enlighten and sympathetic aristocracy of talent and wealth it be in the west where man be in position to establish themselves anew and make of life what they would these crude community to be sure often object to the presence of the negro and sometimes drive they out but on the other hand not a few of those center in the making be in the hand of the quaker and other philanthropic person who give the negro a chance to grow up with the community when they exhibit a capacity which justified philanthropic effort in they behalf these favorable condition obtain especially in the town along the ohio river where so many fugitive and free person of color stop on they way from slavery to freedom in steubenville a number of negro have by they industry and good deportment make themselves helpful to the community stephen mulber who have be in that town for thirty year be in 1835 the leader of a group of thrifty free person of color he have a brick dwelling in which he live and other property in the city he make he living as a master mechanic employ a force of workman to meet the increase demand for he labor -lrb- 26 -rrb- in gallipoli there be another group of this class of negro who have permanently attach themselves to the town by the acquisition of property they be then able not only to provide for they family but be maintain also a school and a church -lrb- 27 -rrb- in portsmouth ohio despite the black Friday upheaval of 1831 the negro settle down to the solution of the problem of they new environment and later show in the accumulation of property evidence of actual progress among the successful negro in columbus be david jenkin who acquire considerable property as a painter glazier and paper hanger -lrb- 28 -rrb- one mr hill of chillicothe be for several year its lead tanner and currier -lrb- 29 -rrb- it be in cincinnatus however that the negro make most progress in the west the migratory black come there at time in such large number as we have observe that they provoke the hostile class of whites to employ rash measure to exterminate they but the negro accustom to adversity struggle on endeavor

weapon that they would continue a public charge they secure the cooperation of a larger number of white people who at first have treat they with contempt -lrb- 31 -rrb- this unusual progress in the ohio valley have be promote by two force the development of the steamboat as a factor in transportation and the rise of the negro mechanic negro employ on vessel as servant to the travel public amass large sum receive in the form of tip furthermore the fortunate few constitute the steward of these vessel could by place contract for supplies and use business method realize handsome income many negro thus enriched purchase real estate and go into business in town along the ohio the other force the rise of the negro mechanic be make possible by overcome much of the prejudice which have at first be encounter a great change in this respect have take place in cincinnatus by 1840 -lrb- 32 -rrb- many negro who have be force to work as menial laborer then have the opportunity to show they usefulness to they family and to the community negro mechanic be then get as much skilled labor as they could do it be not uncommon for white artisan to solicit employment of color man because they have the reputation of be better paymaster than master workman of the favored race white mechanic not only work with the black but often associate with they patronize the same barber shop and go to the same place of amusement -lrb- 33 -rrb- out of this group come some very useful negro among whom may be mention robert harlan the horseman av thompson the tailor j presley and thoma ball contractor and samuel t wilcox the merchant who be worth $ 60000 in 1859 -lrb- 34 -rrb- there be among they two other successful negro henry boyd and robert gordon boyd be a kentucky freedman who help to overcome the prejudice in cincinnatus against negro mechanic by invent and exploit a cord bed the demand for which be extensive throughout the ohio and mississippus valley he have a creditable manufacturing business in which he employ twenty-five man -lrb- 35 -rrb- robert gordon be a much more interesting man he be bear a slave in richmond virginium he ingratiate himself into the favor of he master who place he in charge of a large coal yard with the privilege of sell the slake for he own benefit in the course of time he accumulate in this position thousand of dollar with which he finally purchase himself and move away to free soil after observe the situation in several of the northern center he finally decide to settle in cincinnatus where he arrive with $ 15000 know the coal business he well establish himself there after some discouragement and opposition he accumulate much wealth which he invest in united state bond during the civil war and in real estate on walnut hill when the bond be later redeem -lrb- 36 -rrb- the ultimately favorable attitude of the people of detroit toward immigrate negro have be reflect by the position the people of that section have take from the time of the earliest settlement generally speak detroit adhere to this position -lrb- 37 -rrb- in this congenial community prosper many a negro family there be the william ' most of whom confine themselves to they trade of bricklaying and amass considerable wealth then there be the cook descend from lomax b cook a broker of no little business ability will marion cook the musician belong to this family the de baptistes too be among the first to succeed in this new home as they prosper materially from they experience and knowledge previously acquire in fredericksburg virginium as contractor from this group come richard de baptiste who in he day be the most useful negro baptist preacher in the northwest -lrb- 38 -rrb- the pelham be no less successful in establish themselves in the economic world have a excellent reputation in the community they easily secure the cooperation of the influential white people in the city out of this family come robert a pelham for year editor of a weekly in detroit and from 1901 to the present time a employee of the federal government in washington the child of the richard another old family be in no sense inferior to the descendant of the other the most prominent and the most useful to emerge from this group be the daughter fannie m richard she be bear in fredericksburg virginium October 1 1841 have leave that state with she parent when she be quite young she do not see so much of the antebellum condition obtain there desire to have better training than what be then give to person of color in detroit she go to toronto where she study english history drawing and needlework in later year she attend the teacher ' training school in detroit she become a public-school teacher there in 1863 and after fifty year of creditable service in this work she be retire on a pension in 1913 -lrb- 39 -rrb- the negro in the north have not only show they ability to rise in the economic world when properly encourage but have begin to exhibit power of all kind there be negro inventor a few lawyer a number of physician and dentist many teacher a score of intelligent preacher some scholar of note and even successful black in the finer art some of these with frederick douglass as the most influential be also do creditable work in journalism with about thirty newspaper which have develop among the negro as weapon of defense -lrb- 40 -rrb- this progress of the negro in the north be much more marked after the middle of the nineteenth century the migration of negro to northern community be at first check by the reaction in those place during the thirty and forty thus relieve of the large influx which once constitute a menace those community give the negro already on hand better economic opportunity it be fortunate too that prior to the check in the infiltration of the black they have come into certain district in sufficiently large number to become a more potential factor -lrb- 41 -rrb- they be strong enough in some case to make common cause against foe and could by cooperation solve many problem with which the black in dispersed condition could not think of grapple they endeavor along these line proceed in many case from well-organized effort like those culminate in the numerous national convention which begin meet first in philadelphium in 1830 and after some year of deliberation in this city extend to other in the north -lrb- 42 -rrb- these body aim not only to promote education religion and moral but take up the work which the quaker begin they put forth effort to secure to the free black opportunity to be train in the mechanic art to equip themselves for participation in the industry then spring up throughout the north this movement however do not succeed in the proportion to the effort put forth because of the increase power of the trade union after the middle of the nineteenth century too the negro find condition a little more favorable to they progress than the generation before the aggressive south have by that time so shape the policy of the nation as not only to force the free state to cease aid the escape of fugitive but to undertake to impress the northerner into the service of assist in they recapture as provide in the fugitive slave law this repressive measure set a larger number of the people think of the negro as a national problem rather than a local one the attitude of the north be then reflect in the personal liberty law as a answer to this measure and in the increase sympathy for the negro during this decade therefore more be do in the north to secure to the negro better treatment and to give they opportunity for improvement -lrb- footnote 1 : _ cincinnatus morning herald _ July 17 1846 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 2 : woodson _ the education of the

they leave the slave and sometimes poor whites to escape where they would or to remain in helpless condition to constitute a problem for the northern army -lrb- 1 -rrb- many poor whites of the border state go with the confederacy not always because they want to enter the war but to choose what they consider the lesser of two evil the slave soon realize a community of interest with the union force send as they think to deliver they from thralldom at first it be difficult to determine a fixed policy for deal with these fugitive to drive they away be a easy matter but this do not solve the problem general butler 's action at fortress monroe in 1861 however anticipate the policy finally adopt by the union force -lrb- 2 -rrb- hearing that three fugitive slave who be receive into he line be to have be employ in building fortification for the confederate army he declare they seize as contraband of war rather than declare they actually free as do general fremont -lrb- 3 -rrb- and general hunter -lrb- 4 -rrb- he then give they employment for wages and ration and appropriate to the support of the unemployed a portion of the earnings of the laborer this policy be follow by general wood butler 's successor and by general bank in new orlean a elaborate plan for handle such fugitive be carry out by e pierce and general rufus saxton at port royal south carolina see the situation in another light however general halleck in charge in the west exclude slave from the union line at first as do general dix in virginium but halleck in he instruction to general mccullum February 1862 order he to put contraband to work to pay for food and clothing -lrb- 5 -rrb- other commander like general mccook and general johnson permit the slave hunter to enter they line and take they slave upon identification -lrb- 6 -rrb- ignore the confiscation act of August 1861 which be construe by some as justify the retention of such refugee officer of a different attitude however soon begin to protest against the return of fugitive slave general grant also while admit the binding force of general halleck 's order refuse to grant permit to those in search of fugitive seek asylum within he line and at the capture of fort donelson order the retention of all black who have be use by the confederate in building fortification -lrb- 7 -rrb- lincoln finally urge the necessity for withhold fugitive slave from the enemy believe that there could be in it no danger of servile insurrection and that the confederacy would thereby be weaken -lrb- 8 -rrb- as this opinion soon develop into a conviction that official action be necessary congress by act of march 13 1862 provide that slave be protect against the claim of they pursuer continue further in this direction the federal government gradually reach the position of withdraw negro labor from the confederate territory finally the united state government adopt the policy of withholding from the confederate slave receive with the understanding that they master be in rebellion against the united state with this as a settle policy then the united state government have to work out some scheme for the remaking of these fugitive come into its camp in some of these case the fugitive find themselves among man more hostile to they than they master be for many of the union soldier of the border state be slaveholder themselves and northern soldier do not understand that they be fight to free negro the condition in which they be on arrive moreover be a new problem for the army some come naked some in decrepitude some afflict with disease and some wound in they effort to escape -lrb- 9 -rrb- there be woman in travail the helplessness of childhood and of old age the horror of sickness and of frequent death -lrb- 10 -rrb- in they crude state few of they have any conception of the significance of liberty thinking that it mean idleness and freedom from restraint in consequence of this ignorance there develop such undesirable habit as deceit theft and licentiousness to aggravate the affliction of nakedness famine and disease -lrb- 11 -rrb- in the east large number of these refugee be concentrate at washington alexandrium fortress monroe hampton craney island and fort norfolk there be smaller group of they at yorktown suffolk and portsmouth -lrb- 12 -rrb- -lrb- illustration : map show the per cent of negro in total population by state : 1910 -lrb- map 2 bulletin 129 the united state bureau of the census -rrb- -rrb- some of they be conduct from these camp into york columbium harrisburg pittsburgh and philadelphium and by water to new york and boston from which they go to various part seek labor some collect in group as in the case of those at five point in new york -lrb- 13 -rrb- large number of they from virginium assemble in washington in 1862 in duff green 's row on capitol hill where they be organize as a camp out of which come a contraband school after be move to the mcclellan barracks -lrb- 14 -rrb- then there be in the district of columbium another group know as freedman 's village on arlington height it be say that in 1864 30000 to 40000 negro have come from the plantation to the district of columbium -lrb- 15 -rrb- it happen here too as in most case of this migration that the negro be on hand before the official grapple with many other problem could determine exactly what could or should be do with they the camp near washington fortunately become center for the employment of contraband in the city those repair to fortress monroe be distribute as laborer among the farmer of that vicinity -lrb- 16 -rrb- -lrb- illustration : diagram show the negro population of northern and western city in 1900 and the extent to which it increase by 1910 county in the southern state have at least 50 per cent of they population negro -lrb- map 3 and 4 bulletin 129 we bureau of the census -rrb- -lrb- map 5 and 6 bulletin 129 we bureau of the census -rrb- -rrb- in some of these camp and especially in those of the west the refugee be finally send out to other section in need of labor as in the case of the contraband assemble with the union army at first at grand junction and later at memphi -lrb- 17 -rrb- there be three type of these camp community which attract attention as place for free labor experimentation these be at port royal on the mississippus in the neighborhood of vicksburg and in lower louisiana and virginium the first trial of free labor of black on a large scale in a slave state be make in port royal -lrb- 18 -rrb- the experiment be generally successful by industry thrift and orderly conduct the negro show they appreciation for they new opportunity in the mississippus section invade by the northern army general thoma open what he call _ infirmary farm _ which he lease to negro on certain term which they usually meet successfully the same plan however be not so successful in the lower mississippus section -lrb- 19 -rrb- the failure in this section be doubtless due to the inferior type of black in the lower cotton belt where negro have be more brutalize by slavery in some case these refugee experience many hardship it be charge that they be work hard badly treat and deprive of all they wages except what be give they for ration and a scanty pittance wholly insufficient to purchase necessary clothing and provide for they family -lrb- 20 -rrb- not a few of the refugee for these reason apply for permission to return to they master and sometimes such permission be grant for although under military authority they be by order of congress to be consider as freeman these voluntary slave of course be few and the authority be not thereby impressed with the thought that negro would prefer to be slave should they be treat as freeman rather than as brute -lrb- 21 -rrb- it become increasingly difficult however to handle this problem in the first place it be not a easy matter to find soldier well dispose to serve the negro in any manner whatever and the officer of the army have no desire to force they to render such service since those thus engage suffer a sort of social ostracism the same condition obtain in the case of care for those afflict with disease until there be issue a specific regulation place the contraband sick in charge of the army surgeon -lrb- 22 -rrb- what the situation in the mississippus valley be during these month have be well describe by a observer say : i hope i may never be call on again to witness the horrible scene i saw in those first day of history of the freedman in the mississippus valley assistant be hard to find especially the kind that would do any good in the camp a detailed soldier in each camp of a thousand people be the best that could be do and he duty be so onerous that he end by do nothing in review the condition of the people at that time i be not surprise at the marvelous story tell by visitor who catch a occasional glimpse of the misery and wretchedness in these camp we effort to do anything for these people as they herd together in mass when found on any expectation that they would help themselves often fail they have become so completely break down in spirit through suffer that it be almost impossible to arouse they -lrb- 23 -rrb- a few sympathetic officer and especially the chaplain undertake to relieve the urgent case of distress they could do little however to handle all the problem of the unusual situation until they engage the attention of the higher officer of the army and the federal functionary in washington after some delay this be finally do and special officer be detail to take charge of the contraband the negro be assemble in camp and employ accord to instruction from the secretary of war as teamster laborer and the like on fort and railroad some be put to pick ginning baling and remove cotton on plantation abandon by they master general grant as early as 1862 be make further use of they as fatigue man in the department of the surgeon-general the quartermaster and the commissary he believe then that such negro as do well in these more humble position should be make citizen and soldier -lrb- 24 -rrb- as a matter of fact out of this very suggestion come the policy of arm the negro the first regiment of whom be recruit under order issue by general hunter at port royal south carolina in 1862 as the arming of the slave to participate in this war do not generally please the white people who consider the struggle a war between civilized group this policy could not offer general relief to the congested contraband camp -lrb- 25 -rrb- a better system of handle the fugitive be finally work out however with a general superintendent at the head of each department support by a number of competent assistant more explicit instruction be give as to the manner of deal with the situation it be to be the duty of the superintendent of contraband say the order to organize they into work party in save the cotton as pioneer on railroad and steamboat and in any way where they service could be make available where labor be perform for private individual they be charge in accordance with the order of the commander of the department in case they be direct to save abandon crop of cotton for the benefit of the united state government the officer sell such crop would turn over to the superintendent of contraband the proceeds of the sale which together with other earnings be use for clothing and feed the negro clothing send by philanthropic person to these camp be receive and distribute by the superintendent in no case however be negro to be force into the service of the united state government or to be entice away from they home except when it become a military necessity -lrb- 26 -rrb- some order out of the chaos eventually develop for as john eaton one of the worker in the west report : there be no promiscuous intermingling family be establish by themselves every man take care of he own wife and child one of the most touching feature of we work say he be the eagerness with which color man and woman avail themselves of the opportunity offer they to legalize union already form some of which have be in existence for a long time -lrb- 27 -rrb- chaplain as fiske on one occasion marry in about a hour one hundred and nineteen couple at one service chiefly those who have long live together letter from the virginium camp and from those of port royal indicate that this favorable condition generally obtain -lrb- 28 -rrb- this unusual problem in spite of additional effort however would not readily admit of solution benevolent worker of the north therefore begin to minister to the need of these unfortunate black they send considerable sum of money increase quantity of clothing and even some of they most devoted man and woman to toil among they as social worker and teacher -lrb- 29 -rrb- these effort also take organized form in various part of the north under the direction of _ the pennsylvanium freedman 's relief association the tract society the american missionary association pennsylvanium friend freedman 's relief association old school presbyterian mission the reform presbyterian mission the new england freedman 's aid committee the new england freedman 's aid society the new england freedman 's mission the washington christian union the universalist of maine the new york freedman 's relief association the hartford relief society the national freedman 's relief association of the district of columbium _ and finally the _ freedman 's bureau _ -lrb- 30 -rrb- as a outlet to the congested grouping of negro and poor whites in the war camp it be arrange to send a number of they to the loyal state as fast as there present themselves opportunity for find home and employment cairo illinoi in the west become the center of such activity extend its ramification into all part of the invade southern territory some of the refugee permanently settle in the north take up the work abandon by the northern soldier who go to war -lrb- 31 -rrb- it be soon find necessary to appoint a superintendent of such affair at cairo for there be those who desire to lead a straggle life have to be restrain from crime by military surveillance and regulation require labor for self-support exactly how many whites and black be thus aid to reach northern community can not be determine but in view of the frequent mention of they movement by traveller the number must have be considerable in some case as in lawrence kansa there be assemble enough freedmen to constitute a distinct group -lrb- 32 -rrb- speaking of this settlement the editor of the _ alton telegraph _ say in 1862 that although they amount to many hundred not one that he could learn of have be a public charge they readily find employment at fair wages and soon make themselves comfortable -lrb- 33 -rrb- there be a little apprehension that the north would be overrun by such black some have no such fear however for the reason that the census do not indicate such a movement many slave be free in the north prior to 1860 yet with all the emigration from the slave state to the north there be then in all the northern state but 226152 free black while there be in the slave state 261918 a excess of 35766 in the slave state frederick starr believe that during the civil war there might be a influx for a few month but it would not continue -lrb- 34 -rrb- they would return when sure that they would be free starr think that if necessary these refugee might be use in build the much desire pacific railroad to divert they from the north there be little ground for this apprehension in fact if they readjustment and development in the contraband camp could be consider a indication of what the negro would eventually do take all thing into consideration most unbiased observer feel that black in the camp deserve well of they benefactor -lrb- 36 -rrb- accord to levus coffin these contraband be in 1864 disposed of as follow : in military service as soldier laundress cook officer ' servant and laborer in the various staff department 41150 in city on plantation and in freedman 's village and care for 72500 of these 62300 be entirely self-supporting just as any industrial class anywhere else as planter mechanic barber hackman and drayman conduct enterprise on they own responsibility or work as hire laborer the remain 10200 receive subsistence from the government 3000 of these be member of family whose head be carry on plantation and have undertake cultivation of 4000 acre of cotton pledge themselves to pay the government for they subsistence from the first income of the crop the other 7200 include the pauper that be all negro over and under the self-supporting age the cripple and sick in hospital this class however instead of be unproductive have then under cultivation 500 acre of corn 790 acre of vegetable and 1500 acre of cotton besides work at wood chop and other industry there be report in the aggregate over 100000 acre of cotton under cultivation 7000 acre of which be lease and cultivate by black some negro be manage as many as 300 or 400 acre each -lrb- 37 -rrb- statistics show exactly how much the number of contraband in the various branch of the service increase be want but in view of the fact that the few thousand soldier here give increase to about 200000 before the close of the civil war the other number must have be considerable if they all grow the least proportionately much industry be show among these refugee under this new system they acquire the idea of ownership and of the security of wages and learn to see the fundamental difference between freedom and slavery some yankee however see that they do less work than do laborer in the north consider they lazy but the lack of industry be customary in the south and a river should not be expect to rise higher than its source one of they superintendent say that they work well without be urge that there be among they a public opinion against idleness which answer for discipline and that those put to work with soldier labor longer and do the nicer part in natural tact and the faculty of get a livelihood say the same writer the contraband be inferior to the yankee but quite equal to the mass of southern population -lrb- 38 -rrb- the negro also show capacity to organize labor and use capital in the promotion of enterprise many of they purchase land and cultivate it to great profit both to the community and to themselves other enter the service of the government as mechanic and contractor from the employment of which some of they realize handsome income the more important development however be that of manhood this be best observe in they grow consciousness of rights and they readiness to defend they even when encroach upon by member of the white race they quickly learn to appreciate freedom and exhibit evidence of manhood in they desire for the comfort and convenience of life they readily purchase article of furniture within they means bring they home equipment up to the standard of that of person similarly circumstance the indisposition to labor be overcome in a healthy nature by instinct and motive of superior force such as love of life the desire to be clothe and feed the sense of security derive from provision for the future the feeling of self-respect the love of family and child and the conviction of duty -lrb- 39 -rrb- these enterprise begin in doubt soon cease to be a bare hope or possibility they become during the war a fruition and a consummation in that they produce negro who would work for a living and fight for freedom they be therefore consider adapt to civil society they have show capacity for knowledge for free industry for subordination to law and discipline for soldierly fortitude for social and family relation for religious culture and aspiration these quality say the observer when stir and sustain by the incitement and reward of a just society and combine with the current of we continental civilization will under the guidance of a benevolent providence which forget neither they nor we make they a constantly progressive race and secure they ever after from the calamity of another enslavement and ourselves from the worst calamity of be they oppressor -lrb- 40 -rrb- it be clear that these smaller number of negro under favorable condition could be easily adjust to a new environment when however all negro be declare free there set in a confused migration which be much more of a problem the first thing the negro do after realize that he be free be to roam over the country to put he freedom to a test to do this accord to many writer he frequently change he name residence employment and wife sometimes carry with he from the plantation the fruit of he own labor many of they easily acquire a dog and a gun and be dispose to devote they time to the chase until the assistance in the form of mule and land expect from the government materialize they emancipation therefore be interpret not only as freedom from slavery but from responsibility -lrb- 41 -rrb- where they be go they do not know but the town and city become very attractive to they speak of this upheaval in virginium eckenrode say that many of they roam over the country without restraint -lrb- 42 -rrb- release from they accustomed bond say hall and fill with a please if not vague sense of uncontrolled freedom they flock to the city with little hope of obtain remunerative work wagon load of they be bring in from the country by the soldier and dump down to shift for themselves -lrb- 43 -rrb- refer to the proclamation of freedom in georgium thompson assert that they most general and universal response be to pick up and leave the home place to go somewhere else preferably to a town the lure of the city be strong to the black appeal to they social nature to they inherent love for a crowd -lrb- 44 -rrb- davi maintain that thousand of the 70000 negro in florida crowd into the federal military camp and into town upon realize that they be free -lrb- 45 -rrb- accord to ficklen the exodus of the slave from the neighbor plantation of louisiana into baton rouge carrollton and new orlean be so great as to strain the resource of the federal authority to support they ten thousand pour into new orlean alone -lrb- 46 -rrb- fleming record that upon leave they home the black collect in gang at the cross road in the village and town especially near the military post the town be fill with crowd of black who leave they home with absolutely nothing think that the government would care for they or more probably not think at all -lrb- 47 -rrb- the portrayal of these writer of this phase of reconstruction history contain a general truth but in some case the picture be overdrawn the student of history must bear in mind that practically all of we history of that period be base altogether on the testimony of prejudiced whites and be write from they point of view some of these writer have aim to exaggerate the vagrancy of the black to justify the radical procedure of the whites in deal with it the negro do wander about thoughtlessly believe that this be the most effective way to enjoy they freedom but nothing else could be expect from a class who have never feel anything but the heel of oppression history show that such vagrancy have always follow the immediate emancipation of a large number of slave many negro who flock to the town and army camp moreover have like they master and poor whites see they home break up or destroy by the invade union army whites who have never learn to work be also roam and in some case constitute maraud band -lrb- 48 -rrb- there be moreover a actual drain of laborer to the lower and more productive land in mississippus and louisiana -lrb- 49 -rrb- this develop later into a more considerable movement toward the southwest just after the civil war the exodus be from south carolina georgia alabama and mississippus to louisiana arkansa and texa here be the pioneering spirit a go to the land of more economic opportunity this slow movement continue from about 1865 to 1875 when the development of the numerous railway system give rise to land speculator who induce whites and black to go west and southwest it be a migration of individual but it be report that as many as 35000 negro be then persuade to leave south carolina and georgia for arkansa and texa -lrb- 50 -rrb- the usual charge that the negro be naturally migratory be not true this impression be often receive by person who hear of the thousand of negro who move from one place to another from year to year because of the desire to improve they unhappy condition in this there be no tendency to migrate but a urgent need to escape undesirable condition in fact one of the american negro ' greatest shortcoming be that they be not sufficiently pioneering statistics show that the whites have more inclination to move from state to state than the negro to prove this assertion -lrb- 51 -rrb- professor william o scrogg have show that in 1910 166 per cent of the negro have move to some other state than that in which they be bear while during the same period 224 per cent of the whites have do the same -lrb- 52 -rrb- the south however be not dispose to look at the vagrancy of the ex-slave so philosophically that section have be devastate by war and to rebuild these waste place reliable labor be necessary legislature of the slave state therefore immediately after the close of the war grant the negro nominal freedom but enact measure of vagrancy and labor so as to reduce the negro again almost to the status of a slave white magistrate be give wide discretion in adjudging negro vagrant -lrb- 53 -rrb- negro have to sign contract to work if without what be consider a just cause the negro leave the employ of a planter the former could be arrest and force to work and in some section with ball and chain if the employer do not care to take he back he could be hire out by the county or confine in jail mississippus louisiana and south carolina have further drastic feature by local ordinance in louisiana every negro have to be in the service of some white person and by special law of south carolina and mississippi the negro become subject to a master almost in the same sense in which he be prior to emancipation -lrb- 54 -rrb- these law of course convince the government of the united state that the south have not yet decide to let slavery go and for that reason military rule and congressional reconstruction follow in this respect the south do itself a great injury for many of the provision of the black code especially the vagrancy law be unnecessary most negro soon realize that freedom do not mean relief from responsibility and they quickly settle down to work after a rather protracted and exciting holiday -lrb- 55 -rrb- during the last year of and immediately after the civil war there set in another movement not of a large number of negro but of the intelligent class who have during year of residence in the north enjoy such advantage of contact and education as to make they desirable and useful as leader in the reconstruction of the south and the remaking of the race in they tirade against the carpet-bag politician who handle the reconstruction situation so much to the dissatisfaction of the southern whites historian often forget to mention also that a large number of the negro leader who participate in that drama be also native or resident of northern state three motive impel these black to go south some have find northern community so hostile as to impede they progress many want to rejoin relative from whom they have be separate by they flight from the land of slavery and other be move by the spirit of adventure to enter a new field ripe with all sort of opportunity this movement together with that of migration to large urban community largely account for the depopulation and the consequent decline of certain color community in the north after 1865 some of the negro who return to the south become man of national prominence william j simmon who prior to the civil war be carry from south carolina to pennsylvanium return to do religious and educational work in kentucky bishop jame w hood of the african methodist episcopal zion church go from connecticut to north carolina to engage in similar work honorable rt greener the first negro

of slave many negro desert the south for the promising west to grow up with the country the immediate cause be doubtless political _ bulldoze _ a rather vague term cover all such crime as political injustice and persecution be the source of most complaint the abridgment of the negro ' rights have affect they as a great calamity they have learn that voting be one of the highest privilege to be obtain in this life and they want to go where they might still exercise that privilege that persecution be the main cause be dispute however as there be case of negro migrate from part where no such condition obtain yet some of the whites give they version of the situation admit that violent method have be use so to intimidate the negro as to compel they to vote accord to the dictation of the whites it be also learn that the _ bulldozer _ concern in dethrone the non-taxpaying black be a impecunious and irresponsible group themselves lead by man of the wealthy class -lrb- 1 -rrb- come to the defense of the whites some say that much of the persecution with which the black be afflict be due to the fear of negro uprising the terror of the day of slavery the whites however do practically nothing to remove the underlie cause they do not encourage education and make no effort to cure the negro of fault for which slavery itself be to be blame and consequently could not get the confidence of the black the race tend rather to drift apart the negro live in fear of reenslavement while the whites believe that the war between the north and south would soon be renew some negro think likewise seek to go to the north to be among friend the black of course have come so to regard southern whites as they enemy as to render impossible a voluntary division in politics among the worst of all fault of the whites be they unwillingness to labor and they tendency to do mischief -lrb- 2 -rrb- as there be so many to live on the labor of the negro they be reduce to a state a little better than that of bondage the master class be generally unfair to the black no longer responsible for they as slave the planter endeavor after the war to get they labor for nothing the negro themselves have no land no mule no press nor cotton gin and they could not acquire sufficient capital to obtain these thing they be make victim of fraud in sign contract which they could not understand and have to suffer the consequent privation and want aggravate by robbery and murder by the ku klux klan -lrb- 3 -rrb- the murder of negro be common throughout the south and especially in louisiana in 1875 general sheridan say that as many as 3500 person have be kill and wound in that state the great majority of whom be negro that 1884 be kill and wound in 1868 and probably 1200 between 1868 and 1875 frightful massacre occur in the parish of bossier catahoulum saint bernard grant and orlean as most of these murder be for political reason the offender be regard by they community as hero rather than as criminal a massacre of negro begin in the parish of st landry on the 28th of September and continue for three day result in the death of from 300 to 400 thirteen captive be take from the jail and shot and as many as twenty-five dead body be find burn in the wood there break out in the parish of bossier another three-day riot during which two hundred negro be massacre more than forty black be kill in the parish of caddo during the follow month in fact the number of murder maiming and whipping during these month aggregate over one thousand -lrb- 4 -rrb- the result be that the intelligent negro be either intimidate or kill so that the illiterate mass of negro voter might be order to refrain from vote the republican ticket to strengthen the democrat or be subject to starvation through the operation of the mischievous land tenure and credit system what be not do in 1868 to overthrow the republican regime be accomplish by a renew and extend use of such drastic measure throughout the south in 1876 certain whites maintain however that the unrest be due to the work of radical politician at the north who have send they emissary south to delude the negro into a fever of migration some say it be a scheme to force the nomination of a certain republican candidate for president in 1880 other lay it to the charge of the defeat white and black republican who have be throw from power by the whites upon regain control of the reconstructed state -lrb- 5 -rrb- a few insist that a speech deliver by senator windom in 1879 have give stimulus to the migration -lrb- 6 -rrb- many southerner say that speculator in kansa have adopt this plan to increase the value of they land then there be other theory as to the fundamental cause each consist of a charge of one political faction that some other have give rise to the movement vary accord as they be bourbon conservative native white republican carpet-bag republican or black republican impartial observer however be satisfy that the movement be spontaneous to the extent that the black be ready and willing to go probably no more inducement be offer they than to other citizen among whom land company send agent to distribute literature but the fundamental cause of the unrest be economic for since the civil war race trouble have never be sufficient to set in motion a large number of negro the discontent result from the land-tenure and credit system which have restore slavery in a modified form -lrb- 7 -rrb- after the civil war a few negro in those part where such opportunity be possible invest in real estate offer for sale by the impoverished and ruin planter of the conquer commonwealth when however the negro lose they political power they property be seize on the plea for delinquent tax and they be force into the ghetto of town and city as it become a crime punishable by social proscription to sell negro desirable residence the aim be to debase all negro to the status of menial labor in conformity with the usual contention of the south that slavery be the normal condition of the black -lrb- 8 -rrb- most of the land of the south however always remain as large tract hold by the planter of cotton who never think of alienate it to the negro to make they a race of small farmer in fact they have not the means to make extensive purchase of land even if the planter have be dispose to transfer it still subject to the experimentation of white man the negro accept the plan of pay they wages but this fail in all part except in the sugar district where the black remain contented save when disturb by political movement they then try all system of work on share in the cotton district but this be finally abandon because the planter in some case be not able to advance the negro tenant supplies pend the growth of the crop and some find the negro too indifferent and lazy to make the partnership desirable then come the rent system which during the reconstruction period be general in the cotton district this system throw the tenant on he own responsibility and frequently make he the victim of he own ignorance and the rapacity of the white man as exorbitant price be charge for rent usually six to ten dollar a acre for land worth fifteen to thirty dollar a acre the negro tenant not only do not accumulate anything but have reason to rejoice at the end of the year if he find himself out of debt -lrb- 9 -rrb- along with this go the credit system which furnish the capstone of the economic structure so harmful to the negro tenant this system make the negro dependent for they living on a advance of supplies of food clothing or tool during the year secure by a lien on the crop when harvest as the negro have no chance to learn business method during the day of slavery they fall a prey to a class of loan shark harpy and vampire who establish store everywhere to extort from these ignorant tenant by the mischievous credit system they whole income before they crop could be gather -lrb- 10 -rrb- some planter who sympathize with the negro bring forward the scheme of protect they by advance certain necessity at more reasonable price as the planter himself however be subject to usury the scheme do not give much relief the negro ' crop therefore when gather go either to the merchant or to the planter to pay the rent for the merchant 's supplies be secure by a mortgage on the tenant 's personal property and a pledge of the grow crop this often prevent negro laborer in the employ of black tenant from get they wages at the end of the year for although the laborer have also a lien on the grow crop the merchant and the planter usually have theirs record first and secure thereby the support of the law to force the payment of they claim the negro tenant then begin the year with three mortgage cover all he own he labor for the coming year and all he expect to acquire during that twelvemonth he pay one-third of he product for the use of the land he pay a exorbitant fee for record the contract by which he pay he pound of flesh he be charge two or three time as much as he ought to pay for gin he cotton and finally he turn over he crop to be eat up in commission if any be still leave to he -lrb- 11 -rrb- the worst of all result from this iniquitous system be its effect on the negro themselves it make the negro extravagant and unscrupulous convinced that no share of they crop would come to they when harvest they do not exert themselves to produce what they could they often abandon they crop before harvest know that they have already spend they in case however where the negro tenant have acquire mule horse or tool upon which the speculator have a mortgage the black be actually bind to they landlord to secure the property it be soon evident that in the end the white man himself be the loser by this evil system there appear waste place in the country improvement be want land lay idle for lack of sufficient labor and that which be cultivate yield a diminish return on account of the ignorance and improvidence of those till it these negro as a rule have lose the ambition to become landowner prefer to invest they surplus money in personal effect and in the few case where the negro be induce to undertake the buying of land they often tire of the responsibility and give it up -lrb- 12 -rrb- there begin in the spring of 1879 therefore a emigration of the negro from louisiana and mississippus to kansa for some time there be a stampede from several river parish in louisiana and from county just opposite they in mississippus it be estimate that from five to ten thousand leave they home before the movement could be check person of influence soon busy themselves in show the black the necessity for remain in the south and those who have not then go or prepare to go be persuade to return to the plantation this lull in the excitement however be merely temporary for many negro have merely return home to make more extensive preparation for leave the follow spring the movement be accelerate by the work of two negro leader of some note mose singleton of tennessee the self-styled mose of the exodus and henry adam of louisiana who credit himself with have organize for this purpose as many as 98000 black take this movement seriously a convention of the lead whites and black be hold at vicksburg mississippus on the sixth of may 1879 this body be control mainly by unsympathetic but diplomatic whites general nr mile of yazoo county mississippus be elect president and aw crandall of louisiana secretary after make some meaningless but eloquent speech the convention appoint a committee on credentials and adjourn until the follow day on reassemble colonel wl nugent chairman of the committee present a certain preamble and resolution cite cause of the exodus and suggest remedy among the cause think he be : the low price of cotton and the partial failure of the crop the irrational system of plant adopt in some section whereby labor be deprive of intelligence to direct it and the presence of economy to make it profitable the vicious system of credit foster by law permit laborer and tenant to mortgage crop before they be grow or even plant the apprehension on the part of many colored people produce by insidious report circulate among they that they civil and political rights be endanger or be likely to be the hurtful and false rumor diligently disseminate that by emigrate to kansa the negro would obtain land mule and money from the government without cost to themselves and become independent forever -lrb- 13 -rrb- refer to the grievance and propose a redress the committee admit that error have be commit by the whites and black alike as each in turn have control the government of the state there represent the committee believe that the interest of planter and laborer landlord and tenant be identical that they must prosper or suffer together and that it be the duty of the planter and landlord of the state there represent to devise and adopt some contract by which both party would receive the full benefit of labor govern by intelligence and economy the convention affirm that the negro race have be place by the constitution of the united state and the state there represent and the law thereof on a plane of absolute equality with the white race and declare that the negro race should be accord the practical enjoyment of all civil and political rights guarantee by the say constitution and law the convention pledge itself to use whatever of power and influence it possess to protect the negro race against all danger in respect to the fair expression of they will at the poll which they apprehend might result from fraud intimidation or _ bulldoze _ on the part of the whites and as there could be no liberty of action without freedom of thought they demand that all election should be fair and free and that no repressive measure should be employ by the negro to deprive they own race in part of the fullest freedom in the exercise of the highest right of citizenship -lrb- 14 -rrb- the committee then recommend the abolition of the mischievous credit system call upon the negro to contradict false report as to crime of the whites against they and after consider the negro ' right to emigrate urge that they proceed about it with reason ex-governor foote of mississippus submit a plan to establish in every county a committee compose of man who have the confidence of both whites and black to be auxiliary to the public authority to listen to complaint and arbitrate advise conciliate or prosecute as each case should demand but unwilling to do more than make temporary concession the majority reject foote 's plan -lrb- 15 -rrb- the whites think also to stop the exodus by induce the steamboat line not to furnish the emigrant ' transportation negro be also detain by writ obtain by prefer against they false charge some who be willing to let the negro go think of import white and chinese labor to take they place hearing of the movement and think that he could offer a remedy senator dw voorhee of indiana introduce a resolution in the united state senate authorize a inquiry into the cause of the exodus -lrb- 16 -rrb- the movement however could not be stop and it become so widespread that the people in general be force to give it serious think man in favor of it declare they view organize migration society and appoint agent to promote the enterprise of remove the freedman from the south become a national measure therefore the migration evoke expression from frederick douglass and richard t greener two of the most prominent negro in the united state douglass believe that the exodus be ill-timed he see in it the abandonment of the great principle of protection to person and property in every state of the union he feel that if the negro could not be protect in every state the federal government be shear of its rightful dignity and power the late rebellion have triumph the sovereign of the nation be a empty vessel and the power and authority in individual state be supreme he think therefore that it be better for the negro to stay in the south than to go north as the south be a better market for the black man 's labor douglass believe that the negro should be warn against a nomadic life he do not see any more benefit in the migration to kansa than he have year before in the emigration to africa the negro have a monopoly of labor at the south and they would be too insignificant in number to have such a advantage in the north the black be then potentially able to elect member of congress in the south but could not hope to exercise such power in other part douglass believe moreover that this exodus do not conform to the law of civilizing migration as the carrying of a language literature and the like of a superior race to a inferior and it do not conform to the geographic law assure healthy migration from east to west in the same latitude as this be from south to north far away from the climate in which the migrant be bear -lrb- 17 -rrb- the exodus of the negro however be heartily endorse by richard t greener he do not consider it the best remedy for the lawlessness of the south but feel that it be a salutary one he do not expect the united state to give the oppressed black in the south the protection they need as there be no abstract limit to the right of a state to do anything he would not encourage the negro to lead a wander life but in that instance such advice be gratuitous greener fail to find any analogy between african colonization and migration to the west as the former be promote by slaveholder to remove the free negro from the country and the other spring spontaneously from the class consider itself aggrieve one lead out of the country to a comparative wilderness the other direct to a better land and larger opportunity he do not see how the migration to the north would diminish the potentiality of the negro in politics for massachusett first elect negro to she general court ohio have nominate a negro representative and illinoi another he show also that mr douglass 's objection on the grounds of migrate from south to north rather than from east to west be not historical he think little of the advice to the negro to stick and fight it out for he have evidence that the return of the unreconstructed confederate to power in the south would for generation doom the black to political oppression unknown in the annals of a free country greener show foresight here in urge the negro to take up desirable western land before it would be preempt by foreigner as the swede norwegian irish hebrew and other be organize society and raise fund to promote the migration of they needy to these land why should the negro be debar greener have no apprehension as to the treatment the negro would receive in the west he connect the movement too with the general welfare of the black consider it a promising sign that they have learn to run from persecution have pass they first stage that of appeal to philanthropist the negro be then appeal to themselves -lrb- 18 -rrb- feeling very much as greener do these negro rush into kansa and neighbor state in 1879 so many come that some systematic relief have to be offer mr comstock a quaker lady organize for this purpose the kansa freedman 's relief association to raise fund and secure for they food and clothing in this work she have the support of governor jp saint john there be much suffering upon arrive in kansa but relief come from various source during this year $ 40000 and 500000 pound of clothing bedding and the like be use england contribute 50000 pound of goods and $ 8000 in 1879 the refugee take up 20000 acre of land and bring 3000 under cultivation the relief association at first furnished they with supplies team and seed which they profitably use in the production of large crop desire to establish home they build 300 cabin and save $ 30000 the first year in April 1300 refugee have gather around wyandotte alone up to that date 60000 have come to kansas nearly 40000 of whom arrive in destitute condition about 30000 settle in the country some on rent land and other on farm as laborer leave about 25000 in city where on account of crowded condition and the hard weather many greatly suffer upon find employment however they all do well most of they become self-supporting within one year after they arrival and few of they come back to the relief association for aid the second time -lrb- 19 -rrb- this be especially true of those in topeka parson and kansa city the people of kansa do not encourage the black to come they even send messenger to the south to advise the negro not to migrate and if they do come anyway to provide themselves with equipment when they do arrive however they welcome and assist they as human being under such condition the black establish five or six important colony in kansa alone between 1879 and 1880 chief among these be baxter spring nicodemus morton city and singleton governor saint john of kansa report that they seem to be honest and of good habit be certainly industrious and anxious to work and so far as they have be try have prove to be faithful and excellent laborer give he observation there sir george campbell bear testimony to the same report -lrb- 20 -rrb- out of these community have come some most progressive black citizen in consideration of they desirability they white neighbor have give they they cooperation secure to they the advantage of democratic education and honor a few of they with some of the most important position in the state although the greater number of these black go to kansa about 5000 of they seek refuge in other western state during these year negro gradually invade indian territory and increase the number already infiltrate into and assimilate by the indian nation when assure of they friendly attitude toward the indian the negro be accept by they as equal even during the day of slavery when the black on account of the cruelty of they master escape to the wilderness -lrb- 21 -rrb- here we be at sea as to the extent to which this invasion and subsequent miscegenation of the black and red race extend for the reason that neither the indian nor these migrate negro keep record and the united state government have be dispose to classify all mixed breed in tribe as indian have equal opportunity among the red man the negro easily succeed a traveler in indian territory in 1880 find they condition unusually favorable the cosy home and promising field of these freedman attract he attention as striking evidence of they thrift he see new fence addition to cabin new barn church and school-house indicate prosperity give every privilege which the indian themselves enjoy the negro could not be other than contented -lrb- 22 -rrb- it be very unfortunate however that in 1889 when by proclamation of president harrison the oklahoma territory be throw open the intense race prejudice of the white immigrant and the rule of the mob prevent a larger number of negro from settle in that promising commonwealth long since extensively advertise as valuable the land of oklahoma have become a coveted prize for the adventurous squatter

spite of these interstate movement the negro still continue as a perplexing problem for the country be unprepared to grant the race political and civil rights nominal equality be force on the south at the point of the sword and the north reluctantly remove most of its barrier against the black some still think however that the two race could not live together as equal advocate cede the black the region on the gulf of mexico -lrb- 1 -rrb- this be brand as chimerical on the ground that deprive of the guidance of the whites these state would soon sink to african level and the end of the experiment would be a reconquest and a military regime fatal to the true development of american institution -lrb- 2 -rrb- another plan propose be the revival of the old colonization idea of send negro to africa but this exhibit still less wisdom than the first in that it be base on the hypothesis of deport a nation a expense which no government would be willing to incur there be then no physical means of transport six or seven million of people moreover as there would be a new bear for every one the agent of colonization could deport -lrb- 3 -rrb- with the deportation scheme still keep before the people by the american colonization society the idea of emigration to africa do not easily die some negro continue to emigrate to liberium from year to year this policy be also favor by radical like senator morgan of alabama who after movement like the ku klux klan have do they work of intimidate negro into submission to the domination of the whites conclude that most of the race believe that there be no future for the black in the united state and that they be willing to emigrate these radical advocate the deportation of the black to prevent the recurrence of negro domination this plan be acceptable to the whites in general also for unlike the consensus of opinion of today it be then think that the south could get along without the negro -lrb- 4 -rrb- even newspaper like the _ charleston news and courier _ which denounce the persecution of the negro urge they to emigrate to africa as they could not be permit to rule over the white people the _ minneapoli time _ wish the scheme success and godspeed and believe that the sooner it be carry out the better it would be for the negro most of the influential newspaper of the country however urge the contrary cite the progress of the negro since emancipation to show that the black be do they full share toward develop the wealth of the south the _ indianapoli journal _ characterize as barbarism the suggestion that the government should furnish they transportation to africa the ancestor of most of the negro now in this country say the editor have doubtless be here as long as those of senator morgan and they descendant be as thoroughly acclimate and have as good a right here as the senator himself -lrb- 5 -rrb- this be the opinion of all useful negro except bishop hm turner who endorse morgan 's plan by advocate the emigration of one fourth of the black to africa the editor of the _ chicago record-herald _ entreat turner to temper he enthusiasm with discretion before he involve in unspeakable disaster any more of he trustful compatriot speak more plainly to the point the editor of the _ philadelphium north american _ say that the true interest of the south be to accommodate itself to changed condition and that the duty of the freedman lie in make themselves worth more in the development of the south than they be as chattel although recognize the disability and hardship of the south both to the whites and the black he could not believe that the elimination of the negro would if practicable give relief -lrb- 6 -rrb- the _ boston herald _ inquire whether it be worth while to send away a labor population in the absence of whites to take its place and refer to the misfortune of spain which undertake to carry out such a scheme speak the real truth _ the milwaukee journal _ say that no one need to expect any appreciable decrease in the black population through any possible emigration no matter how successful it might be the negro say the editor be here to stay and we institution must be adapt to comprehend he and develop he possibility _ the color american _ then the lead negro organ of think in the united state believe that the negro should be thankful to senator morgan for he attitude on emigration because he might succeed in deport to africa those negro who affect to believe that this be not they home and the more quickly we get rid of such foolhardy people the better it will be for the stalwart of the race -lrb- 7 -rrb- a number of negro however under the inspiration of leader -lrb- 8 -rrb- like bishop hm turner do not feel that the race have a fair chance in the united state a few of they emigrate to wapimo mexico but become dissatisfied with the situation there they return to they home in georgium and alabama in 1895 the come of the negro into mexico cause suspicion and excitement a newspaper _ el tiempo _ which have be denounce lynching in the united state change front when these negro arrive in that country go in quest of new opportunity and desire to reenforce the civilization of liberium 197 other negro sail from savannah georgium for liberium march 19 1895 commend this step the _ macon telegraph _ refer to they action as a rebellion against the social law which govern all people of this country this organ further say that it be the outcome of a feeling which have grow stronger and stronger year by year among the negro of the southern state and which will continue to grow with the increase of education and intelligence among they the editor concede that they have a opportunity to better they material condition and acquire wealth here but contend that they have no chance to rise out of the peasant class the _ memphi commercial appeal _ urge the building of a large negro nation in africa as practicable and desirable for it be more and more apparent that the negro in this country must remain a alien and a disturber because there be not and can never be a future for he in this country the _ florida time union _ feel that this colonization scheme like all other be a fraud it refer to the negro 's be carry to the land of plenty only to find out that there as everywhere else in the world a existence must be earn by toil and that he own old sunny southern home be vastly the better place -lrb- 9 -rrb- only a few intelligent negro however have reach the position of be contented in the south the negro eliminate from politics could not easily bring themselves around to think that they should remain there in a state of recognize inferiority especially when during the eighty and ninety there be many evidence that economic as well as political condition would become worse the exodus treat in the previous chapter be productive of better treatment for the negro and a increase in they wages in certain part of the south but the migration contrary to the expectation of many do not become general actual prosperity be impossible even if the whites have be willing to give the negro peasant a fair chance the south have pass through a disastrous war the effect of which so blighted the hope of its citizen in the economic world that they land seem to pass so to speak through a dark age there be then little to give the man far down when the one to whom he of necessity look for employment be in he turn bleed by the merchant or the banker of the larger city to whom he have to go for extensive credit -lrb- 10 -rrb- southern planter as a class however have not much sympathy for the black who have once be they property and the tendency to cheat they continue despite the fact that many farmer in the course of time extricate themselves from the clutch of the loan shark there be a few negro who thanks to the honesty of certain southern gentleman succeed in acquire considerable property in spite of they handicap -lrb- 11 -rrb- they yield to the white man 's control in politics when it seem that it mean either to abandon that field or die and devoted themselves to the accumulation of wealth and the acquisition of education this concession however do not satisfy the radical whites as they think that the negro might some day return to power unfortunately therefore after the restoration of the control of the state government to the master class there sweep over these commonwealth a wave of hostile legislation demand by the poor white uplander determine to debase the black to the status of the free negro prior to the civil war -lrb- 12 -rrb- the negro have therefore be disfranchise in most reconstructed state deprive of the privilege of serve in the state militia segregate in public conveyance and exclude from public place of entertainment they have moreover be brand by public opinion as pariah of society to be use for exploitation but not to be encourage to expect that they status can ever be change so as to destroy the barrier between the race in they social and political relation this period have be mark also by a effort to establish in the south a system of peonage not unlike that of mexico a sort of involuntary servitude in that one be consider legally bind to serve he master until a debt contract be pay such law have be enact in florida alabama georgium mississippus north carolina and south carolina no such distinction in law have be able to stand the constitutional test of the united state court as be evidence by the decision of the supreme court in 1911 declare the alabama law unconstitutional -lrb- 13 -rrb- but the planter of the south still a law unto themselves have maintain actual slavery in sequestered district where public opinion against peonage be too weak to support federal authority in exterminate it -lrb- 14 -rrb- the negro themselves dare not protest under penalty of persecution and the peon concerned usually accept he lot like that of a slave some year ago it be commonly report that in try to escape the person undertake it often fail and suffer death at the hand of the planter or of murderous mob give as they excuse if any be require that the negro be a desperado or some other sort of criminal unfortunately this reaction extend also to education appropriation to public school for negro diminish from year to year and when there appear practical leader with they sane plan for industrial education the south ignorantly accept this scheme as a desirable subterfuge for seem to support negro education and at the same time direct the development of the black in such a way that they would never become the competitor of the white people this be not these educator ' idea but the south so understand it and in effect the readjustment practically leave the negro out of the pale of the public school system consequently there have be add to the negro ' misfortune in the south that of be unable to obtain liberal education at public expense although they themselves as the largest consumer in some part pay most of the tax appropriate to the support of school for the youth of the other race -lrb- 15 -rrb- the south moreover have adopt the policy of a more general intimidation of the negro to keep they down the lynching of the black at first for assault on white woman and later for almost any offense have rapidly develop as a institution within the past fifty year -lrb- 16 -rrb- there have be lynch in the south about 4000 negro many of whom have be publicly burn in the daytime to attract crowd that usually enjoy such feat as the tourney of the middle age negro who have the courage to protest against this barbarism have too often be subject to indignity and in some case force to leave they community or suffer the fate of those in behalf of whom they speak these crime of white man be at first keep secret but during the last two generation the culprit have become know as hero so popular have it be to murder negro it have often be discover also that the officer of these community take part in these crime and the worst of all be that politician like tillman blease and vardaman glory in recount the noble deed of those who deserve so well of they countryman for make the soil red with the negro ' blood rather than permit the much fear africanization of southern institution -lrb- 17 -rrb- in this harass situation the negro have hope that the north would interfere in he behalf but with the reactionary supreme court of the united state interpret this hostile legislation as constitutional in conformity with the demand of prejudiced public opinion and with the leader of the north incline to take the view that after all the faction in the south must be leave alone to fight it out there have be nothing to be expect from without matter too have be render much worse because the leader of the very party recently abandon the freedman to they fate aggravate the critical situation by first set the negro against they former master whom they be teach to regard as they worst enemy whether they be or not the last humiliation the negro have be force to submit to be that of segregation here the effort have be to establish a ghetto in city and to assign certain part of the country to negro engage in farm it always happen of course that the best portion go to the whites and the least desirable to the black although the promoter of the segregation maintain that both race be to be treat equally the ultimate aim be to prevent the negro of means from figure conspicuously in aristocratic district where they may be bring into rather close contact with the whites negro see in segregation a settle policy to keep they down no matter what they do to elevate themselves the southern white man eternally dread the miscegenation of the race make the life liberty and happiness of individual second to measure consider necessary to prevent this so-called evil that this enviable civilization distinctly american may not be destroy the united state supreme court in the decision of the louisville segregation case recently declare these segregation measure unconstitutional -lrb- 18 -rrb- these restriction have make the progress of the negro more of a problem in that direct toward social distinction the negro have be deny the helpful contact of the sympathetic whites the increase race prejudice force the whites to restrict they open deal with the black to matter of service and business maintain even then the bearing of one in a sphere which the negro must not penetrate the whites therefore never see the black as they be and the black never be able to learn what the whites know be throw back on they own initiative which they life as slave could not have permit to develop it make little difference that the negro have be free a few decade such freedom have in some part be tantamount to slavery and so far as contact with the superior class be concerned no better than that condition for under the old regime certain slave do learn much by close association with they master -lrb- 19 -rrb- for these reason there have be since the exodus to the west a steady migration of negro from the south to point in the north but this migration mainly due to political change have never assume such large proportion as in the case of the more significant movement due to economic cause for as the accompany map show most negro be still in the south when we consider the various class migrate however it will be apparent that to understand the exodus of the negro to the north this longer draw out and smaller movement must be carefully study in all its ramification it should be note that unlike some of the other migration it have not be direct to any particular state it have be from almost all southern state to various part of the north and especially to the largest city -lrb- 20 -rrb- what class then have migrate in the first place the negro politician who after the restoration of bourbon rule in the south find themselves throw out of office and often humiliate and impoverish have to find some way out of the difficulty some few have be relieve by sympathetic leader of the republican party who secure for they federal appointment in washington these appointment when sometimes pay lucrative salary have be give as a reward to those negro who although dethrone in the south remain in touch with the remnant of the republican party there and control the delegate to the national convention nominate candidate for president many negro of this class have settle in washington -lrb- 21 -rrb- in some case the observer witness the pitiable scene of a man once a prominent public functionary in the south now serve in washington as a messenger or a clerk the well-established black however have not be so easily induce to go the negro in business in the south have usually be loath to leave they people among whom they can acquire property whereas if they go to the north they have merely political freedom with no assurance of a opportunity in the economic world but not a few of these have give themselves up to unrelenting toil with a view to accumulate sufficient wealth to move north and live thereafter on the income from they investment many of this class now spend some of they time in the north to educate they child but they do not like to have these child who have be under refining influence return to the south to suffer the humiliation which during the last generation have be grow more and more aggravating endeavor to carry out they policy of keep the negro down southerner too often carefully plan to humiliate the progressive and intelligent black and in some case form mob to drive they out as they be bad example for that class of negro whom they desire to keep as menial -lrb- 22 -rrb- there be also the migrate educate negro they have study history law and economics and well understand what it be to get the rights guarantee they by the constitution the more they know the more discontented they become they can not speak out for what they want no one be likely to second such a protest not even the negro themselves so generally have they be intimidate the more outspoken they become moreover the more necessary be it for they to leave for they thereby destroy they chance to earn a livelihood white man in control of the public school of the south see to it that the subserviency of the negro teacher employ be certify beforehand they dare not complain too much about equipment and salary even if the per capita appropriation for the education of the negro be one fourth of that for the whites -lrb- 23 -rrb- in the higher institution of learning especially the state school it be exceptional to find a principal who have the confidence of the negro the negro will openly assert that he be in the pay of the reactionary whites whose purpose be to keep the negro down and the incumbent himself will tell he board of regent how much he be oppose by the negro because he labor for the interest of the white race out of such sycophancy it be easily explain why we state school have be so ineffective as to necessitate the send of the negro youth to private institution maintain by northern philanthropy yet if a outspoken negro happen to be a instructor in a private school conduct by educator from the north he have to be careful about contend for a square deal for if the head of he institution do not suggest to he to proceed conservatively the mob will dispose of the complainant -lrb- 24 -rrb- physician lawyer and preacher who be not so economically dependent as teacher can exercise no more freedom of speech in the midst of this triumphant rule of the lawless a large number of educate negro therefore have on account of these condition be compel to leave the south finding in the north however practically nothing in they line to do because of the proscription by race prejudice and trade union many of they lead the life of menial serve as waiter porter butler and chauffeur while in chicago not long ago the writer be in the office of a graduate of a color southern college who be show he former teacher the picture of he class in accounting for he classmate in the various walk of life he report that more than one third of they be settle to the occupation of pullman porter the largest number of negro who have go north during this period however belong to the intelligent labor class some of they have become discontented for the very same reason that the higher class have tire of oppression in the south but the larger number of they have go north to improve they economic condition most of these have migrate to the large city in the east and northwest such as philadelphium new york indianapoli pittsburgh cleveland columbus detroit and chicago to understand this problem in its urban aspect the accompany diagram show the increase in the negro population of northern city during the first decade of this century will be helpful some of these negro have migrate after careful consideration other have just happen to go north as wanderer and a still larger number on the many excursion to the city conduct by railroad during the summer month sometimes one excursion bring to chicago two or three thousand negro two third of whom never go back they do not often follow the higher pursuit of labor in the north but they earn more money than they have be accustom to earn in the south they be attract also by the liberal attitude of some whites which although not that of social equality give the negro a liberty in northern center which lead they to think that they be citizen of the country -lrb- 25 -rrb- this shift in the population have have a unusually significant effect on the black belt frederick douglass advise the negro in 1879 to remain in the south where they would be in sufficiently large number to have political power -lrb- 26 -rrb- but they have gradually scatter from the black belt so as to diminish greatly they chance ever to become the political force they formerly be in this country the negro once have this possibility in south carolina georgia alabama mississippus and louisiana and have the process of africanization prior to the civil war have a few decade longer to do its work there would not have be any doubt as to the ultimate preponderance of the negro in those commonwealth the tendency of the black population accord to the census of the united state and especially that of 1910 however show that the chance for the control of these state government by negro no longer exist except in south carolina and mississippus -lrb- 27 -rrb- it have be predict therefore that if the same tendency continue for the next fifty year there will be even few county in which the negro will be in a majority all of the southern state except arkansa show a proportionate increase of the white population over that of the black between 1900 and 1910 while west virginium and oklahoma with relatively small number of black show for reason state elsewhere a increase in the negro population thus we see come to pass something like the propose plan of jefferson and other statesman who a hundred year ago advocate the expansion of slavery to lessen the evil of the institution by distribute its burden -lrb- 28 -rrb- the migration of intelligent black however have be attend with several handicap to the race the large part of the black population be in the south and there it will stay for decade to come the southern negro therefore have be rob of they due part of the talented tenth the educate black have have no constituency in the north and consequently have be unable to realize they sweetest dream of the land of the free in they new home the enlighten negro must live with he light under a bushel those leave behind in the south soon despair of see a brighter day and yield to the yoke in the place of the leader who be wont to speak for they people the whites have raise up negro who accept favor offer they on the condition that they lip be seal up forever on the rights of the negro this emigration too have leave the negro subject to other evil there be many first-class negro business man in the south but although there be once progressive man of color who endeavor to protect the black from be plunder by white shark and harpy there have arise numerous unscrupulous negro who have for a part of the proceeds from such jobbery associate themselves with ill-designing white man to dupe illiterate negro this trickery be bring into play in market they crop sell they supplies or purchase they property to carry out this iniquitous plan the person concern have the protection of the

stream of negro into the north in such large number as to overshadow in its result all other movement of the kind in the united state these negro have come largely from alabama tennessee florida georgium virginium north carolina kentucky south carolina arkansa and mississippus the give cause of this migration be numerous and complicate some untruth center around this exodus have not be unlike those of other migration again we hear that the negro be be bring north to fight organize labor -lrb- 1 -rrb- and to carry doubtful state for the republican -lrb- 2 -rrb- these numerous explanation themselves however give rise to doubt as to the fundamental cause why then should the negro leave the south it have often be speak of as the best place for they there it be say they have make unusual stride forward the progress of the negro in the south however have in no sense be general although the land own by negro in the country and the property of thrifty person of they race in urban community may be extensive in most part of the south the negro be still unable to become landowner or successful business man condition and custom have reserve these sphere for the whites generally speak the negro be still dependent on the white people for food and shelter although not exactly slave they be yet attach to the white people as tenant servant or dependent accept this as they lot they have be content to wear they lord 's cast-off clothing and live in he ramshackled barn or cellar in this unhappy state so many have settle down lose all ambition to attain a higher station the world have go on but in they sequestered sphere progress have pass they by what then be the cause there have be _ bulldoze _ terrorism maltreatment and what not of persecution but the negro have not in large number wander away from the land of they birth what the migrant themselves think about it go to the very heart of the trouble some say that they leave the south on account of injustice in the court unrest lack of privilege denial of the right to vote bad treatment oppression segregation or lynching other say that they leave to find employment to secure better wages better school facility and better opportunity to toil upward -lrb- 3 -rrb- southern white newspaper unaccustomed to give the negro any mention but that of criminal have say that the negro be go north because they have not have a fair chance in the south and that if they be to be retain there the attitude of the whites toward they must be change professor william o scrogg of louisiana state university consider as cause of this exodus the relatively low wages pay farm labor a unsatisfactory tenant or crop-sharing system the boll weevil the crop failure of 1916 lynching disfranchisement segregation poor school and the monotony isolation and drudgery of farm life professor scrogg however be wrong in think that the persecution of the black have little to do with the migration for the reason that during these year when the treatment of the negro be decidedly better they be leave the south this do not mean that they would not have leave before if they have have economic opportunity in the north it be highly probable that the negro would not be leave the south today if they be treat as man although there might be numerous opportunity for economic improvement in the north -lrb- 4 -rrb- the immediate cause of this movement be the suffering due to the flood aggravate by the depredation of the boll weevil although generally mindful of we welfare the united state government have not be as ready to build levee against a natural enemy to property as it have be to provide fortification for warfare it have be necessary for local community and state government to tax themselves to maintain they the national government however have appropriate to the purpose of facilitate inland navigation certain sum which have be use in do this work especially in the mississippus valley there be now 1538 mile of levee on both side of the mississippus from cape girardeau to the pass these levee of course be still inadequate to the security of the planter against these inundation carry 406 million ton of mud a year the river become a dangerous stream subject to change abandon its old bed to cut for itself a new channel transfer property from one state to another isolate city and leave once useful levee maroon in the landscape like old indian mound or overgrown intrenchment -lrb- 5 -rrb- this valley have therefore be frequently visit with disaster which have often set the population in motion the first disastrous flood come in 1858 and 1859 break many of the levee the destruction of which be practically complete by the flood of 1865 and 1869 there be a annual rise in the stream but since 1874 this river system have fourteen time devastate large area of this section with destructive flood the property in this district depreciate in value to the extent of about 400 million in ten year farmer from this section therefore have at time move west with foreigner to take up public land the other disturbing factor in this situation be the boll weevil a interloper from mexico in 1892 the boll weevil be a insect about one fourth of a inch in length vary from one eighth to one third of a inch with a breadth of about one third of the length when it first emerge it be yellowish then become grayish brown and finally assume a black shade it breed on no other plant than cotton and feed on the boll this little animal at first attack the cotton crop in texa it be not think that it would extend its work into the heart of the south so as to become of national consequence but it have at the rate of forty to one hundred sixty mile annually invade all of the cotton district except that of the carolina and virginium the damage it do vary accord to the rainfall and the harshness of the winter increase with the former and decrease with the latter at time the damage have be to the extent of a loss of 50 per cent of the crop estimate at 400000 bale of cotton annually about 4500000 bale since the invasion or $ 250000000 worth of cotton -lrb- 6 -rrb- the output of the south be thus cut off the planter have less income to provide supplies for he black tenant and the prospects for future production be dark merchant accustom to give they credit have to refuse this of course mean financial depression for the south be a borrowing section and any limitation to credit there block the wheel of industry it be fortunate for the negro laborer in this district that there be then a demand for labor in the north when this condition begin to obtain this demand be make possible by the cut off of european immigration by the world war which thereby render this hitherto uncongenial section a invite field for the negro the negro have make some progress in the north during the last fifty year but despite they achievement they have be so handicapped by race prejudice and proscribe by trade union that the uplift of the race by economic method have be impossible the european immigrant have hitherto exclude the negro even from the menial position in the midst of the drudgery leave for they the black have often heretofore be debase to the status of dependent and pauper scatter through the north too in such small number they have be unable to unite for social betterment and mutual improvement and naturally too weak to force the community to respect they wish as could be do by a large group with some political or economic power at present however negro laborer who once go from city to city seek such employment as trade union leave to they can work even as skilled laborer throughout the north -lrb- 7 -rrb- woman of color formerly exclude from domestic service by foreign maid be now in demand many mill and factory which negro be prohibit from enter a few year ago be now bid for they labor railroad can not find help to keep they property in repair contractor fall short of they plan for failure to hold mechanic draw into the industrial boom and the united state government have have to advertise for man to hasten the preparation for war man from afar go south to tell the negro of a way of escape to a more congenial place black long since unaccustomed to venture a few mile from home at once have vision of a promised land just a few hundred mile away some be tell of the chance to amass fabulous riches some of the opportunity for education and some of the hospitality of the place of amusement and recreation in the north the migrant then be soon on the way railway station become conspicuous with the presence of negro tourist the train be crowd to full capacity and the street of northern city be soon congest with black laborer seek to realize they dream in the land of unusual opportunity employment agency recently multiply to meet the demand for labor find themselves unable to cope with the situation and agent send into the south to induce the black by offer of free transportation and high wages to go north have find it impossible to supply the demand in center where once toil the pole italian and the greek formerly prefer to the negro -lrb- 8 -rrb- in other word the present migration differ from other in that the negro have opportunity await he in the north whereas formerly it be necessary for he to make a place for himself upon arrive among enemy the proportion of those return to the south therefore will be inconsiderable become alarm at the immensity of this movement the south have undertake to check it to frighten negro from the north southern newspaper be carefully circulate report that many of they be return to they native land because of unexpected hardship -lrb- 9 -rrb- but have fail in this southerner have compel employment agent to cease operation there arrest suspect employer and to prevent the departure of the negro imprison on false charge those who appear at station to leave for the north this procedure could not long be effective for by the more legal and clandestine method of railway passenger agent the work have go forward some southern community have therefore advocate drastic legislation against labor agent as be suggest in louisiana in 1914 when by operation of the underwood tariff law the negro throw out of employment in the sugar district migrate to the cotton plantation -lrb- 10 -rrb- one should not however get the impression that the majority of the negro be leave the south eager as these negro seem to go there be no unanimity of opinion as to whether migration be the best policy the sycophant toady class of negro naturally advise the black to remain in the south to serve they white neighbor the radical protagonist of the equal-rights-for-all element urge they to come north by all means then there be the think negro who be still further divide both division of this element have the interest of the race at heart but they be unable to agree as to exactly what the black should now do think that the present war will soon be over and that consequently the immigration of foreigner into this country will again set in and force out of employment thousand of negro who have migrate to the north some of the most representative negro be advise they fellow to remain where they be the most serious objection to this transplantation be that it mean for the negro a loss of land the rapid acquisition of which have long be point to as the best evidence of the ability of the black to rise in the economic world so many negro who have by dint of energy purchase small farm yield a increase income from year to year be now dispose of they at nominal price to come north to work for wages look beyond the war however and think too that the depopulation of europe during this upheaval will render immigration from that quarter for some year a impossibility other thinker urge the negro to continue the migration to the north where the race may be find in sufficiently large number to wield economic and political power great as be the dearth of labor in the south moreover the negro exodus have not as yet cause such a depression as to unite the whites in induce the black to remain in that section in the first place the south have not yet feel the worst effect of this economic upheaval as that part of the country have be unusually aid by the million which the united state government be daily spending there furthermore the poor whites be anxious to see the exodus of they competitor in the field of labor this leave the capitalist at they mercy and in keep with they domineering attitude they will be able to handle the labor situation as they desire as a evidence of this fact we need but note the continuation of mob rule and lynching in the south despite the preaching against it of the organ of thought which heretofore wink at it this terrorism have go to a unexpected extent negro farmer have be threaten with bodily injury unless they leave certain part the southerner of aristocratic bearing will say that only the shiftless poor whites terrorize the negro this may be so but the truth offer little consolation when we observe that most white people in the south be of this class and the tendency of this element to put they child to work before they secure much education do not indicate that the south will soon experience that general enlightenment necessary to exterminate these survival of barbarism unless the upper class of the whites can bring the mob around to they way of think that the persecution of the negro be prejudicial to the interest of all it be not likely that mob rule will soon cease and the migration to this extent will be promote rather than retard it be unfortunate for the south that the grow consciousness of the negro have culminate at the very time they be most need finally heed the advice of agricultural expert to reconstruct its agricultural system the south have learn in the school of bitter experience to depart from the plan of produce the single cotton crop it be now raise food-stuff to make that section self-supporting without reduce the usual output of cotton with the increase production in the south therefore more labor be need just at the very time it be be draw to center in the north the north be a industrial and commercial section have usually attract the immigrant who will never fit into the economic situation in the south because they will not accept the treatment give negro the south therefore be now lose the only labor which it can ever use under present condition where these negro be go be still more interesting the exodus to the west be mainly direct to kansa and neighbor state the migration to the southwest center in oklahoma and texa pioneering negro laborer drift into the industrial district of the appalachian highland during the eighty and ninety and the infiltration of the discontented talented tenth affect largely the city of the north but now we be tell that at the very time the mining district of the north and west be be fill with black the western planter be supply they farm with they and that into some city have go sufficient skilled and unskilled negro worker to increase the black population more than one hundred per cent place in the north where the black population have not only not increase but even decrease in recent year be now receive a steady influx of negro in fact this be a nation-wide migration affect all part and all condition student of social problem be now wonder whether the negro can be adjust in the north many perplexing problem must arise this movement will produce result not unlike those already mention in the discussion of other migration some of which we have evidence of today there will be a increase in race prejudice lead in some community to actual outbreak as in chester and youngstown and probably to massacre like that of east st loui in which participate not only well-known citizen but the local officer and the state militia the negro in the north be in competition with white man who consider they not only strike breaker but a sort of inferior individual unworthy of the consideration which white man deserve and this condition obtain even where negro have be admit to the trade union negro in seek new home in the north moreover invade residential district hitherto exclusively white there they encounter prejudice and persecution until most whites thus disturb move out determine to do whatever they can to prevent they race from suffer from further depreciation of property and the disturbance of they community life lawlessness have follow show that violence may under certain condition develop among some class anywhere rather than reserve itself for vigilance committee of primitive community it have bring out too another aspect of lawlessness in that it break out in the north where the number of negro be still too small to serve as a excuse for the terrorism and lynching consider necessary in the south to keep the negro down the maltreatment of the negro will be nationalize by this exodus the poor whites of both section will strike at this race long stigmatize by servitude but now demand economic equality race prejudice the fatal weakness of the american will not so soon abate although there will be advocate of fraternity equality and liberty require to reconstruct we government and rebuild we civilization in conformity with the demand of modern efficiency by place every man regardless of he color wherever he may do the greatest good for the greatest number the negro however be doubtless go to the north in sufficiently large number to make themselves feel if this migration fall short of establish in that section negro colony large enough to wield economic and political power they state in the end will not be any better than that of the negro already there it be to these large number alone that we must look for a agent to counteract the development of race feeling into riot in large number the black will be able to strike for better wages or concession due a rise labor class and they will have enough vote to defeat for reelection those officer who wink at mob violence or treat negro as person beyond the pale of the law the negro in the north however will get little out of the harvest if like the black of reconstruction day they unwisely concentrate they effort on solve all of they problem by elect man of they race as local officer or by send a few member even to congress as be likely in new york philadelphium and chicago within the next generation the negro have have representative in congress before but they be put out because they constituency be uneconomic and politically impossible there be nothing but the mere letter of the law behind the reconstruction negro officeholder and the thus force political recognition against public opinion could not last any longer than natural force for some time throw out of gear by unnatural cause could resume the usual line of procedure it would be of no advantage to the negro race today to send to congress forty negro representative on the pro rata basis of number especially if they happen not to be exceptionally well qualify they would remain in congress only so long as the american white people could devise some plan for eliminate they as they do during the reconstruction period near as the world have approach real democracy history give no record of a permanent government conduct on this basis interest have always be stronger than number the negro in the north therefore should not on the eve of the economic revolution follow the advice of they misguided and misleading race leader who be divert they attention from they actual welfare to a specialization in politics to concentrate they effort on elect a few negro to office wherever the black be find in the majority would exhibit the narrowness of they oppressor it would be as unwise as the policy of the republican party of set aside a few insignificant position like that of recorder of deed register of the treasury and auditor of the navy as segregate job for negro such position have furnish a nucleus for the large worthless office-seeking class of negro in washington who have establish the going of the people of the city toward pretence and sham the negro should support representative man of any color or party if they stand for a square deal and equal rights for all the new negro in the north therefore will as so many of they race in new york philadelphium and chicago be now do ally themselves with those man who be fairmind and considerate of the man far down and seek to embrace they many opportunity for economic progress a foundation for political recognition upon which the race must learn to build every race in the universe must aspire to become a factor in politics but history show that there be no short route to such success like other despise race beset with the prejudice and militant opposition of self-styled superior the negro must increase they industrial efficiency improve they opportunity to make a living develop the home church and school and contribute to art literature science and philosophy to clear the way to that political freedom of which they can not be deprive the entire country will be benefit by this upheaval it will be helpful even to the south the decrease in the black population in those community where the negro outnumber the whites will remove the fear of _ negro domination _ one of the cause of the backwardness of the south and its peculiar civilization many of the expensive precaution which the southern people have take to keep the negro down much of the terrorism incite to restrain the black from self-assertion will no longer be consider necessary for have the excess in number on they side the whites will finally rest assure that the negro may be encourage without any apprehension that they may develop enough power to subjugate or embarrass they former master the negro too be very much in demand in the south and the intelligent whites will gladly give they larger opportunity to attach they to that section know that the black once conscious of they power to move freely throughout the country wherever they may improve they condition will never endure hardship like those formerly inflict upon the race the south be already learn that the negro be the most desirable laborer for that section that the persecution of negro not only drive they out but make the employment of labor such a problem that the south will not be a attractive section for capital it will therefore be consider the duty of business man to secure protection to the negro lest they ill-treatment force they to migrate to the extent of bring about a stagnation of they business the exodus have drive home the truth that the prosperity of the south be at the mercy of the negro dependent on cheap labor which the bulldoze whites will not readily furnish the wealthy southerner must finally reach the position of regard themselves and the negro as have a community of interest which each must promote nature itself in those state douglass say come to the rescue of the negro he have labor the south want it and must have it or perish since he be free he could then give it or withhold it use it where he be or take it elsewhere as he please he labor make he a slave and he labor could if he would make he free comfortable and independent it be more to he than either fire sword ballot box or bayonet it touch the heart of the south through its pocket -lrb- 11 -rrb- know that the negro have this silent weapon to be use against he employer or the community the south be already give the race better educational facility better railway accommodation and will eventually if the advocacy of certain southern newspaper be heed grant they political privilege wages in the south therefore have rise even in the extreme southwestern state where there be a opportunity to import mexican labor reduce to this extremity the southern aristocrat have begin to lose some of they race prejudice which have not hitherto yield to reason or philanthropy southern man be tell they neighbor that they section must abandon the policy of treat the negro as a problem and construct a program for recognition rather than for repression meeting be therefore be hold to find out what the negro want and what may be do to keep they contented they be tell that the negro must be elevated not exploit that to make the south what it must need be the cooperation of all be need to train and equip the man of all race for efficiency the aim of all then must be to reform or get rid of the unfair proprietor who do not give they tenant a fair division of the return from they labor to this end the best whites and black be urge to come together to find a work basis for a systematic effort in the interest of all to say that either the north or the south can easily become adjust to this change be entirely too sanguine the north will have a problem the negro in the northern city will have much more to contend with than when settle in the rural district or small urban center force by restriction of real estate man into congested district there have appear the tendency toward further segregation they be deny social contact be sagaciously separate from the whites in public place of amusement and be clandestinely segregate in public school in spite of the law to the contrary as a consequence the negro migrant often find himself with less friend than he formerly have the northern man who once denounce the south on account of its maltreatment of the black gradually grow silent when a negro be bring next door there come with the movement therefore the difficult problem of housing where then must the migrant go they be not want by the whites and be treat with contempt by the native black of the northern city who consider they brethren from the south too criminal and too vicious to be tolerate in the average progressive city there have heretofore be a certain increase in the number of house through natural growth but owe to the high cost of material high wages increase taxation and the inclination to invest money in enterprise grow out of the war fewer house be now be build although negro be pour into these center as a steady stream the usual negro quarter in northern center of this sort have be fill up and the overflow of the black population scatter throughout the city among white people old warehouse store room church railroad car and tent have be use to meet these demand a large per cent of these negro be located in room house or tenement for several family the majority of they can not find individual room many be crowd into the same room therefore and too many into the same bed sometimes as many as four and five sleep in one bed and that may be place in the basement dining-room or kitchen where there be neither adequate light nor air in some case man who work during the night sleep by day in bed use by other during the night some of they house have no water inside and have toilet on the outside without sewerage connection the cooking be often do by coal or wood stove or kerosene lamp yet the rent run high although the house be generally out of repair and in some case have be condemn by the municipality the unsanitary condition in which many of the black be compel to live be in violation of municipal ordinance furthermore because of the indiscriminate employment by labor agent and the dearth of labor require the acceptance of almost all sort of man some disorderly and worthless negro have be bring into the north on the whole however these migrant be not lazy shiftless and desperate as some predict that they would be they generally attend church save they money and send a part of they savings regularly to they family they do not belong to the class go north in quest of whiskey mr abraham epstein who have write a valuable pamphlet set forth he research in pittsburgh state that the migrant of that city do not generally imbibe and most of those who do take beer only -lrb- 12 -rrb- out of four hundred and seventy person to whom he propound this question two hundred and ten or forty-four per cent of they be total abstainer seventy per cent of those have family do not drink at all with this congestion however have come serious difficulty crowded condition give rise to vice crime and disease the prevalence of vice have not be the rule but tendency which better condition in the south restrain from develop have under these undesirable condition be give a opportunity to grow there be therefore a tendency toward the crowding of dive assemble on the corner of street and the commission of petty offence which crowd they into the police court one find also sometimes a congestion in house of dissipation and the carrying of conceal weapon law abide on the whole however they have not experience a wave of crime the chief offence be those result from the saloon and denizen of vice which be furnish by the community itself disease have be one of they worst enemy but report on they health have be exaggerate on account of this sudden change of the negro from one climate to another and the hardship of more unrelenting toil many of they have be unable to resist pneumonia bronchitis and tuberculosis church rescue mission and the national league on urban condition among negro have offer relief in some of these case the last-named organization be serve in large city as a sort of clear house for such activity and as means of interpret one race to the other it have now eighteen branch in city to which this migration have be direct through a local worker these migrant be approach properly place and supervise until they can adjust themselves to the community without apparent embarrassment to either race the league have be able to handle the migrant arrive by extend the work so as to know they movement beforehand the occupation in which these people engage will throw further light on they situation about ninety per cent of they do unskilled labor only ten per cent of they do semi-skilled or skilled labor they serve as common laborer puddler mold-setter painter carpenter bricklayer cement worker and machinist what the negro need then be that sort of freedom which carry with it industrial opportunity and social justice this they can not attain until they be permit to enter the higher pursuit of labor two reason be give for failure to enter these : first that negro labor be unstable and inefficient and second that white man will protest organize labor however have do nothing to help the black yet it be a fact that accustomed to the easy-going toil of the plantation the black have not show the same efficiency as that of the whites some employer report however that they be glad to have they because they be more individualistic and do not like to group but it be not true that color labor can not be organize the black have merely be neglect by organize labor wherever they have have the opportunity to do so they have organize and stand for they rights like man the trouble be that the trade union be generally antagonistic to negro although they be now accept the black in self-defense the policy of exclude negro from these body be make effective by a evasive procedure despite the fact that the constitution of many of they specifically provide that there shall be no discrimination on account of race or color because of this tendency some of the representative of trade union have ask why negro do not organize union of they own this the negro have generally fail to do think that they would not be recognize by the american federation of labor and know too that what they union would have to contend with in the economic world would be diametrically oppose to the wish of the man from whom they would have to seek recognition organize labor moreover be oppose to the powerful capitalist the only real friend the negro have in the north to furnish they food and shelter while they life be often be seek by union member step toward organize negro labor have be make in various northern city during 1917 and 1918 -lrb- 18 -rrb- the objective of this movement for the present however be largely that of employment eventually the negro migrant will no doubt without much difficulty establish themselves among law-abiding and industrious people of the north where they will receive assistance many person now see in this shift of the negro population the dawn of a new day not in make the negro numerically dominant anywhere to obtain political power but to secure for he freedom of movement from section to section as a competitor in the industrial world they also observe that while there may be a increase of race prejudice in the north the same will in that proportion decrease in the south thus balance the equation while give the negro he best chance in the economic world out of which he must emerge a real man with power to secure he rights as a american citizen -lrb-
