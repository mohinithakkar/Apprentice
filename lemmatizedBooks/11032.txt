confess of get hold of some fact -- those entity call by quintilian the bone of truth the more by token i fancy that they so often stick in the throat -- which might contribute to my legend i come to some sheet whereon he lordship have write some hasty remark to the effect that the case napier _ versus _ napier be the most curious puzzle that ever he have witness since he have take he seat on the bench the papers be fragmentary consist of part of a reclaim petition and some portion of a proof that have be lead in support of a brieve of service but i get enough to enable I to give the story which i shall do in such a connected manner as to take the reader along with I i hope pleasantly and without any inclination to choke upon the foresaid bone without be very particular about the year which really i do not know with further precision than that it be within the first five year of lord kame 's senator-ship i request the reader to fancy himself in a small domicile in toddrick 's wynd in the old city of edinburgh and i request this the more readily that as we all know nature do not exclude very humble place from the region of romance neither do she deny to very humble personage the character of hero and heroine not that i have much to say in the first instance either of the place or the person the former be no more than a solitary room and a bed-closet where yet the throb of life be as strong and quick as in the mansion of the great and the latter compose of two person -- one a decent hard-working woman call mr hislop whose duty in this world be to keep she employer clean in they clothes wherein she stand next to the minister insomuch as cleanliness be next to godliness -- in other word she be a washerwoman the other be a young girl verge upon sixteen call henrietta whose quality both of mind and body might be comprise in the homely eulogy as blithe as bonnie so it may be that if you be alarm at the humility of the occupation of the one -- even with you remembrance that sir isaac newton experiment upon soap-bubble -- as be so intractable in the plastic-work of romance you may be appease by the quality of the other for have it not be we delight to sing for a thousand year yea in a thousand song too the praise of young damsel whether under the name of jenny or peggy or those of clarinda or florabellum or whether engage in herd flock by logan water or dispense knight ' favor under the peacock but we can not afford to dispose of we young heroine in this curt way for she look form part of the line of a strange history and so we must be permit the privilege of narrate that while mr hislop 's _ protegée _ do not come within that charm circle which contain accord to the poet so many angel without wing she be probably as fair every whit as dowsabell yet after all we be not here concern with beauty which as a specialty in one to one and as a universality in all to all be beyond the power of write description we have here to do simply with some trait which be hereditary not derive from mr hislop have a bearing upon we strange legend : the very slightest cast in the eye which in its piquancy belie a fine genial nature in the say henney and a classic nose which partaking of the old roman type and indicate pride be equally untrue to a generosity of feeling which make friend of all who see she -- _ except one _ a strange exception this _ one _ for who even in this bad world could be a enemy to a creature who conciliate sympathy as a love and defy antipathy as a impossibility who could _ he _ be or rather who could _ she _ be for man seem to be exclude by the very instinct of he nature the question may be answer by the evolution of fact than which what other have we even amidst the dark groping into the mystery of we wonderful be mr hislop 's head be over the skeil wherein lay one of the linen sheet of mr dalla the writer to the signet which with she broad hand she be busy twist into the form of a serpent and no doubt there be indication of she effort in the drop of perspiration which stand upon she good-humoured gaucy face so suggestive of dewdrop -lrb- ` bate the poetry -rrb- on the leaf of a big blush peony in this work she be interrupt by the entrance of henney who come rush in as if under the influence of some emotion which have take she young heart by surprise what think ye minny she cry as she hold up she hand the deil have rise again from the grave where he be bury in kirkcaldy be the reply with a laugh no that be no it continue the girl then what be it be the question he be dead reply henney who be dead again ask mrs hislop the strange man reply the girl and a reply too which bring the busy worker to a pause in she work for she understand who the _ he _ be and the information go direct through the ear to the heart but henney supposing that she be not understand add -- the man who use to look at I with yon terrible eye yes yes dear i understand you say the woman as she let the coil fall and sit down upon a chair under the influence of strong emotion but who tell you jean graham reply the girl a answer which seem for certain reason know to herself to satisfy the woman for the never another word she say any more than if she tongue have be paralyze by the increase action of she heart but as we usually find that when that organ in woman be quiet more useful power come into action so the sensible dame begin to exercise she judgment a few minute suffice for form a resolution nor be it sooner form than that it be begin to be put into action yet not before the excited girl be away no doubt to tell some of she companion of she relief from the bugbear of the man with the terrible eye the formation of a purpose might have be observe in she puckered lip and the speculation in she gray eye the spirit of romance have visit the small house in toddrick 's wynd where for fifteen year the domestic _ lare _ have sit quietly survey the economy of poverty she rise composedly from the chair into which the effect of henney 's exclamation have throw she go to the blue chest which contain she holiday suit take out one after another the chintz gown the mankie petticoat the curch the red plaid and after wash from she face the perspiration drop she begin to put on she humble finery -- all the operation have be go through with that quiet action which belong to strong mind where resolution have settle the quiver chord of doubt follow the dress dame up the high street we next find she in the writing-booth of mr jame dallas writer to he majesty 's signet the gentleman be after the manner of he tribe minutely scan some papers -- that be he be look into they so sharply that you would have infer that he be engage in hunting for flaw a species of game that be both a prey and a reward -- _ et praeda et premium _ as a old proverb say nor shall we say he be altogether please when he find he inquiry whatever it might be interrupt by the entrance of mr margaret hislop of toddrick 's wynd notwithstanding that to this personage he and mr dalla and all the dallase be indebted for the whiteness of they linen no doubt she would be want payment of she account yet why apply to he and not to mr dalla and besides it need only one glance of the writer 's eye to show that he visitor have something more of the look of a client than a cleaner of linen a conclusion which be destine to be confirm when the woman take up one of the high-backed chair in the room place it right opposite to the man of law and hitch she round body into something like stiff dignity seat herself nor be this change from she usual deportment the only one she undergo for as soon appear she style of speech be to pass from broad scotch not altogether into the ingli of the upper rank but into a mixture of the two tongue a feat which she perform very well and for which she have be qualify by have live in the service of the great and so mr napier of eastley be dead she begin yes answer the writer perhaps with a portion of cheerfulness see he be that gentleman 's agent or doer as it be then call a word far more expressive as many client can testify at least after they be do and see also that a dead client be not finally do until he affair be wind up and consign to the green box and wha be he heir think ye continue he questioner why charle napier he nephew answer the writer somewhat carelessly i be no just a ` thegither sure of that mr dalla say she with another effort at dignity which be unfortunately qualify by a know wink the deil 's in the woman be the sharp retort as the writer open he eye wider than he have do since he lay down he parchment the deil 's in I or no in I say she but this i be sure of that henrietta hislop -- that be we henney ye ken -- the brawest and bonniest lass in toddrick 's wynd -lrb- and that be no say little -rrb- be the lawful heiress of mr john napier of eastley and be call henrietta after she mother the honest woman 's red wud say the writer laugh why mr hislop i always take you for a shrewd sensible woman do you really think that because you bear a child to mr john napier therefore henney hislop be the heiress of she reputed father _ I _ bear a bairn to mr napier cry the offended client wha ever say i be the mother of henney hislop everybody reply he we never doubt it though i admit she have none of you feature everybody be a leear then rejoin the woman tartly there be no a drap of blood in the lassie 's body can claim kindred with I or mine though if it be so it would be no dishonor for the hislop be laird of highslap in ayrshire at the time of malcolm mucklehead and whose daughter by the mother 's side be she then ask he as he curiosity begin to wax stronger ay you have now you hand on the cock egg reply she with a look of mystery the other be a wind ane and you have just to sit a little and you 'll see the chick the writer settle himself into attention and the good dame think it proper like some preacher who pause two or three minute -lrb- the best part of they discourse -rrb- after they have give out the text to raise a wonder how long they intend to hold they tongue and thereby produce attention to retain she speech until she have attain the due solemnity it be now she begin in a low mysterious voice just sixteen year come June -- and if ye want the day it will be the 15th -- and if ye want the hour we may say eleven o'clock at night when i be make ready for my bed -- i hear a knock at my door and the word of a woman ` oh mr hislop mr hislop ' so i run and open the door and wha think ye i saw but jean graham mr napier 's cook with een like twa candle and she mouth as wide as if she have be to swallow the biggest sup of porridge that ever cross ploughman 's craig ` what be ado woman ' say i for i think something fearful have happen ` oh ' cry she ` my lady 's lighter and ye be to come to meggat 's land even noo this minute and bide nae man 's hindrance ' ` and so i will ' say i as i throw my red plaid ower my head then i blow out my cruse and out we come jolting each other in the dark passage through sheer hurry and confusion -- down the canongate t 'll we come to meggat 's land in at the kitchen door ben a dark passage up a stair then ben another passage till we come to a back room the door of which be open by somebody inside i be bewilder -- the light in the room make my een reel but i soon come to myself when i see a man and mr kemp the howdie busy rowing something in flannel ` get along ' say the man to jean ` you be not want here ' and as jean make off mr kemp turn to I -- ` come here mrs hislop ' say she so i slipt forward but the never a word more be say for ten minute they be so intent on get the bairn all right -- for ye ken sir it be a new-born babe they be busy with : they be as silent as the grave and indeed everything be so still that i hear they breathing like a rush of wind though they breathe just as they be wont to do and when they have finish -- ` mr hislop ' say the man as he turn to I ` you be to take this child and bring it up as you own or anybody else 's you like except mr napier 's and you be never to say when or how you get it for it be a ban creature with the curse upon it of a malison for the sin of he who beget it and of she who bear it swear to it ' and he hold up he hand and i swear but i think i would just take the advice of the lord how far my word would bind I to do evil or leave I to do gude when the time come so i take the bairn into my arm ` and wha will pay for the wet-nurse ' say i ` for ye ken i be as dry as a yeld crummie but there be a woman in toddrick 's wynd wha lose she bairn yestreen : she be threaten wus ' a milk-fever and by my troth this little stranger will cure she but besides the nourice-fee there be my trouble ' ' i be come to that ' say he ` if you supple tongue have leave you power to hear mine in this leathern purse there be twenty gowden guinea -- a goodly sum but whether goodly or no you must be content yea the never a penny more you may expect for all connection between this child and this house or its master be to be from this moment finish for ever ' and a gude quittance it be i think with a bonny bairn and twenty guinea on my side and nothing on the other but maybe a father 's anger and salt tear besides the wrath of god against those who forsake they child so with thankfulness enough i carry away my bundle and ye 'll guess that henney hislop be now the young woman of fifteen who be then that child of a day and be this all the evidence say the writer you have to prove that henrietta hislop be the daughter of mr and mr napier maybe no reply she if ye be not so like the english stranger wha curst the scotch kail because he do not see on the table the beef that be come from the kitchen besides the haggis and the bread-pudding you have only as yet get the broth and for the rest i will give you mr kemp wha tell I as a secret that the child be bring into the world by she own hand from the living body of mr napier will that satisfy you no reply mr dalla who have get deeper and deeper into a study mr napier i know be at home that evening when he wife bear a child : that child never could have be give away without he consent and as for the consent itself it be a still greater improbability see that he be always anxious for a heir to eastley and so maybe he be reply she but i see you be only at the beef yet and you may be better pleased when you have get the haggis let alone the pudding yea it be even likely mr napier want a heir and what be more he get one at least a heiress but sometimes god give and the devil misgive and so it be here for mr napier take it into he head that the child be not he and in place of be please with a heir he think himself curse with a bastard beget on he wife by no other than captain preston he lady 's cousin and where do the devil find that poison grow but in the heart of isabel napier the sister of that very charle who be now think he will heir eastley by push aside poor henney and then the poison like the old apple be so fair and tempting for mr napier have be marry ten year and enjoy the love that be so bonnie a ` little while when it be new ' and yet have no child till this one come so exactly nine month after the captain 's visit to scotland that satan have little more to do than hold up the temptation you see sir how thing come round but still accord to the old fashion after a long weary dreary turn mr napier die next day after the birth mr napier live a miserable man henney be bring up in poverty and sometimes distress but now i hope she have come to she kingdom here mr hislop stop and as there could be no better winding-up of a romance than by bring she heroine to she kingdom at last she feel so well pleased with she conclusion that she could afford to wait longer for she expect applause than the fair story-teller in the _ briga _ under queen pampinea and it be as well that she be thus fortify for the writer in place of declare he satisfaction with she proof seem as he lay back in he chair in a deep reverie to be occupy once more in hunting for flaw at length raise himself on he chair and fix he eye upon she with that look of scepticism which a writer assume when he address a would-be new client who want to push out a old one with a better right -- mr hislop say he if it have not be that i have always take you for a honest woman i would say that you be art and part in fabricate a story without a particle of foundation there may possibly be some mystery about the birth and parentage of the young girl you may have get she out of the house of meggat 's land in the canongate from a man -- not mr napier you admit -- who may have be the father of it by some mother reside in the house and mr kemp may have be actuate by some unknown means to remove the paternity from the right to the wrong person all this be possible but that the child could be that one which mr napier bear be impossible for this reason -- and i beg of you to listen to it -- that mr napier 's child _ be dead-born and be accord to good evidence bury in the same coffin with the mother _ a statement this which deliver in the solemn manner of a attorney who be really honest and who know much of this history appear to mr hislop so strange that she tongue be paralyze a effect which have never before be produce by any one of all the five cause of the metaphysician even she eye seem to have lose they power of movement and as for she wit they have like those of the renowned astolpho surely leave and take refuge in the moon if you be not satisfy with my word continue the writer -lrb- no doubt ironically for where could he have find better evidence of the effect of he statement -rrb- i will give you write for the truth of what i have say to you and rise and go towards a green tin box he open the same and take therefrom a piece of paper he resume he seat now listen say he as he unfold a old yellow-coloured sheet of paper and then he read these word : ` you presence be request at the funeral of henrietta preston my wife and of a child still-born from my house meggat 's land canongate to the burying-ground at st cuthbert on Friday the 19th of this month June at one o'clock ' and the name at this letter continue mr dalla be that of ` john napier of eastley ' will that satisfy you and the doer for mr charle napier conceive that he have at last effectually do he client 's opponent seem well pleased to sit and witness the further effect of he evidence on the bewildered woman but we be to remember that a second stroke sometimes only take away the pain of the former and a repetition of blow will quicken the reaction which slumber under the first whether this be so or not in we present instance or whether mr hislop have recover she wit by a process far shorter than that follow by the foresaid astolpho we know not but certain it be that she recover the power of both she eye and she tongue in much less time than the writer expect and in a manner too very different from that for which he be probably prepared weel reply she smile it would just seem that even the haggis have not pleased you mr dalla and put she hand into a big side-pocket that might have serve a gaberlunzie for a wallet she extract a small piece of paper she continue : but ye see a guid honest scotchwoman 's no to be suspect of be shabby at she own table so read ye that which you may take for the bread-pudding and the writer have take the paper and hold it before he face for so long a time that it might have suggest the suspicion that the word therein write stick in he eye and would not submit to that strange process whereby unknown to ourselves we transfer write vocable to the ear before we can understand they turn a look upon the woman of dark suspicion -- where in god 's name get you this he say just read it out first reply she ye read yer ain paper and why no mine and the writer read perhaps more easily than he could understand the strange word : this child bear of my wife and yet neither of my blood nor my lineage i repudiate and unable to push it back into the dark world of nothing from which it come i leave it with a scowl to the mercy which countervaileth the terrible decree whereby the sin of the parent shall be visit on the child this i do on the 15th of June 17 -- john napier of eastley in the county of mid-lothian after read this extraordinary denunciation mr dalla sit and consider as if at a loss what to say but whether it be that scepticism be at the root of he thought or that he assume it as a mask to conceal misgiving to which he do not like to confess he put a question : where get you this notable piece of evidence ay reply mr hislop you be get reasonable on the last dish that bit of paper which to I and my dear henney be werth the haill estate of eastley be find by I carefully pin to the flannel in which the child be wrapt wonderful enough surely repeat he _ if true _ -- the latter word be pronounce with emphasis which make the rough liquid letter sound like a hurl stone but he continue the whole document in its term of crimination and exposure and not less the wild manner of its application be so unlike the act of a man not absolutely frantic that i can not believe it to be genuine but you know mr dalla reply she that mr john napier be a man who if he throw a stone care little whether it strike the kirk window or the mill door that be so far true but passionate and unforgiving as he be he be not so reckless as to be regardless whether the stone do not come back on he own head and it be no genuine she resume as disregard he latter word she relapse into she more familiar dialect the lord help ye canna ye look at first the ae paper and then the ither and if they be no alike mustna the ither be the forgery a example of the conditional syllogism which might have amuse even a writer to the signet if he have not be at the very moment busy in the examination of the handwriting of the funeral letter and that of the paper of repudiation and malison -- the resemblance or rather the identity of which be so striking as to reduce all he theory to confusion by all that be good in heaven the same he mutter to himself and then address he visitor i confess mrs hislop say he that this paper have drive I somewhat off my point of confidence but i suppose you will see that if the child be actually as the letter indicate bury with its mother henrietta 's rights be at a end it be just possible however i fairly admit that mr napier who be a very eccentric man may have so word the letter as to induce the world to believe that the so-considered illegitimate child have be dead-born while he gratify -- privately he might verily think -- he vengeance by write this terrible curse still i think you be wrong but as this wonderful paper give you a plausible plea i would recommend you to mr white in mill 's court who will see to the young woman 's rights he will be the flint and i the steel and between we friendly opposition we will produce a spark which will light up the candle of truth ay reply she only as the spark of fire come from the steel we 'll just suppose you be the flint -- and by my troth you be hard enough but come as it may it will light the lantern that will show henney napier to the bonnie haugh of eastley mr hislop have get back she paper from mr dalla leave the writer 's chamber and direct she step to mill 's court where she find mr white even as she have mr dalla busy pore over law papers she be as we have see one of those people who can make they own introduction acceptable and moreover one of those woman few as they be who can tell a story with the continuity and fitting emphasis necessary to secure the attention of a busy listener so mr white hear she narrative not only with interest but even a touch of the pervade sympathy of the spirit of romance and so he might for who do not see that the charm of mystery can be enhance by the hope of turn it to account of money then he be so much of a practical man as to know that while every string have two end the true way to get hold of both be to make sure in the first place of one wherefore he begin to interrogate he client as to who could speak to the doings in the house in meggat 's land on that eventful night when the child be bear and have take note of the answer to he question he pause a little as if to consider what be the first step he ought to take into the region of doubt and perhaps of intrigue where at least there must be lie float about like film in the clear atmosphere of truth nor have he meditate many minute till he rise and take up he square hat and he gold-headed cane he say -- come we will try what we can discover in a quarter where a end of the ravel string ought to be find whether complicate into a knot by the twist power of self-interest or no and lead the way he proceed with he client down the high street where along under the glimmer lamp be the usual crowd of lounger compose of canny saxon and fiery celt which have always make this picturesque thoroughfare so remarkable not one of all these have any interest for we two searcher but it be otherwise when they come toward the canongate tolbooth where out from a dark entry spring a young woman and bound forward seize we good dame round the neck this be no other than henney hislop herself who have be alarm at the long absence of she mother as she call she and of course believe she to be be so delighted to find she that she sob out she joy in such a artless way that even the writer own it be interesting to behold nor be the picture without other trait calculate to engage attention for the girl whose fortune have be so strange and be perhaps destine to be still more strange be dress in the humblest garb -- the short gown and the skirt peculiar to the time but then every tint be so bright with pure cleanliness the earring set off so fine a skin the indispensable strip of purple round the head impart so much of the grace of the old classic wreath and beyond all this which might be say to be extraneous she feature -- if you abate the foresaid cast or slight squint in the eye which impart a piquancy -- be so regular if not handsome that you could not have deny that she deserve to be a napier if she be not a very napier in reality a few word whisper in mr hislop 's ear and the girl be off leave we couple to proceed on they way even this incident have its use for mr white who have know mr napier and have faith -lrb- as who have not -rrb- in the hereditary descent of bodily aspect could not restrain himself from the remark however much it might inflame the hope of he client -- the curse have leave no blight there say he that be the very face of mr napier -- the high nose especially and as for the eye with that unmistakeable cast why i have see they foretype in the head of john napier a hundred time a observation so congenial to mr hislop that she could not help be a little humorous even in the depth of a anxiety which have keep she silent for the full space of ten minute nose sir there be not a man frae the castle yett to holyrood wha could have produce that nose except john napier and without further interruption than she own laugh they proceed till they come to the entry call big lochend close up which they go some forty or fifty step till they come to a outer door which lead by a short dark passage to two or three inner door in succession all lead to separate room occupy by separate people no sooner have they turn into this passage than they encounter a woman in a plaid and with a lantern in she hand who have just leave the third or innermost room and whose face as it peer through the thick fold of she head-covering be illuminate by a gleam from the light she carry she give they little opportunity for examination have hurry away as if she have be afraid of be search for steal property isbel napier whisper mr hislop she wha first bring evil into the house of the napier with all its woe and who bode we small hope here say he if she have be with the nurse and enter the room from which the ill-omening woman have issue they find another even she of whom they be in search sit by the fire torpid and corpulent to a degree which indicate that as it have be she trade to nurse other she have not forget herself in she ministration mr temple say mr white who see the policy of speak fair the woman who have be so recently in the company of a evil genius i be glad to find you so stout and hearty neither o ' the twa sir reply she for i be rather weak and heartless many a ane i hae nurse into health and strength but a ' nursing come hame in the end and some no doubt have die under you care continue the writer with a view to introduce he subject and therefore you should be grateful for the life that be still spare to you you could not save the life of mr napier that be a auld story and a waefu ' ane she reply with a side-look at mr hislop and i hae nae heart to mind it some say the lady wasna innocent and doubtless mr napier think sae for he take high dealings wus ' she and look at she wus ' a scorn that would have scathe whinstane sae it be better she be ta'en awa -- ay and she baby wus ' she for if it have live it would have dree would the revenge o ' that stern man the child say mr white do it die too dee ye may rather ask if it ever live for it never draw breath in this world at least a statement so strange that it bring the eye of the two visitor to each other and no doubt both of they recur in memory to the statement in the funeral letter which whatever may have be the case with the assertion now make by the nurse never could have be dictate by she they have meet in the passage and no doubt also they both remember the statement make by mr dalla to the effect that both the mother and child be bury together never draw breath you say nurse resume mr white with a air of astonishment why i have be give to understand not only that the child be bear alive but that it be actually live now weel reply the nurse maybe st cuthbert have work a miracle and bring the child out o ' the grave by the west church but he have work nae miracle on I to mak ' I forget what my een saw and my hand do that day when i help to place the dead body o ' the innocent on the breast o ' its dead mother ay and bent she stiff arm sae as to bring they ower she bairn just as if she have be fauld it to she bosom and sa in this fashion be they bury and you would swear to that mr temple say the writer ay upon fifty bible ane after anither be the reply in something like a tone of triumph nor could the woman be induce to swerve from these assertion notwithstanding repeat interrogation and the writer be leave to the conclusion -- which he prefer rather than place any confidence in the funeral letter -- that the nurse 's statement be in some mysterious way connect with the visit of isabel napier and yet not so very mysterious after all when we be to consider that she brother be prepare to claim eastley as well as the valuable furniture of the house in meggat 's land as the nearest lawful heir of he deceased uncle the salvo be at least comfortable to both mr white and he client and no doubt it help to lighten they step as bidding adieu to the hard witness they leave she to the nursing which come aye hame in the end but they inquiry be not finish and retrace they step up the canongate they land in the fountain close where under the lead of mr hislop the writer be procure another witness with a name already familiar to he through the communication of he client and this be no other than that same jean graham who be send to toddrick 's wynd on that eventful night fifteen year before to bring mr hislop to the house in meggat 's land -- one of those simple soul -- we wish there be more of they in the world -- who look upon a lie as rather a operose affair and who seem to be truthful from sheer laziness there be accordingly no difficulty here for the woman roll off she story just as if it have be coil up in she mind for all that length of time there be a terrible stir in the house that night she begin the nurse wha be yet live in lochend close and mr kemp the howdie wha be dead be wus ' my lady and john cowie the butler be busy attend we master who have be the haill day in ane o ' he dark fit for we hear he call for cowie in a fierce voice ever and again and he step sound ower we head upon the floor as he walk back and fore in he wrath then i be send for you and bring you and you 'll mind how cowie bid I go along but i have mair sense for i listen at the door and hear what the butler say to ye when he gie ye the bairn and think ye i didna see ye carry it along the passage as ye leave sae far i could understand but when i hear nurse say the bairn be dead mr kemp say the bairn be still-born and cowie declare it be better it be dead and awa i couldna comprehend this ava nor do i weel yet but we just think that as there be something wrang between master and my lady he want we to believe that the bairn be dead for very shame o ' be think the father when maybe he wasna and then he be so guid to I and my neighbor anne dickson -- ye mind o ' she -- puir soul she be dead too -- that we couldna for the very heart o ' we say a word o ' what we know but now when mr napier be dead and the brother o ' that wicked jezebel isbel napier may try to take the property fra henney wha i aye ken as a napier with the very nose and een o ' the father i have speak out and may the lord gie the right to whom the right be due it be all right say the writer after he have jot with a pencil the evidence of jean as well as that of the nurse and if we could find this john cowie we might so fortify the orphan 's rights as to defy miss napier and she brother and mr dalla and all the witness they can bring ay continue the woman but i doubt if you 'll catch he he leave mr napier 's service about ten year ago and i never hear mair o ' he nor i either say mr hislop well we must search for he add mr white for that man alone so far as i can see be he who will unravel this strange business and thus the day 's work finish the writer part for mill 's court and mr hislop fill with doubt hope and anxiety seek she humble dwelling in toddrick 's wynd where henney wait for she with all the solicitude of a daughter but a word do not escape she lip that might carry to the girl 's mind a suspicion that the golden cord of they suppose relationship run a risk of be sever even with the eventual condition that one if not both of the division would be transmute into a string of diamond meanwhile the agent be in he own house revolve all the point of a puzzle more curious than any that have yet come within the scope of he experience sometimes he feel confidence and at other time despair and of course he have the consolation which belong to all litigant that the opposite party be undergo the same process of oscillation it be clear enough that cowie be the require oedipus and if it should turn out that he be dead or could not be find the advantage be with a slight declination on the part of charle napier insomuch as while he be indisputably the nephew of the decease the orphan henrietta be under the necessity of prove she birth and pedigree and so as it appear mr dalla be of that opinion for the very next day he apply to chancery for a brieve to get charle napier serve nearest and lawful heir to he uncle and as in legal warfare where the judge be cognisant only of patent claim there be small room for retire tactic mr white feel himself oblige however anxious he be to gain time to follow he opponent 's example by take out a compete brieve in favor of henrietta the party be now face to face in court and the battle behove to be fight out but as in all legal case where the circumstance be strange or peculiar the story soon get wind so here the meggat 's land romance be by-and-by all over the city nor do it take less fantastic form than usual where sympathy and antipathy be strong in proportion to the paucity of the fact on which they be feed it be a favorite opinion of some that the case could only be clear by suppose that a dead stranger child have be surreptitiously pass off and even coffine as the true one while other equally skilled in the art of divine maintain that the child give to mr hislop by cowie be a bastard of he own by the terrible woman isabel napier who be thus accord to the ordinary working of public prejudice raise to a height of crime sufficient to justify the hatred of the people : on which presumption it behove to be assume that the paper contain the curse be a forgery by cowie and he associate in crime and that the money pay to mr hislop be furnish by the lady all which supposition and other not less incredible be greedily accept for the very reason that it require something prodigious to explain a enigma which exhaust the ordinary source of man 's ingenuity just as we find in many religion where miracle -- the more absurd the more acceptable -- be resort to to explain the mystery of man 's relation to god a secret which no natural light can illuminate but all these supposition be destine to undergo refraction through the medium of a new fact the case by technical process come before the court of session where the diversity of opinion be proportionably to the number of judge as great as among the quidnunc outside the only clear idea in the head of the robed and wigged wiseacre be that the case napier _ versus _ napier be a puzzle which no man could read or solve it seem fate to be as famous as the old sphinx the insoluble moenander or the tortuous labyrinth or the intricate key of hercule -- _ ne apollo quidem intelligat _ and if it have not happen that lord kame suggest the possibility of get a additional piece of evidence through the examination of the coffin wherein mr napier be bury the court might have be sit over the famous case even in this year of the nineteenth century the notion be worthy of he lordship 's ingenuity and accordingly a commission be issue to one of the faculty to proceed to the west church burying-ground and there cause to be lay open and examine the coffin of the say mr henrietta preston or napier with the view to ascertain whether or not the body of a child have be place therein along with the corpse of the mother this commission be accordingly execute and the report bear that he the commissioner have proceed to the burying-ground of the parish of st cuthbert and there cause david scott the sexton to lay open the grave of the say henrietta preston or napier and to open the coffin therein contain which have accordingly be do by the say david scott and he assistant the commissioner upon a faithful examination aid by the experience of the say david scott do find the skeleton of two body in the say coffin identify as that of the say lady one whereof be that of a woman apparently of middle age and the other that of a babe which lay upon the chest of the larger skeleton in such a way or manner as to be retain or hold in that position by the arm of the same be lay across it that have satisfy himself of these fact the commissioner cause the coffin to be again close and the grave cover with all decency and care and he accordingly make this report to they lordship the fact thus ascertain in opposition to the expectation of those who favor the orphan be view by the court as deprive to a great extent the case of that aspect of a riddle by which it have be so unfortunately distinguish and as the case have be hang up even beyond the time generally occupy by case at that period when as it be sometimes remark law-suit be as often settle by the old rule _ romanus sedendo vincit _ -- by the death of one or other of the party -- as by a judgment the case be again put to the roll for a hearing on the effect of the new evidence it be contend for the nephew by mr wight that the question be now virtually settle insomuch that the court be not bind to solve riddle but to find to whom pertain a certain right of inheritance the birth of the child have be swear to by the nurse as well as its death and the final placing of it in the coffin and now the court have as it be ocular demonstration of these fact by the body have be see by they own commissioner place on the breast of the mother in that very peculiar way describe by mr temple all claim on the part of the girl be thus virtually exclude for the proceedings which take place that evening in another room under circumstance of suspicion be swear to only by mr hislop herself a interested witness and be only partially confirm by a eavesdropper who as eavesdropper generally do -lrb- except when they own character be concerned -rrb- perhaps hear accord as foregone prejudice induce she to wish these suspicious proceedings might be explain by as many hypothesis as have be devise by the wise judge of the tavern among which be the theory of the living child be cowie 's own by isabel napier and palm off as mr napier 's to hide the shame of the true mother -- all unlikely enough no doubt but not so impossible as that the coffine child should now be alive and await the issue of this case in the expectation of be lady of eastley on the other side mr andrew counsel for henrietta maintain that while he learn brother assume the one half of the case as proved and repudiate the other as a lie or a myth he have a right to embrace the other half and pronounce the first a stratagem or trick the proceedings in the back-room into which jean graham introduce mr hislop be more completely substantiate than those in the bedroom where mr napier lay for while the one be swear to by mr hislop herself a soothfast witness and confirm in all point by the woman graham the other be attempt to be prove by the solitary testimony of the nurse temple the paper contain the curse be as indisputably in the handwriting of mr napier as be the funeral letter the money pay be prove by the fact that the orphan have be keep and educate for fifteen year the name henrietta be not likely to have be a mere coincidence and it be still more unlikely that a respectable woman such as mr hislop would invent a story of affiliation so strangely in harmony with the secret of the house in meggat 's land and fortify it by a forge document then mr hislop be unable to write and no attempt have be make on the other side to prove that henrietta have a father other than he who be point out by the paper of the curse so he -lrb- the counsel -rrb- might follow the example of he brother and hold the other half of the case to be unexplainable by hypothesis however ridiculous the child have be dispose of to mr hislop -- a fact thus prove -- what be to prevent he -lrb- the counsel -rrb- from go also to the haunt of the _ tabernian _ solon or anywhere else in the region of fancy for the theory that mr napier or some plotter for he in the shape of mr kemp or john cowie substitute the dead child of a stranger for the live one of he wife and bribe the nurse temple to tell the tale she have tell to which she would be the more ready by the golden prompting of the woman isabel napier the niece whose brother would in the event of the stratagem be conceal succeed to the estate of eastley at the conclusion of these pleading the judge be incline to be even more humorous than they have be previous to the issue of the commission for they have think they see they way to a judgment against the orphan the president -lrb- braxfield -rrb- it be say indulge in a joke to the effect that he have read _ somewhere _ -- it be not for so religious a man to say where -- of a child have be claim by two mother he would like to see two father at that work at least he would not be one but here the claim be set up by death on the one side and life -lrb- if a personification could be allow -rrb- on the other and they could not follow the old precedent because he suspect none of they lordship would like to see the grim claimant at the bar to receive he half and so they chuckle as judge sometimes do at they own joke -- generally very bad -- altogether oblivious of the fable of the frog who could see no fun in a game which be death to they for as we have indicate the opinion of a great majority be against the claim of the young woman : nor would the decision have be suspend that day have not mr andrew rise and make a statement -- perhaps _ as _ fictitious as a counsel 's conscience would permit -- to the effect that the agent -lrb- mr white -rrb- have procure some trace of the butler cowie who could throw more light on the case than death have do and that if some time be accord to complete the inquiry something might turn up which would alter the complexion even of this protean mystery the request be grant but in truth mr andrew ' suggestion be simply a bit of ingenuity intend to ward off a unfavourable judgment and allow a development of the chapter of accident -- a wise policy for as the womb of time be never empty so fate write in the morning a chapter of every man 's life of a day at which in the evening he be sometimes a little surprised no trace have yet be get of cowie it be not even know whether he be alive but if we throw some fourteen day into the wallet-bag of saturn we may come to a day whereupon a certain person in a inn far down in a valley of westmoreland and in the little town call kirby lonsdale be busy read the _ caledonian mercury _ -- for it be not more easy to say where the winged _ mercury _ of that time would not go than it be to tell where a certain insect without wing which aye travels south might not be find in england as a immigrant it be at least no wonder that the paper should contain a account of the romance wrap up in the case napier _ versus _ napier and certainty if we could have judge from the face of the individual we would have set he down as one give to the reading of riddle for after he have peruse the paragraph he look as if he know more about that case than all the fifteen with the macer to boot nor be he contented with a indication of a mere look of wisdom : he actually burst out into a laugh -- a expression wondrously unsuited to the gravity of the subject you who read this will no doubt suspect that we be merely shade this man for the sake of effect : and this be true but you be to remember that while we be chronicler of thing mysterious we work for the advantage to you of put into you power to venture a shrewd guess in make which you be only work in the destine vocation of man for the world be only guesswork all over and you yourself be only guesswork as a part of it the reader of the _ mercury _ be verily mr john cowie whilom butler to mr john napier and now waiter in the lonsdale arm of the obscure kirby -- a place like peeble where if you want to deposit a secret you could do so by cry it out at the market-cross and moreover he be verily in possession of the key to the napier mystery accordingly mr white of mill 's court in two day afterwards receive a letter inform he that john cowie be the writer of the same and that if a reasonable consideration be hold out to he he would proceed to the northern metropolis and there settle for ever a case which apparently have keep the newsmonger of edinburgh in aliment for a length of time much exceed the normal nine day opportune and happily come in the very nick of time as the latter be -- for the delay allow by the court have all but expire -- mr white see the danger of promising anything which could be construe into a reward but he could use other means of decoy the shy bird into he mesh and these he use in he answer with such effect that the man who could solve the mystery be in edinburgh at the end of a week nor be mr white unprepared to receive he for he have previously get a commission to examine he and take he deposition : but then a agent like to know what a witness will say before he cite he and the canny scotchman of all man in the world be the most uncanny if bring to swear without some hope of be benefit by he oath there be therefore need of tact as well as delicacy and mr white contrived in the first place to get he man to take up he quarter in the house in mill 's court a good supper and chamber form the first demulcent -- we do not say bribe because by a legal fiction all eating and drinking be set down to the score of hospitality a scotch breakfast follow in the morning at which be present mr white and mr hislop and we favorite henney -- the last of whom spite of all the effort of she putative mother to keep from she the secret of she birth and prospects have catch the infection of the general topic of the city and wonder at she strange fortune much as the paladin in the orlando do when he get into the moon no man can precognosce like a woman and here be three but perhaps they might have all fail have it not be for the natural art of henney who out of pure goodness and gratitude be so delighted with the man who have roll she in a blanket and send she to she beloved mother as she still call she that she promise to make he butler at eastley and keep he comfortable all he day now say the cautious agent this promise of henney 's be not make in consideration of you give evidence for she before the commissioner i be think of nothing but she face say john i could swear to it out of a thousand and heaven bless she for i think i be again in the once happy house in meggat 's land and john pretend he be wipe a morsel of egg from he mouth while the handkerchief be extend as far as the eye a terrible night that be he continue mr napier have be in labor all day and when mr kemp tell I to tell my master that my lady have be deliver of twin -- _ twin _ cry they all as if move by some sympathetic chord which run from heart to heart ay twin he repeat one dead and another living -- even you yourself henney who be as like you father as if there never have be a captain preston in the world and thus be john cowie precognosced we need not say that he be that very day examine before the commissioner he give a account of all the proceedings of the house in meggat 's land on the eventful night to which we have refer the case be no longer a puzzle and accordingly a decision be give in favor of henrietta whereby we have one other example of truth and right emerge from darkness into light some time afterwards the heiress with mr hislop alongside and john cowie on the driver 's box proceed to eastley and take possession where henrietta act the part of a generous lady mr hislop that of a kind of a dowager and john be once more butler in the house of the napier we stop here those who feel interest enough in the fortune of henney to inquire when and whom she marry and what be the subsequent fortune of a life so strangely begin will do well to go to eastley the orphan about forty year ago a post-chaise be a sight more novel in the little hamlet of thorndean than silk gown in country church during the maidenhood of we great-grandmother and as one draw up at the only public-house in the village the inhabitant old and young startle by the unusual and merry sound of its wheel hurry to the street the landlady on the first notice of its approach have hastily bestow upon she goodly person the additional recommendation of a clean cap and apron and still tie the apron-string run bustling to the door smile color and courtesy and courtesy and color again to the yet unopened chaise poor soul she know not well how to behave -- it be a epoch in she annals of innkeeping at length the coachman open the door hand out a lady in widow 's weed a beautiful golden-haired child apparently not exceed five year of age spring to the ground without assistance and grasp she extended hand what a image o ' beauty exclaim some half-dozen bystander as the fair child lift she lovely face of smile to the eye of she mother the lady step feebly towards the inn and though the landlady 's heart continue to practice a sort of flutter motion which communicate a portion of its agitation to she hand she wait upon she unexpected and unusual guest with a kindliness and humility that fully recompense for the expertness of a practice waiter about half a hour after the arrival of she visitor she be see bustling from the door she face as the villager say burst with importance they be still in group about they door and in the middle of the little street discuss the mysterious arrival and as she hasten on she mission she be assail with a dozen such question as these -- wat ye wha she be be she ony great body hae ye ony guess what bring she here and be yon bonny creature she ain bairn but to these and sundry other interrogatory the important hostess give for answer hoot i hae nae time to haver the noo she stop at a small but certainly the most genteel house in the village occupy by a mr dougla who in the country phrase be a very douce decent sort of a old body and the widow of a cameronian minister in the summer season mr dougla let out she little parlor to lodger who visit the village to seek health or for a few week ' retirement she be compel to do this from the narrowness of she circumstance for though she be a clever-handed woman as she neighbor say she have a sair fecht to keep up a appearance onyway like the thing ava in a few minute mr dougla in a clean cap a muslin kerchief round she neck a quilted black bombazine gown and snow-white apron follow the landlady up to the inn in a short time she return the stranger lady lean upon she arm and the lovely child leap like a young lamb before they day and week pass away and the good people of thorndean notwithstanding all they surmise and inquiry be no wiser regard they new visitor all they could learn be that she be the widow of a young officer who be one of the first that fall when britain interfere with the french revolution and the mother and she child become know in the village by the designation of mr dougla 's twa picture -- a appellation bestow on they in reference to they beauty the beautiful destroyer however lay in the mother 's heart now pale she cheek like the early lily and again scatter over they the rose and the rainbow still dream of recovery about eight month after she arrival in thorndean death steal over she like a sweet sleep it be only a few moment before the angel hurl the fatal shaft that the truth fall upon she soul she be stretch forth she hand to she work-basket she lovely child be prattle by she knee and mr dougla smile like a parent upon both strive to conceal a tear while she smile when the breathing of she fair guest become difficult and the rose which a moment before bloom upon she countenance vanish in a fitful streak she fling she feeble arm around the neck of she child who now weep upon she bosom and exclaim oh my elizabeth who will protect you now my poor poor orphan mr dougla spring to she assistance she say she have much to tell and endeavor to speak but a gurgle sound only be hear in she throat she pant for breath the rosy streak deepen into blue come and go upon she cheek like the midnight dance of the northern light she eye flash with a momentary brightness more than mortal and the spirit flee the fair orphan still cling to the neck and kiss the yet warm lip of she dead mother as yet she be too young to see all the dreariness of the desolation around she but she be indeed a orphan in the most cruel meaning of the word she mother have preserve a mystery over she sorrow and the circumstance of she life which mr dougla have never endeavor to penetrate and now she be leave to be as a mother to the helpless child for she know not if she have another friend and all that she have hear of the mother 's history be record on the humble stone which she place over she grave : _ here resteth the body of isabellum morton widow of captain morton she die amongst we a stranger but beloved _ the whole property to which the fair orphan become heir by the death of she mother do not amount to fifty pound and amongst the property no document be find which could throw any light upon who be she relative or if she have any but the heart of mr dougla have already adopt she as a daughter and circumscribe as she circumstance be she trust that he who provide food for the very bird of heaven would provide the orphan 's morsel year roll on and elizabeth morton grow in stature and in beauty the pride of she protector and the joy of she age but the infirmity of year grow upon she foster-mother and disable she from follow she habit of industry stern want enter she happy cottage still elizabeth appear only as a thing of joy contentment and gratitude and often do she evening song beguile she aged friend 's sigh into a smile and to better they hard lot she hire herself to watch a few sheep upon the neighbouring hill to the steward of a gentleman name sommerville who about the time of she mother 's death have purchase the estate of thorndean he be but little beloved for he be a hard master and a bad husband and more than once he have be see at the hour of midnight in the silent churchyard standing over the grave of mr morton this give rise to not a few whispering respect the birth of poor elizabeth he have no child and a nephew who reside in he house be understand to be he heir william sommerville be about a year older than we fair orphan and ever as he could escape the eye of he uncle he would fly to the village to seek out elizabeth as a playmate and now while she tend the few sheep he would steal round the hill and place himself by she side teach she the lesson he have that day be teach while he arm in innocence rest on she neck they glowing cheek touch each other and she golden curl play around they often be they peaceful lesson break

between forty and fifty year of age they have merely become acquaint as travel companion and the stranger be on he way northward have accept he invitation to rest at he uncle 's for a few day the footpath to the hall lay through the churchyard about a quarter of a mile from the village it be a secluded path and elizabeth be wont to retire to it between school hour and frequently to spend a few moment in silent meditation over she mother 's grave she be gaze upon it when a voice arrest she attention say elizabeth -- miss morton the speaker be lieutenant sommerville accompany by he friend to the meeting of the young lover we shall add nothing but the elder stranger gaze on she face and tremble and look on she mother 's grave and weep morton he repeat and read the inscription on the humble

wandered by the hill-side in bliss catch love and recollection from the scene in a few month she father bestow on he she hand and mr dougla in joy and in pride bestow upon both she blessing the burgher 's tale the brownie of the west bow i can not say so much for the authenticity of the legend i be now to relate as i have be able to do for some of the other in this collection but that be no reason i hope for its fail to interest the reader who make it a necessary condition of he acceptance that a legend shall keep within the bound of human nature : not that any one of we can say what these bound be for every day of we experience be extend they in both the inner and outer world and we never can be very sure whether the thing which rise upon the distant horizon of we nocturnal vision be less unstable and uncertain than those that exist under we nose true it be at any rate that the legend be narrate to I in a meager form by a lady sufficiently ancient to be suppose to be a lover of strange story and not imaginative or wicked enough to concoct they that part of edinburgh call the west bow be at the date of we legend the tinsmith ' quarter a fact which no one who chance to walk down that way could have doubt unless indeed he be deaf among the fraternity there be one destine to live in annals even with more posthumous notoriety than he of the same place and craft who long get the credit of be the author of the land o ' the leal he name be thoma or accord to the scottish way of pronounce it tamma dodd who with a wife go under the domestic euphuism of jenny occupy as a dwelling-house a small flat of three room in the near neighborhood of he workshop this couple have live together five year without have any child procreate of they body or any quarrel bear of they spirit and thus they might have live to the end of they life if a malign influence bear of the devil have not get possession of the husband 's heart this influence which we may be permit by good calvinist to call diabolical be as a consequence not only in its origin but also in its medium altogether extraneous to we couple for so far as regard mr jenny dodd she be as much as a good wife could be free from any great defect of conduct and as for the tinsmith himself he have hitherto live so sober and douce a life that we can not avoid the notion that if he have not be subject to aiblin a great temptation he would not have become the victim of the arch-enemy thus much we say of the disposition of the two party and be it not that certain peculiarity belong to jenny which as reappearing in a after-part of we story it be necessary to know we would not have go further into mere character -- a element which have little to do generally with legend except in so far as it either produce the incident or may be develop through they the first of these peculiarity be a settle conviction that she have as good a right to rule tamma dodd as be she property as if she have drunk of the water of st kevin nor be this conviction merely natural to she for she could lay she finger on that particular part of sacred writ which be the foundation of the generally-received maxim one may do what one like with one 's own no doubt she know another passage in the same volume with a very different meaning but then mr dodd do not _ wish _ to remember that or to obey it when she do remember it and we be to consider without go back to that crazy school of which a certain aristippus be the dominie that wish or not wish have a considerable influence upon the aspect of moral truth if it do not exercise over they a kind of legerdemain of which we be unconscious whereby it change one of these aspect into another even when these be respectively to each other as white be to black this claim of right do not generally look peaceful no more it should for it be clearly enough against nature and one seldom kick at she without get sore toe true enough there do appear case where it seem to work pretty well but when they be inquire into it be generally find either that the husband be a simpleton submit by mere inanity or a man who have resist to the uttermost and be at last crumple up by pure caudlish iteration and perseverance how tamma take it may yet appear proceed with the peculiarity : another of these be that mr dodd like she of auchtermuchty or mr grumlie carry domesticity to devotion scarcely anything in the world have any interest to she soul save what be contain in the house -- from tammas the chief article of furniture down through the mahogany table to the porridge-pot clouting mend darning cleaning scour wash scrape wring dry roast boil stew be all of they do with such duty love and intensity of purpose that they be veritable sacrifice to the _ lare _ this be doubtless a virtue and as doubtless it be a vice insomuch as if we believe another old greek pedagogue of the name of aristotle all virtue be medial vice and all vice extreme virtue how tammas view this question may also appear but we may proceed to state that mr janet dodd be not content with do all those thing with such severity of love or duty she be always tell herself what she intend to do either at the moment or afterwards this pan need to be scour thae stocking maun be darned this sark be as black as the lum and maun be plot the floor need scrub tamma 's coat be cry ' a steek in time save nine ' and by my faith it say true and so on nor do it signify much whether thoma or any other person be in the house at the time -- the word be not intend for anybody but herself and to herself she persist in tell they with a stedfastness which only the ear of a whitesmith could tolerate even with the consideration that he be not as so many be deave with scandal -- a delectation which janet despise if she do not care as little for what be go on domestically within the house on the top of the same stair as she do for the in-door affair of japan or tobolsk we may mention also that she persevere in read the same chapter of the bible and in sing the same psalm every Sunday morning in addition to these characteristic janet make it a point never to change the form or color of she dress so that if all the woman in edinburgh have be of she taste and mode of think all the color by which they be diversified and make interesting would have be reduce to the dead level of hodden-grey the occupation of the imp fashion would have be go nay the angel for fear of offend mortal would have eschew the nymph iri from whom the poet say they steal tint and dipt they wing in a gray cloud before appear in the presence of the douce daughter of man with all these imperfection -- and how many husband would term some of they perfection -- the married life of thoma and janet dodd might have go on for another five year and five to that if it have not be that thoma in a weary hour cast a glance with a scarlet ray in it on a certain mary blyth who live in the grassmarket -- a woman of whom we legend say no more than that she be a widow besides be fair to the eye and pleasant to the ear we could wish that we have it not to say but as truth be more valuable than gold yea refine gold we be under the necessity of admit that that red ray betoken love if a affection of that kind could be call by a name so hallowed by the benediction of poet and the song of angel you must take it in you own way and with you own construction but however that may be we must all mourn for the fearful capability within we and the not less awful potentiality in the power without -- the one hide from we up to the moment when the other appear and all wrestle with the enemy prevent by what be often nothing less than a fatal charm from that moment thoma dodd be change after the manner of action of moral poison for we be to remember that while the physical kill the other only transmute and the transmutation _ may be _ from any good below grace to any evil above the devil this change in the mind of the husband include he manner of view those peculiarity in the mental constitution of janet to which we have allude she desire to rule he be now rebellion she devotion to hussyskep be nothing better than mercenary grub she adhesion to she hodden-grey be vulgar affectation and as to she monologue they be evidence of insanity such change in reference to other object happen to every one of we every day in the year only we do not look at and examine they nor if we do could we reconcile they to any theory of the mind -- all that we can say be that if we love a certain object we hate any other which come between we and we gratification and thus just as mr thoma dodd loved mr mary blyth so in a equal ratio he hate he good helpmate jenny and then begin that other wonderful process call reconciliation whereby the wish gradually overcome scruple through the cunning mean of falsify they aspect whereunto again the new mistress contribute in the adroit way of all such wretch -- instil into he ear the moral poison which deaden the apperception of these scruple at the same time that it bring out the advantage of disregard they the result of all which be that jenny 's husband of whom she have make a slave for he own good and benefit as she think and not without reason arrive by small degree and by relay of new motive one after another at the conclusion of actually remove she from this big world and of course also from that little one to she so dear even that of she household empire a resolution this which terrible and revolting as it may appear to those who be happily beyond the influence of the wish be far more easily form than execute for nature -- although improvident herself of she child swallow they up in thousand by earthquake tear they by machinery and drown they in the sea by shipload -- be very careful to defend one of they against another every scheme the husband could think of be surround with difficulty and one by one be lay aside till he come to that of precipitate he faithful jenny as if by accident into a deep pool in the north loch that sheet of water which contain as many secret in its bosom as that more romantic one in italy not far remove from a certain pious nunnery even here there be the difficulty of get jenny out at night and down cranstoun 's close and to west of the foot thereof where the say deep pool be for no other ostensible purpose in the world than to see the moon shed she beam on the surface of the water -- a object not half so beautiful to she as the clear tin pan make by she own tamma and in which she make she porridge every morning but the adage about the will and the way be of such wondrous universality that one successful effort seem as nothing in the diversity of man 's invention and so it turn out to be comparatively easy to get janet out one evening for the reason that she husband do not feel very well and would like he supper the better for a walk along the edge of the loch in which if it be she pleasure she would not refuse to accompany he so pleasant a way of put the thing harmonize with janet 's love of rule and she agree upon the condition she make with herself by means of the eternal soliloquy that she would put on the stew to be progress towards unctuousness and tenderness before they go be that to be janet 's last act of she darling hussyskep it would not be consistent with we art be we to tell you but this much be certain that janet dodd go down cranstoun 's close along with she beloved tamma that shortly after she be plunge by he into the say deep hole of the loch and cruelly leave there to sink or swim while he hasten back to tell he new love mr blyth how desperately he have do she bidding but sometimes run away have a bad look and it happen that as thoma be hurry up the dark close he meet a neighbor brother of the craft who cry to he what ho tammas dodds whaur frae and whaur tae man to which see how the act of run away would look in the justiciary court he reply with wonderful invention for the moment that janet have fall into the deep pool of the loch and that though he have endeavor to get she out he have fail by reason of he not be able to swim and that he be run to get some one to help to save she whereupon he entreat he brother craftsman to go with he to the spot and help he to rescue he beloved wife if she be not yet dead so away they go in a great hurry but to no purpose for when they come to the say pool no vestige of a creature be therein they could see except some air-bubble reflect the moonbeam and contain no doubt the living breath of the drowned woman nor when the terrible news be spread through the city and a boat and drag be make to do they uttermost under the most willing hand could the body be find it be know that the bank there be pretty steep in declivity and the presumption be that the body have roll down into the middle of the loch where in consequence of the muddiness of the water it would be difficult to find it the effort be continue next morning and day by day for a week with no better success till at last it be resolve to wait for the bursting of the gall-bladder when no doubt mr janet dodds 's body would rise and swim on the top of the water a event this which do not occur till about three week have pass at the end of which time a crowd of people appear at mr dodd 's door bear a corpse in a white sheet it be receive by the disconsolate thoma with become resignation and lay on the bed even the marriage-bed realize that strange meeting of two end which equalize pain and pleasure and reduce the product to _ nil _ nor be many hour allow to pass when decay and deface as it be it be consign to a coffin without mr dodd be able to bring he resolution to the sticking point of try to recognize in the confused mass of muscle and bone form what be once a face the lineament of she who have be once he pride and now by he own act have become he shame and condemnation in the sight of heaven next day she be consign to the tomb in so solemn a manner that if man be not man one would have have a difficulty in recognize in that gentle hand that hold the head-cord and drop it so softly on the coffin the same member which drive the innocent victim into the deep water there be a continuous progress in all thing a fact which we know only after we get hold of the clue and so when mr mary blyth appear as mr mary dodd in room of the domesticated jenny it be in perfect accordance with the law of cause and effect no doubt they do they best to be happy as all creature do even the devil 's child only in a wrong shaft but they have make that fearful miscalculation which be the wages of sin when they count upon conscience as a pimp to they pleasure in place of a king 's - evidence against they that king be the lord of heaven and earth and so it turn out in the course of several year that as they love lose its fervor they respective monitor acquire greater power in plead the cause of she who be dead and convince they against they will -lrb- for the all-powerful wish have no virtue here -rrb- that they have do a cruel thing for which they be amenable to a avenge guardian of the everlasting element of good in nature 's dualism yet strange enough each of the two keep he and she own secret they heart burn even as the fire which consume the wicked under the smother of a forced silence -- itself a torment and a agony yea neither of the two would mention the name of jenny dodd for the entire world and there be more than a mutual fear that one should know what the other thought each be under a process of exculpation and inculpation -- a mutual blame of each other in they heart without ever yet a word say to indicate they thought it be the quarrel of devil who make the lesser crime a foil to show the greater and call it a virtue for the reason that they would rather be the counterfeit of good than the base metal of evil yet with no advantage for hypocrisy be only the glow which conceal the worm in its retreat within it the plea of the wife be that she be court by the man and that although she might have wish jenny out of the way and hint as much she never mean actual murder while he again be the old barnwell charge that he better nature have be corrupt by the woman and that he do it at she suggestion and under the influence of she siren power they thus get gradually into that state of feeling by which the runaway convict from a penal settlement be actuate when toiling away through endless brake and swamp where neither meat nor drink could be procure they be so madden by hunger that each with a conceal knife under he sleeve watch he neighbor for a opportunity to strike nor could one dare to fall behind without the suspicion be raise in the mind of he companion that he be to execute he purpose when they be off they guard so like in other respects too for these man afraid to speak they thought of each other journey on in deep silence and each be ready to immolate he friend at the altar of selfishness change into a bloodthirsty dagon by the fiend hunger and thirst the year be now to be count as seven since janet dodd be plunge into the deep pool of the north loch and the state of mind of the married criminal which we have try to describe have be grow and grow for two of these year as if it threaten to get stronger the older they grow and the nearer the period of judgment one morning when they be in bed -- for even yet while they conceal they thought from each other and the name of jenny dodd be a condemn word in they vocabulary even as the sacred name among the roman they have evince no speak enmity to each other -- they hear a tirl at the door the hour be early and the douce genius of the gray dawn be deliberate with herself whether it be time to give place to she advance sister the morning mr mary dodd rise to answer the knock and thoma listen with natural curiosity to know who the early visitor be and what be want he hear a suppress scream of fear from he wife and the next moment she come rush into the room yet the never a word she utter and she lip be so white and dry that you might have suppose that she silence be the result of organic inability nor even when she get into bed again and try to hide she head with the bed-clothes do she terror diminish or she lip become more obedient to the feeling within so that thoma know not what to think except it be that she have see a ghost -- not a unnatural supposition at a time when occult cause and spiritual appearance be as undoubted as the phenomenon of the electric telegraph be in we day but he be not destine to be leave many minute more in ignorance of the cause of mr mary dodd 's terror for upon listen he hear some one come into the kitchen and bolt the door on the inside -- so much for he ear then he turn he eye to the kitchen into which he could as well as the light of the gray dawn would permit see from where he lay and what do he see how come it whence this mimic shape in look and lineament so like we kind you might accost the spectral thing and say ` good e ` en t ` ye ' no other than the figure of mr janet dodd herself yes there she be in she old gray dress busy take off that plaid which thoma know so well and hang the same upon the peg where she have hang it so often for five long year thoma be now as completely deprive of the power of speech as she who lay equally criminal as himself alongside of he but able at least to look or rather unable to shut they eye they watch the doings of the strange morning visitor they see that she be move about as if she be intent upon domestic work and by-and-by there she be busy with coal and stick bring from they respective place put on the fire which she light with the indispensable spunk apply to the spark in the tinder-box next she undertake the sweeping of the floor say to herself -- and they hear the word -- it look as if it hadna be sweep for seven year next she wash the dish which have be leave on the table indulge in the appropriate monologue imply the necessity of the work thereafter it appear as if she be dissatisfy with the progress of the fire for she be presently engage in use the bellows every blast of which be hear by the quake couple in bed and between the blast the word come ower late for tamma 's breakfast so the blow continue till it be apparent enough from the reflection of the flame on the wall that she be succeed in she effort then have make herself sure of the fire she go to the proper place for the porridge goblet take the same and put a sufficient quantity of water therein place it on the fire and begin to blow again with the same assiduity as before with still interjected sentence expressive of she confidence that she would overcome the obstinacy of the coal and overcome it she do as appear from the entire lighting up of the kitchen be ever border brownie so industrious some time now elapse as if she be sit with due patience till the water should boil thereafter she rise and they see she cross the kitchen to the lobby where the meal be keep then return with a bowl contain what she no doubt consider a sufficient quantity the stir utensil call a theedle have also get into its proper place and by-and-by they hear the sound of the same as it beat upon the bottom and side guide by a experienced hand and every now and then the sweltering and totling of the pot this process be now interrupt by the get of the gray basin into which the porridge behove to be pour and pour it be the process be follow by the sound of the clauting o ' the laggan so familiar to scotch ear now it be ready for he say the figure as it move across the kitchen again to get the spoon and the bowl of milk both of which they see she place beside the basin all thing be thus complete accord to the intention of the industrious worker a period of silence intervene as if she have be take a rest in the chair which stand by the fire a most ominous interlude for every moment the couple in bed expect that she would enter the bedroom be it for nothing else than to intimate breakfast a intimation which if one could have judge by they erect hair and the sweat that stand in big drop on they brow they be by no means prepare for they be not to be subject to this fearful trial for the figure -lrb- so we must persist in call it -rrb- be see again to cross the kitchen take down the plaid and adjust it over the head accord to the manner of the time they then hear she draw the bolt open the door and shut the same again after she as she depart she be go mr thoma dodd and he wife now begin to be able to breathe more freely the hair resume its flexibility and the sweat disappear but strange as it may seem they never exchange a word with each other as to who the visitor be nor as to the morning 's work she have so industriously and silently -lrb- with the exception of she monologue -rrb- execute too certain in they conviction as to the identity whether in spirit or body of the figure with that of she they have so cruelly put out of the way they seem to think it needless to question each other and independently of this the old terror of the conscience be sufficient to seal they lip now as it have do for a period before each of they suppose that the visitor be send for the special purpose of some particular avengement of the crime upon the other the appearance in so peaceful a way in the meantime be merely a premonition to show they that they conscience be not work in vain and if thoma be the greater sinner which he no doubt suspect in spite of himself he might place against that conviction the fact that the inscrutable visitor have show he the kindness at least of prepare he breakfast and entirely overlook the morning requirement of he spouse under these thought they rise and repair with falter step and fearful eye to the kitchen there everything be in the order they have anticipate from what they have see and hear each look with a shudder at the basin of porridge as if it have be invest with some terrible charm -- nay might it not have be poison -- a thought which rush instantaneously into the head of thoma and entirely put to flight the prior hypothesis that he have be favor by this special gift of cookery the basin be accordingly lay aside by hand that tremble to touch it and fear be a sufficient breakfast for both of they on that most eventful morning this occurrence as may readily be suppose be keep a profound secret they both see that it might be the forerunner of divine means to bring they evil deed to light and under this apprehension they taciturnity and mutual discontent if not grow hatred continue break only by occasional growl and curse and the ejaculation force out by the inevitable circumstance of they connection the effect of the morning visit be meanwhile most apparent upon the man who commit the terrible act he could not remain in the house which even in they happiest condition be slovenly keep show everywhere the want of the skilled hand of that queen of housewife mr janet dodd -- so ill-requited for she devotion to she husband nay he feel all this as a reproof to he and sorely and bitterly lament the fatal act whereby he have deprive of life the best of wife and the most honest and peaceful of womankind then the awe of divine vengeance deepen these shadow of the soul till he become moody and melancholy walk hither and thither without a object and in secluded place look fearfully around he as if he expect every moment the spectre visitor of the morning to appear before he nor be he less miserable at home where the grow hatred make matter worse and worse every hour and where when the gray dawn come he expect another visit and another scene of the same description as the last nearly a week have thus pass and it be sabbath morning the tinsmith ' hammer be silent the noisy game of the urchin be hush the street of the bow resound only occasionally to the sound of a foot -- all edinburgh be in short under the solemnity enjoin by the calvinism so much beloved by the people and surely the day might have be suppose to be hold in such veneration by minister spirit send down to earth to execute the purpose of heaven that no visit of the fear shadow would disturb even the broken rest of the wicked so perhaps think we couple but they thought belie they for just again as the dawn break over the top of the high house the well-known tirl be hear at the door who be to open it for day the mind of the wife have be make up she would not face that figure again no if all the power of the world be there to compel she and as for thoma conscience have reduce the firmness of a man who once upon a time could kill to a condition of fear and tremble yet terrify as he be he consider that he be here under the obligation to obey power even higher than he conscience and disobedience might bring upon he some evil greater than that under which he groan so up he get tremble in every limb and proceed to the door open the same what he see may be surmise but what he feel no one ever know for the one reason that he have never the courage to tell it and for the other that no man or woman be ever place in circumstance from which they could draw any conclusion which could impart even a distant analogy this much however be know : thoma retreat instantly to bed and the visitor in the same suit of hodden-grey again enter pass the bolt take off she plaid hang it up and begin the duty which she think be suit to the day and the hour so much be thus alike the couple in the bedroom no doubt augur a repetition of the old process they be right and they be wrong they eye be fix upon she and watch she movement but the watch be that of the charmed eye which be say to be without motive they see she once more go deliberately and tentily through the old process of put on the fire and they hear again the application of the bellows every blast succeed another with the regularity of a clock until the kitchen be illuminate by the rise flame this be all that could be call a repetition for in place of go for the porridge goblet she go direct for the tea-kettle into which she pour a sufficient quantity of water say the while to herself tammas maun hae he tea breakfast on sabbath morning -- word which thoma as he now lay quake in bed know very well he have hear before many a time and oft nor be the subsequent act less in accordance with the old custom of the dwelling there be no sweeping of the floor or scour of pan on the sacred morning in place of all which she have something else to do for surely we must suppose that this gentle visitor be a good calvinist and would perform only the act of necessity and mercy these she have do in so far as regard necessity and now they see she go to the shelf on which the bible be deposit -- a book which alas for seven year have not be open by either of the guilty pair have get what she want she sit down by the table open the volume at a place well thumb and begin to read aloud a chapter in the corinthian which thoma dodd the more by reason that he have hear it read two hundred and fifty time know by heart this be finish she turn up a psalm yea that very psalm which janet dodd have sing every Sunday morning and presently the kitchen be resonant with the rise note of the bangor as they come from a throat tremble with devotion -- i wait on the lord my god and patiently do bear at length to I he do incline my voice and cry to hear he take I from a fearful pit and from the miry clay and on a rock he set my foot establish my way the service finish they see she replace the book where she have find it and by this time the kettle be spew from the mouth thereof a volume of steam as if it be call to its old mistress to relieve it from the heat of the fire nor be she long in pay due obedience the tea-pot be get where she seem to know it would be find so also the tea-canister the quantity to be put in be a foregone conclusion and steadily measure with the spoon the water be pour in and the utensil place on the cheek of the chimney in order to the indispensable infusion next the cup and saucer be place on the table then follow the bread and butter and the sugar and the milk all be finish by the word to herself there be na egg in the house have thus finish she work she take down she plaid adjust it carefully open the door and depart the effect produce by this second spectral appearance could scarcely be exaggerate yet we suspect you will not find it of that kind which be most in harmony with human nature except in the case of mr dodd the second who lay as on the former occasion sweating and tremble it be now different with the husband on whom apparently have fall some of the seed of the word as they be scatter by the lip of the strange visitor and conscience have prepare the soil the constitutional strength of character which have enable he to perpetrate a terrible deed of evil be ready as a power to achieve he emancipation and work in the direction of good so without say a word of all that have be act that morning he rise and dress himself and go into the kitchen he sit down without the fear of poison and partook of the breakfast which have be so strangely prepare for he nor be he satisfy till he read the chapter and psalm with which he have be so long familiar he then return to the bedroom and address he wife -- you now see say he that heaven have find we out that visitor be nae ither than mr janet dodd return frae the grave and sure it be that nane be permit to leave that place o ' rest except for a purpose no it be no for naething that janet dodd come back to she auld hame what the purpose may be the lord only know but this seem to I to be clear enough -- that you and i maun pairt you see that nae breakfast have be lay for you i have taen mine and na harm have come o ' t a clear sign that though we be baith great criminal you be consider to be the warst o ' the twa it be you wha put poison into my ear and cast glamour ower my een it be you wha egg I on for ` the lip of a strange woman drop as a honeycomb and she word be smoother than oil but she foot take hold of hell ' that i be guilty i know and ` though hand join in hand the wicked shall not go unpunished ' i will dree my doom whatever it may be and so maun you yours but there may be a difference and so far as mortal can yet see yours will be waur to bear than mine but however a ' that may be the time be come when you maun leave this house ` cast out the strange woman and contention shall go out yea strife and reproach shall cease ' but ` go not forth hastily to strive lest thou know not what to do in the end when thy neighbor have put thee to shame ' keep you secret fra a ' save the lord and may he hae mercy on you soul with which word savor as they do of the objurgation of the black pot to the kettle mr thoma dodd leave he house no doubt in the expectation that mr dodd _ secunda _ would move she camp and betake herself once more to she old place of residence in the grassmarket where he go that day no man ever know further than that he be see in the afternoon in st gile 's church where no doubt he do he best to make a cheap purchase of immunity to he soul and body in consideration of a repentance bring on by pure fear produce by a spectre and who know but that that be a final cause of the spectre 's appearance we have see that it be a kindly spirit prepare porridge and tea for he at the same time that it make he hair stand on end and big drop of sweat settle upon he brow or roll down therefrom -- a conjunction this of the tawse and the jelly-pot whereby kind and loving parent try to redeem naughty boy nor let it be say that this kindly deal with a murderer be contrary to the way of heaven for amidst a thousand other example do not joshua after the wall of jericho lay flat at the blast of a trumpet save that vile woman rahab at the same time that he slew the young and the old nay the very infant with the edge of the sword all which though we be not by token of we sin able to see the reason thereof be doubtless consonant to a higher justice -- altogether unlike we goddess who be represent as blind merely because she be suppose not to see a bribe when offer to she by a litigant so the penitence of mr thoma dodd might be a very dear affair after all in so much as terror be a condition of the soul which of all we be doom to experience be the most difficult to bear especially if it be a terror of divine wrath on he return to he house in the evening he find that mr mary have take he at he word and decamped but not without provide herself with as good a share of the goods in communion as she could perhaps at two or three return carry off so be she like zebulun in all save she righteousness for she rejoice in she go out nay she have some reason for she have discover that in a secret drawer of a old cabinet there be a pose of gold collect by the industrious hand of mr janet and unknown to she husband every piece of which she carry off in spite of all fear of the spectre which if a sensible one might have be suppose to be more irritated at this heedless spoliation than at all the jezebel have yet do with the exception of the counsel she death in the deep hole of the north loch on see all this robbery mr dodd become more and more aware of the bad exchange he have make by kill he good spouse to enable he to take another who have merely find more favor in he eye by reason of she good look and we may augur how much deeper he feeling of regret would have be have he know the secret pose so frugally and prudently lay up perhaps for he sake at least for the sake of both when disease or old age might overtake they in a world where good and evil pleasure and pain appear to be fix quantity only shove from one to another by wisdom and prudence yet sometimes refuse to be move even by these means after satisfy himself of the full extent of the robbery which after all he have bring upon himself and very richly deserve he sit down upon a chair and begin to moralize after the manner of those late penitent who have find themselves out to be either rogue or fool -- the number of whom comprehend perhaps all mankind he have certainly good reason to be contrite the angel in the house have become a spectre and she who be no angel either in the house or out of it have carry off almost everything of any value he possess nor do he stop at mere unspoken contrition he bewail in solemn tone he destiny and then begin to cast up all the perfection of good janet the more perfect and beautiful these seem in proportion as he feel the fear of she reappearance perhaps next time in place of make he breakfast to run away with he to the dire place of four letter all she peculiarity be now virtue -- nay the very thing which have appear to he the most indefensible take on the aspect of angelic endowment while she careful housewifery be all intend for he bodily health and comfort she perseverance in adhering to the one chapter and the one psalm be due to that love of iteration which inspire those who be never weary of well-doing and what be more extraordinary one verse of the psalm -- that which we have quote -- have special reference to the manner of she death and she deliverance from condemnation in the world to come no doubt the man who meditate upon he own crime or folly at the very moment when he be suffer from its sharp recalcitration be just about as miserable a wretch as the reformatory of the world can present but when to the effect upon himself he be compel to think of the cruelty he have exercise towards other -- and those perhaps find out to be he best friend -- we doubt if there be any word beyond the vocabulary of the condemn that be sufficient to express he anguish even this do not comprehend all the suffering of mr dodd for be he not under doom without know what form it be to assume whether the spectre -lrb- whose cookery might be a sham -rrb- would choke he burn he or run away with he deeply steep in this remorseful contemplation during which the figure of he ill-used wife flit before the eye of he fancy with scarcely less of substantial reality than she have show in she spectral form he find that he have lose all regard to time the night be fast setting in the shadow of the tall house be fall deeper and deeper on the room and the sabbath stillness be a solemn contrast to the perturbation inside the chamber of he soul where the serpent and the cockatrice would not be charm still everything within and without be dreary and the spoliation of he means do not tend to enliven the outer scene or impart a charm to the owner while in this state of depression tamma hear a knock at the door it be not as on the former occasion what be call a tirl it might be a neighbor or it might be a old crony and he stand in need of some one to raise he spirit so he go to the door and open it but what be he horror when he see enter a female figure in all respects so like he fear visitor that he conclude in the instant that she be the same nor could all he penitence afford he resolution enough to make a proper examination besides it be gray dark and even a pair of better eye than he could boast of might under the circumstance soon to appear have be deceive retreat into the kitchen he be follow by this dubious and yet not dubious visitor who as he throw himself upon a chair take a seat right opposite to he ye 'll no ken I tammas dodd say she whereupon tamma look and look again and still the likeness he dread be so impressive that in place of move he tongue he move that be he shudder all over what -- eh at length he stutter ken ye wha in god 's name be ye no surely mr janet dodd in the likeness of the flesh no but she sister mr paterson reply the other and be it possible ye can hae forget the only woman who be present at you first marriage ay ay reply tammas as he begin to come to a proper condition of perceive and think and it be you then wha be here this morning no no reply she i have not be here for seven long year even since that terrible night when you push janet into the north loch and may heaven and its angel hae mercy upon I ejaculate he aiblin they may say she for you purpose be defeat yea even by that heaven and thae angel what mean you woman cry the astonished man what in the name o ' a ' that be gude on earth and holy in heaven do ye mean just that janet dodd be at this hour a leevin ' woman be the reply the lord be thank cry tamma again for ` he preserveth all they that love he ' ` but all the wicked he will destroy ' return she and surely it be wicked to try to drown sae faithful a wife and sae gude a christian wicked rejoin he in rise agony ` let the righteous smite I it shall be a kindness and let they reprove I it shall ' as solomon say ` be a excellent oil ' i be glad continue the woman to find you with a turn heart but whaur be the jezebel ye take in she place awa this day reply he i have find she out and never mair be she wife o ' mine sae far weel and better say she ay but speak to I o ' janet cry he earnestly come tell I how she escape whaur she be and how she be for now i think there be light break through the fearfu ' cloud light indeed continue mr paterson and now listen to a strange tale mair wonderfu ' than man 's brain ever conceive when ye think ye have drown she and care naething doubtless -- for ye see i maun speak plain -- whether she spirit go to the ae place or the ither ay and run awa to add to murder a lee she struggle out o ' the deep yea -- ` he take she from the fearfu ' pit and from the miry clay ' and when she get to the bank she run as for the little life be in she until she come to the foot of halkerstone 's wynd where she cross to the other side of the loch when she think hersel ' safe she take the road to glasgow where i be then live wus ' my husband wha be since dead the night be dark but self-preservation mak nae gob at danger so on she go till in the gray morning she make up to the glasgow carrier wha agree to gie she a cast even to the end o ' he journey it be the next night when she arrive at my door cold and hungry and what be waur sair and sick at heart she tell I the hail story as weel as she could for sob and greet for the think aye rugged at she heart that the man she have like sae weel and have toil for night and day should hae turn out to be the murderer o ' he ain wife and weel it might hae rugged and rugged ejaculate tamma i get aff she wet clothes continue she and give she some strong drink to warm she and then we consider what be to be dune my husband be for off to edinburgh to inform on ye even if there should hae be a draw o ' the neck o not but janet cry and entreat baith he and I to keep the thing quiet she say she couldna ga back to you and as for get you punish she couldna bear the thought o ' t and then we a ' think what a disgrace it would be to we family if it be think that my sister have be attempt to be murder by she husband we know weel enough ye would say she have fall in by accident and when afterwards we hear that ye have bury a body that have be find in the loch we make up we mind as to what we would do we just agree to keep janet under she maiden name nane in glasgow have ever see she before and she ain sorrow keep she within door so that the secret wasna ill to keep year afterwards my husband be ta'en from I and janet and i come about twa month syne to live at juniper green wus ' john paterson my husband 's brother wha have offer we a hame and be janet there now cry tamma impatiently ay continue mr paterson but alas she be no what she be she get at time out o ' she reason and will be that way for day thegether the doctor have a name for it ower lang for my tongue but it tell naething but what we ken ower weel when in thae fit she think she be here in the bow and living with you and work and moil in the house just as she use to do langsyne mairower and that trouble we maist ava she will be out when the reason 's no in so that we be oblige to watch she five day syne she be aff in the morning before daylight and even so late as this morning she play we the same trick whaur she gae we couldna tell but i have some suspicion she be here ay reply mr dodd as he open he eye very wide she be here wus ' a vengeance thus mr paterson 's story be finish and we legend of the brownie more veritable we opine than that of bodsbeck be also draw to a conclusion tamma after a period of meditation more like one of janet 's hallucination than a fit of rational thinking ask he sister-in-law whether she think that janet in the event of she get quit of she day-dream would consent to live with he again to which question she answer that she be not certain for that janet when in she usual state of mind be still wroth against he for the attempt to take away she life but she add that she have no objection see he be penitent to give he a opportunity to plead for himself she even go further and agree to use she influence to bring about a reconciliation it be therefore agree between they that the sister should call again when janet have get quit of she temporary derangement and thoma might follow up this intimation with a visit about four day thereafter accordingly mr paterson keep she word and next day mr dodd repair to juniper green at first janet refuse to see he but upon mr paterson 's representation of he penitence and suffer she become reconcile to a interview we may venture to say without attempt a description of a meeting unparalleled in history that if janet dodd have not be a veritable calvinist no good could have come of all mr dodd 's profession but she know that the master cast out the dumb spirit which tear the possess and that that spirit attempt murder not less than tammas wherefore might not _ he _ dumb spirit be cast out as well by that grace which aboundeth in the bosom of the savior we do not say that a return of she old love help this deduction because we do not wish to mix up profane with sacred thing enough if we can certify that a very happy conclusion be the result the doctor do he duty and janet have be declare _ compo menti _ return to she old home she first duty be to look for the pose it be go in the manner we have set forth but janet could collect another and no doubt in due time do nor do she fail of any of she old peculiarity all of which become endear to thoma by reason of they be veritable sacrifice to he domestic comfort gleanings of the covenant the last scrap it be a fact well know to dr lee and to many besides that notwithstanding the extensive research of wodrow and other there have die away in the silent lapse of time or be still hover over we cleuch and glen in the aspect of a dim and misty tradition many instance of extreme cruelty and wanton oppression exercise

-- for it be now nightfall -- than he begin to think of some means or other of effect he escape the barn be happily know to he and he recollect that though the greater proportion of the gable be build of stone and lime yet that a small part towards the top as be sometimes the case in these day be construct of turf and that should he effect a opening through the soft material he might drop with safety upon the top of a peat-stack and thus effect he escape to creechope linn with every pass and cave of which he be intimately acquaint in a word he escape be effect in this manner and though the alarm be immediately give and large stone roll over the precipice of the adjoining linn he be safely ensconce in darkness and under the covert of a project rock and ultimately -lrb- for in the course of a few day king william and liberty be the order of the day -rrb- he return to he wife and he family there to enjoy for many year that happiness which the possession of a conscience void of offence towards god and towards man be sure to impart the brother however of this more favored individual be not so fortunate as may be gather from wodrow and the cloud of witness for he be execute ere the day of deliverance at the gallowlee and he most pathetic and eloquent address be still extant let we rejoice with tremble that we live in a age and under a government so widely different from those now refer to and whilst on we knee we pour forth the tribute of thankfulness to god let we teach we child to prize the precious inheritance so dearly purchase by we forefather \* \* \* \* \* the story of mary brown if the reader of what i be go to relate for he or she edification or for perhaps a greater luxury viz wonder should be so unreasonable as to ask for my authority i shall be tempt because a little pique to say that no one should be too particular about the source of pleasure inasmuch as if you will enjoy nothing but what you can prove to be a reality you will under good philosophical leadership have no great faith in the sun -- a thing which you never see the existence of which you be only assure of by a round figure of light on the back of you eye and which may be liken to tradition so all you have to do be to believe like a good catholic and be contented even though i begin so poorly as to try to interest you in two very humble being who have be dead for many year and whose life be like a steeple without a bell in it the intention of which you can not understand till you eye reach the weathercock upon the top and then you wonder at so great a erection for so small a object the one bear the name of william halket a young man who eight or nine year before he become of much interest either to himself or any other body be what in we day be call a arab of the city -- a poor street boy who do not know who he father be though as for he mother he know she by a pretty sharp experience insomuch as she take from he every penny he make by hold horse and give he more cuff than cake in return but bill get out of this bondage by the mere chance of have be take a fancy to by mr peter ramsay innkeeper and stabler in st mary 's wynd -lrb- a ancestor we suspect of the ramsay of barnton -rrb- who think he see in the city arab that love of horse-flesh which belong to the bedouin and who accordingly elevate he to the position of a stable-boy with board and as many shilling a week as there be day in that subdivision of time nor do william halket -- to whom for he merit we accord the full christian name -- do any discredit to the perspicacity of he master if it be not that he rather exceed the hope of he benefactor for he be attentive to the horse civil to the farmer and handy at anything that come in he way then to render the connection reciprocal william be gratefully alive to the conviction that if he have not be as it be take from the street the street might have be take from he by he be lock up some day in the heart of midlothian so thing go on in st mary 's wynd for five or six year and might have go on for twice that period have it not be that at a certain hour of a certain day william fall in love with a certain mary brown who have come on that very day to be a under-housemaid in the inn and strange enough it be a case of love at first sight the more by token that it take effect the moment that mary enter the stable with a glass of whisky in she hand send to he by mr ramsay no doubt it be seldom that a fine bloom young girl with very pretty brown hair and very blue eye appear to a young man with such a recommendation in she hand but we be free to say that the whisky have nothing to do with a effect which be well know to be the pure result of the physical attribute of the individual nay we statement might have be prove by the counterpart effect produce upon mary herself for she be strike by william at the same moment when she hand he the glass and we be not to assume that the give of a pleasant boon be always attend with the same effect as the receiving of it but as we story require it be the love itself between these two young person whose fate be so remarkable we have to do with -- not the cause which be a mystery in all case sure it be humble in position as they be they could love as strongly as fervently perhaps as ecstatically as great people -- nay probably more so for education have a greater chance of moderate the passion than increase it and so notwithstanding of what plutarch say of the awfully consuming love between phrygius and picrea and also what shakespeare have sing or say about a certain romeo and a lady call juliet we be certain that the affection between these grand personage be not _ more _ genuine tender and true than that which bind the simple and unsophisticated heart of will halket and mary brown but at best we merely play on the surface of a deep subject when we try with a pen to describe feeling and especially the feeling of love we doubt if even the say pen be pluck from cupid 's wing whether it would help we much we be at best only leave to a choice of expression and perhaps the strongest we could use be those which have already be use a thousand time -- the two be all the world to each other the world outside nothing at all to they so that they could have be as happy on the top of mount ararat or on the island of juan fernandez provide they should be always in each other 's company as they be in st mary 's wynd and as for whisper protestation and chaste kiss -- for really they love have a touch of romance about it you could hardly have expect but which yet keep it pure if not in some degree elevate above the love of common people -- these be repeat so often about the quiet part of arthur 's seat and the king 's park and the field about the dumbiedyke and duddingstone loch that they be the very moral aliment on which they live in short to mary brown the great duke of buccleuch be as nothing compare to willie halket and to willie halket the beautiful duchess of grammont would have be as nothing compare to simple mary brown all which be very amiable and very necessary for if it have be so ordain that people should feel the exquisite sensation of love in proportion as they be beautiful or rich or endowed with talent -lrb- accord to a standard -rrb- we world would have be even more queer than that kingdom describe by gulliver where the ugliest individual be make king or queen thing continue in this very comfortable state at the old inn in st mary 's wynd for about a year and it have come to enter into the contemplation of will that upon get a increase of he wages he would marry mary and send she to live with she mother a poor hard-working washerwoman in big lochend close whereunto mary be so much inclined that she look forward to the day as the one that promise to be the happiest that she have yet see or would ever see but as a ancient say run the good hour be in no man 's choice and about this time it so happen that mr peter ramsay have have a commission from a old city man a mr dreghorn located as a planter in virginium to send he out a number of scottish horse suggest to william that he would do well to act as supercargo and groom mr dreghorn have offer to pay a good sum to the man who should bring they out safe besides pay he passage over and home and mr ramsay would be ready to receive will into he old place again on he return as for mary with regard to whom the master know he man 's intention she would remain where she be safe from all temptation and true to the choice of she heart this offer pleased william because he see that he could make some money out of the adventure whereby he would be the better able to marry and make a home for the object of he affection but he be by no means sure that mary would consent for woman by some natural divining of the heart look upon delay in affair of love as ominous and dangerous and so it turn out that one sabbath evening when they be seat beneath a tree in the king 's park and william have cautiously introduce the subject to she she be like other woman the bird that get into the bush she say as the tear fall upon she cheek sometimes forget to come back to the cage again i would rather hae the lean lintie in the hand than the fat finch on the wand but you forget mary love be the answer of will that you can feed the lean bird but you can not feed I it be i who must support you it be to enable I to do that which induce I to go i will come with guinea in my pocket where there be now only penny and plack and you know mary the scotch say ' a heavy purse make a light heart ' and a unsteady one rejoin mary and you may bring something else wus ' you besides the guinea maybe a wife one of mr dreghorn 's black beauty say will laugh no no mary i be too fond of the flaxen ringlet the rosy cheek and the blue eye and you know mary you have all these so you have I in you power but to calm you fear and stop you tear i 'll tell you what i 'll do stay at hame will and we 'll live and dee thegither no reply will but like the genteel lover i have read of i will swear on you bible that i will return to you within the year and marry you at the tron kirk and throw my guinea into the lap of you marriage-gown and live with you until i die for all which and some more we may draw upon we fancy but certain it be as the strange story go that will do actually then and there -- for mary have be at the tron kirk and have she bible in she pocket -lrb- a article the want of which be not well supply by the scent-bottle of we modern marie -rrb- -- swear to do all he have say whereupon mary be so far satisfy that she give up murmuring -- perhaps no more than that certain also it be that before the month be do will with he live kick charge and after more of these say tear from mary than either of they have arithmetic enough to enable they to count embark at leith for richmond at which place the sugar-planter have undertake to meet he we need say nothing of the voyage across the atlantic somewhat arduous at that period nor need we pick up will again till we find he in richmond with he horse all safe and as fat and sleek as if they have be feed by neptune 's wife and have draw she across in place of she own steed there he find direction wait from mr dreghorn to the effect that he be to proceed with the horse to peach grove he plantation a place far into the heart of the country but will be content for have he not time and to spare within the year and he would see some more of the new world which so far as he experience yet go seem to he to be a good place for a freeman to live in so off he go put up at inn by the way as well supply with food and fodder as mr peter ramsay 's in st mary 's wynd and show off he nag to the planter who wonder at they bone and muscle the more by reason they have never see scotch horse before as he progress the country seem to will more and more beautiful and by the time he reach peach grove he have come to the unpatriotic conclusion that all it need be mary brown with she rose and ringlet and eye pass like a angel -- lover will be poet -- among these ebon beauty to make it the finest country in the world nor when the scotsman reach peach grove do the rosy side of matter recede into the shady for he be receive in a great house by mr dreghorn with so much kindness that if the horse rejoice in maize and oats will find himself as the say go in five-bladed clover but more await he even thus much more that the planter and he fine lady of a wife as well urge he to remain on the plantation where he would be well pay and well feed and when will plead he engagement to return to scotland within the year the answer be ready that he might spend eight month in virginium at least which would enable he to take home more money -- a answer that seem so very reasonable if not prudent that sawny see the advantage thereof and agree but we need hardly say that this be concede upon the condition make with himself that he would write to mary all the particulars and also upon the condition accede to by mr dreghorn that he would take the charge of get the letter send to scotland all which have be arrange mr halket -- for we can not now continue to take the liberty of call he will -- be forthwith elevated to the position of drive negro in place of horse a occupation which he do not much relish insomuch that he be expect to use the lash a instrument of which he have be very chary in he treatment of four-legged chattel and which he could not bring himself to apply with anything but a sham force in reference to the two-legged species but this objection he think to get over by use the sharp crack of he jehu-voice as a substitute for that of the whip and in this he persevere in spite of the jeer of the other driver who tell he the thing have be try often but that the self-conceit of the negro meet the stimulant and choke it at the very entrance to the ear and this he soon find to be true so he begin to do as other do and he be the sooner reconcile to the strange life into which he have be precipitate by the happy condition of the slave themselves who when they work be over and at all holiday hour dress themselves in the brightest color of red and blue and white dance sing eat corn-cake and bacon and drink coffee with a zest which would have do a scotch mechanic with he liberty to produce a lock-out much good to see true indeed the white element of the population be at a discount at peach grove but in addition to the above source of reconciliation halket become day by day more captivate by the beauty of the country with its undulating surface its wooded clump its magnolia tulip-tree camellia laurel passion-flower and palm its bright-coloured bird and all the rest of the beauty for which it be famous all over the world but nature might charm as it might -- mary brown be three thousand mile away meanwhile the time pass pleasantly for he be accumulate money mary 's letter would be on the way and the hope of see she within the appoint time be dominant over all the fascination which charm the sens but when the month come in which he ought to have receive a letter no letter come -- not much this to be think of though mr dreghorn try to impress he with the idea that there must be some change of sentiment in the person from whom he expect the much-desired answer so halket write again give the letter as before to he master who assure he it be send carefully away and while it be cross the atlantic he be busy in improve he penmanship and arithmetic under the hope hold out to he by he master that he would if he remain be raise to a book-keeper 's desk for the planter have see early that he have get hold of a long-headed honest sagacious sawny who would be of use to he on with still lighter wing the intermediate time speed again but with no better result in the shape of a answer from she who be still the object of he day fancy and he midnight dream nor do all this kill he hope a third letter be despatch but the return period be equally a blank we have be count by month which as they speed soon bring round the termination of he year and with grow change too in himself for as the notion begin to worm itself into he mind that he beloved mary be either dead or faithless another power be quietly assail he from within -- no other than ambition in the most captivating of all shape -- mammon we all know the manner in which the golden deity acquire he authority nor do we need to have recourse to the conceit of the old writer who tell we that the reason why gold have such a influence upon man lie in the fact that it be of the color of the sun which be the fountain of light and life and joy certain it be at least that halket have be take into the counting-house on a raise salary begin to lay by as the scotch call it and by-and-by with the help of a little money lend to he by he master he begin by purchase produce from the neighbouring plantation and sell it where he might -- all which he do with advantage yet with the ordinary result to a scotsman that while he turn to so good account the king 's head the king 's head begin to turn he own and now in place of month we must begin to count by lustrum and the first five year even with all the thought of he dead or at least lose mary prove in halket 's case the truth of the book write by a frenchman to prove that man be a plant for he have already throw out from he head or heart so many root in the virginian soil that he be bid fair to be as firmly fix in he new sphere as a magnolia and if that bear golden blossom so do he yet true to he first love there be not among all these flower one so fair as the fair-haired mary nay with all hope not yet extinguish he have even at the end of the period resolve upon a visit to scotland when strangely enough and sadly too he be tell by mr dreghorn that have have occasion to hear from mr peter ramsay on the subject of some more horse-dealings that person have report to he that mary brown the lover of he old stable-boy be dead a communication this which if it have be make at a earlier period would have prostrate halket altogether but it be soften by he long foreign anticipation and he be thereby the more easily incline to resign he saddened soul to the further dominion of the say god mammon for as to the notion of put any of those beautiful half-caste he sometimes see about the planter 's house at peach grove in the place of she of the golden ringlet it be nothing better than the desecration of a holy temple then the power of the god increase with the offering one of which be he large salary as manager a station to which he be elevated shortly after he have receive the doleful tiding of mary 's death another lustrum be add and we arrive at ten year and yet another and we come to fifteen at the end of which time mr dreghorn die leave halket as one of he trustee for behoof of he wife in whom the great plantation vest if we add yet another lustrum we find the scot -- fortunate save for one misfortune that make he a joyless worshipper of gold -- purchase from the widow who wish to return to england the entire plantation under the condition of a annuity and halket be now rich even beyond what he have ever wish but the chariot-wheel of time would not go any slower -- nay they move faster and every year more silently as if the old father have intend to cheat the votary of mammon into a belief that he would live for ever the lustrum still pass : another five another and another till there be scope for all the world be change and a new generation take the place of that with which william halket and mary brown begin and he be change too for he begin to take on those sign of age which make the old man a paint character but in one thing he be not change and that be the worshipful stedfastness the sacred fidelity with which he still treasured in he mind the form and face the word and the smile the nice and refined peculiarity that feed love as with nectared sweet which once belong to mary brown the first creature that have move he affection and the last to hold they as the object of a cherish memory for ever nor with time so deceptive need we be so spare in deal out those period of five year but say at once that at last william halket could count twelve of they since first he set he foot on virginian soil yea he have be there for sixty summer and he have now be a denizen of the world for seventy-eight year in all which we narrative have be strange but we have still the stranger fact to set forth that at this late period he be seize with that moral disease -lrb- become physical in time -rrb- which the french call _ mal du pay _ the love of the country where one be bear and first enjoy the fresh spring that gush from the young heart nor be it the mere love of country as such for he be seize with a particular wish to be where mary lay in the churchyard of the canongate to erect a tombstone over she to seek out she relation and enrich they to make a worship out of a disappointed love to dedicate the last of he thought to the small souvenir of she humble life within a month this old man be on he way to scotland have sell the plantation and take bill with he to a amount of little less than a hundred thousand pound in the course of five week william halket put he foot on the old pier of leith on which some very old man be stand who have be urchin when he go away the look of the old harbor revive the image which have be imprint on he mind when he sail and the running of the one image into the other produce the ordinary illusion of all that long interval appear as a day but there be no illusion in the change that mary brown be there when he depart and there be no mary brown there now have call a coach he tell the driver to proceed up leith walk and take he to peter ramsay 's inn in st mary 's wynd but the man tell he there be no inn there nor have be in he memory the man add that he would take he to the white horse in the canongate and thither accordingly he drive he on arrive at the inn he require the assistance of the waiter to enable he to get out of the coach nor probably do the latter think this any marvel after look into a face so furrowed with year so pale with the weakness of a languid circulation so saddened with care the rich man have only a inn for a home nor in all he native country be there one friend whom he hope to find alive neither would a search help he as he find on the succeed day when by the help of he staff he essay a infirm walk in the great thoroughfare of the old city the house be not much altered but the signboard have get new name and figure and as for the face they be to he even as those in crete to the cretan after he awake from a sleep of forty-seven year -- a similitude only true in this change for epimenida be still as young when he awake as when he go to sleep but william halket be old among the young and the grow who be unknown to he as he be indeed strange to they true too as the coachman say peter ramsay 's inn where he have hear mary singing at she work and the stable where he have whistle blithely among he favorite horse be no longer to be see -- _ etiam cineres perierunt _ -- they very site be occupy by modern dwelling what of that small half-sunk lodging in big lochend close where mary 's mother live and where mary have be bring up where perhaps mary have die would it not be a kind of pilgrimage to hobble down the canongate to that little lodging and might there not be for he a sad pleasure even to enter and sit down by the same fireplace where he have see the dearly-beloved face and listen to she voice to he more musical than the melody of angel and so after he have walk about till he be wearied and he step become more unsteady and slow and as yet without have see a face which he know he proceed in the direction of the big close there be as regard stone and lime little change here he soon recognize the half-sunk window where on the Sunday evening he have sometimes tap as a humorous sign that he be about to enter which have often be respond to by mary 's finger on the glass as a token that he would be welcome it be sixty year since then a small corb would now hold all that remain of both mother and daughter he turn away he head as if sick and be about to retrace he step yet the wish to enter that house rise again like a yearning and what more in the world than some souvenir of the only be on earth he ever love be there for he to yearn for all he hundred thousand pound be now dear as money have be to he nothing in comparison of the gratification of see the room where she be bear -- yea where probably she have die in as short a time as he tremble limb would carry he down the stair which in the ardor of he young blood he have often take at a bind he be at the foot of it there be there the old familiar dark passage with door on either side but it be the farthest door that be of any interest to he arrive at it he stand in doubt he would knock and he would not the mystery of a undefined fear be over he and yet what have he to fear for half a century the inmate have be change no doubt over and over again and he would be as unknowing as unknown at length the tremble finger achieve the furtive tap and the door be open by a woman whose figure could only be see by he in come between he and the obscure light that come in by the half-sunk window in front nor could she even if she have have the power of vision see more of he for the lobby be still darker who may live here say he in the expectation of hear some name unknown to he the answer in a broken crack voice be not slow -- mary brown and what may you want of she mary brown but not a word more could he say and he stand as still as a post not a movement of any kind do he show for so long a time that the woman might have be justify in she fear of a very spirit and can ye say nae mair sir rejoin she be my name a bogle to terrify human being but still he be silent for the reason that he could not think far less speak nor even for some minute could he achieve more than the repetition of the word mary brown but hadna ye better come in good sir say she ye may ken we auld say ` they that speak in the dark

have call herself mary brown begin in the obscure light of the room to scrutinize she form and feature and in do this he go upon the presumption that this second mary brown only carry the name of the first but as he look he begin to detect feature which rivet he eye where the reagent be so sharp and penetrate the analysis be rapid -- it be also hopeful -- it be also fearful yes it be true that that woman be _ he _ mary brown the light-brown ringlet be reduce to a white stratum of thin hair the blue eye be gray without light and without speculation the rose on the cheek be replace by a pallor the forerunner of the color of death the lithe and sprightly form be a thin spectral body where the sinew appear as strong cord and the skin seem only to cover a skeleton yet withal he see in she that identical mary brown that wreck be dear to he it be a relic of the idol he have worship through life it be the only remnant in the world which have any interest for he and he could on the instant have clasp she to he breast and cover she pale face with he tear but how be he to act a sudden announcement might startle and distress she there be once a mary brown say he who be once a housemaid in mr peter ramsay 's inn in st mary 's wynd and who can it be that can recollect that be the answer as she turn the sightless orb on the speaker ye maun be full o ' year yes that be my

twelve year come jump into the room and only stop when she see a stranger that be helen kemp say mary who know she movement i forget helen she light my fire and when i be able to gae out use to lead I to the park and she shall be one of the favored one of the earth say he as he take by the hand the girl whom the few word from mary have make sacred to he add helen dear you be to be kinder to mary than you have ever be and slip into the girl 's hand a guinea he whisper you shall have as many of these as will be a bigger tocher to you than you ever dream of for what you have do for mary brown and thus progress to a termination a scene perhaps more extraordinary than ever enter into the head of a writer of natural thing and event not beyond the sphere of the probable nor do what afterwards take place fall short of the intention of a man whose intense yearning to make up for what have be lose lead he into the extravagance of a vain fancy he next day take a great house and forthwith furnish it in proportion to he wealth he hire servant in accordance and make all the necessary arrangement for the marriage time which have be so cruel to he and he sacred mary be put under the obligation of retribution john gilmor mr paterson mr galloway and helen kemp be those and those alone privileged to witness the ceremony we would not like to describe how they be deck out nor shall we try to describe the ceremony itself but vain be the aspiration of man when he try to cope with the fate the changed fortune be too much for the frail and waste bride to bear she swoon at the conclusion of the ceremony and be put into a silk-curtained bed even the first glimpse of grandeur be too much for the spirit whose sigh be vanity all be vanity and with the word on she lip a life 's love lose she die tibby fowler tibby fowler o ' the glen a ' the lad be wooin ' at she -- _ old song _ all we reader have hear and sing of tibby fowler o ' the glen but they may not all be aware that the glen refer to lie within about four mile of berwick no one have see and not admire the romantic amphitheatre below edrington castle through which the whitadder coil like a beautiful serpent glittering in the sun and sport in fantastic curve beneath the pasture-clad hill the gray ruin the mossy and precipitous crag and the pyramid of wood whose branch meet from either side bend down and kiss the glittering river till its water seem lose in they leafy bosom now gentle reader if you have look upon the scene we have describe we shall make plain to you the situation of tibby fowler 's cottage by a homely map which be generally _ at hand _ you have only to bend you arm and suppose you shoulder to represent edrington castle you hand clarabad and near the elbow you will have the spot where ten cam ' rowing owre the water a little nearer to clarabad be the lang dyke side and immediately at the foot of it be the site of tibby 's cottage which stand upon the edrington side of the river and a little to the west of the cottage you will find a shadowy row of palm-trees plant as tradition testifieth by the hand of tibby 's father old ned fowler of whom many speak until this day the locality of the song be know to many and if any should be incline to inquire how we become acquaint with the other particulars of we story we have only to reply that that belong to a class of question to which we do not return a answer there be no necessity for a writer of tale take for he motto -- _ vitam impendere vero _ tibby 's parent have the character of be bien body and together with they own savings and a legacy that have be leave they by a relative they be enable at they death to leave they daughter in possession of five hundred pound this be esteem a fortune in those day and would afford a very respectable foundation for the rearing of one yet tibby however be leave a orphan as well as the sole mistress of five hundred pound and the proprietor of a neat and well-furnished cottage with a piece of land adjoining before she have complete she nineteenth year and when we add that she have hair like the raven 's wing when the sun glance upon they cheek where the lily and the rose seem to have lend they most delicate hue and eye like twin dew-drop glisten beneath a summer moonbeam with a waist and a arm round like a model for a sculptor it be not to be wonder at that a ' the lad cam ' wooin ' at she but she have a woman 's heart as well as woman 's beauty and the portion of a heiress she find she cottage surround and she path beset by a herd of grovel pounds-shillings-and-penny hunter whom she very soul loathe the sneak wretch who profane the name of lover seem to have _ money _ write on they very eyeball and the sigh they profess to heave in she presence sound to she like stifled groan of -- _ you gold _ -- _ you gold _ she do not hate they but she despise they meanness and as they one by one give up persecute she with they address they console themselves with retort upon she the word of the adage that she _ pride _ would have a fall but it be not from pride that she reject they but because she heart be capable of love -- of love pure devoted unchangeable spring from be beloved and because she feeling be sensitive as the quiver aspen which tremble at the rustling of a insect 's wing amongst she suitor there might have be some who be disinterested but the meanness and sordid object of many cause she to regard all with suspicion and there be none among the number to whose voice she bosom respond as the needle turn to the magnet and frequently from a cause as inexplicable she have resolve that the man to whom she give she hand should wed she for herself -- and for herself only she parent have die in the same month and about a year after they death she sell the cottage and the piece of ground and take she journey towards edinburgh where the report of she be a great fortune as she neighbor term she might be unknown but tibby although a sensitive girl be also in many respects a prudent one frequently she have hear she mother when she have to take but a shilling from the legacy quote the proverb that it be like a cow in a clout that soon wear out proverb we know be in bad taste but we quote it because by its repetition the mother produce a deeper impression on she daughter 's mind than could have be effect by a volume of sentiment bearing therefore in she memory the maxim of she frugal parent tibby deposit she money in the only bank we believe that be at that period in the scottish capital and hire herself as a child 's maid in the family of a gentleman who occupy a house in the neighborhood of restalrig here the story of she fortune be unknown and tibby be distinguish only for a kind heart and a lovely countenance it be during the summer month and leith link become she daily resort and there she be wont to walk with a child in she arm and another lead by the hand for there she could wander by the side of the sound sea and she heart still glow for she father 's cottage and its fairy glen where she have often hear the voice of its deep water and she feel the sensation which we believe may have be experience by many who have be bear within hearing of old ocean 's roar that wherever they may be they hear the murmur of its billow as the voice of a youthful friend and she almost fancy as she approach the sea that she draw nearer the home which sheltered she infancy she have be but a few week in the family we have allude to when return from she accustomed walk she eye meet those of a young man habit as a seaman he appear to be about five-and-twenty and he feature be rather manly than handsome there be a dash of boldness and confidence in he countenance but as the eye of the maiden meet he he turn aside as if abashed and pass on tibby blush at she foolishness but she could not help it she feel interested in the stranger there be a expression a language a inquiry in he gaze she have never witness before she would have turn round to cast a look after he but she blush deeper at the thought and modesty forbid it she walk on for a few minute upbraid herself for entertain the silly wish when the child who walk by she side fall a few yard behind she turn round to call he by he name -- tibby be certain that she have no motive but to call the child and though she do steal a sidelong glance towards the spot where she have pass the stranger it be a mere accident it could not be avoid -- at least so the maiden wish to persuade she conscience against she conviction but that glance reveal to she the young sailor not pursue the path on which she have meet he but follow she within the distance of a few yard and until she reach she master 's door she hear the sound of he footstep behind she she experience a emotion between be pleased and offend at he conduct though we suspect the former eventually predominate for the next day she be upon the link as usual and there also be the young seaman and again he follow she to within sight of she master 's house how long this sort of dumb love-making or the pleasure of diffidence continue we can not tell certain it be that at length he speak woo and conquer and about a twelvemonth after they first meeting tibby fowler become the wife of william gordon the mate of a foreign trader on the second week after they marriage william be to sail upon a long long voyage and might not be expect to return for more than twelve month this be a severe trial for poor tibby and she feel as if she would not be able to stand up against it as yet she husband know nothing of she dowry and for this hour she have reserve its discovery a few day before they marriage she have lift she money from the bank and deposit it in she chest no willie my ain willie she cry ye maunna ye winna leave I already : i have neither faither mother brother nor kindred naebody but you willie only you in the wide world and i be a stranger here and ye winna leave you tibby say that ye winna willie and she wring he hand gaze in he face and weep i maun gang dearest i maun gang say willie and press she to he breast but the thocht o ' my ain wifie will mak the month chase ane anither like the moon drive shadow owre the sea there be na danger in the voyage hinny no a grain o ' danger sae dinna greet but come kiss I tibby and when i come hame i 'll mak ye leddy o ' they a ' oh no no willie she reply i want to be nae leddy i want naething but my willie only say that ye 'll no gang and here 's something here something for ye to look at and she hurry to she chest and take from it a large leathern pocket-book that have be she father 's and which contain she treasure now amount to somewhat more than six hundred pound in a moment she return to she husband she throw she arm around he neck she thrust the pocket-book into he bosom there willie there she exclaim that be yours -- my faither place it in my hand wus ' a blessing and wus ' the same blessing i transfer it to you -- but dinna dinna leave I thus say she hurry out of the room we will not attempt to describe the astonishment we may say the joy of the fond husband on open the pocket-book and find the unlooked-for dowry however intensely a man may love a woman there be little chance that she put a unexpected portion of six hundred pound into he hand will diminish he attachment nor do it diminish that of william gordon he relinquish he intention of proceed on the foreign voyage and purchase a small coast vessel of which he be both owner and commander five year of unclouded prosperity pass over they and tibby have become the mother of three fair child william sell he small vessel and purchase a larger one and in fitting it up all the gain of he five successful year be swallow up but trade be good she be a beautiful brig and he have she call the _ tibby fowler _ he now take a fond farewell of he wife and little one upon a foreign voyage which be not calculate to exceed four month and which hold out high promise of advantage but four eight twelve month pass away and there be no tiding of the _ tibby fowler _ britain be then at war there be enemy ' ship and pirate upon the sea and there have be fierce storm and hurricane since she husband leave and tibby thought of all these thing and weep and she lisping child ask she when they father would return for he have promise present to all and she answer to-morrow and to-morrow and turn from they and weep again she begin to be in want and at first she receive assistance from some of the friend of they prosperity but all hope of she husband 's return be now abandon the ship be not insure and the mother and she family be reduce to beggary in order to support they she sell one article of furniture after another until what remain be seize by the landlord in security for he rent it be then that tibby and she child with scarce a blanket to cover they be cast friendless upon the street to die or to beg to the last resource she could not yet stoop and from the remnant of former friendship she be furnish with a basket and a few trifling wares with which with she child by she side she set out with a broken and a sorrowful heart wander from village to village she have travel in this manner for some month when she draw near she native glen and the cottage that have be she father 's that have be she own stand before she she have travel all the day and sell nothing she child be pull by she tattered gown weep and cry bread mother give we bread and she own heart be sick with hunger oh wheesht my darling wheesht she exclaim and she fall upon she knee and throw she arm round the neck of all the three you will get bread soon the almighty will not permit my bairn to perish no no ye shall have bread in despair she hurry to the cottage of she birth the door be open by one who have be a reject suitor he gaze upon she intently for a few seconds and she be still young be scarce more than six-and-twenty and in the midst of she wretchedness yet lovely gude gracious tibby fowler he exclaim be that you poor creature be ye seek charity weel i think ye 'll mind what i say to you now that you pride would have a fa ' while the heartless owner of the cottage yet speak a voice behind she be hear exclaim it be she it be she my ain tibby and she bairn at the well-known voice tibby utter a wild scream of joy and fall senseless on the earth but the next moment she husband william gordon raise she to he breast three week before he have return to britain and trace she from village to village till he find she in the midst of they child on the threshold of the place of she nativity he story we need not here tell he have fall into the hand of the enemy he have be retain for month on board of they vessel and when a storm have arise and hope be go he have save she from be lose and she crew from perish in reward for he service he own vessel have be restore to he and he be return to he country after a absence of eighteen month richer than when he leave and laden with honor the rest be soon tell after tibby and she husband have weep upon each other 's neck and he have kiss he child and again they mother with he youngest child on one arm and he wife rest on the other he hasten from the spot that have be the scene of such bitterness and transport in a few year more william gordon have obtain a competency they re-purchase the cottage in the glen where tibby fowler live to see she child 's child and die at a good old age in the house in which she have be bear -- the remains of which we have only to add for the edification of the curious may be see until this day the cradle of logie it be not very easy when we consider the great desire manifest by author and editor to serve up piquant dish of fiction on the broad table of literature to account for the fact that the undoubtedly true story of the cradle of logie and the indian princess as she be often call should never have appear in print it have apparently escape the sharpest eye of we chronicler sir walter scott do not appear to have much fancy for angus but it would seem that the fact of this strange occurrence in a civilised country and not very far back have never reach he even the history of forfarshire be silent and the picture of scotland for tourist which generally seize on any romantic trait connect with a locality or a old ruin have also overlook they yet the principal personage in the drama be one whose name be for year in the mouth of the people not only for peculiarity of character but retribution of fate and this local fame have die away only within a comparatively recent period it be in my very early year that i see the cradle and hear imperfectly its tale from my mother but she account be comparatively meager i seek long for detail nor be i by any means successful till i fall in with a man name aminadab fairweather a resident at the scour burn in dundee who be in the habit of frequent logie house and who though very old remember many of the circumstance the truth be there be rich flesh-pot in logie house -- richer than those which supply the muscle of the theban mummy so endure through long age no doubt from be so well feed for mr fletcher of linderte -lrb- \* -rrb- who be proprietor of the mansion be the greatest epicurean and glossogaster that ever live since leontine time then a woman call jenny mcpherson who have in early life like a good scotch louse who aye travels south find she way from lochaber to london where she have get into george 's kitchen and learn something better than to make sour kraut be the individual who administer to she master 's epicureanism if not gulosity nay it be say she have a hand in the tragedy of the cradle but however that may be it be certain she be deep in the confidence of fletcher but then mr mcpherson as she choose to call herself -- though the never a mcpherson be connect with she except by the tie of blood which like those of all celt have they loose termination dangle into infinity at the beginning of the world 's history -- be give to administer the contents of she savoury flesh-pot to other than the family of logie yea like a true highlander she delight in have henchman -- or haunchmen truly in this instance -- who give she love in return for she edible luxury it happen that we say aminadab be one of those favor individual and it be lucky for this generation that he be for if he have not be there would assuredly have be no record of the cradle and the black lady -lrb- note \* : mr fletcher have also the property of balinsloe as well as logie they have all pass into other hand -rrb- it be in a little parlor off the big kitchen that janet receive she henchman and be there ever man so happy as we good aminadab -- and that for several human reason whereof the first be certainly the logie flesh-pot the second the story about the romantic place wherewith she contrived to garnish and spice these savoury mouthful and last janet herself who be always under the feminine delusion that she be the corporate representative of the first of these reason if indeed the other be not mere _ adjecta _ not to be take into account whereas there be doubt if she be for herself ever count at all except as the mere old-pot which contain the reality and they happiness would certainly have be complete if it have not be -- at least in the case of aminadab -- that it could be enjoy only by pass through that grim medium a churchyard but then be not all celestial bliss burden by this condition nay be not even we earthly bliss which be a foretaste of heaven only a flower raise upon the rottenness of other flower -- a type of the soul as it issue from corruption yes aminadab could not get to the holy of holy except by pass through logie kirkyard a small and most romantic golgotha on the left of the road lead to lochee whose inhabitant it contain and which be so limited and crowd that one might prefigure it as one of those hole or dungeon in michael angelo 's picture belch forth spirit in the shape of inverted tadpole the tail uppermost and yet represent ascend spark the wicket that surround logie house -- lie as it do upon the south side of balgay hill and flank on the east by a deep gully wherethrough run a small stream which so far as i know have no name -- be lock at night the terror of this place at the late hour when these say henchman behove to seek they savoury reward be the only drawback to aminadab 's supreme bliss and if the time of these symposial meeting have be somewhat later in the century how much more formidable would have be a passage through this contract valley of tumulus and bone no churchyard except those of judea be ever invest with such terror -- not the mystical fear of a divine fate see in the descend cloud with justice gleam with fiery eye on sin and hold those scale the decision of which would destine to eternal bliss or eternal woe and that justice personify in he whose glory be a burning like the burning of a fire -- no but the revolting fear produce by the profanity of that poor worm of very common mud which have be since the beginning of time act the god ay the aurelia-born image of grace see a difference when it look from the sun to the epigenetic thing which he raise out of corruption there be in that small place of skull a rehearsal of the great day we hear little of these freak now-a-day but it be different then when man make themselves demon by drink one night william maule of panmure then in he day of graceless frolic fletcher read the nephew of the laird and subsequently the laird himself of logie rob thornton the merchant dudhope and other kindred spirit who use to sing in the inn of sandy morren the hotel-keeper death begone here 's none but soul sally drunk from the inn the story go that the night be dark and there stand at the door a hearse which have that day convey to the howf now about to be shut up because of its offence against the nostril of man who be not destine to need a grave the wife of a inconsolable husband and the mother of child and thereupon come from maule 's mouth -- for wickedness will seek its playful function in a pun -- the proposition that the bacchanal should have a rehearsal in the kirkyard of logie well it signify of course nothing that the black princess have be bury there so far away from the land of the balmy east where the rose blow and the orange grow and all be divine but man below fletcher read might have recollect this but what though be not the pun a good one -- worthy of hood they all mount the hearse panmure be driver nor could sandy morren give to these white-robed spirit who be so soon to rise in glory from the envious earth more than a sour-milk horn and half a dozen of snow-white table-cloth for the theatrical property of the great player so it have be since the time when the shepherd who kill the son of aebolus for that he give they wine which they think be poison because they find they head out of order -- wine still generate on folly the afflatus of madness the story go on the night be as dark as those place they be to illumine with they white robe alas not of innocence but the darkness be not of the moon 's absence in another hemisphere only that darkness which be cloud-born and must cede in twinkling yet glorious intervene moment to the moon when she will salute the grave and the marriage-guest and the hearse as it slowly wend its way up the road to lochee every now and then pour forth from its dark inside peal of laughter the traveller on the road look with wide eye at the grim apparition and flee they arrive at the rough five-bar stile it be throw back and the hearse be drive into the place of the dead the story go on there be silence everywhere and appropriately there where the four brick corner of the smoke-coloured cradle rise from the hollow of balgay hill they wait till the moon shine out again in she calm breathless repose and then resound from the clang black board of the hearse a terrible din resemble thunder and already each man with he table-cover roll round he be snug behind the solemn head-stones storied with domestic love sever by the dark angel now be the time for the trumpet-call which behove to be sound by the cycloborean lung of the broad-chested panmure the story have no reason to flag where the stake of the _ grimelinage _ be the upraising of white-robed spirit the sour-milk horn be sound as it never be sound before on the earth which have pass away every spirit come forth from below the head-stone and there rise a wail of misery which nothing but wine could have produce mercy on we poor soul justice cry maule stand out there bob thornton and answer for the sin do in the body the story go on and it intercalate fie fie on man thornton stand forth shriek for the say mercy be not you sir last night of the time of the past world in the inn keep by sandy morren in the town call bonnie dundee -- bonnie in all save its sin and its magistracy go a-begging and its hemp-spinner -lrb- \* -rrb- and the effect of sandy riddoch 's reign -- drinking and swearing -lrb- note \* : there be some prevision here which i can not explain -rrb- i be then down with you to the pit which have no bottom whatsomever and thornton disappear in the hollow not far from where the brick cradle stand stand forth fletcher read be not you sir art and part in confine in yonder dungeon the poor unfortunate black lady whereby she be murder by that villain of a uncle of yours fletcher of linderte i be down with you to the pit and the lake of brimstone and down he go into the same valley stand forth dudhope be not you sir see on the 21st of December of the late dynasty of time in the company of one of these denizen of rougedom in the overgate that disgrace of the last world for which it have very properly be burn up like a scroll of sandy riddoch 's peculation i be then down to the pit and dudhope -- even he the representative of graham of opprobrious memory -- disappear you be all -lrb- cry maule -rrb- like the lady of luss 's kain egg every one of which fall through the ring into the tub and do not count and so on with the rest till there be no more to go down yet the horn sound again for maule be not so drunk that he do not remember there be any more to come but then have he not be singing in sandy morren 's death begone here 's none but soul the story go on the horn have sound there stand forth a figure that do not belong to this crowd of sinner it be a woman dress in dark clothes with a black bonnet and a umbrella in she hand how the great god can show he power over the little god man the woman be no other than a mr gedde of lochee who have get a little too much at the scour burn have on she way home slip into the resting-place of she husband who have be bury only a week before and have get drowsy have fall asleep on the flat stone which cover he in a half dreamy state she have see all this terrible mummery -- no mummery to she for she think it real : and as every one stand forward by name she often say to herself when will it be johnnie 's turn poor man for he be a awfu ' sinner i fear the pit 's owre guid for he but johnnie be not call and then she expect she own summons -- fall agony of a moment

witness the object of they new-born fear hurry into the hearse the party be in a few minute post to dundee in solemn silence where they arrive about two o'clock not to resume they orgy but to separate each for he home with the element in he of a sense of retribution not forget for many a day at the long run the story finish and the chronicler lift up he hand to heaven cry be there no end lord be there no end to the profanity of man lord why stayeth the hand of vengeance if guidman aminadab have know these thing -- which he could not do because like sir jame colquhoun 's last day -lrb- of the session -rrb- which he want the judge to abolish this last day -lrb- of the world -rrb- happen after the say aminadab be in the habit of seek mr m ` pherson 's parlor -- he would have have greater deduction from he pleasure for aminadab read he bible and belong to the first secession and so it be better he do not especially on that night when mr m ` pherson have be so extraordinarily condescend to she henchman as to set before he a fine piece of pork in recognition of he adherence to the resolution of leave the flesh-pot of egypt -- the old church it be a dark night in January there be a cheerful fire in the neat parlor and janet be communicative if not chatty in good english get in george 's kitchen at kew i would like all this better say aminadab if i have not that churchyard to come through and then there be that fearful-looking cradle in the hollow with four lum like the stumpt post of a child 's rocking-bed what be it janet -- it be not a cow-house nor a henhouse but a pure dungeon fearful to free man who might shudder to be confine in it what more say janet do you know anything more aminadab yes but i be eat logie 's pork and do not like to say much never mind the pork man speak out do the folk down in the town say anything or shake they head or point they finger well they say there be a human be confine in it reply aminadab and so they may for sound have be hear come from the dark hole -- ay and i have hear they myself -- deep moan and weep i would like to know if there be a secret hush hush aminadab there be a secret and you be the only man i would speak of it to and mr mcpherson rise solemnly and lock the door upon herself and she henchman you know aminadab that my master come from bombay some year ago and bring home with he a black wife dear good soul -- so kind so timid so cheerful too but heaven help I what could i do -- for you know mr fletcher be a terrible man he do not fear the face of clay and the scowl upon he face when he be in he mood be terrible i be bind to obey but what of she say aminadab it be no surely she who be in the horrid hole never you mind that but eat you bacon you fool for stop I when i be stop i seldom begin again for a day and night at least something like you master janet no aminadab i have _ a heart _ lad that i know janet say aminadab with a lump of pork in he mouth and -- and -- it -- be -- fat -- lass and the easier swallow say she i mean you heart mr mcpherson and i must swallow that too as it seem to come up my throat and choke I even as the pork seem to do you take time aminadab there be no hurry man ah well then we have it all among the servant how mr fletcher get my lady he be a great man in bombay -- governor i think or something near that -- and my lady be the only daughter of the nawab or nabob of some kingdom near bombay -- i forget the strange indian name she be the very petted child of she father and when mr fletcher see she she be run about the palace like a wild playful creature -- i may say we bonny little roe of the highland hill or maybe another creature she use to speak about i think they call it gazelle with such wonderful eye for shine that you can not look into they no more you could at the sun for oh aminadab they have strange thing in these place which be much nearer the sun than we be here in this old country but the mighty nabob be unwilling to give she to the white-faced lover even though he be the governor of bombay forbye have balinsloe and linderte in scotland too maybe he think a scotsman could not like a black indian princess though she be with she grand shawl about she and she jewelled turban and diamond and pearl and all that and maybe aminadab he think -- and here janet lower she husky voice -- that it be just for these fine thing he want she rich though he be himself yet strange enough too the nabob have promise the man who should marry he daughter the weight of herself in fine indian gold weigh in a balance as she tocher hear ye ever the like of a tocher man that would depend upon she size and weight janet lass now have you a tocher like that it would be a gey business i think -- fourteen potato-stone at the very least i would say eh -- and he must get quit of the mouthful before he could finish -- eh janet and if you go on at that rate with my pork you will not by-and-by be much behind I but guid faith aminadab i be not ashamed lad of my size a poor smoke-dried shrivel cook shame she guid savoury dish intend to fatten mankind and make they jolly but you be right about the offer of the nabob the creature be small and light and lithe and could not weigh much but then think of the jewel these do not depend upon she weight but upon they own light oh what diamond and ruby and pearl as big as marble i have look at they till my eye reel with the light of they and no wonder when i have hear they value at a hundred thousand guinea -- and to think of all that be hold in a little box there be one necklace worth fifteen thousand itself and yet a small neck too maybe -- ` and thou shalt make a necklace to fit she neck ' say the lord it would not be half the girth of yours mr m ` pherson ay aminadab not a half nor anything like it but do not stop I again lad or i 'll stop the pork -lrb- a pause -rrb- ah well i fear it be the shine jewel and not the black face do the business on my master 's side and of course he would be all smile at the nabob 's court for aminadab my lad there never be on the face of god 's earth a man who could so soon change the horrid dark scowl into the very light of sunshine as mr fletcher i have see he when in company with kincaldrum and dudhope and gleneagle and the rest laughing till he face be as red as the sun then all of a sudden when some of he mood come over he turn just like a fiend new come out of -- oh i 'll just say it out aminadab though ye be of the seceder -- just hell lad but good mother janet -- mother you own mother man till you be a father aminadab have i not tell you to let I go on there be no honor in a mother : that sow you be eat be the mother six time of thirteen at each litter and i think that be about seventy-eight mother forsooth ay and yet you 'll see a beggar wretch clothe in tanterwallop -- rag be owre guid a word -- come to logie door and look as if she have the right to demand meal from I merely because she have two at she foot and one in she arm such honorable gaberlunzy get no meal from I my master be keen for the match but the nabob be shy of the white face and here be a curious thing -- i get it from my lady herself she say the nabob she papa as she call he -- for just like we here they have kindly word and real human feeling -- make a bargain with my master that if he take she away out of indium to where the big woman they call the company live he would be kind to she and ' _ treat she as he would do a child which be rock in a cradle _ ' better than naomus 's wish say aminadab ` and the lord grant ye find rest in the house of thy husband ' that bargain they make he sign with blood draw just right over he heart and the nabob sign too for the weight of gold and the jewel then come the marriage such a day have not be witness in bombay for year if ever when a great son of the big woman be to be marry to the daughter of a nawab all the great man of bombay and the rich parsee she call they be at the king 's court and the little prince round about for hundred of mile and all the minister of indian state -- for you must know that the marriage be in the english fashion as the nawab think he could bind the bridegroom best in that way then the grand feast and such dancing and deray and firing of cannon and wave of flag be never see ` and all israel shout with a great shout so that the earth ring again ' just so guid auld burgher lad rejoin mr m ` pherson they have only be a few month marry when mr fletcher 's health have fail he -- and surely he liver be rotten to this day if not he heart too -- he come home with he wife and buy this bonnie place she bring with she a squalling half-and-half thing -- there he be at the door this moment by-and-by my little prince -lrb- she cry -rrb- go to aditi -- ady we call she -- that be the black ayah my lady bring home with she that will be another wife i fancy say aminadab they have all two or three wife in the east have not they guid faith ane 's mair than eneugh here if the nawab 's daughter 's in she cradle no no no ye fool ` and i shall cut off the multitude of no ' ezekiel thirtieth fifteen a ayah be a servant and ady 's a good black soul as ever foolishly wash she face when there be no occasion for the trouble and yet these black creature be for ever wash themselves they wash before breakfast and after breakfast before dinner and after dinner before supper and after supper but the never a bit whiter they be that ever i could see yea they might save themselves a great deal of trouble say aminadab but they will not rejoin janet we have be tortured with they washing sometimes when angry i say to ady can not you go down to the _ scour burn _ ` and wash thyself in the brook cherith which be before jordan ' but she say it be brahma that bid she -- that be they biggest god and this brahma be a trouble to we too it seem he be everywhere and ady seek he on balgay hill and in the churchyard o ' night when the moon 's out thereafter come in with those eye of hers like flame coal dart they on we who do not believe in brahma as if we be the real heathen and not she and she mistress ` and thou shalt not erect a temple to dagon but cut he down to the stump ' say amimadab hush hush man we servant be all in terror they say that ady be right for that they have see he in about the skirt of balgay wood and down in the hollow of the ravine move about like a spirit of darkness with something white round he head and a wide cloak wrap about he aminadab have just take up a large tankard of ale wherewith he intend to make a clean sweep of he hearty supper down he throat but he pause lay down the tankard turn pale shake and look wistfully into the face of he chieftainess nor do he speak a word because some idea have probably magnetize he tongue at the wrong end and the other would not move ady say and so do the servant that he have no shadow and we should think he should not because we ghost hereaway have none that ever i hear of but that be a lie of they foolish religion for i could swear i one night see he shadow flit like that of a sun-dial when the sun 's in a hurry to get the curtain round he head away past the east end of the house and disappear in a moment but i 'll tell you what aminadab he may like we spirit be a shadow himself i could hardly speak for fear though five minute before i have as good a tankard of that logie-brewed as you have before you but i get my tongue through the ale at the other end o ' t and cry out with zechariah wherein i be something like you aminadab ` ho ho come forth and flee from the land of the north ' that would stump he dagonship say aminadab with a effort to be cheerful in spite of the foresaid idea whatever it be ay he continue after drink off the tankard and get courage and wit at same time a line from the bible be just like a rifle-shot in the hinder-end of these false god they can not stand it nohow and you have stumpt I reply the cook with the chopping-knife of you folly so that i do not know where to find my leg again it be a year after he come to logie before another half-and-half be bear -- a boy too and then there come a change over mr fletcher 's mind there be something strange about those english that live long in indium i have notice it when i be in london in george 's house but it be all from the liver continue the cook first grilled upon the rib then cool with champagne then heal up with curry chile and ginger no wonder the devil get into the kitchen where a dish like that be wait he then they be so proud and selfish and fond of themselves and they worthless life ` skin for skin yea all that they have will they give for they life ' so the devil say of he of uz but you see it be all in the liver continue the cook aditus come to I one day and say ` de ` gyptian in indium tink body divide into sixteen part with god to each part he he janette ' and the black creature laugh then i say the liver of a englishman after he come from indium be the devil 's part and so it be with mr fletcher he begin first to interfere with kalee 's religion ` oh terrible janette ' cry ady on another day ` master cut off head of kartekeya 's peacock and smash de tail of garoora ' on another day ` right eye of elephant head of ganeso knock into de skull ' another day this time in tear weep awfully ` oh janette tail of holy cow clean snapt over de rump ' all right say aminadab of the first secession ` and i will cause they image to cease out of noph ' ay but i be ` wide ' continue the cook three foot and a half across the bosom say aminadab who be still in he reverie with the secret idea still exercise a power over he even after the tankard of ale wide in my mind and charity ye fool man continue she not disincline this time to laugh for she be proud of be jolly in the person i feel for poor kalee she weep incessantly at the loss of the cow 's tail and ask I if i have see it nay implore I like a worshipper to try to recover it for she i say god forgive I that i have see it in the dung-pit and that george have cart it away ` and do not know de value ' cry ady ` worth de necklace of diamond ' and both she and kalee break out into such a yell as make the house ring yet with all this kalee still love the gloomy man she would throw she jewelled arm about he neck and hang upon he with she foot off the ground so little light and lithe she be so like a sapling you could have bent she any way and when the love be in she heart and it be never absent she be really bonny we eye hereaway be mere cinder to these glowing churley bit of flaming sulphur and then that strange look of the shine face just as if she yearn to enter into he very soul -- ay as the soul of these black creature go up and form a part of brahma 's spirit that be all over the earth all art cry aminadab get impatient of janet 's eloquence -- eloquence i say for janet be a superior woman and though a cook a natural genius all art ` and he make she to use enchantment and deal with familiar spirit and wizard ' no no man it be all real nature but it wasna real nature make he throw the poor black soul away whose gold and jewel he have barter he white i should say yellow rotten-livered body for ay if she have be a man i would have like she better than he for as i hate the skin of a old hen when the fat become rancid and golden so do i hate a yellow-faced man with the devil sit gnawing at he liver the reason the devil 's so bitter say aminadab ay if you be to try a beef-steak off he rump or spare-rib ye 'll find it more like the absynth i use in the kitchen than the flesh of a capon or three-year old stot yea i would be like unto he who be make to ` suck honey out of the living rock ' the cruel man throw she away from he just as if she tocher have be the weight of herself in copper instead of gold and oh it be so easily do for the creature be not only as i have say light but she have such a touchiness when she glancing eye see that she love be not return by he she love beyond all the earth that you would have think she shrink all up into a tiny child couring in the corner of the big drawing-room so like a wounded bird yaw-aw-aw yawn the seceder half asleep ` and he give up the ghost in the room while he seek he meat to relieve he soul ' asleep and dream cry mr m ` pherson who have get into the very spirit of description away to the scour burn and never show you face here again but aminadab soon pacify the wide-souled and wide-bodied cook who be of he own persuasion really love the man yes she be a seceder from the old faith and such a seceder no wonder there be a blank among the congregation of mere body it be now well on to twelve and aminadab have that cradle to pass and the kirkyard to get through all too with that idea in he head to which we have allude and which we may as well tell be no other than a vivid recollection of have see this brahma on a prior night he have discharge the notion at the time as a illusion though in general he have little power over he supernatural fear which be to he not indeed supernatural but very natural so much so as we have say that a mere inanimate and dead very dead burying-place have be more than once the means of cut he out of a savoury piece of pork and a good logie-brewed tankard it be the allusion make by janet that recall the suspicion that he have see something ah something what a pregnant vocable -- so mysterious so provocative of curiosity -- a it -- of all the word in we language the most suggestive of a difference from the real being of flesh and blood carry a name get at the baptismal font whereby it shall be know and pass current like a counter and be it not at best only a counter yea a counterfeit we be only to each other as sign of thing which be not see and yet we laugh when we hear the it as if it might not be the very thing of which we be one of the sign be it not thus that we be all humbug in this world of ours for we take the sign for the thing yea talk to the sign and love it or hate it or worship it -- all the while be as ignorant as mule ne pictum quidem vidit the very sign may be as far from the reality as in philosophy we see it every day and thus all wander and grope in the dark the blind lead the blind we screech like owl at a spark of light from the real fountain beyond aldebaran and the owl be more busy than pleasant that night in the deep wood of balgay hill it be a sign that the moon be not kindly to they heavy eye the scene as aminadab issue from the postern might have be feel as beautiful from the very awe which it inspire but aminadab be no lover of nature especially if he see in she recess any hiding-place for such being as brahma more mysterious to he from know nothing at all about he except that he be some ashtoreth or chemosh or milcom in a new form let loose from hell to disturb the pure soul of seceder destine for heaven the full moon fall on the hollow in the hill surmount by the dark wood of balgay right aface of he the house of logie behind and the declination on either side in one of which lay the little golgotha there in the midst of the hollow stand grim and desolate the dark brick-built cradle cast its shadow to the south the four-corner prominence shoot out like horn and so unlike the habitation of a human be yea unlike any composition of brick and lime ever rear by the hand of a genius for house-make the shadow lay on the grass like those ghastly sun-picture so call yet more like moon-born thing and then the solemn silence only relieved to be deepen by the occasional to-hoo be oppressive to he as if a medium for some footstep to startle he into superstition yet he be draw towards the horrid dungeon in spite of he very self janet 's story would come at last he think to a termination which would justify he own suspicion and even there before he be evidence in the same direction for have throw himself as if by a effort into the shade of the dungeon he could see beyond its verge and by as it be look round the corner the body of the dark-faced aditus she have no doubt come stealthily from the house and be posture in a attitude far deeper in humiliation and adjuration than we practice in we land she face be cover by she hand for in truth she could see nothing through these mere light-permitting slip of a brick 's width wherewith this horrible hole be supply as if by a relaxation of severity in its last stage of perfect inhumanity no nothing could be see but something might be hear yea the most piteous moan that ever burst from a oppressed heart and yet so soft so uncomplaining as if the sufferer find no fault with aught in the world but herself then aditi 's sound be something like response rise as the internal sound rise and as they die away -- a jabber wail of a eastern tongue aminadab blunt though he be and fonder of pork than poetry and of scriptural quotation -- which he have always at he tongue 's end for conclave of weaver -- than impassioned sentiment rise at the inspiring touch of this strange world 's endless and ever-occurring occasion be impressed he look over the dark abode up at the moon then at the prostrate ady and thought of the distance between that prisoner and the gay palace where she be bring up with its paradise of flower and aroma and singing bird of gold and azure -- far away far away and then that blood-written oath -- oh so literally fulfil and obey but the thought be evanescent from very fear nor be he nervousness unjustified for even as he turn he head he see a figure wrap up in a dark cloak and surmount by a white coil of pure linen as he think emerge from the clump of thick tree that stand on the north end of the burying-ground the figure have run as it be in fear so far forward no sooner see the project head of aminadab than it turn and retreat at the same instant ady rise as if disturbed and run to the house yet the moan do not cease it seem interminable or if to be terminate by the absence of ady the sufferer do not know she be go and oh these wail -- aminadab flee and take they along with he nor do they ever leave he even when he go to bed they be fresh upon he ear claim precedence to the vision of he eye though that too assert its authority as something miraculous -- whether the eastern mystery itself or some tutelary genius bring from heaven by the shriek of man 's cruelty nor could he rest for the thought that humble as he be he be surely take there that he might go to the power of earth to ask they to aid the power of heaven why that cradle have be build within the limit of civilisation even the mason be know : the brick be not egyptian brick nor the mortar foreign nor the wood a tree from the heart of africa and yet why be it there -- nay why be the use of it not inquire into if jeshurun have wax fat and kick against the lord of heaven be there no lord of earth that could tame this yellow-livered worshipper of baal who yet be receive among the chief of israel to drink the pure juice of the grape and make a god of he belly and to sing obscene song even in that house there be riot and debauchery upon the spoil of that woman encage like a beast and at the world 's end from she natural protector yea we good soul aminadab become bold he be privileged if not call but then that brahma -- that incarnation of a power confess by million on million of people possess of soul and therefore something in god 's reckoning it be no illusion twice he have see the mysterious be how do he come hither to the ultima thule as it be of the known world why do he come just at a juncture when the daughter of a king of he own favored people be immure in a dungeon and call for he help because he must have know that a spark of the spirit that belong to he and would go back to he be threaten to be extinguish by power in a land owe no obedience to he but do not that same moon shine on the child of brahma as well as on the child of christ and be there no power in heaven but what we confess how philosophical all this in a scour burn weaver in hysteric yet there be greater man than aminadab who could not explain such thing ah well to the honor of poor aminadab it be for once not pork he seek at logie house next night at ten he be in the parlor but how do he get there and brahma in these very wood aminadab very probably could not have tell himself yet there he be come again so soon aminadab ay reply he ` though a man may fall he may be raise up again ' i stumble in front of my friend but she will not kick I yea she will lift I up be silent she say you be see last night near the cradle where no one dare approach none of the servant go there save I and even ady if she go it be by stealth ah you know something now but there be one thing you do not know and that be that rich man can pay watcher to discover those who search into they iniquity whatever i know say aminadab i be ignorant of this : why that dungeon contain a human being can keep its place at the distance of a mile from a town with 30000 inhabitant but they do not know it lad be you quiet and pick that leg of a chicken that be better than the knowledge that kill there be not one of the magistrate would dare to touch a hair on mr fletcher 's head no for all that lie in the power of brahma but why do you keep the secret ` the step of a good woman be order by the lord ' but do he order you to step to the cradle i do it for good say she because i can soften grief that be unbearable and cook have something in they power but if i be to say a word to fletcher i would be turn away and another might treat the prisoner worse but why would not the power interfere because baily love a dinner and fine wine and it be easier to wink than think and easier to think than get themselves out of trouble by act on they thought will that satisfy you it be a strange business but the world 's a strange place and strange man and woman live therein meat and drink and honor be better than wisdom look to you plate aminadab oh i wish i know less but i see what be come when i see george cameron begin to build what he say be to be like a cradle do i not recollect what kalee tell I about the blood-bond do we not all witness the grow gloom gathering day by day over he face then separate bed then no more companionship out or in the gloom for ever and the tear of kalee for ever and ever and the terror and anguish of poor soul aditus ah yes but he never strike she never upbraid she and at length she shrink from he as if from a serpent and this he could not bear : it make he dun-yellow black aminadab then when the cradle be finish and a truckle and a table and a chair be put in he call I to he and say with a horrid smile on he face be ` pherson you be a highlander and staunch to you master i be true to my word yes i sign a bond when i married kalee that i would treat she as a father would a child whom he rock in a cradle i have obey kalee go into the cradle to-night you be to give she child 's food but you can not rock the cradle let the wind which drive in past balgay wood do that if they can my honor be pure swear to obey I ' i could not say no and look on that face kalee have be in that dungeon feed by I and have never see she child for a whole year the vengeance of the lord hangeth over the wicked by a burnt thread say aminadab yes who be to know that she own protector even the great spirit of she land be to come here to help she he be see last night again he wander about and about -- flit hither and thither he need no rest -- no food he be independent of rain and wind and thunder and storm but he do not help she say aminadab he time be come kalee be die die ay die then brahma will claim that which be a part of himself and then will be the time of he return to he chosen people horrible ejaculate aminadab the chicken stand untasted do mr fletcher know this why to be sure have not i tell he but may not a child die in its own cradle and the father continue feast with the lord and the laird drinking and swearing and debauching when he know that he honor be discharge -- ay and the blood-bond pay and the body when she die -- will be in logie burying-ground ay and strange people from the east a long way beyond where we sun rise with black face and bleed heart will come and bend over the little grave and weep for the daughter of they prince ah aminadab grief make a learn woman of I a poor servant but i can not save kalee none can save she now consumption have set in and bad air and a reject love and a mother 's yearning will do the work i be with she now with my cruse -- all alone with she for no one dare approach she know she be die she ask for the child -- ` will you not let I see my boy ' i shake my head ` and will fletcher not see I before i die to receive my last kiss ' i shake my head ` and aditus who will return to my father 's palace be she to be keep from I to the end ' i shake my head and will no one watch say aminadab yes i will watch all night but it will be unknown to fletcher no one can speak to he now he go hither and thither he have no rest yet the gloom be deeper than ever horrible mystery again ejaculate aminadab but ` the wicked shall perish they shall consume into smoke they shall consume away ' occasion make hero of very ordinary man and aminadab feel that he could be one of these worthy that night he soon leave after these word of janet but he be now more upon he guard against watcher perhaps janet have mention they to induce he to avoid too minute a examination where there be danger of another kind and this rather encouraged he the only fault of he heroism be the strange feeling which arise in he mind when he think of the indian spirit somehow this vision could not be get rid of or analyze by the small philosophy he have as for fletcher he view he merely as a human monster -- no uncommon phenomenon at a time when although there might not be any greater evil than now man be more reckless of consequence more dead to shame less under the control of public opinion probably not less under the fear of god he clear the wicket it be again a bright moonlight night he pass again the cradle and be bold enough to listen again alas the wail be weaker the bright lamp of these eye be fast lose its oil so he think for he could hear only now and then a very inaudible sob and occasionally a very weak wail shrill and yet low he could not stay for janet would be come stealthily with she cruse -- yes she cruse for so far as he could see by the narrow slip all be darkness around the die stranger in a proud land of liberty and humanity -- the proudest see on the face of the earth or perhaps ever will be see yet by-and-by to have more reason to be proud -- by-and-by when kalee would be asleep in the bosom of brahma she body only the monument of the sham of that proud land of liberty and humanity and the true religion of god 's covenant from the beginning retreat quickly he proceed over the green hollow and get into the skirt of balgay wood there he stand patiently still fearful but with the new-born zeal of curiosity and sympathy by-and-by he see janet come out with she cruse and walk as lightly as she huge body would permit she look round and round as if in great fear of fletcher probably of the indian spirit for it be clear she have a conviction of the truth of the real presence of brahma all be still no fletcher see nor watch but in about half a hour the dark aditus come trot out clothe in pure white look also fearfully about she but it be more clear that she expect some one stranger still she make for the very spot where aminadab be watch he study she direction to the breadth of a line and step aside there be plenty of foliage and some thick bush he throw himself down on the ground and hear the sighing of ady as if almost close to he by-and-by she be join by the mystery -- yes that be who have so long be the terror of logie house to all but the master who know nothing of he he be there but aminadab could not see more of he than he head which be as usual envelop in the same white cloth he hear they conversation of which not a word could he understand but oh that natural language of the heart which be the same in all land and will be the same in heaven -- those quick utterance deep sigh shaking of the frame as if the being be convulse it seem to be the last meeting it be so eloquent of heart love so mysterious in religious aspiration but here occur a strange incident even at the distance where they be a loud shrill scream be hear as if the last of expire human nature how it shake these two till the very leave rustle and the night-hawk and owl scream they terrible discord all be still again the male run as if move by the frenzy of a dervish forward towards the cradle then as he see the door half open retreat aminadab could make nothing of the figure beyond the conviction that it be the same he have see by fitful glimpse before it be altogether indescribable unlike anything he have ever see or read of on he return ady meet he and catch he in she arm as if to lead he back to the wood yet he be fitful anxious and flighty as if he know not where to go or what to do again the rapid whispering so sharp and intense as sometimes to appear like hiss of strange foreign creature it seem as if he soul be on fire and urge he he know not whither at that instant the door of the cradle open altogether and janet come out with the light ady dart forward like a moonbeam in the midst of another moonbeam and see by its superior whiteness a instant serve for some communication between she and janet then a shrill scream from ady a run hither and thither on the part of the male figure and at length dart into the wood he disappear aminadab now see janet go into the house be all over aminadab could not tell ady still hang round the cradle she even circle it like a hover ghost at length she near the door the key have be leave and she enter now be aminadab 's time he rush forward open the door and enter the dungeon a terrible sight meet he eye -- sight yes even in the comparative darkness there be enough in the small glimmer of moonlight enter by one of the hole to carry object to eye that would have pierce the deepest gloom there be say to be no darkness in the world sufficient to conceal object entirely but here there be in addition to the attenuate beam the white dress of ady and the bed where kalee lay janet have describe it and the table and the chair : what more than the bare wall be there to describe nothing on that bed cover by a thin white cloth lay this indian princess dead with ady hanging over she and pull at she and offer to she blank eye once like diamond a small figure of a indian god then the groan and suppress shriek of the faithful soul as she still pull and shake the corpse as if she could get from it one last look direct to the wooden figure too late kalee have die not only away from she people but away from the god of she people all of a sudden the ayah cease she endeavor and direct she eagle eye suffuse with tear up to the roof quick word follow the look aminadab could not understand they but the motion and aspiration convinced he that she cry there there brahma there she go to be of thy eternal and infinite soul from which she come and to which she fly then suddenly she rush out of the dungeon aminadab look after she she do not go to logie house but in the direction of the wood whither the indescribable figure have go aminadab hear no more scarcely see more if it be not the corpse lie before he he be afraid of janet more of fletcher who might now at length come to pass he eye over the body in the cradle where he be to cherish she as a father cherisheth he child yet he would look and look again how shrivel that face of darkness yet how calm and loving-like as if even in the midst of the agony of the last hour it smile love to she destroyer by-and-by a light again approach it be janet with a white sheet you here good heaven away away fletcher be to look at she yes he be to look at she in the cradle he promise she away no more i see brahma say aminadab yes true brahma brahma fool fool man i only tell you it be brahma to keep you from the cradle for you own safety then who be the strange be i dare not tell you that but i fear ady 's away with he without hat or cloak or box or supper to where nor that lad but i fear you will hear more of this scotch tragedy some day get you go there be fletcher aminadab obey and fletcher do see she some time after the departure of aminadab he cross the green it seem that night he have refrain from company not through penitence or any motive that man could divine in the nature of the man strangely-formed being do thing which do not seem to belong to they nature or to human nature and it be this that make they strange before he enter this not alas domdaniel he call janet to the door he want to be alone she give he the cruse and with the old gloom upon he face perhaps he want to test he courage it could not be that he want to look once more on the face of the mother of he child nor that he feel now that there have be one in the world who really do love he as few woman have ever love then man measure woman 's love by he own but when be man 's heart stir by nature 's strongest passion like that of devoted woman while now the world do not contain one heart that be move to he by anything stronger than dithyrambic delirium who know but there be fletcher look on the corpse of he wife and wave over she face the light of the small cruse he hold in he hand be he move as he see the still death-bound feature that once could not contain the expression which the leap heart with that burning fire in it of that land of the sun try in vain to force into it the eye too that flash and leap as never be see in we country of humid fog stifle the inborn heat and blear the vision and those arm that entwine he so as the vine hold the olive in its grasp as if it would give the juice which fire and inebriate for the oil that calm and fatten and sustain all over that lithe body which enable she when he see she first in the land of she father to bind and flee as if she have wing and these beautiful as the monaul 's ay and enable she too to play round he in that eastern gaiety which have charm he if he ever love she and even for a time make he home like fairydom who shall say there be no movement in he stern feature no moisture in he eye no tremble of the lip no tremor of the body as he might have read the last effort of nature in the expression of calm forgiveness or continue affection who could read _ he _ at midnight two day after kalee sleep in logie kirkyard there be no stone to point out the grave of the indian princess who lie -- as become too in we boast land of liberty entitle to she boast in a equality at length which even pride can not deny -- among the humble artisan and cottar of lochee do fletcher read on that after day when panmure blow the white iron trump not expect to see kalee rise up and seek judgment on the house of logie the blood be hereditary and the heart that be feed by the blood and which impel it if it have not be that aminadab marry the portly janet we might have hear no more of the fortune of this man but how true aminadab 's quotation that god 's vengeance never sleep where in all the scathed corpse of heaven 's lightning be there ever one that tell its tale like that of fletcher of balinsloe linderte and logie he be recall to india again ay aminadab he be force to go by the government but maybe the government be only like a thing that be move by the storm and cut in twain where its own silly power could do nothing before he go he marry a beautiful little woman -lrb- \* -rrb- perhaps the most spirited in the shire white as kalee be black and come too of gentle blood why do she marry this man have she not hear of the fate of kalee have she not see the cradle -lrb- still stand in the hollow of the hill -rrb- no doubt but woman will go through worse storm than man 's passion to get to the goal of wealth and honor then there be a frenzy in woman aminadab she be like the boy who seek danger for its own sake and will skim on skate the rim of the black pool that descend from the film of ice down to the bubble well of death below woman have a ambition to tame wild man ay even wild man have a charm for they which the tame son of prudence and industry can not inspire so it be : they be marry and he take she to indium -lrb- note \* : afterwards as i have hear the wife of milne of milneford she live till nearly a hundred -rrb- ` so the lord do lead he and there be no strange

equal and the contest be terrible each man fight hand to hand and the ground be contest inch by inch the gilded ornament of the french horse be cover with blood and they movement be encumber by they weight the sword of wedderburn have already smitten three of the chevalier 's follower to the ground and the two chief now contend in single combat d'arcy fight with the fury of despair but home continue to bear upon he as a tiger that have be rob of its cub every moment the force of the chevalier be thin and every instant the number of he enemy increase as the neighbouring peasantry rally round the standard of they chief find the most faithful of he follower stretch upon the earth d'arcy seek safety in flight dash he silver spur into the side of he noble steed he turn he back upon he desperate enemy and rush along in the direction of pouterleiny and through dunse with the hope of gain the road to dunbar of which town he be governor fiercely wedderburn follow at he heel with he naked sword uplift and ready to strike immediately behind he ride trotter the henchman of the late earl and another of home 's follower name dickson it be a fearful sight as they rush through dunse they horse striking fire from they heel in the light of the very sunbeam and the sword of the pursuer within a few foot of the fugitive still the chevalier ride furiously urge on the gallant animal that bear he which seem conscious that the life of its rider depend upon its speed he flaxen lock waive behind he in the wind and the voice of he pursuer ever and anon fall upon he ear like a dagger of death thrust into he bosom the horse upon which wedderburn ride have be wound in the conflict and as they draw near broomhouse its speed slacken and he follower trotter and dickson take the lead in the pursuit the chevalier have reach a spot on the right bank of the whitadder which be now in a field of the farm of swallowdean when he noble steed become entangled with its cumbrous trappings stumble and hurl its rider to the earth the next moment the sword of trotter and dickson be through the body of the unfortunate chevalier off with he head exclaim wedderburn who at the same instant reach the spot the bloody mandate be readily obey and home take the bleeding head in he hand cut off the flaxen tress and tie they as a trophy to he saddle-bow the body of the _ chevalier de la beauté _ be rudely bury on the spot where he fall a humble stone mark out the scene of the tragedy and the people in the neighborhood yet call it _ bawty 's grave _ the head of the chevalier be carry to dunse where it be fix upon a spear at the cross and wedderburn exclaim thus be exalt the enemy of the house of home the bloody relic be then bear in triumph to home castle and place upon the battlements there say sir david let the regent climb when he return from france for the head of he favorite it be thus that home of wedderburn revenge the murder of he kindred the story of the pelican though not so much a tradition as a memory still fresh probably in the mind of some of the good old edinburgh folk we here offer chiefly for the benefit of we young female reader who be fond of a story wherein little heroine figure as in béranger 's _ sylphide _ a account of a very famous adventure of a certain little jeannie dean in we city -- the more like the elder jeannie inasmuch as they both be concern in a loving effort to save the life of a sister whereunto as a very necessary introduction it behove we to set forth that there be some sixty year ago more or less a certain mr william maconie who be a merchant on the south bridge of edinburgh but who for the sake of exercise and fresh air -- a commodity this last he need not have go so far from the calton hill to seek -- reside at juniper green a little village three or four mile from st gile 's nor do this distance incommode he much see that he have the attraction to quicken he step homewards of a pretty young wife and two little twin daughter mary and annie as like each other as two rosebud partially open and as like they mother too as the object of we simile be to themselves when full blow peculiar in this respect of have twin at the outset and sister too -- a good beginning of a contract to perpetuate the species -- mr maconie be destine to be even more so inasmuch as there come no more of these pleasant _ delicia domi _ at least up to the time of we curious story -- a circumstance the more to be regret by the father in consequence of a strange fancy -lrb- never tell to he wife -rrb- that possess he of wish to insure the life of he child as they come into the world or at least after they have get through the rather uninsurable period of mere infant life and in execution of this fancy -- a very fair and reasonable one and not uncommon at that time whatever it may be now when people be not so provident -- he have get a insurance to the extent of five hundred pound effect in the pelican office -- perhaps the most famous at that time -- on the life of the say twin mary and annie who be no doubt altogether unconscious of the importance they be thus make to hold in the world yet unfortunately for the far-seeing and provident father this scheme threaten to fructify sooner than he wish if indeed it could ever have fructify to he satisfaction for the grisly spectre of typhus lay he relentless hand upon mary when she -- and of a consequence annie -- be somewhere about eight year old and surely be as we be very hopeful optimist in the cause of human nature we need not say that the father as he and he wife watch the suffering invalid on through the weary day and night of the progress towards the crisis of that dangerous ailment never once think of the pelican except as a bird that feed its young with the warm blood of its breast but sorrowful as they be they grief be nothing in comparison with the distress of little annie who slip about listen and make all manner of anxious inquiry about she sick sister whom she be prohibit from see for fear of she be touch by the say spectre nor be she heart the less trouble with fear for she life that all thing seem so quiet and mysterious about the house -- the doctor come and go and the father and mother whispering to each other but never to she and they face so sad-like and mournful in place of be as be they wont so cheerful and happy and surely all this solicitude on the part of annie maconie need not excite we wonder when we consider that from the time of they birth the twin sister have never be separate but that from the moment they have make they entrance on this world 's stage they have be always each where the other be and have run each where the other run wish each what the other wish and weep and laugh each when the other weep or laugh nature indeed before it come into she fickle head to make two of they have in all probability intend these little sister -- little cherry on one stalk -- to be but one and they could only be say not to be _ one _ because of they body be two -- a circumstance of no great importance for in spite of the duality of body the spirit that animated they be a unity and as we know from a old philosopher call plato the spirit be really the human creature the flesh and bone constitute the body be nothing more than a mere husk intend at the end to feed worm and then the mother help this sameness by dress they so like each other as if she want to make a _ comedy of error _ out of the two little female dromio but in the middle of this mystery and solicitude it happen that annie be to get some light for at breakfast one morning -- not yet that of the expect crisis -- when she father and mother be talk earnestly in a undertone to each other all unaware that the child as she be move about be watch they word and look much as a older victim of credulity may be suppose to hang on the cabbalistic movement and incantation of a sibyl the attentive little listener eagerly drink in every word of the follow conversation : -- the doctor be so doubtful say the anxious mother with a tear in she eye that i have scarcely any hope and if she be take away the very look of annie leave alone ` bleat for she sister lamb ' will break my heart altogether yes rejoin mr maconie it would be hard to bear but -- and it be the first time since mary 's illness he have ever remember the insurance -- it be wise that i insure poor mary 's life in the pelican insure she life in the pelican echo the wife in a higher tone that be at least lucky but oh i hope we will not need to have we grief solace by that comfort in affliction for many a day and this colloquy have scarcely be finish when the doctor enter have go previously into the invalid 's room with a very mournful expression upon he face nor do he word make that expression any more bearable as he say -- i be sorry to say i do not like mary 's appearance so well to-day i fear it be to be one of those case where we can not discover anything like a crisis at all indeed i have doubt about this old theory be applicable to this kind of fever where the virus go on gradually work to the end the end echo mr maconie then doctor i fear you see what that will be i would not like to say add he but i fear you must make up you mind for the worst now all this be overhear by annie who we may here seize the opportunity of say be in addition to be a sensitive creature one of those precocious little philosopher thinly spread in the female world and make what they be often by delicate health which reduce they to a habit of think much before they time not that she want the vivacity of she age but that it be temper by period of serious musing when all kind of what the scotch call auld farrant -lrb- far yont -rrb- thought come to be where they should not be the consequence be a weird-like kind of wisdom very like that of the age so the effect on a creature so constitute be just equal to the cause annie run out of the room with she face conceal in she hand and get into a small bedroom darken by the window-blind and there in a obscurity and solitude suit to she mind and feeling she resign herself to the grief of the young heart it be now clear to she that she dear mary be to be take from she have not the doctor say as much and then she have never see death of which she have read and hear and think so much that she look upon it as a thing altogether mysterious and terrible but have she not overhear she father say that he have insure poor dear mary 's life with the pelican and have she not hear of the pelican -- yea the pelican of the wilderness -- as a creature of a most mythical kind though she know not aught of its nature whether bird or beast or man or woman or angel but whatever it might be certain it be that she father would never have get this wonderful creature to insure mary 's life if it be not possess of the power to bring about so great a result so she cogitate and muse and philosophize in she small way till she come to the conclusion that the pelican not only have the destiny of mary in its hand but be under a obligation to save she from that death which be so terrible to she nor have she do yet with the all-important subject for all at once it come into she head as a faint memory that one day when she father be take she along with she mother through the city he point to a gilded sign with a large bird represent thereon tear its breast with its long beak and let out the blood to its young who be hold they mouth open to drink it in there say he be the pelican word she remember even to that hour for they be imprint upon she mind by the formidable appearance of the wonderful-looking creature feed its young with the very blood of its bosom but withal she have sense enough to know -- be as we have say a small philosopher -- that a mere bird however endowed with the power of sustain the life of its offspring could not save that of she sister and therefore it behove to be only the symbol of some power within the office over the door of which the say sign be suspend nor in all this be annie maconie more extravagant than be nineteen-twentieth of the thousand million in the world who still cling to occult cause and with those there come other equally strange thought but beyond all she could not for the very life of she comprehend that most inexcusable apathy of she father who though he have hear with he own ear from good authority that she beloved mary be lie in the next bedroom die never seem to think of hurry away to town -- even to that very pelican who have so generously undertake to insure mary 's life it be a apathy unbecome a father and the blood of she little heart warm with indignation at the very time that the say heart be down in sorrow as far as its loose string would enable it to go but be there no remedy to be sure there be and annie know moreover what it be but then it be to be get only by a sacrifice and that sacrifice she also know though it must of necessity be keep in the meantime as secret as the wonderful doings in the death-chamber of the palace of a certain bluebeard great thought these for so little a woman as annie maconie and no doubt the greatness and the weight of they be the cause why for all that day -- every hour of which she father be allow to pass -- she be more melancholy and thoughtful than she have ever be since mary begin to be ill but somehow there be a peculiar change which even she mother could observe in she for while she have be in the habit of weep for she sister yea and sob very piteously she be all this day apparently in a reverie nor even up to the time of she go to bed be she less thoughtful and abstracted even as if she have be engage in solve some problem great to she however small it might seem to grown-up infant as for sleep under the weight of so much responsibility it might seem to be out of the question and so verily it be for she little body act on by the big thought be move from one side to another all night so that she never sleep a wink still think and think in she unutterable grief of poor mary she father 's criminal passiveness and that most occult remedy which so completely engross she mind but certainly it be the light of morning for which sister annie sigh and when it come glint in at the small window she be up and begin to dress all the while listen lest the servant or any other one in the house should know she be up at that hour have complete she toilet she slip down stair and have get to the lobby she be provident enough to lay hold of a umbrella for she suspect the element as be in league against she thus equip she creep out by the back door and have get thus free she hurry along never look behind she till she come to the main road to edinburgh when she mount the umbrella -- one use by she father and so large that it be more like a main-sheet than a cover suitable to so small a personage so it behove that if she meet any other traveller on purpose bent the move body must have appear to be some small tent on its way to a fair carry by the proprietor thereof of whom no more could be see but the two short toddle leg and the hem of the black riding-hood but what care annie she toil along the mile be long in comparison of the short leg but then there be a large purpose in that little body in the view of which mile be of small account however long a time it might take those step to go over they nor be it any drawback to all this energy concentrate in so small a bulk that she have have no breakfast be the die sister mary able to take any breakfast and why should annie eat when mary who do all she do -- and she always do everything that sister mary do -- could not the argument be enough for we little logician by the time she reach by those short step of hers the great city it be half-past eleven and she have before she still a great deal to accomplish she make out after considerable wanderings the street signalize above all street by that wonderful bird but after she get into it the greater difficulty remain of find the figure itself whereto there be this untoward obstacle that it be still drizzle in the thick scotch way of concrete drop of mist and the umbrella which she hold over she head be so large that no turn it aside would enable she to see under the rim at such a angle as would permit she scanning so elevate a position and so there be nothing for it but to draw it down but even this be a task -- heavy as the mainsheet be with rain and rattle in a considerable wind -- almost beyond she strength and if it have not be that a kindly personage who see the little maid 's difficulty give she assistance she might not have be able to accomplish it and now with the heavy article in she hand she peer about for another half-hour till at length she gladdened eye fall upon the mystic symbol and no sooner have she make sure of the object than she find she way into the office ask the porter as well as a clerk where the pelican be to be find -- question that produce a smile but smile here or smile there annie be not to be beat nor do she stop in she progress until at last she be show into a room where she see perch on a high stool with three -lrb- of course -rrb- long leg a strange-looking personage with a curl wig and a pair of green spectacles who no doubt must be the pelican himself as she appear in the room with the umbrella not much shorter or less in circumference than herself the gentleman look curiously at she wonder no doubt what the errand of so strange a little customer could be well my little lady say he what may be you pleasure i want the pelican say annie the gentleman be still more astonished even to the extent that he lay down he pen and look at

be thus satisfied go away drag the main-sheet after she and have upon she face a look of contentment if not absolute happiness in place of the sorrow which have occupy it during all the time of she toilsome journey the same road be to be retrace and if she have a object before which nerve she little limb she have now the delightful consciousness of that object have be effect -- a feeling of inspiration which enable she hungry as she be to overcome all the toil of the return another two hour with that heavy umbrella over head as well as body bring she at length home where she find that people have be send out in various direction to find the miss annie the mother be in tear and the father in great anxiety and no sooner have she enter and lay down she burden than she be clasp to the bosom first of one parent and then of the other but where be the pelican say the anxious little maid the pelican my darling cry the mother what do you mean oh i have be to he at he own office at

truth we stranger story could have end here but alas we be oblige to pain the good reader 's heart by say that the demon who have leave the troubled little breast of mary maconie take possession of annie 's the very next day she lay extend on the bed panting under the fell embrace of the relentless foe as mary get better annie grow worse and she case be so far unlike mary 's that there be more a tendency to a fevered state of the brain the little sufferer watch with curious eye the anxious face of she parent and seem conscious that she be in a dangerous condition nor do it fail to occur to she as a great mystery as well as wonder why they do not send for the wonderful be who have so promptly save the life of she sister the thought haunt she yet she be afraid to mention it to she mother because it imply a sense of danger -- a fear which one evening she overcome fix she eye now every moment wax less clear on the face of she mother -- oh mother dear she whisper why do you not send for the pelican in other circumstance the mother would have smile but alas no smile could be see on that pale face whether the pelican be send for we know not but certain it be that he have no power to save poor annie and she die within the week but she do not die in vain for the large sum insure upon she life eventually come to mary whom she love so dearly the widow 's ae son we will not name the village where the actor in the follow incident reside and it be sufficient for we purpose to say that it lay in the county of berwick and within the jurisdiction of the presbytery of dunse eternity

the appoint hour arrive she be first at the kirk she heart feel too big for she bosom she could not sit -- she walk again to the air -- she tremble back -- she gaze restless on the pulpit the parish minister give out the psalm -- the book shake while she hold it the minister pray again give out a psalm and leave the pulpit the book fall from mr jeffrey 's hand a tall figure pace along the passage

they lead she to the door she gaze upon they with a look of vacancy -- thrice sorrowfully wave she hand in token that they should leave she for they word fall upon she heart like dew upon a furnace

my brethren he exclaim and smite he hand upon he forehead cry speak mother -- speak now and fall with he face upon the floor the child rush scream from the school and when the villager enter the troubled spirit have flee for ever the lawyer 's tale the story of mysie craig in detail the curious circumstance of the follow story i be again only report a real law case to be find in the court of session record the turning-point of which be as invisible to the judge as to the party themselves -- that be until the end come a circumstance again which make the case a kind of developed romance but as a end imply a beginning and the one be certainly as necessary as the other we request you to accompany we -- take care of you foot -- up the narrow spiral staircase of a tenement call corbet 's land in the same old town where so many wonderful thing in the complicated drama -- or dream if you be a marphurius -- of human life have occur up which spiral stair have get by the help of we hand almost as indispensable as that of the foot we find ourselves in a little human dovecot of two small room occupy by two person not unlike in many respects two dove -- widow craig and she daughter call may euphuize by the scotch into mysie the chief respects in which they might be liken without much stress to the harmless creature we have mention be they love for each other together with they total inoffensiveness as regard the outside world and we be delighted to say this for we see so many of the multitudinous side of human nature dark and depraved that we be apt to think there be no bright side at all nor shall we let slip the opportunity of say at the risk of be consider very simple that of all the gift of felicity bestow as the pagan homer tell upon mankind by the god no one be so perfect and beautiful as the love that exist between a good mother and a good daughter for so much we may be safe by have recourse to instinct which be deeper than any secondary cause we poor mortal can see but beyond this there be special reason tend to this same result of mutual affection which come more within the scope of we observation in explanation of which we may say that the mother have something in she power during she husband 's life have foresee the advantage of use it in the instruction of she quick and intelligent daughter in a art of far more importance then than now -- that of artistic needlework nay of so much importance be this beautiful art and to such perfection be it bring at a time when a lady 's petticoat embroider by the hand with its profuse imitation of natural object flower and bird and strange device would often cost twenty pound scot that a sight of one of those operose achievement of genius would make we blush for we time and the labor of we woman nor be the perfection in this ornamental industry a new thing for the daughter of the pictish king confine in the castle be adept in it neither be it leave altogether to pay sempstress for great lady spend they time in it and emulation quicken both the genius and the diligence so we need hardly say it become to the mother a thing to be proud of that she daughter mysie prove herself so apt a scholar that she become a adept and be soon know as one of the finest embroideress in the great city so too as a consequence it come to pass that great lady employ she and often the narrow spiral staircase of corbet 's land be brush on either side by the huge mass of quilted and emblazon silk that envelop the belle of the day be with difficulty force up to and down from the small room of the industrious mysie but we be now speak of art while we should have more to say -lrb- for it concern we more -rrb- of the character of the young woman who be destine to figure in a stranger way than in make beautiful figure on silk mysie be one of a class : few in number they be indeed but on that account more to be prize she taste and fine manipulation be but counterpart of quality of the heart -- a organ to which the pale face with its delicate line and the clear liquid eye be a suitable index the refinement which enable she to make she imitation of beautiful object on the delicate material of she work be only another form of a sensibility which pervade she whole nature -- that gift which be only concede to peculiar organization and be such a doubtful one too if we go as we can not help do with the poet when he sing that chord that vibrate sweetest pleasure often also thrill the deepest note of woe nay we might say that the creature themselves seem to fear the gift for they shrink from the touch of the rough world and retire within themselves as if to avoid it while they be only court its effect in the play of a imagination much too ardent for the duty of life and as a consequence how they seek secretly the support of stronger nature cling to they as do those strange plant call parasite which with they tender arm and something so like finger cling to the nearest stem of a stouter neighbor and embrace it even though hollow and rotten cover it and choke it with a flood of flower so true be it that woman like the generous vine life by be support and hold up yet equally true that the strength she gain be from the embrace she give and so it be also that goodness as we scottish poet home say often wound itself and affection prove the spring of sorrow all which might truly be apply to mysie craig but as yet the stronger stem to which she cling be she mother and it be not likely nor be it in reality that that affection would prove to she anything but the spring of happiness for it be ripen by love and the earnings of the nimble finger move often into the still hour of the night not only keep the wolf from the door but let in the lamb of domestic harmony and peace would that these thing have so continued but there be other wolf than those of poverty and the ae lamb o ' the fauld can not be always under the protection of the ewe and it so happen on a certain night not particularize in the calendar that we mysie have finish one of these floral petticoat on which she have be engage for many week go forth with she precious burden to deliver the same to its impatient owner no other than the then famous anabellum gilroy who reside in advocate 's close -- of which fine lady by the way we may say that of all the gay creature who parade between the twa bow no one display such ample fold of brocaded silk nod she pon-pon more jauntily or nap with a sharper crack she high-heeled shoe all to approve herself to the buck of the time with they square coat brocade with lace they three-cornered hat on the top of they bob-wig they knee-buckle and shoe-buckle and certainly not the least important of those both in he own estimation and that of the sprightly anabellum be george balgarnie a young man who have only a year before succeed to the property of balgruddery somewhere in the north and of whom we might say that in form he nature have take so much pain with the building up of the body that she have forget the mind so that he have no more spiritual matter in he than suffice to keep he blood hot and enable he sensual organ to work out they own selfish gratification or to perpetrate a metaphor he be all the polish mahogany of a piano without any more musical spring than might respond to one keynote of selfishness and surely anabellum have approve herself to the fop to some purpose for when we sempstress with she bundle have get into the parlor of the fine lady she encounter no other than balgarnie -- a circumstance apparently of very small importance but we know that a moment of time be sometimes like a small seed which contain the nucleus of a great tree -- perhaps a poisonous one and so it turn out that while anabellum be gloat over the beautiful work of the timid embroideress balgarnie be busy admire the artist but not merely -- perhaps not at all -- as a artist only as a object over whom he wish to exercise power this circumstance be not unobserved by the little embroideress but it be only observe to be shrink from in she own timid way and probably it would soon have pass from she mind if it have not be follow up by something more direct and dangerous and it be for no sooner have mysie get to the foot of the stair than she encounter balgarnie who have go out before she and now begin one of those romance in daily life of which the world be full and of which the world be sick balgarnie in short commence that kind of suit which be nearly as old as the serpent and therefore not to be wonder at neither be we to wonder that mysie listen to it because we have hear so much about lovely woman stoop to folly that we be content to put it to the large account of natural miracle and not very miraculous either when we remember that if the low-breathed accent of tenderness awaken the germ of love they awaken at the same time faith and trust and such be the beginning of the romance which be to go through the normal stage -- the appointment to meet again the meeting itself the other that follow the extension of the moonlight walk sometimes to the hunter 's bog between arthur 's seat and salisbury crag and sometimes to the song-famed well o ' weary -- all which be just as sun and shower to the germ of the plant the love grow and grow and the faith grow and grow also which see in he that which it feel in itself nay if any of those moonlight-loving elf that have leave they foot-mark in the fairy ring to be see near st anthony 's well have whisper in mysie 's ear balgarnie will never make you he wife she would have believe the word as readily as if they have impugn the sincerity of she own heart in short we have again the analog of the parasitic plant the very fragility and timidity of mysie be at once the cause and consequence of she confidence she would cling to he and cover he with the blossom of she affection nay if there be unsoundness in the stem these very blossom would cover the rottenness this change in the life of the little sempstress could not fail to produce some corresponding change at home we read smoothly the play we have act ourselves and so the mother read love in the daughter 's eye and hear it too in she long sigh nor do she fail to read the sign that the song which use to lighten she beautiful work be no longer hear for love to creature so form as mysie craig be too serious a affair for poetical warble but she say nothing for while she have faith in the good sense and virtue of she daughter she know also that there be forbearance due to one who be she support nor as yet have she reason to fear for mysie still ply she needle and the rose and the lily spring up in all they varied color out of the ground of the silk or satin as quickly and as beautifully as they be wont though the lily of she check wax paler as the day flit and why the latter should have be we must leave to the reader for ourselves only hazard the supposition that perhaps she already think that balgarnie should be set about to make she he wife -- a issue which behove to be the result of they intimacy sooner or later for that in she simple mind there should be any other issue be just about as impossible as that in the event of the world last as long the next moon would not at she proper time again shine in that green hollow between the lion 's head and samson 's rib which have so often be the scene of they happiness nay we might say that though a doubt on the subject have by any means get into she mind it would not have remain there longer than it take a shudder to scare the wild thing away of course all this be only a question of time but certain it be that by-and-by the mother could see some connection between mysie 's be more seldom out on those moonlight night than formerly and a greater paleness in she thin face as if the one have be the cause of the other but still she say nothing for she daily expect that mysie would herself break the subject to she and so she be leave only to increase fear that she daughter 's heart and affection have be tamper with and perhaps she have fear that go farther still so far as yet have go there be no remission in the labor of mysie 's finger as if in the midst of all -- whatever that all might be -- she recognize the paramount necessity of bring in by those finger the require and usual amount of the means of they livelihood nay somehow or other there be at that very time when she cheek be at the palest and she sigh be at they longest and she disinclination to speak be at the strongest a increase of work upon she for be not there a grand tunic to embroider for miss anabellum which be want on a give day and be there not other thing for miss anabellum 's friend miss allardice which be not to be delay beyond that same day and so she stitch and stitch on and on till sometimes the little lamp seem to go out for want of oil while the true cause of she diminish light be really the intrusion of the morning sun against which it have no chance it might be too that she very anxiety to get these grand dress finish help to keep out of she mind idea which could have do she small good even if they have get in but at length the eventful hour come when the gentle sempstress withdraw the shine needle make clear by long use from the last touch of the last rise and doubtless if mysie have not be under the cloud of sorrow we have mention she would have be happier at the termination of so long a labor than she have ever be for the finish evening have always be celebrate by a glass of strong edinburgh ale -- a drink which as both a liquor and a liqueur be as famous then as it be at this day but of what avail be this work-termination to she now be it not certain that she have not see balgarnie for two moon and though the impossibility of he not marry she be just as impossible as ever why be these two moon leave to shine in the green hollow and on the rise hill without the privilege of throw the shadow of mysie craig and george balgarnie on the grass where the fairy have leave the trace of they dance question these which she be unable to answer if it be not even that she be afraid to put they to herself then when be it that she feel herself unable to tie up she work in order to take it home and that she mother see the react effect of the prior sleepless night in she languid frame do this little duty for she even as while she be do it she look through she tear at she changed daughter but mysie would do so much while the mother should go to miss allardice mysie would proceed to miss anabellum and so it be arrange they go forth together parting at the nether bow and mysie in spite of a weakness which threaten to bring she with she burden to the ground struggle on to she destination at the top of advocate 's close she see a man hurry out and increase he step even as she eye rest on he and if it have not appear to she to be among the ultimate impossibility of thing natural as well as unnatural she would have swear that that man be george balgarnie but then it just so happen that mysie come to the conclusion that such a circumstance be among these ultimate impossibility this resolution be a effort which cost she more than the conviction would have do though doubtless she do not feel this at the time and so with a kind of forced step she mount the stair but when she get into the presence of miss gilroy she could scarcely pronounce the word -- i have bring you the dress ma'am and i be so delighted miss craig that i could almost take you into my arm say the lady but what ail ye dear you be as white as any snow i ever see whereas you ought to have be as blithe as a bridesmaid for do not you know that you have bring I home one of my marriage dress come now smile when i tell you that to-morrow be my wedding-day wedding-day muttered mysie as she think of the aforesaid utter impossibility of herself not be soon marry to george balgarnie a impossibility not render less impossible by the resolution she have form not to believe that within five minute he have fly away from she yes miss craig and surely you must have hear who the gentleman be for do not the town ring of it from the castle to the palace from kirk-o ' - field to the calton i have not be out say mysie that account for it continue the lady and i be delighted at the reason for would not it have be terrible to think that my marriage with george balgarnie of balgruddery be a thing of so small a note as not to be know everywhere if mysie craig have appear shortly before to miss gilroy paler than any snow she ladyship have ever see she must now have be as pale as some other kind of snow that nobody ever see the dreadful word have indeed produce the adequate effect but not in the most common way for we be to keep in view that it be not the most shrink and sensitive nature that be always the readiest to faint and there be besides the aforesaid conviction of impossibility which grasp the mind by a certain force deaden the ear to word imply the contrary mysie stand fix to the spot as if she be try to realize some certainty she dare not think be possible she lip apart she eye rivet on the face of the lady -- mute as that kind of picture which a certain ancient call a silent poem and motionless as a figure of marble a attitude and appearance still more inexplicable to anabellum perhaps irritating as a unlucky omen and therefore not possess any claim for sympathy -- at least it get none be you the mysie craig she cry as she look at the girl who use to chat to I about the dress you bring and the flower on they ah jealous and envious be that it but you forget george balgarnie never could have make _ you _ he wife -- a work needlewoman he only fancy you as the plaything of a hour he tell I so himself when i charge he with have be see in you company so mysie you may as well look cheerful you turn will come next with some one in you own station there be word which stimulate and confirm there be other that seem to kill the nerve and take away the sense nor can we ever tell the effect till we see it produce and so we could not have tell beforehand -- nay we would have look for something quite opposite -- that mysie shrinking and irritable as she be by nature be save from a faint -lrb- which have for some moment be threaten she -rrb- by the cruel insult which thus have be add to she misfortune she have even power to have recourse to that strange device of some nature that of affect to be not affect and cast a glance at the fine lady she turn and go away without utter a single word but who know the pain of the conventional concealment of pain except those who have experience the agony of the trial even at the moment when she hear that george balgarnie be to be marry and that she come to know that she have be for week sew the marriage dress of he bride she be carry under she heart the living burden which be the fruit of she love for that man yet not the burden of shame and dishonor as we story will show for she be justify by the law of she country -- yea by certain word once write by a apostle to the corinthian all which may as yet appear a great mystery but as regard mysie craig 's agony as she stagger down miss gilroy 's stair on she way home there could be no doubt or mystery whatever nor when she get home be there any comfort there for the daughter who have be so undutiful as to depart from she mother 's precept and conceal from she not only she unfortunate connection with a villain but the condition into which that connection have bring she but she be at least save from the pain of a part of the confession for she mother have learn enough from miss allardice to satisfy she as to the cause of she daughter 's change from the happy creature she once be singing in the long night as she work unremittingly at she beautiful work and the poor sigh pale heart-broken thing she have be for month nor do she fail to see with the quick eye of a mother that as mysie immediately on enter the house lay herself quietly on the bed and sob in she great agony she have learn the terrible truth from miss gilroy that the robe she have embroider be to deck the bride of she destroyer moreover she discretion enable she to perceive that this be not the time for explanation for the hour of grief be sacred and the heart must be leave to do its work by open the issue of nature 's assuagement or cease to beat so the night pass without question or answer and the follow day that of the marriage be one of silence even as if death have touch the tongue that use to be the medium of cheerful word and tender sympathy -- a strange contrast to the joy if not revelry in advocate 's close it be not till after several day have pass that mysie be able as she still lay in bed to whisper amidst the recur sob in the ear of she mother as the latter bent over she the real circumstance of she condition and still amidst the tremble word come the vindication that she consider herself to be as much the wife of george balgarnie as if they have be join by holy kirk a statement which the mother could not understand if it be not to she a mystery render even more mysterious by a reference which mysie make to the law of the country as she have hear the same from she cousin george davidson a writer 's clerk in the lawnmarket much of which as it come in broken syllable from the lip of the disconsolate daughter the mother put to the account of the fond dream of a mind put out of joint by the worst form of misery incident to young woman but what avail explanation mystery or no mystery where the fact be patent that mysie craig lay there the poor heartbroken victim of man 's perfidy -- she power of industry broken and useless -- the fine weave genius of she fancy whereby she work she embroidered device to deck and adorn beauty only engage now on portray all the evil of she future life and above all be she not soon to become a mother meanwhile and in the midst of all this misery the laid-up earnings of mysie 's industry wear away where there be no work by those cunning finger now thin and emaciated and before the day pass and the critical day come whereon another burden would be impose on the household there be need for the sympathy of neighbor in that form which soon wear out -- pecuniary help that critical day at length come mysie craig give birth to a boy and they necessity from that hour grow in quicker and greater proportion than the generosity of friend there behove something to be do and that without delay so when mysie lay asleep with the innocent evidence of she misfortune by she side mr craig put on she red plaid and go forth on a mother 's duty and be soon in the presence of george balgarnie and he young wife she be under a impulse which make light of delicate conventionality and do not think it necessary to give the lady a opportunity of be absent : nay she rather would have she to be present for be she who have be so far privy to the intercourse between she husband and mysie to be exempt from the consequence which she in a sense might have be say to have bring about ye have ruin mysie craig sir cry at once the rouse mother ye have ta'en awa she honor ye have ta'en awa she health ye have ta'en awa she bread ay and ye have reduce three human creature to want it may be starvation and i have come here in sair sorrow and necessity to ask when and whaur be to be the remeid when and where you may find it woman say the lady as she cast a side-glance to she husband probably by way of appeal for the truth of what she think it right to say mr balgarnie never injure you daughter let he who do the deed yield the remeid and do you stand by this say mr craig but the husband have be already claim as free from blame by he wife who keep she eye fix upon he and the obligation to conscience say by sceptic to be a offspring of society be sometimes weaker than what be due to a wife in the estimation of whom a man may wish to stand in a certain degree of elevation you must seek another father to the child of you daughter say he lightly and not content with the denial he supplement it by a laugh as he add when bird go to the greenwood they must take the chance of meet the goshawk and that be you answer say she it be and you need never trouble either my wife or I more on this subject be the reply then may the vengeance o ' the god of justice light on the head o ' baith o ' ye add mr craig as she go hurriedly away nor be she threat intend as a empty one for she hold on she way direct to the lawnmarket where she find george davidson to whom she relate as much as she have be able to get out of mysie and also what have pass at the interview with balgarnie and he lady after hearing which the young writer shake he head you will get a trifle of aliment say he perhaps half-a-crown a week but no more and mysie could have make that in a day by she beautiful work and she will never work mair say the mother with a sigh for a hundred year rejoin he more to himself than to she and probably in congratulation of himself for he perspicacity and since ever there be a college of justice there never be a case where a man pull up on oath for a promise of marriage admit the fact it be a good scotch law only we want a people to obey it but what he add again if we be to try it though it be only as a grim joke and a revenge in so sad and terrible a case as that of poor mysie craig word which the mother understand no more than she do law latin and so she be send away as sorrowful as she have come for davidson do not want to raise hope which there be no chance of be fulfil but he know as a scotchman that a man who trust himself to a strae rape in the hope of its breaking may possibly hang himself and so it happen that the very next day a summons be serve upon george balgarnie to have it find and declare by the lord of session that he have promise to marry mysie craig whereupon a child have be bear by she or in fault of that he be bind to sustain the say child thereupon without the ordinary law 's delay certain proceedings go on in the course of which mysie herself be examine as the mother to afford what the lawyer call a _ semiplena probatio _ or half proof to be supplement otherwise and thereafter george balgarnie stand before the August fifteen he deny stoutly all intercourse with mysie except a occasional walk in the hunter 's bog and this he would have deny also but he know that he have be see and that it would be swear to by other and then come the last question which mr greerson mysie 's advocate put in utter hopelessness nay so futile do it seem to try to catch a scotchman by advise he to put he head in a noose on the pretence of see how it fit he neck that he smile even as the word come out of he mouth -- do you ever promise to marry mysie craig be prudence the chief of the four cardinal virtue ever yet consistent with vice balgarnie wax clever -- a dangerous trick in a witness he stroke he beard with a smile on he face and answer -- _ yes once -- when i be drunk _ word which be immediately follow by the crack of a single word in the dry mouth of one of the advocate -- the word nick and nick he be for the preside judge address the witness say -- the drunkenness may be good enough in its own way sir but it do not take away the effect of you promise nay it be even a aggravation insomuch as have enjoy the drink you want to enjoy with impunity what you could make of the promise also if balgarnie have be a reader he might have remember waller 's verse -- that eagle 's fate and mine be one which on the shaft that make he die espy a feather of he own wherewith he wont to soar so high so mysie gain she plea and the marriage with anabellum for whom she have embroider the marriage gown be dissolve how matter progress afterwards for a time we know not but the scotch know that there be wisdom in make the best of a bad bargain and in this case it be a good one for as the lady of balgruddery mysie craig do no dishonor to george balgarnie who moreover find she a faithful wife and a good mother to the child that come of this strange marriage the twin brother william sim be the son of a feuar in the southern part of dumfriesshire who by dint of frugality have hoard together from three to four hundred pound this sum he be resolve to employ in set up he son in business and in pursuance of this resolution at the age of fourteen william be bind as a apprentice to a wealthy old grocer in carlisle and it be he fortune in a few month to ingratiate himself into the favor and confidence of he master the grocer have a daughter who though not remarkable for the beauty of she face or the elegance of she person have nevertheless a agreeable countenance and ten thousand independent charm to render it more agreeable she be some eighteen month older than william and when he first come to be a apprentice with she father and a boarder in he house she look upon he as quite a boy while she consider herself to be a full-grown woman he be indeed a mere boy -- and a clownish-looking boy too he wear a black leathern cap edge and cord with red which he mother call a _ bendy _ a coarse gray jacket a waistcoat of the same and he trousers be of a brownish-green cord term _ thickset _ he shoe be of the double-soled description which ought more properly to be call brogue and into they on the evening previous to he departure he father have drive tacket and sparable innumerable until they become like a plate of iron or a piece of warlike workmanship resemble the scale cuirass of a mail knight in the olden time for say he the callant will hae runnin ' about on the causeway and plainstane o ' carlisle sufficient to drive a ' the shoon in the world aff he foot when therefore william sim make he debut behind the counter of mr carnaby the rich grocer of carlisle and as he run on a message through the street with he bendy cap gray jacket thickset trousers and ironed shoe striking fire behind he as he run and make a noise like a troop of cavalry the sprucer youngster of the city say he be new catch but william sim have not be two year in carlisle when he begin to show he shirt collar he clatter brogue give place to silent pump he leathern bendy to a fashionable hat and he coarse gray jacket to a coat with tail moreover he begin to bow and smile to the lady when they enter the shop he also become quite a connoisseur in tea and confection he recommend they to they and he bow and smile again as they leave such be the work of less than two year and before three go round there be not a smarter or a better dress youth in all carlisle than william sim he become a favorite subject of conversation amongst the young belle and there be not one of they who if disengage would have say to he get thee behind I miss carnaby hear the conversation of she young companion and she gradually become conscious that william be not a boy in fact she begin to wonder how she have ever think so for he as she say unto herself be certainly a very interesting _ young man _ within other four year and before the period of he apprenticeship have expire william begin to repeat poetry -- some say to write it but that be not the fact he only twist or alter a few word now and then to suit the occasion and almost every line end with word of such soft sound as bliss kiss -- love dive -- joy cloy and other equally sweet the delightful meaning of which be only to be meet with in the sentimental glossary he now give miss carnaby he arm to church and on leave it in the afternoon they often walk into the field together on such occasion talk of various kind deceive the road and even when they be silent they silence have a eloquence of its own one day they have wander farther than they wont and they stand on the little bridge where the two kingdom meet about half a mile below gretna i know not what soft persuasion he employ but she accompany he up the hill which leadeth through the village of springfield and they go towards the far-famed green together in less than a hour miss carnaby that be return towards carlisle as mr sim lean affectionately on she husband 's arm when the old grocer hear of what have take place he be exceedingly wroth and although as have be say william stand high in he favor he thus address he -- ay ay sir -- fine doings this come of you Sunday walking and i suppose you say that my daughter be yours -- that she be you wife and _ she _ may be _ yours _ -- but i 'll let you know sir my _ money _ be _ mine _ and i 'll cut you both off you sha not have a sixpence i 'll rather build a church sir i 'll give it towards pay off the national debt you rascal you would steal my daughter -- eh thus speak mr carnaby in he wrath but when the effervescence of he indignation have subside he extend to both the hand of forgiveness and resign he business in favor of he son-in-law mr william sim therefore begin the world under the most favourable circumstance he find a fortune prepare to he hand he have only to improve it in a few year the old grocer die and he bequeath to they the gain of half a century for twenty year mr sim continue in business and he have nearly double the fortune which he obtain with he wife mr sim be a kind-hearted woman but by nature or through education she have also a considerable portion of vanity and she begin to think that it be the duty of she opulent husband to retire from business and assume the character of a independent gentleman or rather i ought to say of a country gentleman -- a squire she profess to be the more anxious that he should do this on account of the health of she daughter -- the sole survivor of five child -- and who be then enter upon womanhood marium sim -lrb- for such be they daughter 's name -rrb- be a delicate and accomplished girl of seventeen the lovely hue that dwell upon she cheek like the blush of a rainbow be a emblem of beauty not of health at the solicitation of she mother she father give up he business and purchase a neat villa and a few acre that surround it in the neighborhood of windermere the house lay in the bosom of poetry and the wind that shout like a triumphant army through the mountain glen or in gentle zephyr sigh upon the lake and gambol with the ripple make music around it the change the beauty i have almost say the deliciousness of they place of abode have effect a wondrous improvement in the health of marium yet she mother be not happy she be not treat by she neighbor with the obsequious reverence which she believe to be due to person possess of twenty thousand pound the fashionable lady in the neighborhood also call she a mean person -- a nobody -- a upstart of yesterday in truth there be not a few who so speak because they envy the wealth of the sim and be resolve to humble they a opportunity for they to do so soon occur a subscription ball or assembly patronize by all the fashionable in the district be to take place at keswick mr sim in some measure from a desire of display and also as she say to bring out marium put down she husband 's name she own and they daughter 's on the list many of the personage above refer to on see the name of the sim family on the subscription paper turn upon they heel and exclaim -- shocking but the important evening arrive mr sim have order a superb dress from london expressly for the occasion a duchess might have worn it at a drawing-room the dress of marium be simplicity typify and consist of a frock of the finest and the whitest muslin while she slender waist be girdle with a lavender ribbon she raven hair descend down she snowy neck in ringlet and around she head she wear a wreath of rose when mr sim with he wife and daughter enter the room there be a stare of wonderment amongst the company no one speak to they no one bow to they the spirit of dumbness seem to have smite the assembly but a general whispering like the hissing of a congregation of adder succeed the silence then at the head of the room the voice of woman rise sharp angry and loud six or eight who appear as the representative of the company be in earnest and excited conversation with the steward and the word -- low people -- vulgar -- not to be bear -- cheese faugh -- impertinence -- must be humble -- become audible throughout the room one of the steward a mr morri of morris house approach mr sim and say -- you sir be mr sim i believe

marium become blind the hundred different head-dress seem to float around she she cling to she father 's arm for support she mother be in a agony of indignation sir say mr sim i do not know what you call _ gentleman _ but if it be not _ genteel _ to have sell tea and grocery it be at least more _ honorable _ than to use they and never pay for they you will remember sir there be a considerable sum standing against you in my book and if the money be not pay to I tonight you shall have less space to dance in before morning insolent barbarian exclaim squire morris stamp he foot upon the floor mr sim scream marium 's head fall upon she father 's shoulder a dozen gentleman approach to the support of the steward and one of they wave he hand and address mr sim say away sir the retired merchant bow and withdraw not in confusion but with a smile of malignant triumph he strive to soothe he wife -- for he daughter when relieve from the presence of the disdainful eye that gaze on she bear the insult that have be offer they meekly -- and after remain a hour in keswick they return to they villa in the same chaise in which they have arrive in the assembly room the dance begin and fairy form glide through the floor lightly silently as a fall blossom embraceth the earth mr morri be lead down a dance when a noise be hear at the door some person insist on be admit and the door-keeper resist he but the intruder carry with he a small staff on the one end of which be a brass crown and on its side the letter g r it be a talisman potent as the wand of a magician the doorkeeper become

gnash he tooth together but without speak accompany the officer that have arrest he in the room he remain in custody in a adjoining inn throughout the night on the follow day be release on bail and within a week he solicitor pay the debt by augment the mortgage on morri house estate it be hardly necessary to say -- for such be human nature -- that after this incident the hatred between mr sim and squire morri become inveterate and the wife of both and the daughter of the latter partook in the relentless animosity two year pass and every day the mutual hatred and contempt in which they hold each other increase at that period a younger son of squire morri who be a lieutenant in the service of the east indium company obtain leave to visit england and he friend it be early in June the swallow chase each other in sport twitter as they fly over the blue bosom of windermere every bush every tree -- yea it seem as if every branch send forth the music of singing bird and the very air be redolent with melody from the bold song of the thrush and the lark to the love-note of the wood-pigeon and even the earth rejoice in the chirp of the grasshopper its tiny but pleasant musician the field and the leaf be in the loveliness and freshness of youth luxuriate in the sunbeam in the depth of they summer green and the butterfly sport and the bee pursue its errand from flower to flower the mighty mountain circle the scene and throw they dun shadow on the lake where a hundred fathom deep they seem a bronzed and inverted world at this time marium sim be sail upon the lake in a small boat that she father have purchase for she and which be guide by a boy a sudden but not what could be call a strong breeze come away the boy have little strength and less skill and from he awkwardness in shift the sail he cause the boat to upset marium be immerse in the lake the boy cling to the boat but terror deprive he of ability to render she assistance she struggle with the water and she garment bear she partially up for a time a boat in which be a young gentleman have be sail to and fro and at the time the accident occur be within three hundred yard of she on hear she sudden cry and the continue scream of the boy he draw in he sail and take the oar at he utmost strength pull to she assistance almost at every third stroke he turn round he head to see the progress he have make or if he have yet reach she twice he behold she disappear beneath the water -- a third time she rise to the surface -- he be within a few yard of she he spring from he boat she be again sink he dive after she he raise she beneath he arm and succeed in place she in he boat he also rescue the boy and convey they both to land marium though for a time speechless be speedily through the exertion of she deliverer restore to consciousness even before she be capable of thank he or of speak to he -- yea before she eye have open to meet he -- he have gaze with admiration on she beautiful feature which be lovely though the shadow of death be then over they almost its hand upon they in truth he have never gaze upon a fairer face and when she speak he have never listen to a sweeter or a gentler voice he have be beneath a indian sun where the impulse of the heart be fervid as the clime and where when the sun be gaze upon its influence be acknowledged but have she be less beautiful than she be and she feature less lovely to look upon there be a strong something in the very manner and accident of they be bring into each other 's society which appeal more powerfully to the heart than beauty could it at least beget a interest in the fate of each other and a interest so call be never very widely separate from affection the individual who have save marium 's life be lieutenant morri he convey she first to a peasant 's cottage and afterwards to she father 's villa he know nothing of the feeling of hatred that exist between they family and when mr sim hear he name though for a moment it cause a glow to pass over he face every other emotion be speedily swallow up in gratitude towards the deliverer of he child and when marium be sufficiently recover to thank he though she know he to be the son of she father 's enemy it be with tear too deep for word -- tear that tell what eloquence would have fail to express even mr sim for the time forget she hatred of the parent in she obligation to the son when however the young lieutenant return to morri house and make mention of the adventure in which he have be engage and speak at the same time in the ardor of youthful admiration of the beauty and gentleness of the fair be he have rescue from untimely death the cheek of he sister become pale they eyeball distend as if with horror the word wretch escape from he mother 's lip and she seem struggle with smother rage he turn towards he father for a explanation of the change that have so suddenly come over the behavior of he mother and sister son say the squire i have rather thou hadst perish than that a son of mine should have put forth he hand to assist a dog of the man whose daughter thou hast save on be make acquaint with the cause of the detestation that exist between the two family lieutenant morri in some degree yield to the whispering of wounded pride and begin to regret that he have enter the house of a man who have offer a indignity to he father that be not to be forgive but he think also of the beauty of marium of the sweetness of she smile and of the tear of voiceless gratitude which he have see bedimm the lustre of she bright eye he have promise to call again at she father 's on the day after the accident and with a ardent kindliness mr sim have welcome he to do so but he go forth he wander by the side of the lake he approach within sight of the house there be a contention of strange feeling in he breast and he return without pay he promise visit nevertheless thought of marium haunt he and she image mingle with all he fancy she become as a spirit in he memory that he could not expel and that he would not if he could three week pass on -- it be evening -- the sun be sink behind the mountain and lieutenant morri be wander through a wooded vale towards mr sim 's mansion for though he enter it not he nightly draw towards it as if instinctively wander around it and gaze on its window as he do so marvelling as he gaze he be absorb in one of those dreamy reverie in which man saunter speak and muse unconsciously when in follow the winding of a footpath which lead through a thicket he suddenly find himself in the presence of a young lady who be walk slowly across the wood with a book in she hand they eye meet -- they startle -- the book drop by she side -- it be marium i must not however dwell longer on this part of the subject for the story of the twin brother be yet to begin let it be sufficient to say that william or as i have hitherto call he lieutenant morri and marium whom he save become attach to each other they disposition be similar they seem form for each other affection take deep root in they heart and to root up that affection in the breast of either be to destroy the heart itself he make know he attachment towards marium to he father and gall pride and hatred to those who have injure he be stronger in the breast of the old squire than the small still voice of affection he spurn he son from he and order he to leave he house for ever the parent of marium notwithstanding they first feeling of gratitude towards the savior of they daughter be equally averse to a union between they but with marium the impulse of the heart and the lover 's passionate prayer prevail over she parent ' frown they be wed they become all to each other and be disown by those who give they birth when lieutenant morri left indium he obtain permission to remain in england for three year and it be about twelve month after he arrival that the marriage between he and marium take place he have still two year to spend in he native land and he hire a secluded and neat cottage on the bank of the annan for that period for the residence of himself and he young and beautiful wife twelve month after they marriage marium become the mother of twin -- the twin brother of we tale but three month have not pass nor have she infant raise they first smile towards they mother 's face when the sterile hand of death touch the bosom that supply they with life the young husband weep by the bed of death with the hand of she he love in he william say the gentle marium -- and they be she die word for she speak not again -- my eye will not behold another sun i must leave you love oh my husband i must leave we poor we helpless infant it be hard to die thus but when i be go dearest -- when my babe have no mother -- oh go to _ my mother _ and tell she -- tell she william -- that it be the die request of she marium that she would be as a mother to they farewell love -- farewell if -- emotion and the struggling of death overpower she -- she speech fail -- she eye become fix -- she soul pass away and the husband sit in stupefaction and in agony hold the hand of he dead wife to he breast he become conscious that she stir not -- that she breathe not -- oh that she be not and the wail of the distract widower ring suddenly and wildly through the cottage startling he infant from they slumber and as some who stand round the bed say cause even the feature of the dead to move as though the depart spirit have linger cast a farewell glance upon the body and pass over it again as the voice it have love to hear rise loud in agony the father of marium come and attend she body to its last long resting-place but he do no more and he leave the churchyard without acknowledge that he perceive he grief-stricken son-in-law in a few month it be necessary for lieutenant morri to return to indium and he could not take he motherless and tender infant thither he write to the parent of he depart marium he tell they of she last request breathe by she last word he implore they as they have once love she during he absence to protect he child but the hatred between mr sim and squire morri have in no degree abate the former would have listen to he daughter 's prayer and take she twin and the nurse into he house but he wife be less susceptible to the influence of natural feeling and even while at interval she weep for poor marium she say -- take both of they indeed no no i love we poor thoughtless disobedient marium mr sim as well as you do but i will not submit to the morrise they have nothing to give the child we have but they have the same they have a greater right to provide for they than we have they shall take one of they or none of they come into this house and again she break into lamentation over the memory of marium and in the midst of she mourning exclaim -- but the child that we take shall never be call morris mr sim write a answer to he son-in-law as cold and formal as if it have be a note add to a invoice colder indeed for it have no equivalent to the poor hackneyed phrase in all such of _ esteem favor _ in it he state that he would bring up one of the child provide that squire morri would undertake the charge of the other the unhappy father clasp he hand together on peruse the letter and exclaim -- must my poor babe be part -- shall they be bring up to hate each other oh maria would that i have die with you and we child also to take they to india with he where a war be threaten be impossible and he heart revolt from the thought of leave they in this country with stranger at time he be see with a infant son on each arm sit over the stone upon the grave of they mother which he have rear to she memory kiss they cheek and weep over they while they smile in he face unconsciously and offer to he in those smile affection 's first innocent tribute on such occasion they nurse stand gaze on the scene wonder at she master 's grief morri of morris house reluctantly consent to take one of he grandchild under he care but at the same time he refuse to see he son previous to he departure the widow father weep over he twin son and invoke a blessing on they see they little arm sunder and each convey to the house of those who have undertake to be they protector while he again proceed towards indium the name of the twin son be george and charle : the former be commit to the care of mr morri the other to mr sim yet it seem as if these innocent pledge of a family union instead of destroy strengthen the deep-rooted animosity that exist between they not a month pass that they do not in some way manifest they hatred of and they persecution towards each other the squire exhibit a proof of he vindictiveness in not permit the child of he son to remain beneath he roof he have a small property in devonshire which be rent by a individual who with he wife have be servant under he father to they george morris one of the infant son of poor marium before he be yet twelve month old be send with a injunction that he should be bring up as they own son that he should be teach to consider himself as such and bear they name the boy charle whose lot

lieutenant turn round and in the captive who call to he for assistance he recognize the devonshire wrestler -- the strange portrait of himself and even now if it be possible the resemblance between they be more striking than before for in the stranger the awkwardness of the peasant have give place to the smartness of the soldier charle have feel a interest in he from the first moment he behold he he have wish to meet he again and have resolve to seek for he should he return to england and now the interest that he have before feel for he be increase tenfold the offence and the fate of the doomed one be soon tell the lieutenant pledge himself that he would leave no effort untried to save he and he redeem he pledge he discover he obtain proof that the condemn prisoner george prescot have be employ on severe and dangerous duty against which it be impossible for nature longer to stand up but in all of which he have conduct himself as a good a brave and a faithful soldier and more that it could not be prove that he be actually find asleep at he post but that he be stupify through excess of fatigue he hasten to lay the evidence he have obtain respect the conduct and innocence of the prisoner before he royal highness who whatever be he fault be at least the soldier 's friend the duke glance over the document which the lieutenant lay before he he listen to the evidence of the comrade of the prisoner he take a pen he write a few line he place they in the hand of lieutenant sim they contain the free pardon of private prescot charle rush with the pardon in he hand to the prisoner he exclaim -- take this -- you be pardon -- you be free the soldier would have embrace he knee to thank he but the lieutenant say -- no kneel not to I -- consider I as a brother i have merely

write a mystery on we face which we need to have explain when this campaign be over we shall inquire concern it farewell for the present but we must meet again the feeling of the reprieve and unlettered soldier be too strong for he word to utter he shake the hand of he deliverer and weep a few day after this some sharp fighting take place the loss of the british be considerable and they be

wound and in they retreat be leave upon the field tear gush into the eye of the lieutenant when he hear the tiding he singular meeting with the stranger in devonshire they mysterious resemblance to each other he meeting he again in holland under circumstance yet more singular he save he life and the dubious knowledge which each have respect they birth and parentage -- all have sink deep into he heart and thought of these thing chase sleep from he pillow it be but a short time after this that the regiment of lieutenant sim be order to indium and he accompany it and it be only a few month after he arrival when the governor-general give a entertainment at he palace at which all the military officer around be present at table opposite to lieutenant sim sit a man of middle age and throughout the evening he eye remain fix upon he and occasionally seem fill with tear he be a colonel in the company 's service and a man who by the force of merit have acquire wealth and reputation i crave you pardon sir say he address the lieutenant but if i be not too bold a few word with you in private would confer a favor upon I and if my conjecture be right will give we both cause to rejoice you may command I sir say the youth the colonel rise from the table and leave the room and the lieutenant rise also and accompany he they enter a adjoining apartment the elder soldier gaze anxiously on the face of the younger and again address he say -- sir do not attribute this strange behavior upon my part to rudeness it have be prompt by feeling painfully deeply i may add tenderly interesting to I it may be accident but you feature bring memory before my eye that have become a part of my soul 's existence nor be it you feature only but i have observe that there be the mark of a rose-bud beneath you chin i remember twin on whom that mark be manifest and the likeness of a countenance be grave upon my heart the lineament of which be as yours be forgive I then sir in thus abruptly request you name the lieutenant look surprised at the anxiety and look of the stranger and he answer -- my name be charle sim yes yes reply the colonel gasp as he speak i see it i feel it you name be charle but not sim that be you mother 's name -- you sainted mother 's you bear it from you grandfather you come from cumberland i do be the reply in accent of astonishment my son my son -- child of my marium be the accent that break from the colonel as he fall upon the neck of the other my father exclaim charle have i then find a father and the tear stream down he cheek many question be ask many answer and amongst other the father inquire -- where be you brother -- my little george do he live you be the miniature of you mother and so strikingly do you resemble each other that while you be infant it be necessary to tie a blue ribbon round he arm and a green one round yours to distinguish you from each other charle become pale he knee shake he hand tremble then i _ have _ a brother he cry you have reply he father but wherefore do you say you _ have _ a brother be it possible that you do not know he he have be bring up with my father -- mr morri of morris house no he have not reply

dare to oppose he i be sting for the honor of cumberland i be loath to see the hero carry he laurel so easily from the field i accoutred myself in the wrestler 's garb i enter the ring the shouting of the multitude cease instantaneously i gaze upon my antagonist he gaze upon I we hand fall we both shake we be the image of each other three year afterwards i be in holland a soldier be unjustly condemn to die i save he i obtain he pardon he be my strange counterpart whom i meet in devonshire he have the mark of the rose-bud beneath he chin that i have and which you say my brother have and where be he now eagerly inquire the colonel alas i know not answer charle nor do i think he live three day after i have rescue he from unmerited death i learn that he have fall bravely on the field and whether he be now a prisoner or with the dead i can not tell surely it be thy brother say the colonel yet how he should be in devonshire or a soldier in the rank puzzle I to think no no charle it can not be it be a coincidence heighten by imagination you grandfather have not be kind to I but he be not capable of the cruelty which the tale you have tell would imply he have exercise towards the child i entrust to he care he hate I but surely he could not be cruel to my offspring you know morris house he add i know it well reply charle but i never know in it one who could be my brother nor

say the colonel my soul be fill with word which i can not utter i weep for you angel-mother i weep for my son you brother and i mourn for the unceasing hatred that exist between you grandsire but charle we must return to england we must do so instantly i have now fortune enough for you and for you brother also if he yet live and if we can find he but we must inquire after and go in quest of he within three month charle morri or lieutenant sim as he have hitherto be call and he father return to england together but instead of follow they i shall return to george prescot the prize-wrestler and the condemn and pardon soldier it have be mention that he be wound and leave upon the field by a retreat army i have to add that he be make prisoner and when he wound be heal he be though not perceptibly disabled for active service amongst he brethren in captivity be a captain paling who when a exchange of prisoner take place hasten to join he regiment and give george who be deem unfit for service a letter to he mother and sister who reside in dartmouth the letter be all that the captain could give he for he be penniless as george be himself george prescot feeling himself once more at liberty take he passage from rotterdam in a sloop bind for dartmouth and with only the letter of captain paling in he pocket to pay for he conveyance he perceive that the skipper frequently cast suspicious glance towards he as though he be about to ask where be you money sir but george see this and he bear it down with a high hand he know that the certain way of be treat with the contempt and neglect which poverty always introduce in its train be to plead be poor he be by no means learn but he understand something of human nature and he know a good deal of the way of man -- of the shallowness of society and the depths of civility he therefore carry he head high he call for the best that the ship could afford and he fare as the skipper do though he partake but sparingly but the vessel arrive in dartmouth harbor it enter the mouth of the romantic river on the one side of which be the fort still bear the name of cromwell and on the other kingsbridge which peter pindar have celebrate while on both side as precipitous bank rise tower hill they summit cover by a stunt furze and the bloom orchard meeting it midway some rather unpleasant sensation visit the disabled soldier as the vessel sail up the river towards the town the beauty of its situation make no impression upon he for he have see it a thousand time and it be perhaps as well that it do not for to look on it from the river or from a distant height -- like a long line of house hang on the breast of romance -- and afterwards to enter it and find yourself in the midst of a narrow dingy street where scarce two wheelbarrow could pass produceth only disappointment and that too of the bitterest kind it seem indeed that the devonian have concede so much of they beautiful county to the barrenness of dartmoor that they grudge every inch that be occupy as a street or highway ere this time george prescot have in a great measure drop he devonshire dialect and now take the letter of captain paling from he pocket he place it in the hand of the commander of the packet say send you boy ashore with this to a widow lady 's of the name of pale you will know she family i suppose you may tell the boy to say that the letter be from she son captain paling and that i shall wait here until i receive she answer before proceed up the river the skipper state that he know mr pale well who be a most respectable lady and that he remember also she son who be a officer in the army and who for some time have be a prisoner of war the boy go on shore with the letter and within a quarter of a hour return have with he a young gentleman accompany by a couple of pointer dog the stranger be the brother of captain paling he inquire for george prescot and on see he invite he to he mother 's house the skipper on see he passenger in such respectable company let fall no hint that the passage-money be not pay and the soldier and the brother of captain paling go on shore together in he letter the captain dwelt on many kindness which he have receive from its bearer and of the bravery which he have see he evince on the field inform they also that he pocket would be but ill provide with cash and regret he own inability to replenish they the kindness of mr pale and she family towards he know no limit she ask he a hundred question respect she son she daughter concern they brother and they imagine want for he that they might show he a kindness now however twelve mile be all that lay between he and he home they entreat he to remain until next day but he refuse for be it ever so humble there be no place like home it be true he could hardly give the name of home to the house of those whom he call he parent for it have ever be to he the habitation of oppressor yet it be he home as the mountain cover with eternal snow be the home of the greenlander and he know no other the usual road to it be by cross the dart at a ferry about a hundred yard above the house of mr pale any other road cause a circuit of many mile if you will not remain with we to-night say the brother of captain paling who have conduct he from the vessel to he mother 's house i shall accompany you to the ferry no i thank you -- i thank you say george confusedly there be no occasion for it -- none whatever i shall not forget you kindness he do not intend to go by the ferry for though the charge of the boatman be but a halfpenny that halfpenny he have not in he possession and he wish to conceal he poverty but woman have sharp eye in these matter they see where man be blind and a sister of captain paling name caroline read the meaning of they guest 's confusion and of he refuse to permit she brother to accompany he to the shore and with a delicacy which speak to the heart of he to whom the word be address she say -- mr prescot you have only now arrive from the continent and it be most likely that you have no small change in you pocket the ferryman be unreasonable people to deal with if you give they a crown they will row away and thank you forget to return the change the regular charge be but a halfpenny therefore you have better take copper with you and as she speak she hold a halfpenny in she finger towards he well well stammer out george with he hand in he pocket i believe i have no copper and he accept the halfpenny from the hand of caroline paling and while he do so he could not conceal the tear that rise to he eye but trifling as the amount of she offer be it must be understand that the person to whom it be tender be one who would not have accept more -- who be ashamed of he poverty and strove to conceal it and there be a soul there be a delicacy in she manner of tender it which i can speak of but not describe it save he also from have to wander weary and solitary mile at midnight no sooner have the disabled soldier cross the river and enter the narrow lane overshadow by dark hedge of hazel than he burst into tear and he first word be caroline i will remember thee it be near midnight when he approach the house which he call he home the inmate be asleep he tap at the window the pane of which be frame in lead after the form of diamond who be there cry a angry voice you son you son he reply george zon repeat the voice we have no zon if it be thee go to coomberland lad we have nought to do with thee thy old grandfather zquire morri be now dead and he ha 'n' t pay we so well for

morris zent thee here and forget to pay for thee and if thou lodgest here to-night thou will not forget to be a-moving bag and baggage in the morning george be wearied and glad to sleep beneath the inhospitable roof of those whom he have consider as he parent but on the follow morning he take leave of they after learn from they all that they know of he history but i must again leave he and return to colonel morri and he son charle they come to england together and hasten towards morri house and there the long disowned son learn that he father be dead and that he mother and he sister know not where he child be or what have become of he but he kindred have ascertain that he be now rich and they repent of they unkindness towards he son say he mother i know nothing of thy child thy father be a strange man -- he tell little to I if any one can tell thee aught concern thy boy it will be john bell the old coachman but he have not be in the family for six year and where he now be i can not tell though i believe he be still somewhere in the neighborhood with sad and anxious heart the colonel and he son next visit the house of mr sim -- the dwelling-place in which the infancy the childhood and what may be call the youth of the latter have be pass tear gather in the eye of charle as he approach the door he know that he grandsire and he grandmother have act wrongly towards he in never speak to he of he father or make know to he that such a person live but when he again see the house which have be the scene of a thousand happy day round which he have chase the gaudy butterfly and the busy bee or seek the nest of the chaffinch the yellowhammer and the hedge-sparrow the feeling of boyhood rise too strong in he soul for resentment and on meeting mr sim -lrb- he grandfather -rrb- as they approach the door of the house charle run towards he and stretch out he hand cry father the old man recognize he and exclaim charle -- charle -- child of my marium and weep at the mention of she name the colonel weep also what gentleman be this with thee charle inquire mr sim it be _ my father _ be the reply mr sim who be now a grey-haired man reel back a few pace -- he raise he hand -- he exclaim can i be forgive forgive -- ay doubly forgive answer colonel morri as the father of lose loved marium and as have be more than a father to my boy who be now by my side but know you nothing of my other son my marium bear twin nothing nothing reply mr sim that question have cost I many a anxious thought it have trouble also the conscience of my wife for it be she fault that he also be not commit to my charge and i would have inquire after you child long ago but that there be no good-will between you father and I and i be a plain retired citizen -- he a magistrate and a justice of the peace for the county who could do no wrong the colonel groan they proceed towards the villa together mr sim meet she grandson with a flood of tear and in she joy at meet he she forget she dislike to he father and she hatred to that father 's family the colonel endeavor to obtain information from he father-in-law respect he other son and he tell he all that he mother have say of what she have speak regard the coachman and also of what charle have tell he in twice meet one who so strongly resemble himself colonel say mr sim i know the john bell you mother speak of he now keep a inn near langholm to-morrow we shall go to he house and make inquiry concern all that he know be it so father say the colonel and on the follow day they take a chaise and set out together -- the grandfather the father and the son they have to cross the annan and to pass the churchyard where marium sleep as they draw near to it the colonel desire the driver to stop follow I charle he say and mr sim accompany they they enter the churchyard the colonel lead they to the humble grave-stone that he have raise to the memory of he marium he sit down upon it he press he lip to it and weep charle say he look on you mother 's grave here on this stone day after day i be wont to sit with you and you brother upon my knee fondle you breathe you mother 's name in you ear and though neither of you know what i say you smile as i weep and speak oh charle though you then fill my whole heart -lrb- and you do now -rrb- i could only distinguish you from each other by the ribbon on you arm would to heaven that i may discover my child and whatever be he condition i shall forgive my father for the injustice he have do I and mine -- i shall be happy and oh should we indeed find you brother -- should he prove to be the youth whom you have twice meet -- i shall say that heaven have remember I when i forget myself but come hither charle -- come kneel upon you mother 's grave -- kiss the sod where she lie and angel will write it in they book and show it to you mother where she be happy come my boy charle kneel on he mother 's grave he have arise and they be about to depart for he grandfather have accompany they and be a silent but tearful spectator of the scene they be leave the churchyard join in the arm of each other when two stranger enter it the one be john bell the other george prescot colonel colonel there be john bell that you speak of exclaimed mr sim father father at the same instant cry he son he be here -- it be he -- my brother -- or -- he whom i have tell you of who so strangely resemble I charle rush forward -- it be george prescot -- and he take the proffer hand of the other and say sir i rejoice to meet thee again -- it seem i belong to cumberland as well as thou dost and this gentleman -lrb- point to john bell -rrb- who seem to know more of I than i do myself have promise to show I here my mother 's grave and where be that grave cry the colonel earnestly who have be a interested spectator of all that pass even where the wife of you youth be bury you honor answer john bell you have with you one son -- behold he twin brother the colonel press he new-found son to he breast with he child he sit down on the stone over marium 's grave and they weep together we tale be tell colonel morri and he son have meet he elder brother die and he become the heir of he father 's property mr sim also state that in he will he should divide he substance equally between the brother and he do so i have but another word to add george forget not caroline paling who have assist he when he heart be full and he pocket empty and within twelve month he again visit dartmouth but when he return from it caroline accompany he as he wife and when he introduce she to he father and he brother -- behold say he what a halfpenny delicately tender may produce the story of the girl forger it be a common thing for writer of a certain class when they want to produce the feeling of wonder in they reader to introduce some frantic action and then to account for it by let out the secret that the actor be mad the trick be not so necessary as it seem for the strength of human passion be a potentiality only limit by experience and so it be that a sane person may under certain stimulant do the maddest thing in the world the passion itself be always true -- it be only the motive that may be false and therefore it be that in narrate for you amusement perhaps i may add instruction the follow singular story -- trace of the main part of which i get in the old book of a former procurator-fiscal -- i assume that there be no more insanity in the principal actor euphemia or as she be call effie carr when she bring herself within the arm of the law than there be in you when now you be read the story of she strange life she be the only daughter of john carr a grain merchant who live in bristo street it would be easy to ascribe to she all the ordinary and extraordinary charm that be think so necessary to embellish heroine but as we be not tell what these be in she case we must be contented with the assurance that nature have be kind enough to she to give she power over the heart of man we shall be nearer we purpose when we state what be necessary to explain a peculiar part of we story that she father in consequence of he own insufficient education have get she train to help he in keep he account with the farmer and in write up he book nay she enjoy the privilege of write he draft upon the bank of scotland which the father contrived to sign though in he own illiterate way and with a peculiarity which it would not have be easy to imitate but we gentle clerk do not consider these duty impose upon she by she father as exclude she either from gratify she love of domestic habit by assist she mother in what at that time be denominate hussyskep or housekeeping or from a certain other gratification which might without a hint from we be anticipate -- no other than the luxury of fall head and ear and heart too we fancy in love with a certain dash young student of the name of robert stormonth then attend the university more for the sake of polish than of mere study for he be the son of the proprietor of kelton and require to follow no profession how effie get entangled with this youth we have no means of know so we must be contented with the scotch proverb -- tell I where the flea may bite and i will tell where love may light the probability be that from the difference of they station and the retire nature of we gentle clerk we shall be safe in assume that he have as the say go be smite by she charm in some of those street encounter where there be more of love 's work do than in black-footed tea coterie expressly hold for the accommodation of cupid and that the smite be a genuine feeling we be not leave to doubt for in addition to the reason we shall afterwards have too good occasion to know he treat effie not as those wild student who be great man 's son do the light o ' love they meet in they escapade for he entrust he secret to she he take such small counsel from she poor head as a learn clerk might be suppose able to give nay he tell she of he mother and how one day he hope to be able to introduce she at kelton as he wife all which effie repay with the devotedness of that most wonderful affection call the first or virgin love -- the purest the deepest the most thorough-going of all the emotion of the human heart but as yet he have not concede to she wish that he should consent to they love be make know to effie 's father and mother love be only a leveller to itself and its object : the high-born youth inure to refine manners shrink from a family intercourse which put he too much in mind of the revolt he have make against the presumed wish and intention of he proud parent wherein after all he be only true to the instinct of that institution apparently so inhumane as well as unchristian in its exclusiveness call aristocracy and yet with the excuse that its root be pretty deeply set in human nature but proud as he be bob stormonth the younger of kelton be amenable to the obligation of a necessity forge by he own imprudent hand he have by a fast mode of live get into debt -- a condition from which he father a stern man have relieve he twice before but with a threat on the last occasion that if he persevere in he prodigality he would withdraw from he he yearly allowance and throw he upon he own resource the threat prove ineffectual and this young heir of entail with all he pride be once in the grasp of low-born creditor nay thing in this evil direction have go so far that writ be out against he and one in the form of a caption be already in the hand of a messenger-at-arm that the debt be comparatively small in amount be no amelioration where the purse be all but empty and he have exhaust the limited exchequer of he chum which with college youth be and be not difficult to do so the gay bob be drive to he last shift and that as be generally the case be a mean one for necessity as the mother of invention do not think it proper to limit she birth to genteel or noble device to please she proud consort he even have recourse to poor effie to help he and however ridiculous this may seem there be reason that make the application appear not so desperate as some of he other scheme it be only the caption that as yet quicken he fear and as the sum for which the writ be issue be only twenty pound it be not after all so much beyond the power of a clerk it be during one of they ordinary walk in the meadow that the press necessity be open by stormonth to the vex and terrify girl he tell she that but for the small help he require in the meantime he would be ruin the wrath of he father would be excite once more and probably to the exclusion of all reconciliation and he himself compel to flee but whither he know not he have he plan prepare and propose to effie who have no means of she own _ to take a loan _ of the sum out of she father 's cash-box -- word very properly choose accord to the euphemistic policy of the devil but effie 's genuine spirit be rouse and alarm dreadful she whisper as if afraid that the night wind would carry she word to honest ear besides she continue my father who be a hard man keep he desk lockit word which take stormonth aback for even he see there be here a necessity as strong as he own yet the power of invention go to work again listen effie say he if you can not help I it be not likely we shall meet again i be desperate and will go into the army the ear of effie be chained to a force which be direct upon the heart she tremble and look wistfully into he face even as if by that look she could extract from he some other device less fearful by which she might have the power of retain he for so short a period as a day you draw out you father 's draft on the bank effie he continue write one out for I and i will put you father 's name to it you can draw the money i will be save from ruin and you father will never know a proposal which again bring a shudder over the girl be it robert stormonth who ask I to do this thing she whisper again no say he for i be not myself yesterday and before the messenger be after I i would have shrink from the suggestion i be not myself i say effie ay or no keep I or lose I -- that be the alternative oh i can not be the language of she innocence and for which he be prepare for the stimulant be again apply in the most powerful of all form -- the word farewell be sound in she ear stop robert let I think but there be no thought only the heart beat wildly i will do it and may the penalty be mine and mine only so it be : even virtue 's self turn vice when misapply what she mind shrink from be embrace by the heart as a kind of sacred duty of a love make a sacrifice for the object of its first worship it be arrange and as the firmness of a purpose be often in proportion to the prior disinclination so effie 's determination to save she lover from ruin be forthwith put in execution nay there be even a touch of the heroine in she so wonderfully do the heart act under its primary instinct sanctify the device which favor its affection that same evening effie carr write out the draft for twenty pound on the bank of scotland give it to stormonth who from a signature of the father 's also furnish by she perpetrate the forgery -- a crime at that time punishable by death the draft so sign be return to effie next forenoon she go to the bank as she have often do for she father before and the document be in she handwriting as prior one of the same kind have also be no scrutinize eye be turn to the signature the money be hand over but _ not count _ by the recipient as before have be she careful habit -- a circumstance with its effect to follow in due time meanwhile stormonth be at a place of appointment out of the reach of the executor of the law and be soon find out by effie who give he the money with tremble hand for this surely a kiss be due we do not know but she return with the satisfaction overcome all the impulse of fear and remorse that she have save the object of she first and only love from ruin and flight but even then the reaction be on the spring the rebound be to be fearful and fatal the teller at the bank have be strike with effie 's manner and the non-counting of the note have rouse a suspicion which fight its way even against the improbability of a mere girl perpetrate a crime from which female be generally free he examine the draft and soon see that the signature be a bad imitation thereupon a messenger be despatch to bristo street for inquiry john carr take by surprise declare that the draft though write by he daughter be forge -- the forgery be in he own mind attribute to george lindsay he young salesman enough this for the bank who have in the first place only to do with the utterer against whom they evidence as yet only lay within a few hour afterwards effie carr be in the tolbooth charge with the crime of forge a cheque on she father 's account-current the news soon spread over edinburgh -- at that time only a overgrown village in so far as regard local facility for the spread of wonder it have begin there where the mother be in recur faint the father in distraction and not less mystery george lindsay in terror and pity and here come in the next strange turn of we story lindsay all of a sudden declare he be the person who imitate the name -- a device of the yearning heart to save the girl of he affection from the gallows and clutch at by the mother and father as a means of they daughter 's redemption one of those thinly-sown being who be cold-blooded by nature who take on love slowly but surely and seem fit to be martyr lindsay defy all consequence so that it might be that effie carr should escape a ignominious death nor do he take time for further deliberation : in less than half a hour he be in the procurator-fiscal 's office -- the willing self-criminator the man who do the deed the man who be ready to die for he young mistress and he love he story too be as ready as it be truth-seeming he declare that he have get effie to write out the draft as if commission by john carr that he take it away and with he own hand add the name that he have return the check to effie to go with it to the bank and have receive the money from she on she return the consequence be he wish and it be inevitable that same day george lindsay be lodge also in the tolbooth satisfy that he have make a sacrifice of he life for one whom he have love for year and who yet have never show he even a symptom of hope that he love would be return all which proceedings soon come on the wing of rumor to the ear of robert stormonth who be not form to be a martyr even for a love which be to he as true as he nature would permit he see he danger because he do not see the character of a faithful girl who would die rather than compromise she lover he flee -- aid probably by that very money he have wring out of the hand of the devoted girl nor be he disappearance connect with the tragic transaction for as we have say the connection between he and effie have be keep a secret and he flight could be sufficiently account for by he debt meanwhile the precognition or examination of the party go on and with a result as strange as it be puzzling to the official effie be firm to she declaration that she not only write the body of the cheque but attach to it the name of she father and have appropriate the money in a way which she decline to state on the other hand lindsay be equally staunch to he statement make to the procurator-fiscal that he have get effie to write the draft have forge the name to it and get the money from she the authority very soon see that they have get more than the law bargain for or want nor be the difficulty likely soon to be solve the two party could not both be guilty accord to the evidence nor could one of they be guilty to the exclusion of the other neither when the balance be cast be there much difference in the weight of the scale because while it be in one view more likely that lindsay sign the false name it be beyond doubt that effie write the body of the document and she have moreover present it but be it for the honor of the law that people should be hang on a likelihood it be a new case without new head to decide it and it make no difference that the body of the people who soon become inflamed on the subject take the part of the girl and declare against the man it be easy to be see that the trace of the money would go far to solve the mystery and accordingly there be a strict search make in lindsay 's lodgings as well as in effie 's private repository at home we need not say with what effect where the money be over the border and away it be thus in all view more a case for astraea than common head but then she have go to heaven the lord advocate soon see that the law be likely to be catch in its own mesh the first glimpse be get of the danger of hang so versatile so inconsistent so unsearchable a creature as a human be on a mere confession of guilt that that have be the law of scotland in all time nay that it have be the law of the world from the beginning there be no doubt who could know the murderer or the forger better than the murderer or the forger himself and would any one throw away he life on a false plea the reasoning do not exhaust the deep subject there remain the presumption that the criminal will in ninety-nine case out of a hundred deny and deny boldly but we case throw a new light on the old law and the lord advocate be slow to indict where he see not only reason for failure but also rise difficulty which might strike at the respect upon which the law be found the affair hang loose for a time and lindsay 's friend anxious to save he get he induce to run he letter -- the effect of which be to give the prosecutor a period wherein to try the culprit on failure of which the person charge be free the same be do by effie 's father but quicken as the lord advocate be the difficulty still meet he like a ghost that would not be lay that if he put effie at the bar lindsay would appear in the witness-box and if he put lindsay on he trial effie would swear he be innocent and as for two people forge _ the same name _ the thing have never be hear of and so it come to pass that the authority at last feeling they be in a cleft stick where if they relieve one hand the other would be catch be incline to liberate both panel but the bank be at that time prey upon by forgery and be determine to make a example now when they have a culprit or perhaps two the consequence be that the authority be force to give way vindicate they right of choice as to the party they should arraign that party be effie carr and the choice justified itself by two consideration : that she by write and utter the cheque be so far commit by evidence exterior to she self-inculpation and secondly that lindsay might break down in the witness-box under a search examination effie be therefore indict and place at the bar she plead guilty but the prosecutor notwithstanding lead evidence and at length lindsay appear as a witness for the defense the people who crowd the court have be aware from report of the condition in which lindsay stand but the deep silence which reign throughout the hall when he be call to answer evince the doubt whether he would stand true to he self-impeachment the doubt be soon solve with a face on which no trace of fear could be perceive with a voice in which there be no quaver he swear that it be he who sign the draft and send effie for the money the oscillation of sympathy which have for a time be suspend come round again to the thin pale girl who sit there look wistfully and wonderingly into the face of the witness and the murmur approbation that break out in spite of the shrill silence of the crier express at once admiration of the man -- criminal as he swear himself to be -- and pity for the accuse what could the issue be effie be acquit and lindsay send back to gaol be he not to be try the official feel that the game be dangerous if lindsay have stand firm in the box have not effie sit firm at the bar with the very gallows in she eye and would not she in she turn be as firm in the box all which be too evident and the consequence in the end come to be that lindsay be in the course of a few day set at liberty and now there occur proceedings not less strange in the house of john carr lindsay be turn off because though he have make a sacrifice of himself to save the life of effie the sacrifice be only that due to the justice he have offend the dismissal be against the protestation of effie who alone know he be innocent and she have to bear the further grief of learn that stormonth have leave the city on the very day whereon she be apprehend -- a discovery this too much for a frame always weak and latterly so waste by she confinement in prison and the anguish of mind consequent upon she strange position and so it come to pass in a few more day that she take to she bed a wan waste heart-broken creature but sting as she have be by the conduct of the man she have offer to die to save she feel even more the sting of ingratitude in herself for not divulge to she mother as much of she secret as would have save lindsay from dismissal for she be now more and more satisfied that it be the strength of he love for she that have drive he to he great and perilous sacrifice nor could she mother as she bent over she daughter understand why she liberation should have be follow by so much sorrow nay love she as she do she even reproach she as be ungrateful to god mother say the girl i have a secret that lie like a stane upon my heart george lindsay have nae mair to do with that forgery than you and who have to do with it then effie dear myself continue the daughter i fill up the cheque at the bidding o ' robert stormonth whom i have lang love it be he wha put my faither 's name to it it be to he i give the money to relieve he from debt and he have flee effie effie cry the mother and we have do this thing to george lindsay -- ta'en from he he basket and he store yea the bread o ' he mouth in recompense for try to save you life by offer he ain yes mother add effie but we must make that wrang richt and mair lass rejoin the mother as she rise abruptly and nervously and hurry to she husband to whom she tell the strange intelligence then john carr be a just man as well as a loving parent and while he forgive he unfortunate daughter he go and bring back george lindsay to he old place that very night nor do he or mr carr know the joy they have pour into the heart of the young man for the reason that they do not know the love he bear to they daughter but if this be a satisfaction to effie in so far as it relieve she heart of a burden it bring to she a burden of another kind the mother soon see how matter stand with the heart of lindsay and she moreover see that she or she daughter 's gratitude could not be complete so long as he be deny the boon of be allow to marry the girl he have save from the gallows and she wait she opportunity of break the delicate subject to effie it be not time yet when effie be a invalid and even so far waste and worn as to cause apprehension of she ultimate fate even death nor perhaps would that time ever come when she could bear to hear the appeal without pain for though stormonth have ruin she character and she peace of mind -- nay have leave she in circumstance almost unprecedented for treachery baseness and cruelty -- he retain still the niche where the offering of a first love have be make : he image have be indeed burn into the virgin heart and no other form of man 's face though represent the possessor of beauty wealth and worldly honor would ever take away that treasured symbol it haunt she even as a shadow of herself which disappear at sundown come again at the rising of the noon nay she would have be contented to make other sacrifice equally great as that which she have make nor wild moor nor stream nor rugged hill would have stop she in a effort to look upon he once more and replace that inevitable image by the real vision which have first take captive she young heart but time pass bring the usual amelioration to the miserable effie get so far better in health that she become able to resume in a languid way she former duty with the exception of those of the gentle clerk -- for of these she have have enough even the very look of a bank-draft bring a shudder over she nor would she have enter the bank of scotland again even with a good cheque for a thousand pound to have be all she own meanwhile the patient george have ply a suit which he could only express by he eye or the attention of one who worship but he never allude even in they conversation to the old sacrifice the mother too and not less the father see the advantage that might result as well to the health of she mind as that of she body they have wait -- a vain waiting -- for the wear out of the trace of the obdurate image and when they think they might take placidity as the sign of what they wait for they first hint and then express in plain term the wish of they heart for a time all they effort be fruitless but john carr get old and weak wish to be succeed in he business by george and the wife when she become a widow would require to be maintain -- reason which have more weight with effie than any other except always the act of george 's self-immolation at the shrine in which he fancy have place she the importunity at length wear out she resisting without efface the line of the old and still endear image and she give a cold we may say reluctant consent the bride 's ay be a sigh the rapture a tear of sadness but george be pleased even with this : effie the long-cherished effie be at length he in she new situation effie carr -- now mr lindsay -- perform all the duty of a good and faithful wife by a effort of the will no doubt though in another sense only a sad obedience to necessity of which we be all as the creature of motive the very slave but the old image resist the appeal of she reason as well as the blandishments of a husband 's love she be only true faithful and kind till the birth of a child lend its reconcile power to the effort of duty some time afterwards john carr die -- a event which carry in its train the subsequent death of he wife there be leave to the son-in-law a dwindle business and a very small sum of money for the father have meet with misfortune in he decline year which impair health prevent he from resist time wear on and show that the power of the martyr-spirit be not always that of the champion of worldly success for it be now but a struggle between george lindsay with a stain name and the stern demon of misfortune he be at length overtaken by poverty which as affect effie prey so relentlessly upon he spirit that within two year he follow john carr to the grave effie be now leave with two child to the work of she finger a poor weapon wherewith to beat off the wolf of want and even this be curtail by the effect of the old crime which the public still keep in green remembrance throughout we story have be the sensationalism of angry fate and even less likely to be believe than the work of fiction nor be the vulture face of the nemesis yet smooth down the grief of she bereavement have only partially divert effie 's mind from the recollection of he who have ruin she and yet could not be hate by she nay could not be but love by she the sensitize nerve which have receive the old image give it out fresh again to the revive power of memory and this be only a continuation of what have be a corrode custom of year and year but as the say go it be a long road that do not offer by its side the spreading bough of shade to the way-worn traveller one day when effie be engage with she work of which she be as weary as of the dream which accompany it there appear before she without premonition or foreshadowing sign robert stormonth of kelton dress as a country gentleman boot and with a whip in he hand be you effie carr the question be useless to one who be already lie back in she chair in a state of unconsciousness from which she recover only to open she eye and avert they and shut they and open they again like the victim of epilepsy and do you fear I say the excited man as he take she in he strong arm and stare wildly into she face i have more reason to fear you whom i ruin he continue ay bring within the verge

you be to consent to be my wife the very smallest boon i dare offer during which strange rambling speech effie be partly insensible yet she hear enough to afford she clouded mind a glimpse of she condition and of the meaning of what be say to she for a time she keep stare into he face as if she have doubt of he real personality nor could she find word to express even those more collect thought that begin to gather into form robert stormonth at length she say calmly and have you suffer too oh this be more wonderful to I than a ' the rest o ' these wonderful thing as no man ever suffer dear effie he answer i be on the eve of come to you when a friend i retain here write I to london of you marriage with the man who save you from the fate into which i precipitated you how i envied that man

assuage as well as he love gratify he depart leave effie to thought we should be sorry to think ourselves capable of put into word nor need we say more than that stormonth keep he word effie carr be in a few day mr stormonth and in not many more the preside female power in the fine residence of kelton the burgher 's tale the two red slipper the take down of the old house of four or five flat call gowanlock 's land in that part of the high street which use to be call the luckenbooth have give rise to various story connect with the building out of these i have select a very strange legend -- so strange indeed that if not true it must have be the production _ quod est in arte summa _ of a capital inventor nor need i say that it be of much importance to talk of the authenticity of these thing for the most authentic be embellish by invention -- and it be certainly the best embellish that live the longest for all which we have very good reason in human nature gowanlock 's land it would seem merely occupy the site of a older house which belong at the time of prince charlie 's occupation of the city to a old town councillor of the name of yellowlee this older house be also one of many story -- a old form in edinburgh suppose to have be adopt from the french but it have which be not uncommon a entry from the street run under a arch and lead to the back of the premise to the lower part of the tenement that part occupy by the councillor there be a lower flat and one above which thus constitute a entire house and which moreover rejoice in the privilege of have a extensive garden run down as far as the sheet of water call the north loch that secret domestic witness as the ancient use to say of many of the dark crime of the old city these garden be the pride of the rich burgher of the time decorate by dutch-clipped holly and trim boxwood walk and in we special instance of councillor yellowlee ' retreat there be in addition a summer-house or rustic bower standing at the bottom that be towards the north and close upon the loch i may mention also that in consequence of the damp this little bower be strew with rush for the very special comfort of miss annie yellowlee the only and much petted child of the good councillor all which you must take as introductory to the important fact that the say miss annie who as a matter of course be very bonnie as well as pass rich to be have be somewhat previous to the prince 's entry to the town pledge to be marry to no less considerable a personage than maister john menelaw a son of he of the very same name who deal in pelt in a shop of the canongate and a student of medicine in the edinburgh university but as the councillor have in he secret soul hankering after the prince and the say student john be a red-hot royalist the marriage be suspend all to the inexpressible grief of we bonnie annie who would not have give she john for all the charly and geordy to be find from berwick to lerwick on the other hand while annie be depress and force to seek relief in solitary musing in she bower by the loch it be just as true that it be a ill wind that blaw naebody gude nay the truth of the say be verify in richard templeton a fellow-student of menelaw and a rival too in the affection of annie who be a charlieite as well as a annieite rejoice that he companion be in the meantime foiled and disappointed meanwhile and i may say while the domestic affair of the councillor 's house be still in this unfortunate position the prince 's bubble burst in the way which history tell we of and thereupon out come proscription of terrible import and as fate would have it young templeton 's name be in the bloody register the more by reason that he have be as noisy as edinburgh student generally be in the proclamation of he partisanship he must fly or secrete himself or perhaps lose a head in which there be conceal a considerable amount of scotch cunning he at once think of the councillor 's house with that seclude back garden and summer-house all so convenient for secrecy and the envied annie there too whom he might by soft wooing detach from the hate menelaw and make he own through the medium of the pity that be akin to love and so to be sure he straightway under the shade of night repair to the house of the councillor who be a tender-hearted man could not see a sympathiser with the glorious cause in danger of lose he head templeton be receive -- a report set abroad that he have go to france -- and all proper measure be take within the house to prevent any domestic from let out the secret in this scheme annie we need hardly say be a favor party not that she have any love for the young man for she heart be still true to menelaw -lrb- who however for safety 's sake be now exclude from the house -rrb- but that with a filial obedience to a beloved father she feel with a woman 's heart sympathy for one who be in distress and a martyr to the cause which she father love need we wonder at a issue which may already be loom on the vision of those who know anything of human nature the two young folk be throw together they be seldom out of each other 's company suffering be love 's opportunity and templeton have to plead for he not only he misfortune but a tongue render subtle and win by love 's action in the heart as the day pass annie see some new quality in the martyr prisoner which she have not see before nay the pretty little domestic attention have the usual reflex effect upon the heart which administer they and all that the recur image of menelaw could do to fight against these rise predilection be so far unavailing that that very image wax dimmer and dimmer while the present object be always work through the magic of sensation yes annie yellowlee grow day by day fonder of she _ protégé _ until at length she get as the say go over head and ear nay be she not in the long night busy work a pair of red slipper for the object of she new affection and be not these so very suitable to one who like hercule be reduce almost to the distaff and who unlike that woman-tamed hero do not need they to be apply anywhere but to the foot in the midst of all this secluded domesticity there be all that comfort which be say to come from steal water then be there not the prospect of the proscription be take off and the two would be make happy even in the meantime they make small escapade into free space when the moon be just so far up as not to be a tell-tale templeton would either with or without annie step out into the garden with these very red slipper on he foot that bower by the loch too be favourable to the fondling of a secret love nor be it sometimes less to the prisoner a refuge from the eeriness which come of _ ennui _ -- if it be not the same thing -- under the pressure of which strange feeling he would creep out at time when annie could not be with he nay sometimes when the family have go to bed and now we come to a very wonderful turn in we strange story one morning templeton do not make he appearance in the breakfast parlor but of course he would when he get up and get he red slipper on yet he be so punctual and annie who know that she father have to go to the council chamber would see what be the cause of the young man 's delay she go to he bedroom door it be open but where be templeton he be not there he could not be out in the city he could not be even in the garden with the full light of a bright morning sun shine on it he be not in the house he be not in the garden as they could see from the window he be nowhere to be find and what add to the wonder he have take with he he red slipper wherever he have go the inmate be in wonderment and consternation and conduplicate evil they could make no inquiry for one who lay under the ban of a bloody proscription but wonder as we all know generally ensconce themselves in some snug theory and die by a kind of pleasant euthanasia and so it be with this wonder of ours the councillor come as the day pass to the conclusion that templeton weary out by he long confinement have become desperate and have go abroad as good a theory as could be get see that he have not trust himself in go near he friend and annie whose grief be sharp and poignant come also to settle down with a belief which still promise she she lover though perhaps at a long date but somehow or another annie could not explain why even with all the fondness he have to the work of she hand he should have elect to expose himself to damp foot by make the love-token slipper do the duty of the pair of good shoe he have leave in the bedroom even this latter wonder wear away and month and month pass on the revolving wheel which cast month not less than moment into that gulf we call eternity the rigor of the government prosecution be relax and timid sympathiser begin to show they head out of door but richard templeton never return to claim either immunity or the woman of he affection nor within all this time do john menelaws enter the house of the councillor so that annie 's day be renounce to sadness and she night to reverie but at last come the eventful one day of the greatest of all story-teller time whereon happen he startling discovery verily one day annie have wander disconsolately into the garden and seat herself on the wooden form in the summer-house where in the moonlight she have often nestle in the arm of she proscribed lover who be now go it might be for ever objective thought cast she into a reverie and the reverie bring up again the image of these object till she heart beat with a affection renew through a dream at length she start up and wish to hurry from a place which seem fill with image at once lovable and terrible she feel she foot catch by a impediment whereby she stumble on look down she observe some object of a reddish-brown color and become alarmed lest it might be one of the toad with which the place be sometimes invade she start back yet curiosity force she to a closer inspection she apply she hand to the object and bring away one of those very slipper which she have make for templeton all very strange but what maybe conceive to have be she feeling when she see stick up from beneath the rush the white skeleton of a foot which have fill that very slipper a terrible suspicion shoot through she mind she fly to she father and hurry he to the spot point out to he the grim object and show he the slipper which have cover it mr yellowlee be a shrewd man and soon see that the foot be there the rest of the body be not far away he see too that he safety might be compromise either as have be concern in a murder or the harbourage of a rebel and so make caution the better part of he policy he repair to a sympathiser and have tell he the story claim he assistance nor be this refuse that same night by the light of a lamp they exhume the body of templeton much reduce but envelop with he clothes only they observe that the other red slipper be want on examine the body they could trace the evidence of a sword-stab through the heart all this they keep to themselves and that same night they contrived to get the sexton of the canongate to inter the body as that of a rebel who have be kill and leave where it be find this wonder also pass away and as time speed old thing begin to get again into they natural order menelaw begin to come again about the house and as a old love when the impediment be remove be soon rekindle again he and annie become even all that which they have once be to each other the old vow be repeat without the slightest reference be make by either party to the cause which have interfere to prevent they from have be fulfil it be not for annie to proffer a reason and it do not seem to be the wish of menelaw to ask one in a short time afterwards they be marry the new-married couple apparently happy in the enjoyment of a affection which have continue so long and have survive the cross of a new love at least on one side remove to a separate house farther up in the lawnmarket menelaw have previously graduate as a doctor and he commence to practice as such not without a amount of success meanwhile the councillor die leave annie a considerable fortune in the course of somewhere about ten year they have five child they at length resolve on occupy the old house with the garden for annie 's reluctance become weaken by time it be on the occasion of the flit that annie have to rummage a old trunk which menelaw long after the marriage have bring from the house of he father the dealer in pelt there at the bottom cover over by a piece of brown paper she find -- what the very slipper which match the one she still secretly retain in she possession _ verbum sapienti _ you may now see where the strange land lie nor be annie blind she conclude in a instant and with a horror that thrill through she whole body that menelaw have murder he rival she have lie for ten year in the arm of a murderer she have bear to he five child nay she love he with all the force of a ardent temperament the thought be terrible and she recoil from the very possibility of live with he a moment longer she take the fatal memorial and secrete it along with its neighbor and have a friend at a little distance from edinburgh she hurry thither take with she she child she father have leave in she own power a sufficiency for she support and she afterwards return to town all the request of she husband for a explanation she resist and indeed they be not long persist in for menelaw no doubt gauge the reason of she obduracy -- a conclusion the more likely that he subsequently leave scotland i have reason to believe that some of the exist menelaw ' be descend from this strange union the faithful wife there be very prevalent along the border a opinion that the arm of the town of selkirk represent a incident which occur there at the time of the battle of flodden the device it be well know consist of a female bear a child in she arm seat on a tomb on which be also place the scottish lion antiquary tell we that this device be adopt in consequence of the melancholy circumstance of the wife of a inhabitant of the town have be find by a party return from the battle lie dead at the place call ladywood-edge with a child suck at she breast we have not the slightest wish to disturb this venerable legend it commemorate with striking force the desolation of one of scotland 's greatest calamity and though the device be rudely and coarsely imagine there be a graphic strength in the conception which independently of the truth of the story recommend it to the lover of the bold and fervid genius of we countryman we must at same time be allow to say that there be another version and this we intend shortly now to lay before the public without vouch for its superiority of accuracy over its more favored and cherish brother and rather indeed caution the credulous lover of old legend to be upon they guard lest dr johnson 's reproof of richardson be applicable to we in say that we have it upon authority when recruit be require by king jame the fourth for the invasion of the english territory which produce the most lamentable of all we defeat it be well know that great exertion be use in the cause by the town-clerk of selkirk whose name be william brydone for which king jame the fifth afterwards confer on he the honor of knighthood many of the inhabitant of selkirk fire with the ardor which the chivalric spirit of jame infuse into the heart of he people and with the spirit of emulation which brydone have the art of exciting among he townsman as borderer join the banner of they provost among these be one alexander hume a shoemaker a strong stalwart man bold and energetic in

when he come among he companion he be uniformly cheer they have confidence in he sagacity and prudence respect he valor and admire he strength if hume be thus court by he companion and urge by brydone to the dangerous enterprise in which the king by the wiles and flattery of the french queen have engage he be treat in a very different manner by margaret he wife -- a fine young woman who fond to distraction of she husband be desirous of prevent he from risk he life in a cause which she fear with prophetic feeling would bring desolation on she country every effort which love and female cajolery could suggest be use by this dutiful wife to keep she husband at home she hang round he neck -- hold up to he face a fine child five month old whose mute eloquence soften the heart but could not alter the purpose of the father -- weep prayed implored she ask he the startling question -- who when he be dead -- and die he might -- would shield she from injury and misfortune and cherish with the tenderness and love which its beauty and innocence deserve the interesting pledge of they affection she paint in glowing color -- which the imagination excite by love can so well supply -- the situation of she as a widow and she child as a orphan they natural protector go what would be leave to she but grief what would remain for she child but destitution he spirit would hear she wail but beggary would array she in its rag and hunger would steal from she cheek the vestige of health and the lineament of beauty these appeal be bear by hume by the panoply of resolution he love margaret as dearly as truly as man could love woman as a husband could love the partner of he life and fortune he answer with tear and embrace but he remain true to the cause of he king and he country would you

country margaret hear this speech with the most intense grief she be incapable of argument she be inconsolable she husband remain inexorable and entreaty give way to anger she have adopt the idea that hume be buoy up with the pride of leadership and she tell he with some acrimony that he ambition of be think the bravest man of selkirk would not in the event of he death supply the child he be bind to work for with a bite of bread she love and anger carry she beyond bound she use other language of a harsher character which force she good-natured husband to retaliate in term unusual to he unsuited to the serious subject which they have in hand and far less to the dangerous separation which they be about to experience the conversation get more acrimonious word of a high cast produce expression stronger still and hume leave he wife in anger to go to the field from which he might never return regret follow close upon the heel of incensed love alexander hume have not be many pace from he own house when he wife see in its proper light the true character of she situation she husband have go on a perilous enterprise he might perish she have perhaps get she last look of he who be dearest to she bosom that look be in anger the idea be terrible those who know the strength and delicacy of the feeling of true affection may conceive the situation of margaret hume unable to control herself she throw she child into its crib and rush out of the house one parting glance of reconciliation be all she want she hurry through the town with a excited and terrify aspect search everywhere for she husband he have depart with he companion and margaret be leave in the agony of one whose sorrow be destine to be increase by the workings of a excited fancy and the remorseful feeling of
