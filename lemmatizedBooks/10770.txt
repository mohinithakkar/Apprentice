by spaniard to be charge against they undeniably large debt to spain one of the greatest if not the most frequently mention be take from they they good name spanish writer have never be note for modesty or historical accuracy back in 1589 the printer of the english translation of padre juan gonzalez de mendoza 's history of the great and mighty kingdom of china feel it necessary to prefix this warning : \* \* \* the spaniard -lrb- follow they ambitious affection -rrb- do usually in all they writings extoll they own action even to the setting forth of many untruthe and incredible thing as in they description of the conquiste of the east and west indy etc doth more at large appeare of early spanish historian doctor antonio de morga seem the single exception and perhaps even some of he credit come by contrast but in later year the rule apparently have prove invariable as the condition in the successive period of spanish influence be recognize to be indicative of little progress if not actually retrogressive the practice grow up of correspondingly lower the current estimate of the capacity of the filipino of the conquest so that always a apparent advance appear this in the closing period in order to fabricate a sufficient show for over three century of pretended progress lead to the practical denial of human attribute to the filipino find here by legaspus against this denial to he countryman of virtue as well as rights doctor rizal opposed two briefs whose english title be the philippine a century hence and the indolence of the filipino almost every page therein show the influence of the young student 's early reading of the hereinafter-printed study by the german scientist jagor friend and counsellor in he maturer year and the liberal spaniard comyn even he acquaintance with morga which eventually lead to rizal 's republication of the 1609 history long lose to spaniard probably be owe to jagor although the life-long resolution for that action can be trace to hearing of sir john bowring 's visit to he uncle 's home and the propose hakluyt society english translation then mention the present value and interest of these now rare book have suggest they republication to make available to filipino student a course of study which they national hero find profitable as well as to correct the myriad misconception of thing philippine in the mind of those who have take the accept spanish account as gospel truth dr l v schweib of berlin make the hundred of correction many reverse the meaning of former reading which almost justify call the revise jagor translation a new one numerous hitherto-untranslated passage likewise appear there have be leave out the illustration from crude drawing obsolete since photographic picture have familiarize the scene and object and also the consequently superfluous reference to these no other omission have be allow for if one author lean far to one side in certain debatable question the other have be equally partisan for the opposite side except a cerement on religion in general and discussion of the world-wide social evil be eliminate as have no particular philippine bearing to excuse they appearance in a popular work the early american quotation of course be for comparison with the numerous american comment of today and the two magazine extract give english account a century apart virchow 's matured view have be substitute for the pioneer opinion he furnish professor jagor thirty year earlier and if rizal 's patron in the scientific world fail at time in he fact he method for research be a safe guide finally three point should constantly be bear in mind : -lrb- 1 -rrb- allowance must be make for the lessen spanish influence surely more foreign to this seafaring people than the present modify anglo-saxon education and so more artificial ie less assimilable as well as for the removal of the unfavorable environment before attempt to from a opinion of the present-day filipino from he prototype picture in those page -lrb- 2 -rrb- foreign observer be apt to emphasize what be strange to they in describe other land than they own and to leave unnoted point of resemblance which may be much more numerous -lrb- 3 -rrb- rizal 's judgment that he countryman be more like backward european than oriental be base on scientific study of europe 's rural district and philippine provincial condition as well as of oriental country life so that it be entitle to more weight than the commoner opinion to the contrary which though more popular have be less carefully form university of the

and this state of thing continue till the close of 1844 when it be resolve with the approval of the archbishop to pass over new year 's eve for once altogether -lrb- 4 -rrb- since that time the philippine be consider to lie no longer in the distant west but in the far east and be about eight hour in advance of they mother country the proper field for they commerce however be what be to european the far west they be colonize thence and for century till 1811 they have almost no other communication with europe but the indirect one by the annual voyage of the galleon between manila and acapulco now however when the eastern shore of the pacific be at last begin to teem with life and with unexampled speed be press forward to grasp they stupendous future the philippine will no longer be able to remain in they past seclusion no tropical asiatic colony be so favorably situate for communication with the west coast of america and it be only in a few matter that the dutch indy can compete with they for the favor of the australian market but -lrb- future in american and australian trade -rrb- on the other hand they will have to abandon they traffic with china whose principal emporium manila originally be as well as that with those westward-looking country of asia europe 's far east which lie nearest to the atlantic port -lrb- 5 -rrb- -lrb- 6 -rrb- -lrb- commercially in

earth into two hemisphere decree that all heathen land discover in the eastern half should belong to the portuguese in the western half to the spaniard accord to this arrangement the latter could only claim the philippine under the pretext that they be situate in the western hemisphere the demarcation line be to run from the north to the south a hundred league to the south-west of all the so-called azore and cape de verde island in accordance with the treaty of tordesilla negotiate between spain and portugal on June 7 1494 and approve by julius ii in 1506 this line be draw three hundred and seventy league west of the cape de verde island -lrb- faulty spanish and portuguese geography -rrb- at that time spanish and portuguese geographer reckon seventeen and one-half league to a degree on the equator in the latitude of the cape de verde island three hundred and seventy league make 21 ° 55 ' if to this we add the longitudinal difference between the westernmost point of the group and cadiz a difference of 18 ° 48 ' we get 40 ° 43 ' west and 139 ° 17 ' east from cadiz -lrb- in round number 47 ° west and 133 ° east -rrb- as the limit of the spanish hemisphere at that time however the exist means for such calculation be entirely insufficient -lrb- extravagant spanish claim thru ignorance -rrb- the latitude be measure with imperfect astrolabe or wooden quadrant and calculate from very deficient table the variation of the compass moreover be almost unknown as well as the use of the log -lrb- 8 -rrb- both method and instrument be want for useful longitudinal calculation it be under these circumstance that the spaniard attempt at badajoz to prove to the protest portuguese that the eastern boundary line intersect the mouth of the gange and proceed to lay claim to the possession of the spice island -lrb- spain 's error in calculation -rrb- the eastern boundary should in reality have be draw 46 1\/2 ° further to the east that be to say as much further as it be from berlin to the coast of labrador or to the lesser altaus for in the latitude of calcutta 46 1\/2 ° be equivalent to two thousand five hundred and seventy-five nautical mile albo 's log-book give the difference in longitude between the most eastern island of the archipelago and cape fermoso -lrb- magellan 's strait -rrb- as 106 ° 30 ' while in reality it amount to 159 ° 85 ' -lrb- moluccan rights sell to portugal -rrb- the dispute between the spaniard and the portuguese occasion by the uncertainty of the eastern boundary -- portugal have already found a settlement in the spice island -- be set at rest by a agreement make in 1529 in which charle v abandon he pretended rights to the molucca in favor of portugal for the sum of 350000 ducat the philippine at that time be of no value \* \* \* \* \* -lrb- foreign mail facility -rrb- the distance from manila to hongkong be six hundred fifty nautical mile and the course be almost exactly south-east the mail steamer run between the two port make the trip in from three to four day this allow of a fortnightly postal communication between the colony and the rest of the world -lrb- 9 -rrb- -lrb- slight share in world commerce -rrb- this small steamer be the only thing to remind a observer at hongkong a port throng with the ship of all nation that a island so specially favor in condition and fertility lie in such close proximity -lrb- little commerce with spain -rrb- although the philippine belong to spain there be but little commerce between the two country once the tie which bind they be so close that manila be wont to celebrate the arrival of the spanish mail with te deum and bell-ringing in honor of the successful achievement of so stupendous a journey until portugal fall to spain the road round africa to the philippine be not open to spanish vessel the condition of the overland route be sufficiently show by the fact that two augustinian monk who in 1603 be entrust with a important message for the king and who choose the direct line through goa turkey and italy need three year for reach madrid -lrb- 10 -rrb- -lrb- former spanish ship mainly carry foreign goods -rrb- the trade by spanish ship which the merchant be compel to patronize in order to avoid pay a additional custom tax in spite of the protective duty for spanish product be almost exclusively in foreign goods to the colony and return the product of the latter for foreign port the traffic with spain be limit to the conveyance of official priest and they usual necessaries such as provision wine and other liquor and except a few french novel some atrociously dull book history of saint and similar work -lrb- manila 's fine bay -rrb- the bay of manila be large enough to contain the unite fleet of europe it have the reputation of be one of the finest in the world the aspect of the coast however to a stranger arrive as do the author at the close of the dry season fall short of the lively description of some traveller the circular bay one hundred twenty nautical mile in circumference the water of which wash the shore of five different province be fringe in the neighborhood of manila by a level coast behind which rise a equally flat table land the scanty vegetation in the foreground consist chiefly of bamboo and areca palm be dry up by the sun while in the far distance the dull uniformity of the landscape be break by the blue hill of san mateo in the rainy season the numerous unwalled canal overflow they bank and form a series of connected lake which soon however change into luxuriant and verdant rice-field -lrb- city 's appearance mediaeval european -rrb- manila be situate on both side of the river pasig the town itself surround with wall and rampart with its low tiled roof and a few tower have in 1859 the appearance of some ancient european fortress four year later the greater part of it be destroy by a earthquake -lrb- the 1863 earthquake -rrb- on June 3 1863 at thirty-one minute past seven in the evening after a day of tremendous heat while all manila be busy in its preparation for the festival of corpus christus the ground suddenly rock to and fro with great violence the firmest building reel visibly wall crumble and beam snap in two the dreadful shock last half a minute but this little interval be enough to change the whole town into a mass of ruin and to bury alive hundred of its inhabitant -lrb- 11 -rrb- a letter of the governor-general which i have see state that the cathedral the goverment-house the barracks and all the public building of manila be entirely destroy and that the few private house which remain standing threaten to fall in later account speak of four hundred kill and two thousand injure and estimate the loss at eight million of dollar forty-six public and five hundred and seventy private building be throw down twenty-eight public and five hundred twenty-eight private building be nearly destroy and all the house leave standing be more or less injured -lrb- damage in cavite -rrb- at the same time a earthquake of forty seconds ' duration occur at cavite the naval port of the philippine and destroy many building -lrb- destruction in walled city -rrb- three year afterwards the duc d'alencon -lrb- lucon et mindanao paris 1870 s 38 -rrb- find the trace of the catastrophe everywhere three side of the principal square of the city in which formerly stand the government or governor 's palace the cathedral and the townhouse be lie like dust heap overgrow with weed all the large public edifice be temporarily construct of wood but nobody then seem to plan anything permanent -lrb- former heavy shock -rrb- manila be very often subject to earthquake the most fatal occur in 1601 in 1610 -lrb- nov 30 -rrb- in 1645 -lrb- nov 30 -rrb- in 1658 -lrb- aug 20 -rrb- in 1675 in 1699 in 1796 in 1824 in 1852 and in 1863 in 1645 six hundred -lrb- 12 -rrb- or accord to some account three thousand -lrb- 13 -rrb- person perish bury under the ruin of they house they monastery the church of the augustinian and that of the jesuit be the only public building which remain standing -lrb- frequent minor disturbance -rrb- smaller shock which suddenly set the hang lamp swing occur very often and generally remain unnoticed the house be on this account generally of but one story and the loose volcanic soil on which they be build may lessen the violence of the shock they heavy tiled roof however appear very inappropriate under such circumstance earthquake be also of frequent occurrence in the province but they as a rule cause so little damage owe to the house be construct of timber or bamboo that they be never mention -lrb- scanty datum available -rrb- m alexi perrey -lrb- mém de l'académie de dijon 1860 -rrb- have publish a list collect with much diligence from every accessible source of the earthquake which have visit the philippine and particularly manila but the account even of the most important be very scanty and the date of they occurrence very unreliable of the minor shock only a few be mention those which be notice by scientific observer accidentally present at the time -lrb- the 1610 catastrophe -rrb- aduarte -lrb- i 141 -rrb- mention a tremendous earthquake which occur in 1610 i briefly quote he version of the detail of the catastrophe as i find they mention nowhere else towards the close of November 1610 on st andrew 's day a more violent earthquake than have ever before be witness visit these island its effect extend from manila to the extreme end of the province of nueva segovia -lrb- the whole northern part of luzon -rrb- a distance of 200 league it cause great destruction over the entire area in the province of iloco it bury palm tree so that only the top of they branch be leave above the earth 's surface through the power of the earthquake mountain be push against each other it throw down many building and kill a great number of people its fury be greatest in nueva segovia where it open the mountain and create new lake basin the earth throw up immense fountain of sand and vibrate so terribly that the people unable to stand upon it lay down and fasten themselves to the ground as if they have be on a ship in a stormy sea in the range inhabit by the mendaya a mountain fall in crush a village and kill its inhabitant a immense portion of the cliff sink into the river and now where the stream be formerly border by a range of hill of considerable altitude its bank be nearly level with the watercourse the commotion be so great in the bed of the river that wave arise like those of the ocean or as if the water have be lash by a furious wind those edifice which be of stone suffer the most damage we church and the convent fall in etc etc chapter ii -lrb- customhouse red tape -rrb- the custom inspection and the many formality which the native minor official exercise without any consideration appear all the more wearisome to the new arrival when contrast with the easy routine of the english free port of the east he have just quit the guarantee of a respectable merchant obtain for I as a particular favor permission to disembark after a detention of sixteen hour but even then i be not allow to take the smallest article of luggage on shore with I -lrb- shelter for shipping -rrb- during the south-west monsoon and the stormy season that accompany the change of monsoon the roadstead be unsafe larger vessel be then oblige to seek protection in the port of cavite seven mile further down the coast but during the north-east monsoon they can safely anchor half a league from the coast all ship under three hundred ton burden pass the breakwater and enter the pasig where as far as the bridge they lie in serried row extend from the shore to the middle of the stream and bear witness by they number as well as by the bustle and stir go on amongst they to the activity of the home trade -lrb- silt up of river mouth -rrb- in every rain-monsoon the pasig river sweep such a quantity of sediment against the breakwater that just its removal keep as it seem the dredge machine station there entirely occupy -lrb- few foreign vessel -rrb- the small number of the vessel in the roadstead particularly of those of foreign country be the more remarkable as manila be the only port in the archipelago that have any commerce with foreign country it be true that since 1855 three other port to which a fourth may now be add have get this privilege but at the time of my arrival in march 1859 not one of they have ever be enter by a foreign vessel and it be a few week after my visit that the first english ship sail into iloilo to take in a cargo of sugar for australium -lrb- 14 -rrb- -lrb- antiquated restriction on trade -rrb- the reason of this peculiarity lay partly in the feeble development of agriculture in spite of the unexampled fertility of the soil but chiefly in the antiquated and artificially limited condition of trade the custom duty be in themselves not very high they be generally about seven per cent upon merchandise convey under the spanish flag and about twice as much for that carry in foreign bottom when the cargo be of spanish production the duty be three per cent if carry in national vessel eight per cent if in foreign ship the latter be only allow as a rule to enter the port in ballast -lrb- 15 -rrb- -lrb- discouragement for foreign ship -rrb- as however the principal want of the colony be import from england and abroad these be either keep back till a opportunity occur of send they in spanish vessel which charge nearly a treble freight -lrb- from # 4 to # 5 instead of from # 1 1\/2 to # 2 per ton -rrb- and which only make they appearance in british port at rare interval or they be send to singapore and hongkong where they be transfer to spanish ship tonnage due be levy moreover upon ship in ballast and upon other which merely touch at manila without unload or take in fresh cargo and if a vessel under such circumstance land even the smallest parcel it be no longer rate as a ship in ballast but charge on the higher scale vessel be therefore force to enter the port entirely devoid of cargo or carry sufficient to cover the expense of the increase harbor due almost a impossibility for foreign ship on account of the differential custom rate which act almost as a complete prohibition the result be that foreign vessel come there only in ballast or when summon for some particular object -lrb- export tax -rrb- the export of the colony be almost entirely limit to its raw produce which be burden with a export duty of three per cent export leave under the spanish flag be only tax to the amount of one per cent but as scarcely any export trade exist with spain and as spanish vessel from they high rate of freight be exclude from the carry trade of the world the boon to commerce be a delusive one -lrb- 16 -rrb- -lrb- law drive away trade -rrb- these inept excise law hamper with a hundred suspicious form frighten away the whole carry trade from the port and its commission merchant be frequently unable to dispose of the local produce so trifling be the carry trade that the total yearly average of the harbor due calculate from the return of ten year barely reach $ 10000 -lrb- manila 's favorable location -rrb- the position of manila a central point betwixt japan china annam the english and dutch port of the archipelago and australium be in itself extremely favorable to the development of a world-wide trade -lrb- 17 -rrb- at the time of the north-eastern monsoon during we winter when vessel for the sake of shelter pass through the strait of gilolo on they way from the indian archipelago to china they be oblige to pass close to manila they would find it a most convenient station for the philippine as we have already mention be particularly favorably place for the west coast of america -lrb- the 1869 reform -rrb- a proof that the spanish ultramar minister fully recognize and appreciate these circumstance appear in he decree of April 5 1869 which be of the highest importance for the future of the colony it probably would have be issue earlier have not the spanish and colonial shipowner pampered by the protective system obstinately struggle against a innovation which impair they former privilege and force they to greater activity -lrb- bettered condition -rrb- the most noteworthy point of the decree be the moderation of the differential duty and they entire extinction at the expiration of two year the abrogation of all export duty and the consolidation of the more annoying port due into one single charge -lrb- pre-spanish foreign commerce -rrb- when the spaniard land in the philippine they find the inhabitant clothe in silk and cotton stuff which be import by chinese ship to exchange for gold-dust sapan wood -lrb- 18 -rrb- holothurian edible bird ' nest and skin the island be also in communication with japan cambodium siam -lrb- 19 -rrb- the molucca and the malay archipelago de barros mention that vessel from luzon visit malacca in 1511 -lrb- 20 -rrb- -lrb- early extension under spain -rrb- the greater order which reign in the philippine after the advent of the spaniard and still more the commerce they open with america and indirectly with europe have the effect of greatly increase the island trade and of extend it beyond the indy to the persian gulf manila be the great mart for the product of eastern asia with which it load the galleon that as early as 1565 sail to and from new spain -lrb- at first to navidad after 1602 to acapulco -rrb- and bring back silver as they principal return freight -lrb- 21 -rrb- -lrb- jealousy of seville monopolist -rrb- the merchant in new spain and peru find this commerce so advantageous that the result be very damaging to the export from the mother country whose manufacture goods be unable to compete with the indian cotton and the chinese silk the spoilt monopolist of seville demand therefore the abandonment of a colony which require considerable yearly contribution from the home exchequer which stand in the way of the mother country 's exploit she american colony and which let the silver of he majesty 's dominion pass into the hand of the heathen since the foundation of the colony they have continually throw impediment in its path -lrb- 22 -rrb- they demand however be vain in face of the ambition of the throne and the influence of the clergy rather respond to the view of that time the merchant of peru and new spain be force in the interest of the mother country to obtain merchandise from china either directly or through manila the inhabitant of the philippine be alone permit to send chinese goods to america but only to the yearly value of $ 250000 the return trade be limit to $ 500000 -lrb- 23 -rrb- -lrb- prohibition of china trading -rrb- the first amount be afterwards increase to $ 300000 with a proportionate augmentation of the return freight but the spanish be forbid to visit china so that they be oblige to await the arrival of the junk finally in 1720 chinese goods be strictly prohibit throughout the whole of the spanish possession in both hemisphere a decree of 1734 -lrb- amplify in 1769 -rrb- once more permit trade with china and increase the maximum value of the annual freightage to acapulco to $ 500000 -lrb- silver -rrb- and that of the return trade to twice the amount -lrb- higher limit on suspension of galleon voyage -rrb- after the galleon to acapulco which have be maintain at the expense of the government treasury have stop they voyage commerce with america be handle by merchant who be permit in 1820 to export goods up to $ 750000 annually from the philippine and to visit san bla guayaquil and callao besides acapulco -lrb- british occupation inspire new want -rrb- this concession however be not sufficient to compensate philippine commerce for the injury it suffer through the separation of mexico from spain the possession of manila by the english in 1762 make its inhabitant acquaint with many industrial product which the import from china and indium be unable to offer they to satisfy these new craving spanish man-of-war be send towards the close of 1764 to the colony with product of spanish industry such as wine provision hat cloth hardware and fancy article -lrb- manila opposition to trade innovation -rrb- the manila merchant accustom to a lucrative trade with acapulco strenuously resist this innovation although it be a considerable source of profit to they for the crown purchase the indian and chinese merchandise for its return freight from manila at double they original value in 1784 however the last of these ship arrive -lrb- subterfuge of european trader -rrb- after the english invasion european vessel be strictly forbid to visit manila but as that city do not want to do without indian merchandise and could not import it in its own ship it be bring there in english and french bottom which assume a turkish name and be provide with a indian sham-captain -lrb- the philippine company monopoly -rrb- in 1785 the compañía de filipina obtain a monopoly of the trade between spain and the colony but it be not allow to interfere with the direct traffic between acapulco and manila the desire be to acquire large quantity of colonial produce silk indigo cinnamon cotton pepper etc in order to export it somewhat as be do later on by the system of culture in java but as it be unable to obtain compulsory labor it entirely fail in its attempt artificial development of agriculture -lrb- loss by bad management -rrb- the compañía suffer great loss through its erroneous system of operation and the incapacity of its official -lrb- it pay for example $ 1350 for a picul of pepper which cost from three to four dollar in sumatra -rrb- -lrb- entrance of foriegn ship and firm -rrb- in 1789 foreign ship be allow to import chinese and indian produce but none from europe in 1809 a english commercial house obtain permission to establish itself in manila -lrb- 24 -rrb- in 1814 after the conclusion of the peace with france the same permission with greater or less restriction be grant to all foreigner -lrb- trade free but port charge discriminate -rrb- in 1820 the direct trade between the philippine and spain be throw open without any limitation to the export of colonial produce on the condition that the value of the indian and chinese goods in each expedition should not exceed $ 50000 ever since 1834 when the privilege of the compañía expire free trade have be permit in manila foreign ship however be charge double due four new port have be throw open to general trade since 1855 and in 1869 the liberal tariff previously allude to be issue -lrb- port 's importance lessen under spain -rrb- today after three century of almost undisturbed spanish rule manila have by no mean add to the importance it possess shortly after the advent of the spaniard the isolation of japan and the indo-chinese empire a direct consequence of the importunity and pretension of the catholic missionary -lrb- 25 -rrb- the secession of the colony on the west coast of america above all the long continuance of a distrustful commercial and colonial policy -- a policy which exist even at the present day -- while important market base on large capital and liberal principle be be establish in the most favored spot of the british and dutch indy all these circumstance have contribute to this result and throw the chinese trade into other channel the cause be as clear as the effect yet it might be erroneous to ascribe the policy so long pursue to short-sightedness the spaniard in they scheme of colonisation have partly a religious purpose in view but the government discover a great source of influence in the disposal of the extremely lucrative colonial appointment the crown itself as well as its favorite think of nothing but extract the most it could from the colony and have neither the intention or the power to develop the natural wealth of the country by agriculture and commerce inseparable from this policy be the persistent exclusion of foreigner -lrb- 26 -rrb- it seem even more necessary in the isolate philippine than in america to cut off the native from all contact with foreigner if the spaniard have any desire to remain in undisturbed possession of the colony in face however of the develop trade of today and the claim of the world to the productive power of such a extraordinarily fruitful soil the old restriction can no longer be maintain and the lately-introduced liberal tariff must be hail as a thoroughly well-timed measure \* \* \* \* \* -lrb- galleon story sidelight on colonial history -rrb- the oft-mentioned voyage of the galleon betwixt manila and acapulco hold such a prominent position in the history of the philippine and afford such a interesting glimpse into the old colonial system that they principal characteristic deserve some description -lrb- chinese part in galleon trade -rrb- in the day of morga towards the close of the sixteenth century from thirty to forty chinese junk be in the habit of annually visit manila -lrb- generally in march -rrb- towards the end of June a galleon use to sail for acapulco the trade with the latter place the active operation of which be limit to the three central month of the year be so lucrative easy and safe that the spaniard scarcely care to engage in any other undertaking -lrb- favoritism in allotment of cargo space -rrb- as the carry power of the annual galleon be by no means proportion to the demand for cargo room the governor divide it as he deem best the favorite however to whom he assign share in the hold seldom trade themselves but part with they concession to the merchant -lrb- division of space and character of cargo -rrb- accord to de guignes -lrb- 27 -rrb- the hold of the vessel be divide into 1500 part of which the majority be allot to the priest and the rest to favor person as a matter of fact the value of the cargo which be officially limit to $ 600000 be considerably higher it chiefly consist of indian and chinese cotton and silk stuff -lrb- amongst other fifty thousand pair of silk stocking from china -rrb- and gold ornament the value of the return freight amount to between two and three million of dollar -lrb- profit in trade -rrb- everything in this trade be settle beforehand the

not the enjoyment of nature in the hot season all who can afford it be drive every evening along the -lrb- the luneta -rrb- dusty street to a promenade on the beach which be build a short time back

be among the most charming creature in the world in they youth -lrb- ill at ease in society -rrb- its cause lie rather in this equivocal position they be haughtily repel by they white sister whilst they themselves disown they mother 's kin they be want in the ease in the tact that the woman of spain show in every relation of existence -lrb- mestizo -rrb- the mestizo particularly those bear of chinese and tagal mother constitute the richest and the most enterprising portion of the native population they be well acquaint with all the good and bad quality of the filipino inhabitant and use they unscrupulously for they own purpose chapter iv -lrb- native distrust of european -rrb- a scotch merchant to whom i bring a letter of introduction invite I with such cordiality to come and stay with he that i find myself unable to refuse while thus live under the roof and protection of one of the wealthiest and most respected man in the city the cabman i employ insist on be pay beforehand every time i ride in they vehicle this distrust be occasion by the scanty feeling of respect most of the european in manila inspire in the mind of the native many later observation confirm this impression what a different state of thing exist in java and singapore the reason however be easily explain -lrb- dutch and english stand well in they colony -rrb- the dutch be as little able as the english to acclimatize themselves in tropical country they get all they can out of country in which they be only temporary sojourner the former by forced service and monopoly the latter by commerce in both case however the end be accomplish by comparatively few individual whose official position and the largeness of whose undertaking place they far above the mass of the population in java moreover the european constitute the govern class the native the govern and even in singapore where both race be equal before the law the few white man understand how to mark the difference of race so distinctively that the native without demur surrender to they though not by means of the law the privilege of a higher caste the difference of religion do but widen the gap and finally every european there speak the language of the country while the native be totally ignorant of that speak by the foreigner -lrb- dutch colonial well educate -rrb- the dutch official be educate at home in school specially devote to the east indian service the art of manage the native the uphold of prestige which be consider the secret of the dutch power over the numerous native population form a essential particular in they education the dutch therefore manage they intercourse with the native no matter how much they intend to get out of they in strict accordance with customary usage -lrb- adat -rrb- they never wind the native ' amor propio and never expose themselves in they own mutual intercourse which remain a sealed book to the inhabitant -lrb- spanish official undesirable -rrb- thing be different in the philippine with the exception of those official whose stay be limit by the rule of the service or by the place-hunting that ensue at every change in the spanish ministry few spaniard who have once settle in the colony ever return home it be forbid to the priest and most of the rest have no means of do so a considerable portion of they consist of subaltern officer soldier sailor political delinquent and refugee whom the mother-country have get rid of and not seldom of adventurer deficient both in means and desire for the journey back for they life in the colony be far pleasanter than that they be force to lead in spain these latter arrive without the slightest knowledge of the country and without be in the least prepared for a sojourn there many of they be so lazy that they will not take the trouble to learn the language even if they marry a daughter of the soil they servant understand spanish and clandestinely watch the conversation and the action and become acquaint with all the secret of they indiscreet master to whom the filipino remain a enigma which they conceit prevent they attempt to decipher -lrb- spanish lack of prestige deserve -rrb- it be easy to understand how filipino respect for european must be diminish by the number of these uneducated improvident and extravagant spaniard who no matter what may have be they position at home be all determine to play the master in the colony -lrb- social standing of filipino thus enhance -rrb- the relative standing of the filipino naturally profit by all this and it would be difficult to find a colony in which the native take all in all feel more comfortable than in the philippine they have adopt the religion the manners and the custom of they ruler and though legally not on a equal footing with the latter they be by no means separate from they by the high barrier with which not to mention java the churlish reserve of the english have surround the native of the other colony -lrb- spanish-filipino bond of union -rrb- the same religion a similar form of worship a existence intermix with that of the indigenous population all tend to bring the european and the indian together that they have do so be prove by the existence of the proportionately very numerous band of mestizo who inhabit the island -lrb- latin race better for colonist in the tropics -rrb- the spaniard and the portuguese appear in fact to be the only european who take root in tropical country they be capable of permanent and fruitful amalgamation -lrb- 52 -rrb- with the native -lrb- 53 -rrb- -lrb- initiative and individuality miss -rrb- the want of originality which among the mestizo appear to arise from they equivocal position be also to be find among the native distinctly marked national custom which one would naturally expect to find in such a isolate part of the world be seek for in vain and again and again the stranger remark that everything have be learn and be only a veneer -lrb- a compromise civilization -rrb- as spain forcibly expel the civilization of the moor and in peru that of the inca so in the philippine it have understand how to set aside a equally well-founded one by appropriate in a incredible manner in order to take root itself the more quickly all exist form and abuse -lrb- 54 -rrb- -lrb- imitation instil and self-respect banish -rrb- the uncivilized inhabitant of the philippine quickly adopt the rite form and ceremony of the strange religion and at the same time copy the personal externality of they new master learn to despise they own manners and custom as heathenish and barbarian nowadays forsooth they sing andalusian song and dance spanish dance but in what sort of way they imitate everything that pass before they eye without use they intelligence to appreciate it it be this which make both themselves and they artistic production wearisome devoid of character and i may add unnatural in spite of the skill and patience they devote to they these two peculiarity moreover be invariably to be find amongst nation whose civilization be but little develop the patience so much admire be often nothing but waste of time and breath quite out of proportion to the end in view and the skill be the mere consequence of the backward state of the division of labor -lrb- educate filipino unnatural -rrb- if i enter the house of a well-to-do filipino who speak spanish i be receive with the same phrase he model a spaniard would employ but i always have the feeling that it be out of place in country where the native population remain true to its ancient custom this be not the case and whenever i have not be receive with proper respect i have remark that the apparent fact proceed from a difference in social form not more to be wonder at than a difference in weight and measure in java and particularly in borneo and the molucca the utensil in daily use be ornament with so refine a feeling for form and color that they be praise by we artist as pattern of ornamentation and afford a proof that the labor be one of love and that it be preside over by a acute intelligence -lrb- native art-sense spoil -rrb- such a sense of beauty be seldom to be meet with in the philippine everything there be imitation or careless makeshift even the piña embroidery which be fabricate with such wonderful patience and skill and be so celebrated for the fineness of the work be as a rule spiritless imitation of spanish pattern one be involuntarily lead to these conclusion by a comparison of the art product of the spanish-american community with those of more barbarous race the berlin ethnographical museum contain many proof of the fact i have just mention -lrb- indolence from absence of incentive -rrb- the oar use in the philippine be usually make of bamboo pole with a board tie to they extremity with strip of rattan if they happen to break so much the better for the fatiguing labor of rowing must necessarily be suspend till they be mend again -lrb- carelessness from lack of responsibility -rrb- in java the carabao-cart which be completely cover in as a protection against the rain be ornament with many tasteful pattern the roofless wagon use in the philippine be roughly put together at the last moment when it be necessary to protect they contents from the wet a old pair of mat be throw over they more for the purpose of appease the prejudice of the castilian than really to keep off the rain -lrb- weakened character and want of dignity -rrb- the english and the dutch be always look upon as stranger in the tropics they influence never touch the ancient native custom which culminate in the religion of the country but the population whom the spaniard have convert to they religion have lose all originality all sense of nationality yet the alien religion have never really penetrate into they inmost be they never feel it to be a source of moral support and it be no accidental coincidence that they be all more or less stamped with a want of dignity -lrb- spanish rule not benevolent but beneficial -rrb- with the exception of this want of national individuality and the loss of the distinguishing manners and custom which constitute the chief charm of most eastern people the filipino be a interesting study of a type of mankind exist in the easiest natural condition the arbitrary rule of they chief and the iron shackle of slavery be abolish by the spaniard shortly after they arrival and peace and security reign in the place of war and rapine the spanish rule in these island be always a mild one not because the law which treat the native like child be wonderfully gentle but because the cause do not exist which cause such scandalous cruelty in spanish america and in the colony of other nation -lrb- circumstance have favor the filipino -rrb- it be fortunate for the filipino that they island possess no wealth in the shape of precious metal or valuable spice in the earlier day of maritime traffic there be little possibility of export the numerous agricultural production of the colony and it be scarcely worth while therefore to make the most of the land the few spaniard who reside in the colony find such a easy method of make money in the commerce with china and mexico by means of the galleon that they hold themselves aloof from all economical enterprise which have little attraction for they haughty inclination and would have impose the severest labor on the filipino take into consideration the wearisome and dangerous navigation of the time it be moreover impossible for the spaniard upon whom they too large possession in america already impose a exhausting man-tax to maintain a strong armed force in the philippine the subjection which have be inaugurate by a dazzling military exploit be chiefly accomplish by the assistance of the friar order whose missionary be teach to employ extreme prudence and patience the philippine be thus principally win by a peaceful conquest -lrb- have fare better than the mexican -rrb- the tax lay upon the people be so trifling that they do not suffice for the administration of the colony the difference be cover by yearly contribution from mexico the extortion of unconscientious official be by no means conspicuous by they absence cruelty however such as be practice in the american mining district or in the manufacture of quito never occur in the philippine -lrb- a land of opportunity -rrb- uncultivated land be free and be at the service of any one willing to make it productive if however it remain untilled for two year it revert to the crown -lrb- 55 -rrb- -lrb- low tax -rrb- the only tax which the filipino pay be the poll-tax know as the tributo which originally three hundred year ago amount to one dollar for every pair of adult and in a country where all marry early and the sex be equally divide really constitute a family-tax by degree the tribute have be raise to two and one-sixteenth dollar a adult therefore male or female pay one and one-thirty-second dollar and that from he sixteenth to he sixtieth year besides this every man have to give forty day ' labor every year to the state this vassalage -lrb- polo y servicio -rrb- be divide into ordinary and extraordinary service : the first consist of the duty appertain to a watchman or messenger in clean the court of justice and in other light labor the second in road-making and similar heavier kind of work for the benefit of village and province the little use however that be make of these service be show by the fact that any one can obtain a release from they for a sum which at most be not more than three dollar no personal service be require of woman a little further on important detail about the tax from official source which be place at my disposal in the colonial office appear in a short special chapter -lrb- fortunate factor -rrb- in other country with a equally mild climate and a equally fertile soil the native unless they have reach a higher degree of civilization than that of the philippine islander would have be ground down by native prince or ruthlessly plunder and destroy by foreigner in these isolate island so richly endowed by nature where pressure from above impulse from within and every stimulus from the outside be want the satisfaction of a few trifling want be sufficient for a existence with ample comfort of all country in the world the philippine have the greatest claim to be consider a lotos-eating utopia the traveller whose knowledge of the dolce far niente be derive from naple have no real appreciation of it it

the river be a natural self-maintaining highway on which load can be carry to the foot of the mountain the hut of the people build upon pile be to be see thickly scatter about its bank and particularly about its broad mouth the appropriateness of they position be evident for the stream be at once the very center of activity and the most convenient spot for the pursuit of they calling at each tide the take of fish be more or less plentiful and at low-water the woman and child may be see pick up shell-fish with they toe for practice have enable they to use they toe as deftly as they finger or gathering in the sand-crab and eatable seaweed -lrb- riverside gaiety -rrb- the riverside be a pretty sight when man woman and child be bathing and frolicking in the shade of the palm-tree and other be fill they water-vessel large bamboo which they carry on they shoulder or jar which they bear on they head and when the boy be stand upright on the broad back of the carabao and ride triumphantly into the water -lrb- coco-palm -rrb- it be here too that the coco-palm most flourish a tree that supply not only they food and drink but also every material necessary for the construction of hut and the manufacture of the various article which they use while the greatest care be necessary to make those grow further inland bear even a little fruit the palm-tree close to the shore even when plant on wretched soil grow plentiful crop without the slightest trouble have a palm-tree ever be make to blossom in a hothouse thomson -lrb- 56 -rrb- mention that coco-tree grow by the sea-side be wont to incline they stem over the ocean the water of which bear they fruit to desert shore and island and render they habitable for mankind thus the coco-tree would seem to play a essential part in the ocean vagabondage of malaysium and polynesium -lrb- nipa-palm -rrb- close to the coco-tree grow clump of the stunt nipa-palm which only flourish in brackish water -lrb- 57 -rrb- they leaf furnish the best roof-thatching sugar brandy and vinegar be manufacture from they sap three hundred and fifty year ago pigafetta find these manufacture in full swing but nowadays they seem to be limit to the philippine besides these the pandanus-tree from the leaf of which the softest mat be weave be always find in near proximity to the shore -lrb- fertile field -rrb- towards the interior the landscape be cover with rice-field which yearly receive a fresh layer of fertile soil wash down from the mountain by the river and spread over they surface by the overflow of its water and which in consequence never require any fertilizer -lrb- the carabao -rrb- the carabao the favorite domestic animal of the malay and which they keep especially for agricultural purpose prefer these region to all other it love to wallow in the mud and be not fit for work unless permit to frequent the water -lrb- bamboo -rrb- bamboo with luxuriant leafy top grow plentifully by the hut in the rice-field which fringe the bank of the river in my former sketch of travel i have endeavor to describe how much this gigantic plant contribute to the comfort and convenience of tropical life since then i have become acquaint with many curious purpose to which it be turn but to describe they here would be out of place -lrb- 58 -rrb- i may be allow however to briefly cite a few example show what numerous result be obtain from simple means nature have endow these splendid plant which perhaps surpass all other in beauty with so many useful quality and deliver they into the hand of mankind so ready for immediate use that a few sharp cut suffice to convert they into all kind of various utensil -lrb- strength -rrb- the bamboo possess in proportion to its lightness a extraordinary strength the result of its round shape and the regularity of the joint in its stem the parallel position and toughness of its fiber render it easy to split and when split its piece be of extraordinary pliability and elasticity to the gravelly soil on which it grow it owe its durability and its firm even and always clean surface the brilliancy and color of which improve by use -lrb- convenience -rrb- and finally it be a great thing for a population with such limited means of conveyance that the bamboo be to be find in such abundance in all kind of locality and of all dimension from a few millimeter to ten or fifteen centimeter in diameter even sometimes to twice this amount and that on account of its unsurpassed float power it be pre-eminently fit for locomotion in a country poor in road but rich in watercourse a blow with a bolo be generally enough to cut down a strong stem -lrb- usefulness -rrb- if the thin joint be take away hollow stem of different thickness can be slide into one another like the part of a telescope from bamboo split in half gutter trough and roofing tile can be make split into several slat which can be again divide into small strip and fiber for the manufacture of basket rope mat and fine plaiting work they can be make into frame and stand two cut in the same place make a round hole through which a stem of corresponding diameter can be firmly introduce if a similar opening be make in a second upright the horizontal stem can be run through both gate close perpendicularly or horizontally in frame move without friction on a perpendicular or horizontal axis can be make in this way two deep cut give a angular shape to the stem and when its two side be wide enough apart to admit of a cross-stem be place between they they can be employ as roof-ridge or for the framework of table and chair a quantity of flat split piece of bamboo be fasten on top of they with chair-cane these split piece then form the seat of the chair and the top of the table instead of the board and large bamboo lath use at other time it be equally easy to make a oblong opening in a large bamboo in which to fit the lath of a stand a couple of cut be almost enough to make a fork a pair of tong or a hook if one make a hole as big as the end of one 's finger in a large bamboo close under a joint one obtain by fasten a small piece of cloth to the open end a syphon or a filter if a piece of bamboo be split down to the joint in strip and the strip be bind together with other horizontally interlace it make a conical basket if the strip be cut shorter it make a peddler 's pack basket if a long handle be add and it be fill with tar it can be use as a signal torch if shallower basket of the same dimension but with they bottom cut off or punch out be place inside these conical one the two together make capital snare basket for crab and fish if a bamboo stem be cut off just below the joint and its lower edge be split up into a cogged rim it make when the partition of the joint be punch out a earth-auger a fountain-pipe and many thing of the kind \* \* \* \* \* -lrb- pleasure of travel -rrb- stranger travel in the interior have daily fresh opportunity of enjoy the hospitality of nature the atmosphere be so equitably warm that one would gladly dispense with all clothing except a sun-hat and a pair of light shoe should one be tempt to pass the night in the open air the construction of a hut from the leaf of the palm and the fern be the work of a few minute -lrb- village rest house -rrb- but in even the smallest village the traveller find a common house -lrb- casa real -rrb- in which he can take up he quarter and be supply with the necessaries of life at the market price there too he will always meet with semanero -lrb- those who perform menial duty -rrb- ready to serve he as messenger or porter for the most trifling remuneration but long practice have teach I that they service principally consist in do nothing on one occasion i want to send a man who be play card and drinking tuba -lrb- fresh or weakly-fermented palm-sap -rrb- with he companion on a errand -lrb- pleasant prison life -rrb- without stop he game the fellow excuse himself on the ground of be a prisoner and one of he guardian proceed in the midst of the intense heat to carry my troublesome message prisoner have certainly little cause to grumble -lrb- frequent flogging little regarded -rrb- the only inconvenience to which they be expose be the flogging which the local authority very liberally dispense by the dozen for the most trifling offence except the momentary bodily pain however these appear in most case to make little impression on a people who have be accustom to corporal punishment from they youth upward they acquaintance stand round the sufferer while the blow be be inflict and mockingly ask they how it taste -lrb- change from malayan character -rrb- a long residence amongst the earnest quiet and dignified malay who be most anxious for they honor while most submissive to they superior make the contrast in character exhibit by the native of the philippine who yet belong to the malay race all the more striking the change in they nature appear to be a natural consequence of the spanish rule for the same characteristic may be observe in the native of spanish america the class distinction and the despotic oppression prevalent under they former chief doubtless render the filipino of the past more like the malay of today chapter v -lrb- the familiar field for traveller -rrb- the environs of manila the pasig and the lagoon of bay which be visit by every fresh arrival in the colony have be so often describe that i have restrict myself to a few short note upon these part of the country and intend to relate in detail only my excursion into the south-eastern province of luzon camarine and albay and the island which lie to the east of they samar and leyte before do this however it will not be out of place to glance at the map and give some slight description of they geographical condition -lrb- archipelago 's great extent -rrb- the philippine archipelago lie between borneo and formosa and separate the northern pacific ocean from the china sea it cover fourteen and one-half degree of latitude and extend from the sulu island in the south in the fifth parallel of north latitude to the babuyan in the north in latitude 19 ° 30 ' if however the bashee or batane island be include its area may be say to extend to the twenty-first parallel of north latitude but neither southwards or northwards do spanish rule extend to these extreme limit nor in fact do it always reach the far interior of the larger island from the eastern to the western extremity of the philippine the distance be about nine degree of longitude two island luzon with a area of two thousand and mindanao with one of more than one thousand five hundred square mile be together larger than all the rest the seven next largest island be palawan samar panay mindoro leyte negro and cebu of which the first measure about two hundred and fifty and the last about one hundred square mile then come bohol and masbate each about half the size of cebu twenty smaller island still of some importance and numerous tiny islet rock and reef -lrb- favor by position and condition -rrb- the philippine be extremely favor by they position and condition they extension from north to south over 16 ° of latitude obtain for they a variety of climate which the dutch indy whose largest diameter they extent in latitude north and south of the equator be but trifle run from the east to the west by no means enjoy the advantage accrue from they neighborhood to the equator be add to those acquire from the natural variety of they climate and the produce of both the torrid and temperate zone the palm-tree and the fir the pine-apple the corn ear and the potato flourish side by side upon they shore -lrb- harbor and water highway -rrb- the larger island contain vast inland sea considerable navigable river and many creek run far into the interior they be rich too in safe harbor and countless natural port of refuge for ship in distress another attribute which though not to be realize by a glance at the map be yet one of the most fortunate the island possess be the countless number of small stream which pour down from the inland hill and open out ere they reach the ocean into broad estuary up these watercourse coast vessel of shallow draught can sail to the very foot of the mountain and take in they cargo -lrb- soil and sea alike productive -rrb- the fertility of the soil be unsurpassed both the sea around the coast and the inland lake swarm with fish and shell-fish while in the whole archipelago there be scarcely a wild beast to be find it seem that only two civet happen to appear : miro -lrb- paradoxurus philippinensis tem -rrb- and galong -lrb- viverra tangalunga gray -rrb- luzon surpass all the other island not only in size but in importance and its fertility and other natural superiority well entitle it to be call as it be by crawfurd the most beautiful spot in the tropics -lrb- luzon -rrb- the mainland of the isle of luzon stretch itself in a compact long quadrangle twenty-five mile broad from 18 ° 40 ' north latitude to the bay of manila -lrb- 14 ° 30 ' -rrb- and then project amid large lake and deep creek a rugged promontory to the east join to the main continent by but two narrow isthmus which stretch east and west of the large inland lagoon of bay many trace of recent upheaval betoken that the two portion be once separate and form two distinct island the large eastern promontory well-nigh as long as the northern portion be nearly cut in half by two deep bay which start from opposite point on the south-eastern and north-western coast almost merge they water in the center of the peninsula the bay of ragay and the bay of sogod in fact the southern portion of luzon may be better describe as two small peninsula lie next to one another in parallel position and join together by a narrow neck of land scarcely three mile broad two small stream which rise nearly in the same spot and pour themselves into the two opposite gulf make the separation almost complete and form at the same time the boundary between the province of tayaba on the west and that of camarine on the east the western portion indeed consist almost entirely of the first-named district and the eastern be divide into the province of north camarine south camarine and albay the first of these three be divide from tayaba by the boundary already mention and from south camarine by a line draw from the southern shore of the bay of san miguel on the north to the opposite coast the eastern extremity of the peninsula form the province of albay separate from south camarine by a line which run from donzol on the south coast northwards across the volcano of mayon and which then incline to the west reach the northern shore a look at the map will make these explanation clearer -lrb- the monsoon -rrb- there be two season in the philippine the wet and the dry the south-west monsoon bring the rainy season at the time of we summer to the province which lie expose to the south and west wind on the northern and eastern coast the heaviest downpour take place -lrb- in we winter month -rrb- during the north-eastern monsoon the ruggedness of the country and its numerous mountain cause in certain district many variation in these normal meteorological condition the dry season last in manila from November till June -lrb- duration of the north-east monsoon -rrb- rain prevail during the remain month -lrb- duration of the south-west monsoon -rrb- the heaviest rainfall occur in September march and April be frequently free from rain from October to February inclusively the weather be cool and dry -lrb- prevalence of nw n and ne wind -rrb- march April and may be warm and dry -lrb- prevalence of ene e and ese wind -rrb- and from June till the end of September it be humid and moderately warm there have be a observatory for many year past in manila under the management of the jesuit the following be a epitome of the yearly meteorological report for 1867 for which i be indebted to professor dive : barometrical reading -- the average height of the mercury be in 1867 7555 in 1865 75457 and in 1866 75337 millimeter in 1867 the difference between the highest and lowest barometrical reading be not more than 1396 millimetre and would have be much less if the mercury have not be much depress by storm in July and September the hourly variation amount to very few millimeter daily reading of the barometer -- the mercury rise in the early morning till about 9 be it then fall up to 3 or 4 pm from then it rise again till 9 pm and then again fall till towards day-break both the principal atmospheric current prevalent in manila exercise a great influence over the mercury in the barometer the northern current cause it to rise -lrb- to a average height of 756 millimeter -rrb- the southern cause it to fall -lrb- to about 753 millimeter -rrb- temperature -- the heat increase from January till the end of may and then decrease till December average yearly temperature 279 ° c the highest temperature ever record -lrb- on the 15th of April at 3 pm -rrb- be 377 ° c the lowest -lrb- on the 14th of December and on the 30th of January at 6 be -rrb- 194 ° c difference 183 ° c -lrb- 59 -rrb- thermometrical variation -- the difference between the highest and lowest reading of the thermometer be in January 139 ° in February 142 ° in march 15 ° in April 146 ° in may 111 ° in June 99 ° in July 9 ° in August 9 ° in September 10 ° in October 119 ° in November 118 ° and in December 117 ° coolest month -- November December and January with northerly wind hottest month -- April and may they high temperature be cause by the change of monsoon from the north-east to the south-west the state of the temperature be most normal from June to September the variation be least marked during this period owe to the uninterrupted rainfall and the clouded atmosphere daily variation of the thermometer -- the coolest portion of the day be from 6 to 7 be the heat gradually increase reach its maximum about 2 or 3 pm and then again gradually decrease during some hour of the night the temperature remain unchanged but towards morning it fall rapidly -lrb- wind -rrb- the direction of the wind be very regular at all season of the year even when local cause make it vary a little in the course of a twelvemonth the wind go around the whole compass in January and February north wind prevail in march and April they blow from the south-east and in may June July August and September from the south-west in the beginning of October they vary between south-east and south-west and settle down towards the close of the month in the north-east in which quarter they remain tolerably fix during the two follow month the two change of monsoon always take place in April and may and in October as a rule the direction of both monsoon preserve its equilibrium but in manila which be protect towards the north by a high range of hill the north-east monsoon be often divert to the south-east and north-west the same cause give greater force to the south-west wind -lrb- sunshine and rain -rrb- the sky be generally partially cloud entirely sunny day be of rare occurrence in fact they only occur from January to April during the north-east monsoon number of rainy day in the year 168 the most continuous and heaviest rain fall from June till the end of October during this period the rain come down in torrent in September alone the rainfall amount to 15 meter nearly as much as fall in berlin in the course of the whole year 30728 millimeter of rain fall in the twelve month but this be rather more than the average the evaporation only amount to 23073 millimeter in ordinary year it be generally about equal to the downfall take the early average not those of single month the average daily evaporation be about 63 millimeter -lrb- storm -rrb- the change of monsoon be often accompany with tremendous storm during one of these which occur in September the velocity of the wind be as much as thirty-seven or thirty-eight meter per second a official report of the english vice-consul mention a typhoon which visit the island on September 27 1865 and which do much damage at manila drive seventeen vessel ashore \* \* \* \* \* -lrb- province and district -rrb- the philippine be divide into province -lrb- p -rrb- and district

government report -rrb- the statistics of the above table be take from a small work by sr -lrb- vicente -rrb- barrante the secretary-general of the philippine but i have arrange they differently to render they more easily intelligible to the eye although sr barrante have the best official material at he disposal too much value must not be attribute to he figure for the source from which he draw they be taint with error to a extent that can hardly be realize in europe for example he derive the follow contradictory statement from he official source : -- the population of cavite be set down as 115300 and 65225 that of mindoro as 45630 and 23054 that of manila as 230443 and 323683 and that of capiz as 788947 and 191818 chapter vi -lrb- to bulacan by steamer -rrb- my first excursion be to the province of bulacan on the northern shore of the bay of manila a couple of hour bring the steamer to the bar of binuanga -lrb- not bincanga as it be call in coello 's map -rrb- and a third to bulacan the capital of the province situate on the flat bank of a influent of the pampanga delta i be the only european passenger the other be compose of tagalog mestizo and a few chinese the first more particularly be represent by woman who be generally charge with the management of all business affair for which they be much better fitted than the man as a consequence there be usually more woman than man see in the street and it appear to be a admit fact that the female birth be more numerous than the male accord however to the church-record which i look through the reverse be at any rate in the eastern province formerly the case -lrb- carromata -rrb- at the landing-place a number of carromata be wait for we -- brightly paint shallow two-wheeled box provide with a awning and harness to a couple of horse in which stranger with money to spend be quickly drive anywhere they may desire -lrb- town of bulacan -rrb- the town of bulacan contain from 11000 to 12000 inhabitant but a month before my arrival the whole of it with the exception of the church and a few stone house have be burn to the ground all be therefore occupy in building themselves new house which oddly enough but very practically be commence at the roof like house in a draw long row of roof compose of palm-leaf and bamboo be lay in readiness on the ground and in the meantime be use as tent -lrb- frequence of fire -rrb- similar destructive fire be very common the house which with few exception be build of bamboo and wood become perfectly parch in the hot season dry into so much touchwood by the heat of the sun they inhabitant be extremely careless about fire and there be no means whatever of extinguish it if anything catch fire on a windy day the entire village as a rule be utterly do for during my stay in bulacan the whole suburb of san miguel in the neighborhood of manila be burn down with the exception of the house of a swiss friend of mine which owe its safety to the vigorous use of a private fire-engine and the intermediation of a small garden full of banana whose stem full of sap stop the progress of the flame -lrb- to calumpit by carriage -rrb- i travel to calumpit a distance of three league in the handsome carriage of a hospitable friend the road be good and be continuously shaded by fruit-tree coco and areca palm the aspect of this fruitful province remind I of the richest district of java but the pueblo here exhibit more comfort than the desa there the house be more substantial numerous roomy construction of wood in many case even of stone denote in every island the residence of official and local magnate but while even the poorer javanese always give they wicker hut a smart appearance border the road of they village with bloom hedge and display everywhere a sense of neatness and cleanliness there be here far fewer evidence of taste to be meet with i miss too the alun-alun that pretty and carefully tend open square which shaded by waringa tree be to be meet with in every village in java and the quantity and variety of the fruit tree under whose leave the desa of java be almost hide be by no means as great in this province although it be the garden of the philippine as in its dutch prototype -lrb- calumpit -rrb- i reach calumpit towards evening just as a procession resplendent with flag and torch and melodious with song be march round the stately church whose worthy priest on the strength of a letter of introduction from madrid give I a most hospitable reception calumpit a prosperous place of 12250 inhabitant be situate at the junction of the quingua and pampanga river in a extremely fruitful plain fertilize by the frequent overflow of the two stream -lrb- mt arayat -rrb- about six league to the north-west of calumpit mount arayat a lofty isolate conical hill lift its head see from calumpit its western slope meet the horizon at a angle of 20 ° its eastern at one of 25 ° and the profile of its summit have a gentle inclination of from 4 ° to 5 ° -lrb- pick fish -rrb- at calumpit i see some chinese catch fish in a peculiar fashion across the lower end of the bed of a brook which be nearly dry up and in which there be only a few rivulet leave run they have fasten a hurdle of bamboo and throw up a shallow dam behind it the water which collect be throw over the dam with a long-handled winnowing shovel the shovel be tie to a bamboo frame work ten foot high the elasticity of which make the work much easier as soon as the pool be empty the fisherman be easily able to pick out of the mud a quantity of small fish -lrb- ophiocephalus vagus -rrb- these fish which be provide with peculiar organism to facilitate respiration at any rate enable they to remain for some considerable time on dry land be in the wet season so numerous in the ditch pond and rice-field that they can be kill with a stick when the water sink they also retire or accord to professor semper bear deeply into the ooze at the bottom of the watercourse where protect by a hard crust of earth from the persecution of mankind they sleep away the winter this chinese method of fishing seem well adapt to the habit of the fish the circumstance that the dam be only construct at the lower end of the watercourse and that it be there that the fish be to be meet with in the greatest number seem to indicate that they can travel in the ooze and that as the brook and ditch get dry up they seek the larger water channel -lrb- to baliwag -rrb- follow the quingua in its upward and eastward course as it meander through a well-cultivated and luxuriantly fertile country past stone-built church and chapel which group themselves with the surround palm-tree and bamboo-bush into sylvan vignette father llano 's four-horsed carriage bring I to the important town of baliwag the industry of which be celebrate beyond the limit of the province -lrb- board house and they furniture -rrb- i visit several family and receive a friendly reception from all of they the house be build of board and be place upon pile elevated five foot above the ground each consist of a spacious dwelling apartment which open on one side into the kitchen and on the other on to a open space the azotea a lofty roof of palm-trees spread itself above the dwelling the entrance to which be through the azotea the latter be half cover by the roof i have just mention the floor be compose of slat a inch in width lay half that distance apart chair table bench a cupboard a few small ornament a mirror and some lithograph in frame compose the furniture of the interior the cleanliness of the house and the arrangement of its contents testify to the existence of order and prosperity -lrb- tapi weave -rrb- i find the woman in almost all the house occupy in weave tapi which have a great reputation in the manila market they be narrow thickly-woven silk scarve six vara in length with oblique white stripe on a dark-brown ground they be wear above the sarong -lrb- petaca cigar case -rrb- baliwag be also especially famous for its petaca -lrb- 60 -rrb- cigar-case which surpass all other in delicacy of workmanship they be not make of straw but of fine strip of spanish cane and particularly from the lower end of the leaf-stalk of the calamusart which be say to grow only in the province of nueva ecija -lrb- preparation of material -rrb- a bundle of a hundred select stalk a couple of foot long cost about six real when these stalk have be split lengthway into four or five piece the inner wood be remove till nothing but the outer part remain the thin strip thus obtain be draw by the hand between a convex block and a knife fix in a sloping position and between a couple of steel blade which nearly meet -lrb- costly weave -rrb- it be a task require much patience and practice in the first operation as a rule quite one-half of the stem be broken and in the second more than half so that scarcely twenty per cent of the stalk survive the final process in very fine mat the proportionate loss be still greater the plaiting be do on wooden cylinder a case of average workmanship which cost two dollar on the spot can be manufacture in six day ' uninterrupted labor cigar-case of exceptionally intricate workmanship make to order for a connoisseur frequently cost upward of fifty dollar -lrb- volcanic stone quarry -rrb- follow the quingua from baliwag up its stream we pass several quarry where we see the thickly-packed stratum of volcanic stone which be use as a building material the bank of the river be thickly stud with prickly bamboo from ten to twelve foot high the water overflow in the rainy season and flood the plain for a great distance hence the many shell of large freshwater mussel which be to be see lie on the earth which cover the volcanic deposit the country begin to get hilly in the neighborhood of tobog a small place with no church of its own and dependent for its service upon the priest of the next parish the gentle slope of the hill be as in java cut into terrace and use for the cultivation of rice except at lucban i have never observe similar sawa anywhere else in the philippine several small sugar-field which however the people do not as yet understand how to manage properly show that the rudiment of agricultural prosperity be already in existence the road be partly cover with awning beneath which bench be place afford repose to the weary traveller i never see these out of this province one might fancy oneself in one of the most fertile and thickly-populated district of java -lrb- a convento and the parish priest -rrb- i pass the night in a convento as the dwelling of the parish priest be call in the philippine it be extremely dirty and the priest a augustinian be full of proselytish ardor i have to undergo a long geographical examination about the difference between prussium and russium be ask whether the great city of nuremberg be the capital of the grand-duchy or of the empire of russium learn that the english be on the point of return to the bosom of the catholic church and that the other would soon follow and be in short in spite of the particular recommendation of father llano very badly receive some little time afterwards i fall into the hand of two young capuchin who try to convert I but who with the exception of this little impertinence treat I capitally they give I pâtés de foie gras boil in water which i quickly recognize by the truffle swim about in the grease to punish they for they importunity i refrain from tell my host the right way to cook the pâtés which i have the pleasure of afterwards eat in the forest as i easily persuade they to sell I the tin they have leave these be the only two occasion on which i be subject to this kind of annoyance during my eighteen month ' residence in the philippine -lrb- arrangement for traveller -rrb- the traveller who be provide with a passport be however by no means oblige to rely upon priestly hospitality as he need must do in many isolate part of europe every village every hamlet have its commonhouse call casa real or tribunal in which he can take up he quarter and be supply with provision at the market price a circumstance that i be not acquaint with on the occasion of my first trip the traveller be therefore in this respect perfectly independent at least in theory though in practice he will often scarcely be able to avoid put up at the convento in the more isolate part of the country in these the priest perhaps the only white man for mile around be with difficulty persuade to miss the opportunity of housing such a rare guest to whom he be only too anxious to give up the best bedroom in he dwelling and to offer everything that he kitchen and cellar can afford everything be place before the guest in such a spirit of sincere and undisguised friendliness that he feel no obligation but on the contrary easily persuade himself that he be do he host a favor by prolong he stay upon one occasion when i have determine in spite of a invitation from the padre to occupy the casa real just as i be begin to instal myself the priest appear upon the scene with the municipal official

reputation for robbery after travel three or four mile in a northerly direction we cross the banauon at that time a mere brook meander through shingle but in the rainy season a impetuous stream more than a hundred foot broad and in a couple of hour we reach the iron-works a immense shed lie in the middle of the forest with a couple of wing at each end in which the manager a englishman who have be wreck some year before in samar live with he wife a pretty mestiza if i lay down my handkerchief my pencil or any other object the wife immediately lock they up to protect they from the kleptomania of

chair-cane be fasten -lrb- 61 -rrb- -lrb- unwelcome hospitality -rrb- upon my return to avoid spend the night at the wretched convento where i have leave my servant with my luggage i take the advice of my friend at the iron-works and start late in order to arrive at the priest 's after ten o'clock at night for i know that the padre shut up he house at ten and that i could therefore sleep without offend he beneath the roof of a wealthy mestizo a acquaintance of theirs about half-past ten i reach the latter 's house and sit down to table with the merry woman of the family who be just have they supper suddenly my friend the parson make he appearance from a inner room where with a couple of augustinian friar he have be play card with the master of the house he immediately begin to compliment

posture indeed the banca-builder appear to have neglect to consider a bamboo hurdle place at the bottom of the boat protect the traveller from the water and serve he as a couch jurien de la gravière -lrb- 62 -rrb- compare the banca to a cigar-box in which the traveller be so tightly pack that he would have little chance of save he life if it happen to upset the crew be compose of four rower and a helmsman they daily pay be five real apiece in all nearly seven peso high wages for such lazy fellow in comparison with the price of provision for the rice that a hard-working man eat in a day seldom cost more than seven centavo -lrb- in the province often scarcely six -rrb- and the rest of he food -lrb- fish and vegetable -rrb- only one centavo we pass several village and tienda on the bank in which food be expose for sale my crew after try to interrupt the journey under all sort of pretence leave the boat as we come to a village say that they be go to fetch some sail but they forget to

lagoon of bay a fresh water lake thirty-five league in circumference that wash the shore of three fertile province manila laguna and cavite formerly large vessel full of cargo use to be able to sail right up to the border of the lake now they be prevent by sandbank even flat-bottomed boat frequently run aground on the napindan and taguig bank -lrb- 63 -rrb- be the bank remove and the stone bridge join manila to binondo replace by a swing bridge or a canal make round it the coast vessel would be able to ship the produce of the lagoon province at the very foot of the field in which they grow the traffic would be very profitable the water would shrink and the shallows along the shore might be turn into rice and sugar field a scheme of this kind be approve more than thirty year ago in madrid but it be never carry into execution the sand up of the river have on the contrary be increase by a quantity of fish reel the erection of which have be favor by the colonial waterway board because it reap a small tax from they -lrb- a famous plantation -rrb- jalajalum a estate which occupy the eastern of the two peninsula which run southward into the lake be one of the first place visit by stranger it owe this preference to its beautiful position and nearness to manila and to the fantastic description of it by a former owner de la gironnière the soil of the peninsula be volcanic its range of hill be very rugged and the watercourse bring down annually a quantity of soil from the mountain which increase the deposit at they base the shore-line overgrown with grass and prickly sensitive-plant quite eight foot high make capital pasture for carabao behind it broad field of rice and sugar extend themselves up to the base of the hill towards the north the estate be bound by the thickly-wooded sembrano the highest mountain in the peninsula on the remain side it be surround with water with the exception of the flat shore the whole place be hilly and overgrown with grass and clump of tree capital pasture for its numerous herd -- a thousand carabao one thousand five hundred to two thousand bullock and from six to seven hundred nearly wild horse as we be descend one of the

beyond jalajalum on the south coast of the lagoon of bay lie the hamlet of lo baños so call from a hot spring at the foot of the makiling volcano even prior to the arrival of the spaniard the native use its water as a remedy -lrb- 64 -rrb- but they be now very little patronize the shore of the lake be at this point and indeed all round its circumference so flat that it be impossible to land with dry foot from the shallowest canoe it be quite cover with sand mussel north-west of lo baños there lie a small volcanic lake fringe with thick wood call dagatan -lrb- the enchanted lagoon of traveller -rrb- to distinguish it from dagât as the tagal call the great lagoon of bay i see nothing of the crocodile which be suppose to infest it but we flush several flock of wild fowl disturb by we invasion of they solitude from los baños i have intend to go to lupang putus -lrb- white earth -rrb- where judge from the sample show I there be a deposit of fine white silicious earth which be purify in manila and use as paint i do not reach the place as the guide whom i have with difficulty obtain pretend after a couple of mile to be dead beat from the inquiry i make however i apprehend that it be a

of a clearing occupy by a few miserable hut be uninhabited and thickly overgrow with forest and undergrowth in the center of the island be the susong-dalaga -lrb- maiden 's bosom -rrb- a dolerite hill with a beautifully form crest upon the shore on a bare rock i find four egg contain fully develop young crocodile when i break the shell the little reptile make off -lrb- m de la gironnière -rrb- although the south-west monsoon generally occur later in jalajalum than in manila it be already rain so hard that i decide to go to calauan on the southern shore of the lake which be protect by mount makiling and do not experience the effect of the rainy monsoon till later in the season i meet m de la gironnière in calauan the gentilhomme breton who be so well know for tell the most terrible adventure he have lately return from europe to establish a large sugar manufactory he enterprise however be a failure the house of the lively old gentleman whose eccentricity have lead he to adopt the

lead to san pablo lie the llanura de imuc a valley of dolerite more than a hundred foot deep large block of basalt enable one to climb down into the valley the bottom of which be cover with dense growth the center of the basin be occupy by a neglect coffee plantation lay out by a former proprietor the density of the vegetation prevent my take more precise observation there be another shallower volcanic crater to the north of it its soil be marshy and cover with cane and grass but even in the rainy season it do not collect sufficient water to turn it into a lake it might therefore be easily drain and cultivate to the south-west of this basin and to the right of the road to san pablo lie the -lrb- tigui-mere -rrb- tigui-mere from a plain of whitish-grey soil cover with concentric shell as large as a nut rise a circular embankment with gently-sloping side intersect only by a small cleft which serve as a entrance and which show on its edge denude of vegetation the loose rapillus of which the embankment be form the side of this natural amphitheatre tower more than a hundred foot above its flat base a path run east and west right through the center the northern half be stud with cocopalm tree and cultivate plant the southern portion be full of water nearly cover with green weed and slime the ground consist of black rapillus -lrb- leaf imprint in lava -rrb- from the tigui-mere i return to the hacienda a bank form of volcanic lava two foot in thickness and cover with indistinct impression of leaf they state of preservation do not allow I to distinguish they species but they certainly belong to some tropical genus and be accord to professor a braun of the same kind as those now grow there there be two more small lake half a league to the south-east the road lead to they be compose of volcanic remains which cover the soil and large block of lava lie in the bed of the stream -lrb- maycap lake -rrb- the first of the two the maycap lake be entirely embank with the exception of a small opening fit with sluice to supply water to a canal and from its northern side which alone admit of a open view the southern peak of san cristobal may be see about 73 ° to the north-east its bank which be about eighty foot high rise with a gentle slope in a westerly direction till they join mount maiba a hill about 500 foot high the soil like that of the embankment of the other volcanic lake consist of rapillus and lava and be thickly wood -lrb- lake palakpakan -rrb- close by be another lake palakpakan of nearly the same circumference and form in a similar manner -lrb- of black sand and rapillus -rrb- its bank be from thirty to one hundred foot high from its north-western edge san cristobal lift its head 70 ° to the northeast its water be easily reach and be much frequent by fisherman -lrb- palm brandy -rrb- about nine o'clock be i ride from calauan to pilum and thence in a northeasterly direction to santa cruz over even broad and well-kept road through a palm-grove a mile long and a mile and a half broad which extend down to the very edge of the lagoon the product of these palm tree generally be not use for the production of oil but for the manufacture of brandy they fruit be not allow to come to maturity but the bud be slit open and the sweet sap be collect as it drip from they it be then allow to ferment and subject to distillation -lrb- 66 -rrb- as the sap be collect twice a day and as the blossom situate at the top of the tree be forty or fifty foot above the ground bamboo be fasten horizontally one above the other from one tree to another to facilitate the necessary ascent and descent the sap collector stand on the lower cross-piece while he hold on to the upper -lrb- buy by government -rrb- the sale of palm-brandy be at the time of my visit the monopoly of the government which retail it in the estanco -lrb- government sale room -rrb- with cigar stamp paper and religious indulgence the manufacture be carry on by private individual but the whole of the brandy be of necessity dispose of to the administration which however pay such a high price for it that the contractor make large profit -lrb- profit in manufacture -rrb- i afterwards meet a spaniard in camarine who accord to he own account must have make considerable and easy gain from these contract he have buy palm-tree at a average price of five real apiece -lrb- they usually cost more though they can be sometimes purchase for two real -rrb- thirty-five palm will furnish daily at least thirty-six quart of tuba -lrb- sugar-containing sap -rrb- from which after fermentation and distillation six quart of brandy of the prescribed strength can be manufacture one man be sufficient to attend to they and receive for he trouble half the proceeds the administration pay six cuarto for a quart of brandy my friend the contractor be in annual receipt therefore from every thirty-five of he tree of 360 × 1\/2 × 5 cuarto = $ 4050 as the thirty-five tree only cost he $ 21875 he invest capital bring he in about 200 per cent -lrb- wine and liquor monopoly a failure -rrb- the proceeds of this monopoly -lrb- wine and liquor -rrb- be rate at $ 1622810 in the colonial budget for 1861 but its collection be so difficult and so disproportionately expensive that it nearly swallow up the whole profit it cause espionage robbery of all sort embezzlement and bribery on a large scale the retail of the brandy by official who be pay by a percentage on the consumption do a good deal to injure the popular respect for the government moreover the imposition of this improper tax on the most important industry of the country not only cripple the free trade in palm but also the manufacture of raw sugar for the government to favor they own monopoly have forbid the sugar manufacturer to make rum from they molasses which become in consequence so valueless that in manila they give it to they horse the complaint of the manufacturer at last stir up the administration to allow the manufacture of rum but the palm-brandy monopoly remain intact the filipino now drink nothing but rum so that at last in self-defence the government entirely abandon the monopoly -lrb- January 1864 -rrb- since that the rum manufacturer pay tax accord to the amount of they sale but not upon the amount of they raw produce in order to cover the deficit occasion by the abandonment of the brandy monopoly the government have make a small increase in the poll-tax the practice of drinking brandy have naturally much increase it be however a very old habit -lrb- 67 -rrb-

convento at majaijaus build by the jesuit be celebrate for its splendid situation the lagoon of bay be see to extend far to the north-east in the distance the peninsula of jalajalum and the island of talim from which rise the susong-dalaga volcano terminate the vista from the convento to the lake stretch a endless grove of coco-tree while towards the south the slope of the distant high ground grow suddenly steeper and form a abruptly precipitous conical hill intersect by deep ravine this be the banajao or majaijaus volcano and beside it mount san cristobal rear its bell-shaped summit -lrb- scenery along lucban-maubon road -rrb- as everybody be occupy with the preparation for a ensue religious festival i betook myself through lucban on the eastern shore to mauban situated amidst deep

along the narrow watercourse of the mapon river through deep ravine with perpendicular cliff of clay i observe several terrace-formed rice-field similar to those so prevalent in java a infrequent sight in the philippine presently the path lead we into the very thick of the forest nearly all the tree be cover with aroide and creep fern amongst they i notice the angiopteri pandanus and several large specimen of the fan palm -lrb- mapon river -rrb- three league from lucban the river flow under a rock support on prismatically shape pillar and then run through a bed of round pebble compose of volcanic stone and white lime as hard as marble in which impression of shell-fish and coral can be trace further up the river the volcanic rubble disappear and the contain stratum then consist of the marble-like pebble cement together with calcareous spar these stratum alternate with bank of clay and coarse-grained soil which contain scanty and badly preserved imprint of leaf and mussel-fish amongst they however i observe a flatten but still recognizable specimen of the fossil melanium the river-bed must be quite five hundred foot above the level of the sea -lrb- bamboo raft ferry -rrb- about a league beyond mauban as it be get dusk we cross the river then tolerably broad on a wretched leak bamboo raft which sink at least six inch beneath the water under the weight of we horse and

flow between two high bank of rocky soil thickly cover with vegetation and leap from a ledge of volcanic rock suddenly plunge into a ravine say to be three hundred and sixty foot in depth along the bottom of which it be hurry away the channel however be so narrow and the vegetation so dense that a observer look at it from above can not follow its course this waterfall have a great similarity to that which fall from the semeru in java here as there a volcanic stream flow over vast rocky deposit form a horizontal watercourse which in its turn be overshadow with immense mass of rock the water easily force its way between these till it reach the solid lava when it leave its high narrow and thickly-wooded bank and plunge into the deep chasm it have itself worn away the pour rain unfortunately prevent I from sketch this fine fall it be rain when i reach the convento of majaijaus and it be still rain when i leave it three day later nor be there any hope of improvement in the weather for another month to come the wet season last for eight or nine month in majaijaus and during the whole period scarcely a day pass without the rain fall in torrent -- estado geograph -lrb- majaijaus -rrb- to ascend the volcano be under such circumstance impracticable accord to some note write by the majaijaus priest a ascent and survey of mount banajao be make on the 22nd of April 1858

another volcano in albay and of the island of polillo they estimate the altitude of banajao to be seven thousand and twenty spanish foot and the depth of its crater to be seven hundred the crater formerly contain a lake but the last eruption make a chasm in its southern side through which the water flow away -lrb- 69 -rrb- -lrb- calauan -rrb- i reach calauan in the pour rain wade through the soft spongy clay upon wretched half-starved pony and find i must put off my water journey to manila till the follow day as there be no boat on the lake at this point the next morning there be no horse to be find and it be not till the afternoon that i procure a cart and a couple of carabao to take I to santa cruz whence in the evening the market-vessel start for manila one carabao be harness in front the other be fasten behind the cart in order that i might have a change of animal when the first become tired carabao number one would not draw and number two act as a drag -- rather useless apparatus on a level road -- so i change they as soon as number two feel the load it lay down a few blow persuade it to pick itself up when it deliberately walk to the nearest pool and drop into it it be with the greatest trouble that we unharness the cart and push it back on to the road while we two considerate beast take a mud bath at last we reload the baggage the carabao be reharness in the original position and the driver lean he whole weight upon the nose-rope of the lead beast pull with might and main to my great delight the animal condescend to slowly advance with the cart and its contents -lrb- pilum -rrb- at pila i manage to get a better team with which late in the evening in the midst of a pour rain i reach a little hamlet opposite santa cruz the market-vessel have leave we attempt to get a boat to take we across to the village only lead to barefaced attempt at extortion so i enter one of the largest of the hamlet 's house which be occupy by a widow and she daughter after some delay my request for a night 's lodging be grant i send for some oil to give I a little light and something to eat the woman bring in some of they relation who help to prepare the food and stop in the house to protect its owner the next morning i cross the river teem with joyous bather to santa cruz and hire a boat there to take I across the lake to pasig and from thence to manila a contrary wind however force we to land on the promontory of jalajalum and there wait for the calm that accompany the dawn -lrb- earthquake evidence -rrb- betwixt the extreme southern point of the land and the house i saw in several place bank of mussel project at least fifteen foot above the surface of the water similar to those which be so frequently find on the sea-coast -- a proof that earthquake have take place in this neighborhood chapter viii -lrb- to albay by schooner -rrb- towards the end of August i start from manila for albay in a schooner which have bring a cargo of hemp and be return in ballast it be fine when we set sail but on the follow day the sign of a come storm increase so rapidly that the captain resolve to return and seek protection in the small but secure harbor of marivele a creek on the southern shore of bataan the province form the western boundary of manila bay we reach it about two o'clock in the night after cruise about for fourteen hour before the entrance and we be oblige to remain here at anchor for a fortnight as it rain and storm continuously for that period -lrb- marivele -rrb- the weather oblige I to limit my excursion to the immediate neighborhood of marivele unfortunately it be not till the close of we stay that i learn that there be a colony of negrito in the mountain and it be not till just before my departure that i get a chance of see and sketch a couple of they male and female the inhabitant of marivele have not a very good reputation the place be only visit by ship which run in there in bad weather when they idle crew spend the time in drinking and gamble some of the young girl be of striking beauty and of quite a light color often be in reality of mixed race though they pass as of pure tagal blood this be a circumstance i have observe in many seaport and in the neighborhood of manila but in the district which be almost entirely unvisited by the spaniard the native be much darker and of purer race -lrb- storm-bound shipping -rrb- the number of ship which be seek protection from the weather in this port amount to ten of which three be schooner every morning regularly a small pontin -lrb- 70 -rrb- use to attempt to set sail but it scarcely get a look at the open sea before it return when it be salute with the jeer and laughter of the other it be hunger that make they so bold the crew who have take some of they own produce to manila have spend the proceeds of they venture and have start on they return voyage scantily provide with provision with the hope and intention of soon reach they home which they could have do with any favorable wind such case frequently occur a few native unite to charter a small vessel and load it with the produce of they own field which they set off to sell in manila -lrb- the strait -rrb- the strait between the island resemble beautiful wide river with charming spot upon the bank inhabit by small colony and the sailor generally find the weather get squally towards evening and anchor till the morning break -lrb- filipino hospitality -rrb- the hospitable coast supply they with fish crab plenty of mussel and frequently unprotected coconut if it be inhabit so much the better filipino hospitality be ample and much more comprehensive than that practice in europe the crew be accommodate in the different hut after a repast share in common and wash down by copious draught of palm-wine mat be strech on the floor the lamp -- large shell fit with rush wick -- be extinguish and the occupant of the hut fall asleep together once as i be sail into the bay of manila after a five day 's cruise we overtake a craft which have sail from the same port as we have with a cargo of coconut oil for manila and which have spend six month upon its trip it be by no means uncommon for a crew which make a long stay in the capital to squander the whole proceeds of they cargo if they have not do it before reach town -lrb- coast luzon -rrb- at last one evening when the storm have quite pass away we sail out of marivele a small volcanic pillar-shaped rock bear a striking resemblance to the island of the cyclops off the coast of sicily lie in front of the harbor -- like there a sharp pyramid and a small flat island we sail along the coast of cavite till we reach point santiago the southwestern extremity of luzon and then turn to the east through the fine strait that lie between luzon to the north and the bisayan island to the south as the sun rise a beautiful spectacle present itself to the north be the peak of the taal volcano towering above the flat plain of batanga and to the south the thickly-wooded but rock-bound coast of mindoro the iron line of which be break by the harbor of porto galera protect from the fury of the wave by a small islet lie immediately before it the water around we be thickly stud with vessel which have take refuge from the storm in the bisayan port and be now return to manila -lrb- importance of strait -rrb- these strait which extend from the south-east to the northwest be the great commercial highway of the archipelago and remain navigable during the whole year be protect from the fury of the north-easterly wind by the shelter peninsula of luzon which project to the south-east and by samar which extend in a parallel direction while the bisayan island shield they from the blast that blow from the south-west the island of mindoro panay negro cebu and bohol which nature have place in close succession to each other form the southern border of the strait and the narrow cross channel between they form as many outlet to the sea of mindoro which be bound on the west by palawan on the east by mindanao and on the south by the sulu group the eastern water of the strait wash the coast of samar and leyte and penetrate through three small channel only to the great ocean the narrow strait of san bernardino of san juanico and of surigao several considerable and innumerable smaller islet lie within the area of these cursorily explain outline -lrb- batanga coast -rrb- a couple of bay on the south coast of batanga offer a road-stead though but little real protection to pass vessel which in stormy weather make for porto galera in the island of mindoro which lie directly opposite a river a league and a half in length join taal the principal port of the province to the great inland sea of taal or bombon this stream be formerly navigable but it have now become so sand up that it be passable only at flood tide and then only by very small vessel -lrb- batanga export -rrb- the province of batanga supplies manila with its best cattle and export sugar and coffee a hilly range bound the horizon on the luzon side the striking outline of which enable one to conjecture its volcanic origin most of the smaller island to the south appear to consist of superimpose mountainous range terminate seaward in precipitous cliff the lofty and symmetrical peak of mount mayon be the highest point in the panoramic landscape towards evening we sight mount bulusan in the south-eastern extremity of luzon and presently we turn northwards and sail up the strait of san bernardino which separate luzon from samar -lrb- bulusan like vesuvius -rrb- the bulusan volcano which appear to have be for a long time extinct but which again begin to erupt in 1852 -lrb- 71 -rrb- be surprisingly like vesuvius in outline it have like its prototype a couple of peak the western one a bell-shaped summit be the eruption cone the eastern apex be a tall rugged mound probably the remains of a huge circular crater as in vesuvius the present crater be in the center of the extinct one the interval between they be considerably larger and more uneven than the atrio del cavallo of the italian volcano -lrb- san bernardino current -rrb- the current be so powerful in the strait of san bernardino that we be oblige to anchor twice to avoid be carry back again to we left we have continually in view the magnificent bulusan volcano with a hamlet of the same name nestle at the foot of its eastern slope in a grove of coco-tree close to the sea struggle with difficulty against the force of the current we succeed with the assistance of light and fickle wind in reach legaspus the port of albay on the follow evening we skipper a spaniard have determine to accomplish the trip as rapidly as possible -lrb- a native captain -rrb- on my return voyage however i fall into the hand of a native captain and as my cruise under he auspices present many peculiarity i may quote a few passage relate to it from my diary the skipper intend to have take a stock of vegetable for my use but he have forget they he therefore land on a small island and presently make he reappearance with a huge palm cabbage which in the absence of its owner he have pick from a tree he cut down for the purpose on another occasion the crew make a descent upon a hamlet on the north-western coast of leyte to purchase provision instead of lay in a stock for the voyage at tacloban the sailor prefer do so at some smaller village on the shore of the strait where food be cheaper and where they landing give they a pretext to run about the country the strait of san juanico never more than a mile and often only eight hundred foot broad be about twenty mile in length : yet it often take a vessel a week to sail up they for contrary wind and a adverse current force it to anchor frequently and to lie to for whole night in the narrower place towards evening we captain think that the sky appear very threatening so he make for the bay of navo of masbate -lrb- a intermittent voyage -rrb- there he anchor and a part of the crew go on shore the next day be a Sunday the captain think the sky still appear very threatening and besides he want to make some purchase so we anchor again off magdalena where we pass the night on Monday a favorable wind take we at a quicker rate past marinduque and the rocky islet of elefante which lie in front of it elefante appear to be a extinct volcano it look somewhat like the iriga but be not so lofty it be cover with capital pasture and its ravine be dot with clump of tree nearly a thousand head of half-wild cattle be grazing on it they cost four dollar a-piece and they freight to manila be as much more where they sell for sixteen dollar they be badly tend and many be steal by the pass sailor my friend the captain be full of regret that the favorable wind give he no opportunity of landing perhaps i be the real obstacle they be splendid beast how easy it would be to put a couple on board they could scarcely be say to have any real owner the nominal proprietor be quite unaware how many they possess and the herd be continually multiply without any addition from its master a man land with a little money in he pocket if he meet a herdsman he give he a dollar and the poor creature think himself a lucky fellow if not so much the better he can do the business himself a barrel of shot or a sling suffice to settle the matter -lrb- plunder -rrb- as we sail along we see come towards we another vessel the luisa which suddenly execute a very extraordinary tack and in a minute or two its crew send up a loud shout of joy have succeed in steal a fishbox which the fisherman of marinduque have sink in the sea they have lower a hook and be clever enough to grapple the rope of the float buoy we captain be beside himself with envy of they prize -lrb- legaspus -rrb- legaspus be the principal port of the province of albay its road-stead however be very unsafe and be expose to the north-easterly storm be perfectly useless during the winter the north-east wind be the prevail one on this coast the south-west breeze only blow in June and July the heaviest storm occur between October and January they generally set in with a gentle westerly wind accompany with rain the gale presently veer round to the north or the south and attain the height of its fury when it reach the north-east or the south-east after the storm a calm generally reign succeed by the usual wind of the prevail monsoon the lightly-built elastic house of the country be capitally suit to withstand these storm but roof and defective house be frequently carry away the traffic between manila and legaspus be at its height between January and October but during the autumn month all communication by water cease the letter-post which arrive pretty regularly every week be then the only link between the two place at this season heavy package can be send only by a circuitous and expensive route along the south coast and thence by water to manila much more favorably situate for navigation be the port of -lrb- sorsogon -rrb- sorsogon the mouth of which open to the west and be protect by the island of bagalao which lie in front of it besides its security as a harbor it have the advantage of a rapid and unbroken communication with the capital of the archipelago while vessel sail from legaspus even at the most favorable time of the year be oblige to go round the eastern peninsula of luzon and meet the principal current of the strait of san bernardino frequently a very difficult undertaking and moreover small vessel oblige to anchor there be in great danger of be capture by pirate the country about sorsogon however be not so fertile as the neighborhood of legaspus -lrb- a worthy official -rrb- i take letter of introduction with I to both the spanish authority of the province who receive I in the most amiable way and be of the greatest use to I during the whole of my stay in the vicinity i have also the good fortune to fall in with a model alcalde a man of good family and of most charming manners in short a genuine caballero to show the popular appreciation of the honesty of he character it be say of he in samar that he have enter the province with nothing but a bundle of papers and have leave it as lightly equip chapter ix -lrb- daraga -rrb- my spanish friend enable I to rent a house in daraga -lrb- 72 -rrb- a well-to-do town of twenty thousand inhabitant at the foot of the mayon a league and a half from legaspus the summit of this volcano be consider inaccessible until two young scotchman paton and stewart by name demonstrate the contrary -lrb- 73 -rrb- since then several native have ascend the mountain but no european -lrb- ascent of mayon -rrb- i set out on September 25th and pass the night by the advice of señor muños in a hut one thousand foot above the level of the sea in order to begin the ascent the next morning with unimpaired vigor but a number of idler who insist on follow I and who keep up a tremendous noise all night frustrate the purpose of this friendly advice and i start about five in the morning but little refresh the fiery glow i have notice about the crater disappear with the dawn the first few hundred foot of the ascent be cover with a tall grass quite six foot high and then come a slope of a thousand foot or so of short grass succeed by a quantity of moss but even this soon disappear and the whole of the upper part of the mountain prove entirely barren we reach the summit about one o'clock it be cover with fissure which give out sulphurous gas and steam in such profusion that we be oblige to stop we mouth and nostril with we handkerchief to prevent ourselves from be suffocate we come to a halt at the edge of a broad and deep chasm from which issue a particularly dense vapor apparently we be on the brink of a crater but the thick fume of the disagreeable vapor make it impossible for we to guess at the breadth of the fissure the absolute top of the volcano consist of a ridge nearly ten foot thick of solid mass of stone cover with a crust of lava bleached by the action of the escape gas several irregular block of stone lie about we show that the peak have once be a little higher when now and again the gust of wind make rift in the vapor we perceive on the northern corner of the plateau several rocky column at least a hundred foot high which have hitherto withstand both storm and eruption i afterwards have a opportunity of observe the summit from daraga with a capital telescope on a very clear day when i notice that the northern side of the crater be considerably higher than its southern edge -lrb- the descent -rrb- we descent take some time we have still two-third of it beneath we when night overtake we in the hope of reach the hut where we have leave we provision we wander about till eleven o'clock hungry and weary and at last be oblige to wait for daylight this misfortune be owe not to we want of proper precaution but to the unreliability of the carrier two of they whom we have take with we to carry water and refreshment have disappear at the very first and a third a very trustworthy man whom we have leave to take care of we thing at the hut and who have be order to meet we at dusk with torch have bolt as i afterwards discover back to daraga before noon my servant too who be carry a woolen blanket and a umbrella for I suddenly vanish in the darkness as soon as it begin to rain and though i repeatedly call he never turn up again till the next morning we pass the wet night upon the bare rock where as we very thin clothes be perfectly wet through we chill till we tooth chatter as soon however as the sun rise we get so warm that we soon recover we temper towards nine o'clock we reach the hut and get something to eat after twenty-nine hour ' fast -lrb- a suspicious medal -rrb- in the trabajos y hechos nolables de la soc econom de los amigos del pais for September 4th 1823 it be say that don antonio siguenza pay a visit to the volcano of albay on march 11th and that the society order a medal to be strike in commemoration of the event and in honor of the aforesaid siguenza and he companion everybody in albay however assure I that the two scotchman be the first to reach the top of the mountain it be true that in the above notice the ascent of the volcano be not directly mention but the fact of the medal naturally lead we to suppose that nothing less can be refer to arena in he memoir say : mayon be survey by captain siguenza from the crater to the base which be nearly at the level of the sea he find that it measure sixteen hundred and eighty-two spanish foot or four sixty-eight and two-third meter a little further on he add that he have read in the record of the society that they have have a gold medal strike in honor of siguenza who have make some investigation about the volcano 's crater in 1823 he therefore appear to have have some doubt about siguenza 's actual ascent -lrb- a early friar attempt -rrb- accord to the franciscan record a couple of monk attempt the ascent in 1592 in order to cure the native of they superstitious belief about the mountain one of they never return but the other although he do not reach the summit be stop by three deep abyss make a hundred convert to christianity by the mere relation of he adventure he die in the same year in consequence it be record of the many variation of temperature to which he be expose in he ascent of the volcano -lrb- estimate of height -rrb- some book say that the mountain be of considerable height but the estado geografico of the franciscan for 1855 where one could scarcely expect to find such a thoughtless repetition of so gross a typographical error say that the measurement of siguenza give the mountain a height of sixteen hundred and eighty-two foot accord to my own barometrical read the height of the summit above the level of the sea be twenty-three hundred and seventy-four meter or eighty-five hundred and fifty-nine spanish foot chapter x -lrb- a accident and a month 's rest -rrb- i sprained my foot so badly in ascend mayon that i be oblige to keep the house for a month under the circumstance i be not sorry to find myself settle in a roomy and comfortable dwelling my house be build upon the bank of a small stream and stand in the middle of a garden in which coffee cacao orange papaya and banana grow luxuriantly in spite of the tall weed which surround they several over-ripe berry have fall to the ground and i have they collect roasted mixed with a equal quantity of sugar and make into chocolate a art in which the native greatly excel with the spaniard chocolate take the place of coffee and tea and even the mestizo and the well-to-do native drink a great deal of it -lrb- cacao -rrb- the cacao-tree come from central america it flourish there between the 23rd parallel north and the 20th south latitude but it be only at its best in the hottest and dampest climate in temperate climate where the thermometer mark less than 23 ° c it produce no fruit -lrb- high quality -rrb- it be first import into the philippine from acapulco either accord to camarine by a pilot call pedro brabo de lagunas in 1670 or accord to samar by some jesuit during salcedo 's government between 1663 and 1668 since then it have spread over the greater part of the island and although it be not cultivate with any excessive care its fruit be of excellent quality the cacao of albay if its cheapness be take into consideration may be consider at least equal to that of caraca which be so highly-prized in europe and which on account of its high price generally be largely mixed with inferior kind -lrb- 74 -rrb- the bush be usually find in small garden close to the house but so great be the native laziness that frequently the berry be allow to decay although the local cacao sell for a higher price than the import at cebu and negro a little more attention be pay to its cultivation -lrb- scanty production -rrb- but it do not suffice to supply the want of the colony which import the deficiency from ternate and mindanao the best cacao of the philippine be produce in the small island of maripipus which lie to the north-west of leyte and it be difficult to obtain the entire crop generally be long bespoke it cost about one dollar per liter whereas the albay cacao cost from two to two and a half dollar per ganta -lrb- three liter -rrb- -lrb- culture -rrb- the native generally cover the kernel just as they be begin to sprout with a little earth and place they in a spirally-rolled leaf hang they up beneath the roof of they dwelling they grow very rapidly and to prevent they be choke by weed be plant out at very short interval this method of treatment be probably the reason that the cacao-tree in the philippine never attain a greater height than eight or ten foot while in they native soil they frequently reach thirty and sometimes even forty foot the tree begin to bear fruit in its third or fourth year and in its fifth or sixth it reach maturity when it usually yield a ganta of cacao which as i have mention be worth from two to two and a half dollar and always find a purchaser -lrb- 75 -rrb- -lrb- neglect -rrb- the profit arise from a large plantation would therefore be considerable yet it be very rare to meet with one i hear it say that the economical society have offer a considerable reward to any one who could exhibit a plantation of ten thousand berry-bearing tree but in the society 's report i find no mention of this reward -lrb- damage by storm -rrb- the great obstacle in the way of large plantation be the heavy storm which recur almost regularly every year and often destroy a entire plantation in a single day in 1856 a hurricane visit the island just before the harvest and completely tear up several large plantation by the root a catastrophe that naturally have cause much discouragement to the cultivator -lrb- 76 -rrb- one consequence of this state of thing be that the free importation of cacao be permit and people be enable to purchase guayaqual cacao at fifteen dollar per quintal while that grow at home cost double the money -lrb- disease and pest -rrb- the plant be sometimes attack by a disease the origin of which be unknown when it suffer severely from certain noxious insect -lrb- 77 -rrb- it be also attack by rat and other predatory vermin the former sometimes fall upon it in such number that they destroy the entire harvest in a single night traveller in america say that a well-kept cacao plantation be a very picturesque sight in the philippine however or at any rate in east luzon the closely-packed lifeless-looking moss-covered tree present a dreary spectacle they existence be a brief one they oval leaf sometimes nearly a foot long droop singly from the twig and form no luxuriant mass of foliage they blossom be very insignificant they be of a reddish-yellow no larger than the flower of the lime and grow separately on long weedy stalk the fruit ripen in six month when it be mature it be of either a red or a yellow tint and be somewhat like a very rough gherkin only two variety appear to be cultivate in the philippine -lrb- 78 -rrb- the pulp of the fruit be white tender and of a agreeable acid taste and contain from eighteen to twenty-four kernel arrange in five row these kernel be as large as almond and like they consist of a couple of husk and a small core this be the cacao bean which roasted and finely ground produce cacao and with the addition of sugar and generally of spice make chocolate till the last few year every household in the philippine make its own chocolate of nothing but cacao and sugar the native who eat chocolate often add roasted rice to it nowadays there be a manufactory in manila which make chocolate in the european way the inhabitant of the eastern province be very fond of add roasted pilus nut to they chocolate -lrb- 79 -rrb- -lrb- chocolate -rrb- european first learn to make a drink from cacao in mexico where the preparation be call chocolatl -lrb- 80 -rrb- even so far back as the day of corte who be a tremendous chocolate drinker the cacao-tree be extensively cultivate the aztec use the bean as money and montezuma use to receive part of he tribute in this peculiar coin it be only the wealthy among the ancient mexican who eat pure cacao the poor on account of the value of the bean as coin use to mix maize and mandioca meal with they even in we own day the inhabitant of central america make use of the bean as small coin as they have no copper money nor smaller silver coin than the half-real both in central america and in orinoco there yet be many unpenetrated forest which be almost entirely compose of wild cacao-tree i believe the native gather some of they fruit but it be almost worthless by itself it have much less flavor than the cultivate kind certainly it be not pick and dry at the proper season and it get spoil in its long transit through the damp wood -lrb- a uncertain venture -rrb- since the abolition of slavery the crop in america have be diminish year by year and until a short time ago when the french lay out several large plantation in central america be of but trifling value accord to f engel a flourish cacao plantation require less outlay and trouble and yield more profit than any other tropical plant yet its harvest which do not yield anything for the first five or six year be very uncertain owe to the numerous insect which attack the plant in short cacao plantation be only suit to large capitalist or to very small cultivator who grow the tree in they own garden moreover as we have say since the abolition of slavery most of the plantation have fall into decay for the free slave be entirely want in industry -lrb- use in europe -rrb- the original chocolate be not generally relish in europe when however at a later period it be mix with sugar it meet with more approbation the exaggerated praise of its admirer raise a bitter opposition amongst the opponent of the new drink and the priest raise conscientious scruple against the use of so nourish a article of food on fast day the quarrel last till the seventeenth century by which time cacao have become a everyday necessity in spain it be first introduce into spain in 1520 but chocolate on account of the monopoly of the conquistador be for a long time secretly prepare on the other side of the ocean in 1580 however it be in common use in spain though it be so entirely unknown in england that in 1579 a english captain burn a capture cargo of it as useless it reach italy in 1606 and be introduce into france by anne of austrium the first chocolate-house in london be open in 1657 and in 1700 germany at last follow suit -lrb- 81 -rrb- -lrb- coffee -rrb- the history of coffee in the philippine be very similar to that of cacao the plant thrive wonderfully and its berry have so strongly mark a flavor that the worst manila coffee command as high a price as the best java in spite of this however the amount of coffee produce in the philippine be very insignificant and until lately scarcely deserve mention accord to the report of a englishman in 1828 the coffee-plant be almost unknown forty year before and be represent only by a few specimen in the botanical garden at manila it soon however increase and multiply thanks to the moderation of a small predatory animal -lrb- paradoxurus musanga -rrb- which only nibble the ripe fruit and leave the hard kernel -lrb- the coffee bean -rrb- untouched as indigestible the economical society bestir itself in its turn by offer reward to encourage the lay out of large coffee plantation in 1837 it grant to m de la gironnière a premium of $ 1000 for exhibit a coffee plantation of sixty thousand plant which be yield they second harvest and four premium to other in the following year but as soon as the reward be obtain the plantation be once more allow to fall into neglect from this it be pretty evident that the enterprise in the face of the then market price and the artificially high rate of freight do not afford a sufficient profit -lrb- export -rrb- in 1856 the export of coffee be not more than seven thousand picul in 1865 they have increase to thirty-seven thousand five hundred and eighty-eight and in 1871 to fifty-three thousand three hundred and seventy this increase however afford no criterion by which to estimate the increase in the number of plantation for these make no return for the first few year after be lay out in short larger export may be confidently expect but even greatly increase export could not be take as correct measure of the colony 's resource not till european capital call large plantation into existence in the most suitable locality will the philippine obtain they proper rank in the coffee-producing district of the world -lrb- highest grade -rrb- the best coffee come from the province of laguna batanga and cavite the worst from mindanao the latter in consequence of careless treatment be very impure and generally contain a quantity of bad bean the coffee bean of mindanao be of a yellowish-white color and flabby those of laguna be smaller but much firmer in texture -lrb- french preference -rrb- manila coffee be very highly esteem by connoisseur and be very expensive though it be by no means so nice look as that of ceylon and other more carefully prepared kind it be a remarkable fact that in 1865 france which import only $ 21000 worth of hemp from the philippine import more than $ 200000 worth of manila coffee a third of the entire coffee produce of the island -lrb- 82 -rrb- manila coffee be not much prize in london and do not fetch much more than good ceylon -lrb- $ 15 per cwt -rrb- -lrb- 83 -rrb- this however be no reproach to the coffee as every one acquaint with a englishman 's appreciation of coffee will allow -lrb- price -rrb- california a excellent customer always ready to give a fair price for a good article will in time become one of its principal consumer -lrb- 84 -rrb- in 1868 coffee in manila itself cost a average of $ 16 per picul -lrb- 85 -rrb- in java the authority pay the native who be compel to cultivate it about $ 366 per picul -lrb- philippine export -rrb- although the amount of coffee export from the philippine be trifling in comparison with the produce power of the colony it compare favorably with the export from other country -lrb- javan and ceylon crop -rrb- in my sketch of travel i compare the decrease of the coffee produce in java under the forced system of cultivation with the increase of that voluntarily grow in ceylon and give the javanese produce for 1858 as sixty-seven thousand ton and the cingalese as thirty-five thousand ton since that time the relative decrease and increase have continue and in 1866 the dutch indy produce only fifty-six thousand ton and ceylon thirty-six thousand ton -lrb- 86 -rrb- -lrb- amateur scientist -rrb- during my enforced stay in daraga the native bring I mussel and snail for sale and several of they wish to enter my service as they feel a particular vocation for natural history at last my kitchen be always full of they they sally forth every day to collect insect and as a rule be not particularly fortunate in they search but this be of no consequence in fact it serve to give they a fresh appetite for they meal some of the neighbor spaniard pay I almost daily visit and several of the native and mestizo dignitary from a distance be good enough to call upon I not so much for the purpose of see my humble self as of inspect my hat the fame of which have spread over the whole province it be construct in the usual judicious mushroom shape cover with nito -lrb- 87 -rrb- and its pinnacle be adorn with a powerful oil lamp furnish with a closely fitting lid like that of a dark lantern so that it could be carry in the pocket this last be particularly useful when ride about on a dark night -lrb- nito cigar case -rrb- in the neighbor pueblo cigar-case be make out of this nito they be not of much use as a article of commerce and usually be only make to order to obtain a dozen a would-be purchaser must apply to as many individual who at the shortest will condescend to finish one in a few month the stalk of the fern which be about as thick as a lucifer match be split into four strip the workman then take a strip in he left hand and with he thumb on the back and he forefinger on the edge draw the strip up and down against the knife blade until the soft pithy part be cut away and what remain have become fine enough for the next process the case be make on pointed cylindrical piece of wood almost a couple of foot long a pin be stick into the center of the end of the cylinder and the workman commence by fasten the strip of fern stalk to it the size of the case correspond to the diameter of the roller and a small wooden disk be place in the bottom of the case to keep it steady while the side be be plait -lrb- a filipino theater -rrb- when my ankle begin to get better my first excursion be to legaspi where some filipino be give a theatrical performance a spanish political refugee direct the entertainment on each side of the stage roof in with palm leave run cover gallery for the dignitary of the place the uncovered space between these be set apart for the common people the performer have choose a play take from persian history the language be spanish and the dress be to say the least eccentric the stage be erect hard by a public street which itself form part of the auditorium and the noise be so great that i could only catch a word here and there the actor stalk on chatter they part which not one of they understand and move they arm up and down and when they reach the edge of the stage they tack and go back again like ship sail against the wind they countenance be entirely devoid of expression and they speak like automaton if i have understand the word the contrast between they meaning and the machine-like movement of the actor would probably have be droll enough but as it be the noise the heat and the smoke be so great that we soon leave the place -lrb- a indifferent performance -rrb- both the theatrical performance and the whole festival bear the impress of laziness indifference and mindless mimicry when i compare the frank cheerfulness i have see radiate from every countenance at the religious holiday of europe with the expressionless and immobile face of the native i find it difficult to understand how the latter be persuade to waste so much time and money upon a matter they seem so thoroughly indifferent to -lrb- interest in festival -rrb- traveller have remark the same want of gaiety amongst the indian of america and some of they ascribe it to the small development of the nervous system prevalent among these people to which cause also they attribute they wonderful courage in bear pain but tylor observe that the indian 's countenance be so different from ours that it take we several year to rightly interpret its expression there probably be something in both these explanation and although i observe no lively expression of amusement among my native friend at legaspus i notice that they take the greatest possible pleasure in decorate they village and that the procession which form part of the festival have extraordinary charm for they every individual be dress in he very best and the honor of carry a banner inspire those who attain it with the greatest pride and raise a amazing amount of envy in the breast of the remainder visitor pour in from all the surround hamlet and erect triumphal arch which they have bring with they ready-made and which bear some complimentary inscription i be oblige to confess that some of the holiday-maker be very drunk the inhabitant of the philippine have a great love for strong drink even the young girl occasionally get intoxicate when night come on the stranger be hospitably lodge in the dwelling of the village on such occasion native hospitality show itself in a very favorable light the door of every house stand open and even ball take place in some of the larger hamlet the spanish and mestizo cavalier however condescend to dance only with mestiza partner and very seldom invite a pretty native girl to join they the native very rarely dance together but in samar i be present on one occasion at a by no means ungraceful native dance where improvise verse be sing the male dancer compare he partner with a rose and she answer he should be careful in touch it as a rose have thorn this would have be think a charming compliment in the mouth of a andalusian -lrb- servant subterfuge -rrb- the idle existence we spend in daraga be so agreeable to my servant and they numerous friend that they be anxious i should stay there as long as possible and they adopt some very ingenious means to persuade I to do so twice when everything be prepare for a start the next morning my shoe be steal in the night and on another occasion they kidnap my horse when a native have a particularly heavy load to carry or a long journey to make he think nothing of coolly appropriate the well-fed beast of some spaniard which when he have do with it he turn loose without attempt to feed it and it wander about till somebody catch it and stall it in the nearest tribunal there it be keep tie up and hungry until its master claim it and pay its expense i have a dollar to pay when i recover mine although it be nearly starve to death on the pretence that it have swallow rice to that value since it have be catch -lrb- petty robbery -rrb- small robbery occur very frequently but they be commit -- as a acquaintance a man who have spend some time in the country inform I one evening when i be tell he my trouble -- only upon the property of new arrival old resident he say enjoy a prescriptive freedom from such little inconvenience i fancy some waggish native must have overhear we conversation for early the next morning my friend the old resident send to borrow chocolate biscuit and egg of I as he larder and he hen-house have be rifle during the night -lrb- daraga market -rrb- Monday and Friday evening be the daraga market night and in fine weather always afford a pretty sight the woman neatly and cleanly clad sit in long row and offer they provision for sale by the light of hundred of torch and when the business be over the slope of the mountain be stud all over with flicker little point of brightness proceeding from the torch carry by the homeward-bound market woman besides eatables many have silk and stuff weave from the fiber of the pine-apple and the banana for sale these goods they carry on they head and i notice that all the younger woman be accompany by they sweetheart who relieve they of they burden chapter xi -lrb- change of season -rrb- during the whole time i be confine to the house at daraga the weather be remarkably fine but unfortunately the bright day have come to a end by the time i be ready to make a start for the north-east monsoon the sure forerunner of rain in this part of the archipelago set in in October in spite however of the weather i determine to make another attempt to ascend the mountain at bulusan i find i could go by boat to bacon in the bay of albay a distance of seven league whence i could ride to gubat on the east coast three league further and then in a southerly direction along the shore to bulusan a experienced old native who provide a boat and crew have appoint ten o'clock at night as the best time for my departure just as we be about to start however we be tell that four piratical craft have be see in the bay in a twinkle the crew disappear and i be leave alone in the darkness and it take I four hour with the assistance of a spaniard to find they again and make a fresh start about nine o'clock in the morning we reach bacon whence i ride across a very flat country to san roque where the road lead to gubat take a sharp turn to the south-east and presently become a extremely bad one after i have pass gubat my way lay along the shore and i see several ruin square tower make of block of coral and build by the jesuit as a protection against the -lrb- moro pirate -rrb- moro or moor -- a term here apply to the pirate because like the moor who be formerly in spain they be mahometan they come from mindanao and from the north-west coast of borneo at the time of my visit this part of the archipelago be greatly infested with they and a few day before my arrival they have carry off some fisherman who be busy pull they fish-stake close to gubat a little distance from the shore and parallel to it run a coral reef which during the south-west monsoon be here and there bare at low tide but when the north-east wind blow the wave of the pacific ocean entirely conceal it upon this reef the storm have cast up many remains of marine animal and a quantity of fungus amongst which i notice some exactly resemble the common sponge of the mediterranean they be just as soft to the touch of a dark brown tint as large as the fist and of a conical shape they absorb water with great readiness and might doubtless be make a profitable article of commerce sample of they be to be see in the zoological museum at berlin as i go further on i find the road excellent and wooden bridge all of which be in good repair lead I across the mouth of the numerous small river but almost all the arch of the stone bridge i come to have fall in and i have to cross the stream they be suppose to span in a small boat and make my horse swim after I just before i reach bulusan i have to cross a ravine several hundred foot deep compose almost entirely of white pumice stone -lrb- bulusan -rrb- bulusan be so seldom visit by stranger that the tribunal where i put up be soon full of curiosity-monger who come to stare at I the woman take the place of honor squat round I in concentric row while the man peer over they shoulder one morning when i be take a shower-bath in a shed make of open bamboo work i suddenly notice several pair of inquisitive eye stare at I through the interstice the eye belong exclusively to the gentler sex and they owner examine I with the greatest curiosity make remark upon my appearance to one another and seem by no means incline to be disturb upon another occasion when bathing in the open air in the province of laguna i be surround by a number of woman old middle-aged and young who crowd round I while i be dress carefully inspect I and point out with they finger every little detail which seem to they to call for special remark -lrb- storm damage -rrb- i have travel the last part of the road to bulusan in wind and rain and the storm last with little intermission during the whole night when i get up in the morning i find that part of the roof of the tribunal have be carry away that the slighter house in the hamlet be all blow down and that almost every dwelling in the place have lose its roof this pleasant weather last during the three day of my stay the air be so thick that i find it impossible to distinguish the volcano though i be actually stand at its foot and as the weather-wise of the neighborhood could hold out no promise of a favorable change at that time of the year i put off my intended ascent till a better opportunity and resolve to return a former alcalde peñeranda be report to have succeed in reach the top fifteen year before after sixty man have spend a couple of month in build a road to the summit and the ascent be say to have take he two whole day but a experienced native tell I that in the dry season he think four man be quite sufficient to open a narrow path to the plateau just under the peak in a couple of day but that ladder be require to get on to the actual summit -lrb- arrival of assistance -rrb- the day after my arrival the inspector of highway and another man walk into the tribunal both of they wet to the skin and nearly blow to piece my friend the alcalde have send they to my assistance and as none of we could attempt the ascent they return with I as we be enter bacon on we way back we hear the report of cannon and the sound of music we servant cry out here come the alcalde and in a few moment he drive up in a open carriage accompany by a irregular escort of horseman spaniard and native the latter prance about in silk hat and shirt flutter in the wind the alcalde politely offer I a seat and a hour 's drive take we into sorsogon -lrb- albay road and bridge -rrb- the road of the province of albay be good but they be by no means keep in good repair : a state of thing that will never be remedy so long as the indolence of the authority continue most of the stone bridge in the district be in ruin and the traveller be oblige to content himself with wade through a ford or get himself ferry across upon a raft or in a small canoe while he horse swim behind he the road be first lay down in the day of alcalde peñaranda a retired officer of the engineer corps whom we have already mention and who deserve considerable praise for have largely contribute to the welfare of he province and for have accomplish so much from such small resource he take care that all socage service should be duly render or that money which go towards pay for tool and material should be pay in lieu of it many abuse exist before he rule no real service be perform by anybody who could trace the slightest relationship to any of the authority and when by chance any redemption money be pay it go often with the connivance of the alcalde of the period into the pocket of the gobernadorcillo instead of into the provincial treasury similar abuse still prevail all over the country where they be not prevent by the vigilance of the authority the numerous population and the prosperity which the province now enjoy would make it a easy matter to maintain and complete the exist highway the admirable official of the district be certainly not want in good-will but they hand be tie nowadays the alcalde remain only three year in one province -lrb- in peñaranda 's time they remain six -rrb- they time be entirely take up with the current official and judicial business and just as they be begin to become acquaint with the capability and requirement of they district they be oblige to leave it -lrb- handicapped official -rrb- this show the government 's want of confidence in its own servant no alcalde could now possibly undertake what peñaranda accomplish the money pay in lieu of socage service which ought to be apply to the want of the province in which the socage be due be forward to manila if a alcalde propose some urgent and necessary improvement he have to send in so many tedious estimate and report which frequently remain unnoticed that he soon lose all desire to attempt any innovation estimate for large work to carry out which would require a considerable outlay be invariably return from headquarters mark not urgent -lrb- fund divert to spain -rrb- the fact be not that the colonial government be want in good-will but that the caja de comunidad -lrb- general treasury -rrb- in manila be almost always empty as the spanish government in its chronic state of bankruptcy borrow the money and be never in a position to return it -lrb- sorsogon earthquake -rrb- in 1840 sorsogon suffer severely from a earthquake which last almost continuously for thirty-five day it rage with the greatest fury on the 21st of march the church both of sorsogon and of casiguran as well as the smallest stone house be destroy seventeen person lose they life and two hundred be injure and the whole neighborhood sink five foot below its former level -lrb- casiguran -rrb- the next morning i accompany the alcalde in a falua -lrb- felucca -rrb- man by fourteen rower to casiguran which lie directly south of sorsogon on the other side of a small bay of two league in breadth which it take we a hour and a half to cross the bay be as calm as a inland lake it be almost entirely surround by hill and its western side which be open to the sea be protect by the island of bagalao which lie in front of it as soon as we land we be receive with salute of cannon and music and flag and shirt stream in the wind i decline the friendly invitation of the alcalde to accompany he any further as to I who have no official business to transact the journey seem nothing but a continually recur panorama of dinner lunch cup of chocolate music and detonation of gunpowder -lrb- quicksilver -rrb- in 1850 quicksilver be discover on a part of the coast now cover by the sea i examine the report bed of the deposit and it appear to I to consist of a stratum of clay six foot in depth superimpose over a layer of volcanic sand and fragment of pumice stone a englishman who be wreck in this part of the archipelago the same individual i meet at the iron work at angat have begin to collect it and by wash the sand have obtain something like a couple of ounce somebody however tell the priest of the district that quicksilver be a poison and as he himself tell I so forcibly do he depict the dangerous nature of the new discovery to he parishioner that they abandon the attempt to collect it since then none of they have ever see a vestige of mercury unless it might be from some broken old barometer towards evening mount bulusan in the south-east and mount mayon in the north-west be visible for a short time they be both in a straight line with casiguran -lrb- sea 's encroachment -rrb- every year the sea make great inroad upon the coast at casiguran as far as i could decide from its appearance and from the account give I about a yard of the shore be annually destroy the bay of sorsogon be protect towards the north by a ridge of hill which suddenly terminate however at its north-eastern angle and through this open the wind sometimes blow with great fury and cause considerable havoc in the bay the more particularly as its coast be principally form of clay and sand -lrb- pirate rumor and robbery -rrb- when i reach legaspus again in the evening i learn that the alarm about the pirate which have interrupted my departure have not be a idle one moro they certainly could not have be for at that season none of the mahometan corsair could reach that part of the coast but they be a band of deserter and vagabond from the surrounding country who in this part of the world find it more agreeable to pursue they freebooting career on sea than on land during my absence they have commit many robbery and carry off several people -lrb- 88 -rrb- -lrb- real pirate -rrb- the beginning of November be the season of storm when water communication between albay and manila entirely cease no vessel daring to put out to sea even from the south coast on the 9th of the month however a vessel that have be give up for lose enter the port after have incur great peril and be oblige to throw overboard the greater part of its cargo within twelve day of its leave the strait of san bernardino behind it a sudden storm compel it to anchor amongst the island of balicuatro one of the passenger a newly-arrived spaniard put off in a boat with seven sailor and make for four small vessel which be ride at anchor off the coast take they for fisherman whereas they be pirate they fire at he as soon as he be some distance from he ship and he crew throw themselves into the water but both he and they be take prisoner the captain of the trading brig fear that he vessel would fall into they clutch slip anchor and put out to sea again escape shipwreck with the greatest difficulty the pirate as a rule do not kill they prisoner but employ they as rower but european seldom survive they captivity : the tremendous labor and the scanty food be too much for they they clothes always be strip off they back they be expose naked to all sort of weather and they sole daily support be a handful of rice chapter xii -lrb- camarine -rrb- no favorable change in the weather be expect in albay before the month of January it storm and rain all day i therefore determine to change my quarter to south camarine which protect from the monsoon by the high range of hill run along its north-eastern boundary enjoy more decent weather the two province of camarine form a long continent with its principal frontage of shore face to the north-east and to the south-west which be about ten league broad in its middle and have its shore indent by many bay from about the center of its north-eastern shore there boldly project the peninsula of caramuan connect with the mainland of camarine by the isthmus of isarog the north-eastern portion of the two province contain a long range of volcanic hill the south-western principally consist as far as my investigation permit I to discover of chalk and coral reef in the midst of the hill extend a wind and fertile valley which collect the water descend from the slope of the mountain range and blend they into a navigable river on the bank of which several flourish hamlet have establish themselves this river be call the bicol the stream which give it birth be so abundant and the slope of the side of the valley which be turn into one gigantic rice-field be so gentle that in many place the lazy water linger and form small lake -lrb- a chain of volcano -rrb- begin at the south-eastern extremity the volcano of bulusan albay mazaraga iriga isarog and colasus -- the last on the northern side of san miguel bay -- be situate in a straight line extend from the south-east to the north-west besides these there be the volcano of buhus or malinao a little to the north-east of the line the hamlet in the valley i have mention be situate in a second line parallel to that of the volcano the southern portion of the province be sparsely inhabit and but few stream find they way from its plateau into the central valley the range of volcano shut out as i have say the north-east wind and condense they moisture in the little lake scatter on its slope the south-west portion of camarine therefore be dry during the north-east monsoon and enjoy its rainy season during the prevalence of the wind that blow from the south-west the so-called dry season which so far as south camarine be concerned begin in November be interrupted however by frequent shower but from January to may scarcely a drop of rain fall the change of monsoon take place in may and June and its arrival be announce by violent thunderstorm and hurricane which frequently last without cessation for a couple of week and be accompany by heavy rain these last be the beginning of the wet season proper which last till October the road pass the hamlet of camalig guinobatan ligao oa and polanguus situate in a straight line on the bank of the river quinalus which after receive numerous tributary stream become navigable soon after pass polanguus here i observe a small settlement of hut which be call after the river each of the hamlet i have mention with the exception of the last have a population of about fourteen thousand soul although they be situate not more than half a league apart -lrb- priestly assistance -rrb- the convent in this part of the country be large impose building and they incumbent who be mostly old man be most hospitable and kind to I every one of they insist upon my stay with he and after do all he could for I pass I on to he next colleague with the best recommendation i wish to hire a boat at polanguus to cross the lake of batu but the only craft i could find be a couple of baroto about eight foot long hollow out of the trunk of tree and laden with rice to prevent my meeting with any delay the padre purchase the cargo of one of the boat on the condition of its be immediately unladen and this kindness enable I to continue my journey in the afternoon -lrb- the priest ' importance -rrb- if a traveller get on good term with the priest he seldom meet with any annoyance upon one occasion i wish to make a little excursion directly after lunch and at a quarter past eleven everything be ready for a start when i happen to say that it be a pity to have to wait three-quarter of a hour for the meal in a minute or two twelve o'clock strike all work in the village cease and we sit down to table : it be noon a message have be send to the village bell-ringer that the señor padre think he must be asleep and that it must be long past twelve as the señor padre be hungry il est l'heure que votre majesté désire -lrb- franciscan friar -rrb- most of the priest in the eastern province of luzon and samar be franciscan monk -lrb- the barefooted friar of the orthodox and strictest rule of we holy father st franci in the philippine island of the holy and apostolic province of st gregory the great -rrb- bring up in seminary in spain specially devote to the colonial mission formerly they be at liberty after ten year ' residence in the philippine to return to they own country but since the abolition of the monastery in spain they can do this no longer for they be compel in the colony to abandon all obedience to the rule of they order and to live as layman they be aware that they must end they day in the colony and regulate they life accordingly on they first arrival they be generally send to some priest in the province to make themselves acquaint with the language of the country then they be install into a small parish and afterwards into a more lucrative one in which they generally remain till they death most of they spring from the very lowest class of spaniard a number of pious trust and foundation in spain enable a very poor man who can not afford to send he son to school to put he into a religious seminary where beyond the duty of he future avocation the boy learn nothing if the monk be of a higher social grade as be some of the english missionary they would have less inclination to mix with the common people and would fail to exercise over they the influence they wield at present the early habit of the spanish monk and they narrow knowledge of the world peculiarly fit they for a existence among the native this mental equality or rather this want of mental disparity have enable they to acquire the influence they undoubtedly possess -lrb- young man develop by responsibility -rrb- when these young man first come from they seminary they be narrow-brained ignorant frequently almost devoid of education and full of conceit hatred of heretic and proselytish ardor these failing however gradually disappear the consideration and the comfortable income they enjoy develop they benevolence the insight into mankind and the confidence in themselves which distinguish the lower class of the spaniard and which be so amusingly exemplify in sancho panza have plenty of occasion to display themselves in the responsible and influential position which the priest occupy the padre be frequently the only white man in he village probably the only european for mile around he become the representative not only of religion but of the government he be the oracle of the native and he decision in everything that concern europe and civilization be without appeal he advice be ask in all important emergency and he have no one whom he in he turn can consult such a state of thing naturally develop he brain the same individual who in spain would have follow the plough in the colony carry out great undertaking without any technical education and without any scientific knowledge they build church and bridge and construct road -lrb- poor architect -rrb- the circumstance therefore be greatly in favor of the development of priestly ability but it would probably be better for the building if they be erect by more experienced man for the bridge be remarkably prone to fall in the church look like sheep-pen and the road soon go to rack and ruin i have much intercourse in camarine and albay with the priest and conceive a great liking for they all as a rule they be the most unpretending of man and a visit give they so much pleasure that they do all in they power to make they guest 's stay as agreeable as possible life in a large convent have much resemblance to that of a lord of the manor in eastern europe nothing can be more unconstrained more unconventional a visitor live as independently as in a hotel and many of the visitor behave themselves as if it be one i have see a subaltern official arrive summon the head servant move into a room order he meal and then inquire casually whether the padre who be a utter stranger to he be at home the priest of the philippine have often be reproach with gross immorality they be say to keep they convent full of bevy of pretty girl and to lead somewhat the same sort of life as the grand turk this may be true of the native padre but i myself never see in any of the household of the numerous spanish priest i visit anything that could possibly cause the least breath of scandal they servant be exclusively man though perhaps i may have notice here and there a old woman or two ribadeneyra say : -- the native who observe how careful the franciscan monk be of they chastity have arrive at the conclusion that they be not really man and that though the devil have often attempt to lead these holy man astray use the charm of some pretty indian girl as a bait yet to the confusion of both damsel and devil the monk have always come scathless out of the struggle ribadeneyra however be a very unreliable author and if he physiological mistake be as gross as he geographical one -lrb- he say somewhere that luzon be another name for the island of cebu -rrb- the monk be not perhaps as fireproof as he suppose at any rate he description do not universally apply nowadays the younger priest pass they existence like the lord of the soil of old the young girl consider it a honor to be allow to associate with they and the padre in they turn find many convenient opportunity they have no jealous wife to pry into they secret and they position as confessor and spiritual adviser afford they plenty of pretext for be alone with the woman the confessional in particular must be a perilous rock-a-head for most of they in a appendix to the tagal grammar -lrb- which by-the-bye be not add to the edition sell for general use -rrb- a list of question be give for the convenience of young priest not yet conversant with the tagal language these question be to be ask in the confessional and several page of they relate exclusively to the relation between the sex -lrb- superiority over government official -rrb- as the alcalde remain only three year in any one province they never understand much of its language and be much occupy with they official business they have neither the time nor the desire to become acquaint with the peculiarity of the district over which they rule the priest on the other hand reside continually in the midst of he parishioner be perfectly acquaint with each of they and even on occasion protect they against the authority he therefore be the real jurisdiction in the district the position of the priest in contradistinction to that of the government official be well express by they respective dwelling the casas reales generally small ugly and frequently half-ruined habitation be not suit to the dignity of the chief authority of the province the convento on the contrary be almost always a roomy impose and well-arranged building in former day when governorship be sell to adventurer whose only care be to enrich themselves the influence of the minister of religion be even greater than it be now -lrb- 89 -rrb- -lrb- former legal status -rrb- the follow extract from the general order give by le gentil will convey a clear idea of they former position : -- whereas the tenth chapter of the ordinance wherein the governor of arandium ordain that the alcalde and the justice should communicate with the missionary priest only by letter and that they should never hold any interview with they except in the presence of a witness have be frequently disobey it be now command that these disobedience shall no longer be allow and that the alcalde shall make it they business to see that the priest and minister of religion treat the gobernadorcillo and the subaltern officer of justice with proper respect and that the aforesaid priest be not allow either to beat chastise or ill-treat the latter or make they wait at table -lrb- alcalde formerly in trade -rrb- the former alcalde who without experience in official business without either education or knowledge and without either the brain or the moral qualification for such responsible and influential post purchase they appointment from the state or receive they in consequence of successful intrigue receive a nominal salary from the government and pay it tribute for the right to carry on trade arena consider this tribute pay by the alcalde as a fine impose upon they for a infringement of the law for several ordinance be in existence strenuously forbid they to dabble in any kind of commerce until it please he catholic majesty to grant they a dispensation the latter source of mischief be however abolish by royal decree in September and October 1844 -lrb- they borrow capital -rrb- the alcalde be at the same time governor magistrate commander of the troops and in reality the only trader in they province -lrb- 90 -rrb- they purchase with the resource of the obras pias the article require in the province and they be entirely dependent for they capital upon these endowment as they almost always arrive in the philippine without any means of they own the native be force to sell they produce to the alcalde and besides to purchase they goods at the price fix by the latter -lrb- 91 -rrb- in this corrupt state of thing the priest be the only protector of the unfortunate filipino though occasionally they also throw in they lot with the alcalde and share in the spoil wring from they unfortunate flock -lrb- improvement in present appointee -rrb- nowadays man with some knowledge of the law be send out to the philippine as alcalde the government pay they a small salary and they be not allow to trade the authority also attempt to diminish the influence of the priest by improve the position of the civil tribunal a state of thing they will not find easy of accomplishment unless they lengthen the period of service of the alcalde and place they in a pecuniary position that will put they beyond the temptation of pocket perquisite -lrb- 92 -rrb- in huc 's work on china i find the following passage relate to the effect of the frequent official change in china from which many hint may be gather : -- -lrb- similarity with chinese condition -rrb- the magisterial office be no longer bestow upon upright and just individual and as a consequence this once flourish and well-governed kingdom be day by day fall into decay and be rapidly glide down the path that lead to a terrible and perhaps speedy dissolution when we seek to discover the cause of the general ruin the universal corruption which too surely be undermine all class of chinese society we be convince that it be to be find in the complete abandonment of the old system of government effect by the manchu dynasty it issue a decree forbid any mandarin to hold any post longer than three year in the same province and prohibit any one from possess any official appointment in he native province one do not form a particularly high idea of the brain which conceive this law but when the manchu tartar find that they be the lord of the empire they begin to be alarm at they small number which be trifling in comparison with the countless swarm of the chinese and they dread lest the influence which the higher official would acquire in they district might enable they to excite the populace against they foreign ruler -lrb- unidentified with country -rrb- the magistrate be allow to remain only a year or two in the same province live there like stranger without acquaint themselves with the want of the people they govern there be no tie between they the only care of the mandarin be to amass as much wealth as possible before they quit they post and they then begin the same game in a fresh locality until finally they return home in possession of a handsome fortune gradually collect in they different appointment they be only bird of passage what do it matter the morrow would find they at the other end of the kingdom where the cry of they plunder victim would be unable to reach they in this manner the governmental policy render the mandarin selfish and indifferent the basis of the monarchy be destroy for the magistrate be no longer a paternal ruler reside amongst and mildly sway he child but a marauder who arrive no man know whence and who depart no one know whither the consequence be universal stagnation no great undertaking be accomplish and the work and labor of former dynasty be allow to fall into decay the mandarin say to themselves : ` why should we undertake what we can never accomplish why should we sow that other may reap ' they take no interest in the affair of the district as a rule they be suddenly transplant into the midst of a population whose dialect even they do not understand -lrb- dependence on interpreter -rrb- when they arrive in they mandarinate they usually find interpreter who be permanent officieal and interested in the affair of the place know how to make they service indispensable and these in reality be the absolute ruler of the district -lrb- importance of interpreter in philippine -rrb- interpreter be especially indispensable in the philippine where the alcalde never by any chance understand any of the local dialect in important matter the native writer have generally to deal with the priest who in many case become the virtual administrator of authority he be familiar with the character of the inhabitant and all they affair in the settlement of which he intimate acquaintance with the female sex stand he in good stead a eminent official in madrid tell I in 1867 that the then minister be consider a proposal to abolish the restriction of office in the colony to three year -lrb- 93 -rrb- -lrb- fear of official ' popularity -rrb- the dread which cause this restriction viz that a official might become too powerful in some distant province and that he influence might prove a source of danger to the mother country be no longer entertain increase traffic and easier means of communication have destroy the former isolation of the more distant province the custom law the increase demand for colonial produce and the right concede to foreigner of settle in the country will give a great stimulus to agriculture and commerce and largely increase the number of chinese and european resident then at last perhaps the authority will see the necessity of improve the social position of they official by decrease they number by a careful selection of person by promote they accord to they ability and conduct and by increase they salary and allow they to make a longer stay in one post the commercial relation of the philippine with californium and australium be likely to become very active and liberal idea will be introduce from those free country then indeed the mother country will have earnestly to consider whether it be advisable to continue its exploitation of the colony by its monopoly its withdrawal of gold and its constant satisfaction of the unfounded claim of a swarm of hungry place-hunter -lrb- 94 -rrb- -lrb- different english and dutch policy -rrb- english and dutch colonial official be carefully and expressly educate for they difficult and responsible position they obtain they appointment after pass a stringent examination at home and be promote to the higher colonial office only after give proof of fitness and ability what a different state of thing prevail in spain when a spaniard succeed in get a appointment it be difficult to say whether it be due to he personal capacity and merit or to a series of successful political intrigue -lrb- 95 -rrb- chapter xiii -lrb- batu -rrb- in a hour and a half after leave polanguus we reach batu a village on the north-western shore of the lake of the same name the inhabitant particularly the woman strike I by they ugliness and want of cleanliness although they live close to the lake and draw they daily drinking water from it they never appear to use it for the purpose of wash the street of the village also be dirty and neglect a circumstance explain perhaps by the fact of the priest be a native -lrb- the lake -rrb- towards the end of the rainy season in November the lake extend far more widely than it do in the dry and overflow its shallow bank especially to the south-west a great number of water-plant grow on its border amongst which i particularly notice a delicate seaweed -lrb- 96 -rrb- as fine as horse hair but intertwine in such close and endless ramification that it form a flooring strong enough to support the largest waterfowl i see hundred of they hop about and eat the shell fish and prawn which swarm amidst the mesh of the net-like seaweed and fall a easy prey to they feathered enemy the native too be in the habit of catch immense quantity of the prawn with net make for the purpose some they eat fresh and some they keep till they be putrid like old cheese and then use they as a relish to swallow with they rice these small shell-fish be not limit to the lake of batu they be catch in shoal in both the salt and the fresh water of the philippine and indian archipelago and when salt and dry by the native form a important article of food eat either in soup or as a kind of potted paste they be find in every market and be largely export to china i be unable to shoot any of the waterfowl for the tangle of the seaweed prevent my boat from get near they -lrb- a neglect product -rrb- when i revisit the same lake in February i find its water so greatly fall that they have leave a circular belt of shore extend all around the lake in most place nearly a hundred foot broad the withdrawal of the water have compress the tangled seaweed into a kind of mat which bleached by the sun and nearly a inch thick cover the whole of the shore and hang suspend over the stunt bush which on my first visit have be under water i have never either see elsewhere or hear any one mention a similar phenomenon this stuff which could be have for nothing be excellent for rifle-stopper and for the stuffing of bird so i take a great quantity of it with I this time the bird-hunting go well too the native priest of batu be full of complaint about he parishioner who give he no opportunity of gain a honest penny i be never ask for a mass sir in fact this be such a miserable hole that it be shun by death itself in d where i be for a long time coadjutor we have we couple of burial regularly every day at three dollar a head and as many mass at a dollar apiece as we have time to say besides christening and wedding which always bring a little more grist to the mill but here nothing take place and i scarcely make anything this stagnant state of thing have induce he to turn he attention to commerce the average native priest of those i saw could hardly be call a credit to he profession generally ignorant often dissipate and only superficially acquaint with he duty the greater part of he time be give over to gamble drinking and other objectionable amusement little care be take to preserve a properly decorous behavior except when officiate in the church when they read with a absurd assumption of dignity without understand a single word the convento be often full of girl and child all of whom help themselves with they finger out of a common dish the worthy padre of batu introduce a couple of pretty girl to I as he two poor sister whom in spite of he poverty he support but the servant about the place openly speak of these young lady ' baby as be the child of the priest -lrb- the native clergy -rrb- the guide principle of spanish colonial policy -- to set one class against another and to prevent either from become too powerful -- seem to be the motive for place so many native incumbent in the parsonage of the archipelago the prudence of this proceeding however seem doubtful a spanish priest have a great deal of influence in he own immediate circle and form perhaps the only enduring link between the colony and the mother-country the native priest be far from afford any compensation for the lack of either of these advantage he generally be but little respect by he flock and certainly do nothing to attach they to spain for he hate and envy he spanish brethren who leave he only the very worst appointment and treat he with contempt -lrb- nabua -rrb- i ride from batu to nabua over a good road in half a hour the country be flat with rice-field on both side of the road but while in batu the rice be only just plant in nabua it already be almost ripe i be unable to obtain any explanation of this incongruity and know not how to account for such a difference of climate between two hamlet situate in such close proximity to one another and separate by no range of hill the inhabitant of both be ugly and dirty and be different in these respects from the tagalog nabua a place of 10875 inhabitant be intersect by several small stream whose water pour down from the eastern hill form a small lake which empty itself into the river bicol just after pass the second bridge beyond nabua the road incline eastward wend in a straight line to iriga a place lie to the south-west of the volcano of the same name -lrb- remontado -rrb- i visit a small settlement of pagan situate on the slope of the volcano the people of the plain call they indifferently igorot cimarron remontado infiele or montesino none of these name however with the exception of the two last be appropriate one the first be derive from the term apply in the north of the island to the mixed descendant of chinese and filipino parent the word cimarron -lrb- french marrow -rrb- be borrow from the american slave colony where it denote negro who escape from slavery and live in a state of freedom but here it be apply to native who prefer a wild existence to the comfort of village life which they consider be overbalance by the servitude and bondage which accompany they the term remontado explain itself and have the same signification as cimarron as the difference between the two state -- on account of the mildness of the climate and the ease with which the want of the native be supply -- be far less than it would be in europe these self-constituted exile be more frequently to be meet with than might be suppose the cause of they separation from they fellowman sometimes be some offence against the law sometimes annoying debt and sometimes a mere aversion to the duty and labor of village life every filipino have a innate inclination to abandon the hamlet and retire into the solitude of the wood or live isolate in the midst of he own field and it be only the village prison and the priest -- the salary of the latter be proportionate to the number of they parishioner -- that prevent he from gradually turn the pueblo into visita -lrb- 97 -rrb- and the latter into rancho until a visit to other rancho in the neighborhood correct my first impression i take the inhabitant of the slope of the iriga for cross-breed between the low-lander and negrito the color of they skin be not black but a dark brown scarcely any darker than that of filipino who have be much expose to the sun and only a few of they have woolly hair the negrito whom i see at angat and marivele know nothing whatever about agriculture live in the open air and support themselves upon the spontaneous product of nature but the half-savage of the iriga dwell in decent hut and cultivate several vegetable and a little sugar-cane no pure negrito as far as i could ascertain be to be meet with in camarine a thickly-populated province only sparsely dot with lofty hill would be ill-suited for the residence of a nomadic hunting race ignorant of agriculture -lrb- iriga settlement -rrb- the rancho on the iriga be very accessible and they inhabitant carry on a friendly intercourse with the lowlander indeed if they do not they would have be long ago exterminate in spite of these neighborly communication however they have preserve many of they own primitive manners and custom the man go about naked with the exception of a cloth about the loin and the woman be equally unclad some of they perhaps wear a apron reach from the hip to the knee -lrb- 98 -rrb- in the larger rancho the woman be decently clothe in the usual filipino fashion they household belongings consist of a few article make of bamboo a few calabash of coconut-shell and a earthen cooking-pot and bow and arrow -lrb- poison arrow -rrb- these latter be make very carefully the shaft from reed the point from a sharp-cut bamboo or from a palm-tree with one to three sharp point in pig-hunting iron-pointed poison arrow be use -lrb- crucifix -rrb- although the igorot be not christian they decorate they hut with crucifix which they use as talisman if they be of no virtue a old man remark to I the spaniard would not employ they so numerously -lrb- 99 -rrb- the largest rancho i visit be nominally under the charge of a captain who however have little real power at my desire he call to some naked boy idly squat about on the tree who require considerable persuasion before they obey he summons but a few small present -- brazen earring and comb for the woman and cigar for the man -- soon put I on capital term with they -lrb- mt iriga -rrb- after a vain attempt to reach the top of the iriga volcano i start for buhus a place situate on the southern shore of the lake of that name ten minute after leave iriga i reach a spot where the ground sound hollow beneath my horse 's foot a succession of small hillock about fifty foot high border each side of the road and towards the north i could perceive the huge crater of the iriga which in the distance appear like a truncate cone i have the curiosity to ascend one of the hillock which see from its summit look like the remains of some former crater which have probably be destroy by a earthquake and split up into these small mound -lrb- advertising -rrb- when i get to buhi the friendly priest have it proclaim by sound of drum that the newly-arrived stranger wish to obtain all kind of animal whether of earth of air or of water and that each and all would be pay for in cash the native however only bring we moth centipede and other vermin which besides enable they to have a good stare at the stranger they hope to turn into cash as extraordinary curiosity -lrb- a church procession -rrb- the follow day i be the spectator of a gorgeous procession first come the spanish flag then the village kettle-drum and a small troop of horseman in short jacket and shirt fly in the wind next a dozen musician and finally as the principal figure a man carry a crimson silk standard the latter individual evidently be deeply conscious of he dignified position and he countenance eloquently express the quantity of palm wine he have consume in honor of the occasion he sit on he horse dress out in the most absurd manner in a large cocked hat trim with color paper instead of gold lace with a woman 's cape make of paper outside he coat and with short tight-fitting yellow breeches and immense white stocking and shoe both he coat and he breeches be liberally ornament with paper trimming he steed lead by a couple of cabeza be appoint with similar trappings after march through all the street of the village the procession come to a halt in front of the church -lrb- papal concession to spain -rrb- this festival be celebrated every year in commemoration of the concession make by the pope to the king of spain permit the latter to appropriate to he own use certain revenue of the church the spanish throne consequently enjoy the right of confer different indulgence even for serious crime in the name of the holy see this right which so to speak it acquire wholesale it sell by retail to its customer -lrb- it formerly dispose of it to the priest -rrb- in the estanco and together with its other monopoly such as tobacco brandy lottery ticket stamp paper etc all through the agency of the priest without the assistance of whom very little business would be do the receipt from the sale of these indulgence have always be very fluctuate in 1819 they amount to $ 15930 in 1839 to $ 36390 and in 1860 they be estimate at $ 58954 in the year 1844-5 they rise to $ 292115 the cause of this large increase be that indulgence be then render compulsory so many be allote to each family with the assistance and under the superintendence of the priest and tax-collector who receive a commission of five and eight per cent on the gross amount collect -lrb- 100 -rrb- -lrb- lake buhus -rrb- the lake of buhus -lrb- 300 foot above the sea-level -rrb- present a extremely picturesque appearance surround as it be on all side by hill fully a thousand foot high and its western shore be form by what still remain of the iriga volcano i be inform by the priest of the neighbor hamlet that the volcano until the commencement of the seventeenth century have be a closed cone and that the lake do not come into existence till half of the mountain fall in at the time of its great eruption this statement i find confirm in the page of the estado geografico : -- on the fourth of January 1641 -- a memorable day for on that date all the known volcano of the archipelago begin to erupt at the same hour -- a lofty hill in camarine inhabit by heathen fall in and a fine lake spring into existence upon its site the then inhabitant of the village of buhus migrate to the shore of the new lake which on this account be henceforward call the lake of buhus -lrb- 1628 camarine earthquake -rrb- perrey in the mémoires de l'académie de dijon mention another outbreak which take place in camarine in 1628 : in 1628 accord to trustworthy report fourteen different shock of earthquake occur on the same day in the province of camarine many building be throw down and from one large mountain which the earthquake rent asunder there issue such a immense quantity of water that the whole neighborhood be flood tree be tear up by the root and in one hour from the seashore all plain be cover with water -lrb- the direct distance to the shore be two and one-half league -rrb- -lrb- 101 -rrb- -lrb- a mistranslation -rrb- it be very strange that the text give in the footnote do not agree with a perrey 's translation the former do not mention that water come out of the mountain and say just the contrary that tree which be tear up by the root take the place of the sea for one hour on the shore so that no water could be see -lrb- unreliable authority -rrb- the datum of the estado geografico be apt to create distrust as the official report on the great earthquake of 1641 describe in detail the eruption of three volcano which happen at the same time -lrb- of these two be in the south of the archipelago and one in northern luzon -rrb- while camarine be not mention at all this suspicion be further strengthen by the fact that the same author -lrb- nierembergius -rrb- whose remark on the eruption of 1628 in camarine be quote give in another book of he a detailed report on the event of 1641 without mention this province if one consider the indifference of the friar toward such event in nature it be not improbable that the eruption of 1641 when a mountain fall in in northern luzon and a lake take its place have be transfer on the iriga to illustrate the indifference it may be mention that even the padre live at the foot of the albay could not agree upon the date of its very last eruption -lrb- another attempt at mountain climbing -rrb- when i be at tambong a small hamlet on the shore of the lake belong to the parochial district of buhi i make a second unsuccessful attempt to reach the highest point of the iriga we arrive in the evening at the southern point of the crater 's edge -lrb- 1041 meter above the level of the sea by my barometrical observation -rrb- where a deep defile prevent we further progress here the igorot abandon I and the low-lander refuse to bivouac in order to pursue the journey on the follow day so i be oblige to return late in the evening after pass through a coco plantation we reach the foot of the mountain and find shelter from a tempest with a kind old woman to whom my servant lie so shamelessly that when the rain have abate we be in spite of we failure conduct with torch to tambong where we find the palm-grove round the little hamlet magically illuminate with bright bonfire of dry coconut-leaf in honor of the conquistador del iriga and where i be oblige to remain for the night as the people be too timorous or too lazy to cross the rough water of the lake -lrb- pineapple fiber preparation -rrb- here i see they prepare the fiber of the pine-apple for weave the fruit of the plant select for this purpose be generally remove early a process which cause the leaf to increase considerably both in length and in breadth a woman place a board on the ground and upon it a pine-apple-leaf with the hollow side upward sit at one end of the board she hold the leaf firmly with she toe and scrape its outer surface with a potsherd not with the sharp fractured edge but with the blunt side of the rim and thus the leaf be reduce to rag in this manner a stratum of coarse longitudinal fiber be disclose and the operator place she thumb-nail beneath it lift it up and draw it away in a compact strip after which she scrape again until a second fine layer of fiber be lay bare then turn the leaf round she scrape its back which now lie upwards down to the layer of fiber which she seize with she hand and draw at once to its full length away from the back of the leaf when the fiber have be wash it be dry in the sun it be afterwards comb with a suitable comb like woman 's hair sort into four class tie together and treat like the fiber of the lupus in this crude manner be obtain the thread for the celebrated web nipis de -lrb- piña -rrb- piña which be consider by expert the finest in the world two shirt of this kind be in the berlin ethnographical museum -lrb- no 291 and 292 -rrb- better weave sample be in the gewerbe museum of trade and commerce in the philippine where the fineness of the work be best understand and appreciate richly-embroidered costume of this description have fetch more than $ 1400 each -lrb- 102 -rrb- -lrb- rain prevent another ascent -rrb- at buhus which be not sufficiently sheltered towards the north-east it rain almost as much as at daraga i have find out from the igorot that a path could be force through the tall cane up to the summit but the continual rain prevent I so i resolve to cross the malinao return along the coast to my quarter and then freshly equip descend the river bicol as far as naga -lrb- mountaineer ' arrow poison -rrb- before we part the igorot prepare for I some arrow poison from the bark of two tree i happen to see neither the leaf nor the blossom but only the bark a piece of bark be beat to piece press dry wetted and again press this be do with the bare hand which however sustain no injury the juice thus extract look like pea-soup and be warm in a earthen vessel over a slow fire during the process it coagulate at the edge and the coagulated mass be again dissolve by stir it into the boiling fluid mass when this have reach the consistency of syrup a small quantity be scrape off the inner surface of a second piece of bark and its juice squeeze into the vessel this juice be a dark brown color when the mass have attain the consistency of a thin jelly it be scrape out of the pot with a chip and preserve on a leaf sprinkle with ash for poisoning a arrow they use a piece of the size of a hazel-nut which after be warm be distribute uniformly over the broad iron point and the poison arrow serve for repeat use -lrb- sapa river -rrb- at the end of November i leave the beautiful lake of buhus and proceed from its eastern angle for a short distance up the little river sapa -lrb- 103 -rrb- the alluvial deposit of which form a considerable feature in the configuration of the lake across a marshy meadow we reach the base of the malinao or buhus mountain the slippery clay of the lower slope merge higher up into volcanic sand -lrb- leech -rrb- the damp undergrowth swarm with small leech i never before meet with they in such number these little animal no stouter when strech out than a linen thread be extraordinarily active they attach themselves firmly to every part of the body penetrate even into the nose the ear and the eyelid where if they remain unobserved they gorge themselves to such excess that they become as round as ball and look like small cherry while they be suck no pain be feel but afterwards the spot attack often itch the whole day long -lrb- 104 -rrb- -lrb- fig-tree -rrb- in one place the wood consist for the most part of fig-tree with bunch of fruit quite six foot in length hanging from the stem and the thicker branch and between the tree grow fern aroid and orchid after nearly six hour ' toil we reach the pass -lrb- 841 meter above the sea level -rrb- and descend the eastern slope the forest on the eastern side of the mountain be still more magnificent than that on the west from a clearing we obtain a fine view of the sea the island of catanduane and the plain of tabaco -lrb- prison as hotel -rrb- at sunset we reach tibus where i quartered myself in the prison this a tolerably clean place enclose with strong bamboo be the most habitable part of a long shed which supply the place of the tribunal destroy in a storm two year before at tibus i have a opportunity of sketch mount malinao -lrb- call also buhus and takit -rrb- which from this side have the appearance of a large volcano with a distinct crater from the lake of buhi it be not so clearly distinguishable -lrb- igabo hot spring -rrb- not far from tibus exactly north-east of malinao we find a small hot spring call igabo in the middle of a plot of turf encircle by tree be a bare spot of oval form nearly a hundred pace long and seventy wide the whole space be cover with stone round by attrition as large as a man 's head and larger here and there hot water bubble out of the ground and discharge into a little brook beside it some woman be engage in cook they food which they suspend in net in the hottest part of the water on the lower surface of some of the stone a little sulphur be sublimate of alum hardly a trace be perceptible in a cavity some caolin have accumulate and be use as a stain -lrb- naglegbeng silicious spring -rrb- from here i visit the stalactite spring not far distant of naglegbeng -lrb- 105 -rrb- i have expect to see a calcareous fountain but find the most magnificent mass of silica of infinite variety of form shallow cone with cylindrical summit pyramidal flight of step round basin with ribbed margin and pond of boiling water one spot denude of tree from two to three hundred pace in breadth and about five hundred in length be with the exception of a few place overgrow with turf cover with a crust of silicious dross which here and there form large connected area but be generally break up into flaky plate by the vertical spring which pierce it in numerous locality boil hot mineral water contain silica be force itself out of the ground spread itself over the surface and deposit a crust the thickness of which depend on its distance from the center point in this manner in the course of time a very flat cone be form with a basin of boiling water in the middle the continuous deposit of dross contract the channel and a less quantity of water overflow while that close to the edge of the basin evaporate and deposit a quantity of fine silicious earth whence the upper portion of the cone not only be steeper than its base but frequently assume a more cylindrical form the external surface of which on account of the want of uniformity in the overflow be rib in the form of stalactite when the channel become so much obstruct that the efflux be less than the evaporation the water cease to flow over the edge and the mineral dross during the continual cooling of the water be then deposit with the greatest uniformity over the inner area of the basin when however the surface of the water sink this formation cease at the upper portion of the basin the interior wall thicken and if the channel be completely stop up and all the water evaporate there remain a bell-shaped basin as even as if excavate by the hand of man the water now seek a fresh outlet and burst forth where it meet with the least obstruction without destroy the beautiful cone it have already erect many such example exist in the largest cone however the vapor generate acquire such power that when the outlet be completely stop up they break up the overlying crust in concentrically radiate flake and the water issue anew copiously from the center deposit a fresh crust which again by the process we have just describe be break up into a superimpose layer of flake in this manner be form annular layer which in turn be gradually cover by fresh deposit from the overflow water after the pyramid of layer be complete and the outlet stop up the water sometimes break forth on the slope of the same cone a second cone be then form near the first on the same base in the vicinity of the silicious spring be see deposit of white yellow red and bluish-grey clay overlay one another in narrow strata-like variegated marl manifestly the disintegrate produce of volcanic rock transport hither by rain and stain with oxide of iron these clay perhaps come from the same rock from the disintegration of which the silicious earth have be form similar example occur in iceland and in new zealand but the product of the spring of tibus be more varied finer and more beautiful than those of the iceland geyser -lrb- a world wonder -rrb- the wonderful conformation of the red cone be indeed astonishing and hardly to be parallel in any other quarter of the world -lrb- 106 -rrb- chapter xiv -lrb- quinali river -rrb- on my second journey in camarine which i undertake in February i go by water from polangui past batu as far as naga the quinalus which run into the south-eastern corner of the lake of batu run out again on the north side as the bicol river and flow in a north-westerly direction as far as the bay of san miguel it form the medium of a not inconsiderable trade between albay and camarine particularly in rice of which the supply grow in the former province do not suffice for the population who consume the superfluity of camarine the rice be convey in large boat up the river as far as quinalus and thence transport further on in carabao cart and the boat return empty during the dry season of the year the breadth of the very tortuous bicol at its mouth be a little over sixty foot and increase but very gradually there be considerable variety of vegetation upon its bank and in animal life it be highly attractive i be particularly strike with its numerous monkey and water-fowl -lrb- plotus water-fowl -rrb- of the latter the plotus variety be most abundant but difficult to shoot they sit motionless on the tree on the bank only they thin head and neck like those of tree-snake overtop the leaf on the approach of the boat they precipitate themselves hastily into the water and it be not until after many minute that the thin neck be see rise up again at some distance from the spot where the bird disappear the plotus appear to be as rapid on the wing as it be in swimming and diving -lrb- naga -rrb- in naga the chief city of south camarine i alight at the tribunal from which however i be immediately invite by the principal official of the district -- who be famed for he hospitality far beyond the limit of he province -- to he house where i be load with civility and favor this universally beloved gentleman put everybody under contribution in order to enrich my collection and do all in he power to render my stay agreeable and to further my design -lrb- nueva caceres -rrb- naga be the seat of a bishopric and of the provincial government in official document it be call nueva cacere in honor of the captain-general d fr de sande a native of cacere who about 1578 found naga -lrb- the spanish town -rrb- close to the filipino village at the beginning of the seventeenth century it number nearly one hundred spanish inhabitant at the present time it hardly boast a dozen murillo velarde remark -lrb- xiii 272 -rrb- in contrast to the state of thing in america that of all the town found in the philippine with the exception of manila only the skeleton the name without the substance have be preserve the reason be as have be frequently show that up to the present time plantation and consequently proper settler have be want formerly naga be the principal town of the whole of that district of luzon lie to the east of tayaba which on account of the increase population be divide into the three province of north and south camarine and albay the boundary of these governmental district those between albay and south camarine more especially have be draw very arbitrarily although the whole of the territory as be show by the map geographically be very well define -lrb- land of the bicol -rrb- the country be name camarine but it might more suitably be call the country of the bicol for the whole of it be inhabit by one race the bicol-filipino who be distinguish by they speech and many other peculiarity from they neighbor the tagal on the west and the bisayan on the island to the south and east -lrb- the bicol -rrb- the bicol be find only in this district and in a few island lie immediately in front of it of they come hither no information be to be obtain from the comprehensive but confused history of the spanish monk morga consider they to be native of the island on the other hand it be assert by tradition that the inhabitant of manila and its vicinity be descend from malay who have migrate thither and from the inhabitant of other island and more distant province -lrb- 107 -rrb- they speech be midway between that of the tagalog and the bisayan and they themselves appear in both they manners and custom to be a half-breed between these two race physically and mentally they be inferior to the tagalog and superior to the inhabitant of the eastern bisayan island -lrb- bicol language -rrb- bicol be speak only in the two camarine albay luzon the island of masbate buria ticao and catanduane and in the smaller adjoining island the inhabitant of the volcanic mountain isarog and its immediate neighborhood speak it in the greatest purity thence towards the west the bicol dialect become more and more like tagalog and towards the east like bisayan until by degree even before reach the boundary of they ethnographical district it merge into these two kindred language -lrb- rice cultivation -rrb- in south camarine the sowing of the rice in bed begin in June or July always at the commencement of the rainy season but in field artificially water earlier because thus the fruit ripen at a time when the store in the country be small its price be high although the rice field could very well give two crop yearly they be till only once it be plant out in August with interval of a hand 's - breadth between each row and each individual plant and within four month the rice be ripe the field be never fertilize and but seldom plough the weed and the stubble be generally trodden into the already soak ground by a dozen carabao and the soil afterwards simply roll with a cylinder furnish with sharp point or loosen with the harrow -lrb- sorod -rrb- besides the agricultural implement name above there be the spanish hatchet -lrb- azadon -rrb- and a rake of bamboo -lrb- kag-kag -rrb- in use the harvest be effect in a peculiar manner the rice which be soonest ripe be cut for ten per cent that be the laborer receive for he toil the tenth bundle for himself at this time of year rice be very scarce want be imminent and labor reasonable the more field however that ripen the higher become the reaper ' wages rise to twenty thirty forty even fifty per cent indeed the executive sometimes consider it to be necessary to force the people to do harvest by corporal punishment and imprisonment in order to prevent a large portion of the crop from rot on the stalk nevertheless in very fruitful year a part of the harvest be lose the rice be cut halm by halm -lrb- as in java -rrb- with a peculiarly-formed knife or fail such with the sharp-edged flap of a mussel -lrb- 108 -rrb- find in the ditch of the rice-field which one have only to stoop to pick up -lrb- rice land production -rrb- a quiñon of the best rice land be worth from sixty to one hundred dollar -lrb- $ 550 to $ 9 per acre -rrb- rice field on rise grounds be dearest as they be not expose to devastate flood as be those in the plain and may be treat so as to insure the ripening of the fruit at the time when the highest price be to be obtain -lrb- the harvest -rrb- a ganta of rice be sufficient to plant four topone -lrb- 1 topon = 1 loan -rrb- from which 100 manojo -lrb- bundle -rrb- be gather each of which yield half a ganta of rice the old ganta of naga however be equal to a modern ganta and a half the produce may be calculate at 75 cavane per quiñon about 9 3\/4 bushel per acre -lrb- 109 -rrb- in book 250 cavane be usually state to be the average produce of a quiñon but that be a exaggeration the fertility of the field certainly vary very much but when it be consider that the land in the philippine be never fertilize but depend for the maintenance of its vitality exclusively upon the overflow of the mud which be wash down from the mountain it may be believe that the first number better express the true average in java the harvest in many province amount to only 50 cavane per quiñon in some indeed to three time this amount and in china with the most careful culture and abundant manure to 180 cabane -lrb- 110 -rrb- -lrb- sweet potato -rrb- besides rice they cultivate the camote -lrb- sweet potato convolvulus batata -rrb- this flourish like a weed indeed it be sometimes plant for the purpose of eradicate the weed from soil intend for coffee or cacao it spread out into a thick carpet and be a inexhaustible storehouse to its owner who the whole year through can supply he want from he field gabus -lrb- caladium -rrb- ubus -lrb- dioscorea -rrb- maize and other kind of grain be likewise cultivate -lrb- cattle and horse -rrb- after the rice harvest the carabao horse and bullock be allow to graze in the field during the rice culture they remain in the gogonale cane-field which arise in place once cultivate for mountain-rice and afterwards abandon -lrb- gogo be the name of a cane 7 to 8 foot high saccharum sp -rrb- transport then be almost impossible because during the rainy season the road be impassable and the cattle find nothing to eat the native do not feed he beast but allow it to die when it can not support itself in the wet season of the year it frequently happen that a carabao fall down from starvation whilst draw a cart a carabao cost from $ 7 to $ 10 a horse $ 10 to $ 20 and a cow $ 6 to $ 8 very fine horse be value at from $ 30 to $ 50 and occasionally as much as $ 80 but the native horse be not esteem in manila because they have no stamen the bad water the bad hay and the great heat of the place at once point out the reason otherwise it would be profitable to export horse in favorable season to manila where they would fetch twice they value accord to morga there be neither horse nor ass on the island until the spaniard import they from china and new spain -lrb- 111 -rrb- they be at first small and vicious horse be import also from japan not swift but powerful with large head and thick mane look like friesland horse -lrb- 112 -rrb- and the breed improve rapidly those bear in the country mostly cross-breed drive well -lrb- black cattle -rrb- black cattle be generally in the hand of a few individual some of whom in camarine possess from 1000 to 3000 head but they be hardly saleable in the province although they have be export profitably for some year past to manila the black cattle of the province be small but make good beef they be never employ for labor and the cow be not milk the filipino who generally feed on fish crab mussel and wild herb together with rice prefer the flesh of the carabao to that of the ox but they eat it only on feastday -lrb- sheep -rrb- the old race of sheep import by the spaniard previous to this century still flourish and be easily propagate those occasionally bring from shanghaus and australium be consider to be deficient in endurance unfruitful and generally short-lived mutton be procurable every day in manila in the interior however at least in the eastern province very rarely although the rearing of sheep might there be carry on without difficulty and in many place most profitably the people be too idle to take care of the young lamb which they complain be tear to piece by the dog when they wander about free the sheep appear to have be acclimatize with difficulty morga say that they be bring several time from new spain but do not multiply so that in he time this kind of domestic animal do not exist -lrb- swine -rrb- pork be eat by wealthy european only when the hog have be bring up from the litter at home in order to prevent its wander away it be usually enclose in a wide mesh cylindrical hamper of bamboo upon fill which it be slaughter the native hog be too nauseous for food the animal maintain themselves almost entirely on ordure -lrb- guess at history from language -rrb- crawfurd observe that the name of all the domestic animal in the philippine belong to foreign language those of the dog swine goat carabao cat even of the fowl and the duck be malay or javanese while those of the horse ox and sheep be spanish until these animal be first import from malaysia the aborigine be less fortunate in this respect than the american who at least have the alpaca llamanda vicuña the name likewise of most of the cultivate plant such as rice yam sugar-cane cacao and indigo be say to be malay as well as those for silver copper and tin of the word relate to commerce one-third be malay to which belong most of the term use in trade as well as the denomination for weight and measure for the calendar -- so far as it exist -- and for number besides the word for write reading speaking and narrative on the other hand only a small number of term which refer to war be borrow from the malay -lrb- ancient filipino civilization -rrb- refer to the degree of civilization which the philippine possess previous to they intercourse with the malay crawfurd conclude from the purely domestic word that they cultivate no corn they vegetable food consist of bata -lrb- -rrb- and banana they have not a single domestic animal they be acquaint with iron and gold but with no other metal and be clothe in stuff of cotton and alpaca weave by themselves they have invent a peculiar phonetic alphabet and they religion consist in the belief in good and evil spirit and witch in circumcision and in somewhat of divination by the star they therefore be superior to the inhabitant of the south sea inasmuch as they possess gold iron and weave fabric and inferior to they in that they have neither dog pig nor fowl -lrb- progress under spain -rrb- assume the truth of the above sketch of pre-christian culture which have be put together only with the help of defective linguistic source and compare it with the present we find as the result a considerable progress for which the philippine be indebted to the spaniard the influence of social relation have be already exhibit in the text the spaniard have import the horse the bullock and the sheep maize coffee sugar-cane cacao sesame tobacco indigo many fruit and probably the bata which they meet with in mexico under the name of camotlus -lrb- 113 -rrb- from this circumstance the term camote universal in the philippine appear to have have its origin crawfurd indeed erroneously consider it a native term accord to a communication from dr witmack the opinion have lately be conceive that the bata be indigenous not only to america but also to the east indy as it have two name in sanscrit sharkarakanda and ruktaloo -lrb- slight industrial progress -rrb- with the exception of embroidery the native have make but little progress in industry in the weave and the plaiting of mat and the handicraft be entirely carry on by the chinese -lrb- rice and abaca export -rrb- the export consist of rice and abaca the province export about twice as much rice as it consume a large quantity to albay which less adapt for the cultivation of rice produce only abaca and a fair share to north camarine which be very mountainous and little fertile the rice can hardly be ship to manila as there be no high road to the south side of the province near to the principal town and the transport by water from the north side and from the whole of the eastern portion of luzon would immediately enhance the price of the product -lrb- chinese monopolize trade -rrb- the import be confine to the little that be import by chinese trader the trader be almost all chinese who alone possess shop in which clothing material and woolen stuff partly of native and partly of european manufacture woman 's embroidered slipper and imitation jewelry may be obtain the whole amount of capital invest in these shop certainly do not exceed $ 200000 in the remain pueblo of camarine there be no chinese merchant and the inhabitant be consequently oblige to get they supplies from naga -lrb- land for everybody -rrb- the land belong to the state but be let to any one who will build upon it the usufruct pass to the child and cease only when the land remain unemployed for two whole year after which it be competent for the executive to dispose of it to another person -lrb- home -rrb- every family possess its own house and the young husband generally build with the assistance of he friend in many place it do not cost more than four or five dollar as he can if necessary build it himself free of expense with the simple aid of the forest-knife -lrb- bolo -rrb- and of the material to he hand bamboo spanish cane and palm-leaf these house which be always build on pile on account of the humidity of the soil often consist of a single shed which serve for all the use of a dwelling and be the cause of great laxity and of filthy habit the whole family sleep therein in common and every passer-by be a welcome guest a fine house of board for the family of a cabeza perhaps cost nearly $ 100 and the possession of such a family in stock furniture ornament etc -lrb- of which they be oblige to furnish a annual inventory -rrb- would range in value between $ 100 and $ 1000 some reach even as much as $ 10000 while the richest family of the whole province be assess at $ 40000 -lrb-

destroy and the remainder disperse in spite of every endeavor i could obtain through the kindness of señor fociños in naga only one small vessel similar remains of more primitive inhabitant have be find at the mouth of the bigajo not far from libmánan in a shell-bed of the same kind and a urn with a human skeleton be find at the mouth of the perlo west of sitio de poro in 1840 at the time when i

more exact although probably they would not have be so easy and natural -lrb- ancient chinese jar -rrb- mr w a frank who have the kindness to examine the vessel incline to the opinion that it be chinese and pronounce it to be of very great antiquity without however be able to determine its age more exactly and a learn chinese of the burlingame embassy express himself to the same effect he know only of one article now in the british museum which be bring from japan by kaempfer the color glazing and crack in the glazing of which -lrb- craquele -rrb- correspond precisely with mine accord to kaempfer the japanese find similar vessel in the sea and they value they very highly for the purpose of preserve they tea in they morga write : -- -lrb- use as tea canister -rrb- on this island

form of the mouth of the vessel in pass over which the air-draught be throw into resonant verberation like the aeolian harp the vessel be generally envelop in gold brocade and be uncover only when it be to be consult and hence of course it happen that it speak only on solemn occasion st john state further that the bisayan use formerly to bring present to the sultan in recognition of which they receive some water from the sacred jar to sprinkle over they field and thereby ensure plentiful harvest when the sultan be ask whether he would sell he jar for $ 100000 he answer that no offer in the world could tempt he to part with it -lrb- morga 's description -rrb- morga 's description suit neither the vessel of libmánan nor the jar of the british museum but rather a vessel bring from japan a short time ago to we ethnographical museum this be of brown clay small but of graceful shape and compose of many piece cement together the joint be gilt and form a kind of network on the dark ground

horse climb it with difficulty and we find the stream on the other side already rise so high that we ride knee-deep in the water after sunset we cross singly with great loss of time in a miserable ferry-boat over the broad mouth of the pulundaga where a pleasant road through a forest lead we in fifteen minute over the mountain-spur malanguit which again project itself right across we path into the sea to the mouth of the paracale the long bridge here be so rotten that we be oblige to lead the horse over at wide interval apart and on the further side lie the place call paracale from which my companion continue they journey across mauban to manila -lrb- red lead -rrb- paracale and mambulao be two locality well know to all mineralogist from the red lead ore occur there on the follow morning i return to longo which consist of only a few miserable hut inhabit by gold-washer who go about almost naked probably because they be labor during the greater part of the day in the water but they be also very poor -lrb- gold mining -rrb- the soil be compose of rubbish decompose fragment of crystalline rock rich in broken piece of quartz the workman make hole in the ground two and one-half foot long two and one-half broad and to thirty foot deep at three foot below the surface the rock be generally find to contain gold the value increase down to eighteen foot of depth and then again diminish though these proportion be very uncertain and there be much fruitless search the rock be carry out of the hole in basket on ladder of bamboo and the water in small pail but in the rainy season the hole can not possibly be keep free from water as they be situate on the slope of the mountain and be fill quicker than they can be empty the want of apparatus for discharge water also account for the fact that the pit be not dig deeper -lrb- a primitive rock breaker -rrb- the breaking of the auriferous rock be effect with two stone of which one serve as anvil and the other as hammer the former which be slightly hollow in the center be lay flat upon the ground and the latter four by eight by eight inch in dimension and therefore of about twenty-five pound weight be make fast with rattan to the top of a slender young tree which lie in a sloping position in a fork and at its opposite end be firmly fix in the ground the workman with a jerk force the stone that serve for hammer down upon the auriferous rock and allow it to be again carry upward by the elasticity of the young tree -lrb- a arrastre -rrb- the crush of the broken rock be effect with a apparatus equally crude a thick stake rise from the center of a circular support of rough-hewn stone -lrb- which be enclose in a circle of exactly similar stone -rrb- have a iron pin at its top to which a tree bent horizontally in the middle and downward at the two end be fix be set in motion by two carabao attach in front it drag several heavy stone which be bind firmly to it with rattan round the circle and in this manner crush the broken rock which have be previously mix with water to a fine mud the same apparatus be employ by the mexican gold-washer under the name of rastra -lrb- gold-washing -rrb- the washing-out of the mud be do by woman they kneel before a small wooden gutter fill with water up to the brim and provide with board slope downward in front of the space assign to each woman the gutter be cut out at these place in a corresponding manner so that a very slender stream of water flow evenly across its whole breadth downward over the board with she hand the work-woman distribute the auriferous mud over the board which at the lower edge be provide with a cross-piece and when the light sand be wash away there remain a stratum consist chiefly of iron flint and ore which be take up from time to time with a flat piece of board and lay on one side and at the end of the day 's work it be wash out in a flat wooden dish -lrb- batea -rrb- and for the last time in a coco-shell when if they be lucky a fine yellow dust show itself on the edge -lrb- 129 -rrb- during the last wash the slimy juice of the gogo be add to the water the fine heavy sand remain suspend therein for a longer time than in pure water and thus be more easily separate from the gold-dust -lrb- 130 -rrb- -lrb- the clean-up -rrb- it be further to be mention that the refuse from the pit be wash at the upper end of the water-gutter so that the sand adhering to the stone intend for pound may deposit its gold in the gutter or on the washing-board in order to melt the gold thus obtain into a lump in which form it be buy by the dealer it be pour into a small heart-shell -lrb- cardium -rrb- and after be cover with a handful of charcoal place in a potsherd when a woman blow through a narrow bamboo-cane on the kindle coal and in one minute the work be complete -lrb- 131 -rrb- the result of many inquiry show the profit per head to average not more than one and one-half real daily further to the south-west from here on the mountain malaguit be see the ruin of a spanish mining company a heap of rubbish a pit fifty foot deep a large house fall to ruin and a stream-work four foot broad and six foot high the mountain

hang some edible nest of the salangane but not of the same kind as those find in the cavern on the south coast of java these which be of much less value than the latter be only occasionally collect by the chinese dealer who reckon they nominally at five cent each we also find a few of the nest-building bird -lrb- collocalium troglodyte gray -rrb- -lrb- 132 -rrb- -lrb- abandon workings -rrb- around lay so large a number of workings and there be so many little abandoned pit wholly or half fall to ruin and more or less grow over that it be necessary to step between with great caution some of they be still be work after the mode follow at lóngos but with a few slight improvement the pit be twice as large as those excavate there and the rock be lift up by a pulley to a cylindrical framework of bamboo which be work by the foot of a lad who sit on a bank higher up -lrb- lead and mica -rrb- ten minute north of the village of malaguit be a mountain in which lead-glance and red lead have be

top of this same hill n 30 ° w from the village the quarry be fall to ruin and flood with rain so that only a shallow hollow in the ground remain visible and after a long search amongst the bush grow there a few small fragment be find on which -lrb- chrome-lead ore -rrb- chrome-lead ore be still clearly to be recognize captain sabino the former governor of paracale a well-informed filipino who at the suggestion of the alcalde accompany I have for some year cause excavation to be carry on in order to find specimen for a speculator who have in view the establishment of a new mining company in spain but the specimen which be find have not be remove as speculation in mine in the philippine have in the interval fall into discredit on the exchange of madrid and as yet only a little box full of sand out of a few small drusy cavity have be fix upon and pound to be sell as variegated writing-sand after be carefully sift -lrb- a pretty fan-palm -rrb- a peculiarly beautiful fan-palm grow on this hill its stem be from thirty to forty foot high cylindrical and dark-brown with white ring a quarter of a inch broad at distance of four inch and at similar interval crown-shaped band of thorn two inch long near the crown-leaf the stem pass into the richest brown of burnt sienna -lrb- room in a powder-magazine -rrb- notwithstanding a very bad road a pleasant ride carry we from paracale to the sea-shore and through a beautiful wood to mambulao which lie w by n i alight at the tribunal and take up my lodgings in the room where the ammunition be keep as be the only one that could be lock for greater security the powder be store in a corner and cover with carabao-hide but such be my arrangement that my servant carry about a burning tallow light and he assistant a torch in the hand when i visit the filipino priest i be receive in a friendly manner by a young girl who when i offer my hand thank I with a bow say tengo las sarnas -lrb- i have the itch -rrb- the malady which be very common in the philippine appear to have its focus in this locality -lrb- gneiss and crystalline rock -rrb- a quarter of a league nne we come upon the ruin of another mining undertake the ancla de oro shaft

shallow hollow in the ground mark the site of a old copper-mine which must have be eighty-four foot deep copper ore be find in several place in luzon and specimen of solid copper be obtain by I at the bay of luyang n of the enseñada de patag in caramuan -lrb- unsuccessful copper-mining -rrb- very considerable bed of copper ore occur in mancayán in the district of lepanto and in the central mountain-range of luzon between cagayán and iloco which have be work by a mining company in manila since 1850 but the operation seem to have be most unsuccessful in 1867 the society expend a considerable capital in the erection of smelting furnace and hydraulic machinery but until a very recent date owe to local difficulty particularly the want of road it have not produce any copper -lrb- 133 -rrb- -lrb- pay minus dividend -rrb- in 1869 i hear in london that the undertaking have be give up accord to my latest information however it be certainly in progress but the management have never i believe secure a dividend the statement of 1872 in fact show a loss or as the spaniard elegantly say a dividendo pasivo -lrb- igorot-mining successful -rrb- what european yet appear unable to accomplish the wild igorot who inhabit that trackless range of mountain have carry on successfully for century and to a proportionally larger extent and this be the more remarkable as the metal in that district occur only in the form of flint which even in europe can be make profitable only by particular management and not without expense -lrb- long-established and considerable -rrb- the copper introduce into commerce by the igorot from 1840 to 1855 partly in a raw state partly manufacture be estimate at three hundred picul yearly the extent of they excavation and the large exist mass of slag also indicate the activity of they operation for a long period of time -lrb- copper kettle attribute to negrito -rrb- in the ethnographical museum at berlin be a copper kettle make by those wild tribe meyer who bring it state that it be make by the negrito in the interior of the island and certainly with hammer of porphyry as they have no iron and that he further find in the collection of the captain general of the philippine a large shallow kettle of three and one-half foot in diameter which have be buy for only three dollar whence it may be infer that in the interior of the island the copper occur in large mass and probably solid for how could those rude uncultivated negrito understand the art of smelting copper -lrb- copper-working a pre-spanish art -rrb- the locality of these rich quarry be still unknown to the governor although the copper implement bring thence have accord to a official statement of he in 1833 be in use in manila over two century it be now know that the copper-smith be not negrito but igorot and there can be no question that they practice this art and the still more difficult one of obtain copper from flint for a long period perhaps previous to the arrival of the spaniard they may possibly have learn they from the chinese or japanese the chief engineer santo -lrb- 134 -rrb- and many other with he be of opinion that this race be descend from the chinese or japanese from whom he insist that it acquire not only its feature -lrb- several traveller mention the obliquely place eye of the igorot -rrb- its idol and some of its custom but also the art of work in copper at all event the fact that a wild people live isolate in the mountain should have make such progress in the science of smelting be of so great interest that a description of they procedure by santo -lrb- essentially only a repetition of a earlier account by hernandez in the revista minera i 112 -rrb- will certainly be acceptable -lrb- the igorot ' method -rrb- the present mining district acquire by the society mention the sociedad minero-metalurgica cantabrofilipina de mancayan be divide amongst the igorot into larger or smaller parcel strictly accord to the number of the population of the adjacent village whose boundary be jealously watch and the possession of each separate village be again divide between certain family whence it be that those mountain district exhibit at the present day the appearance of a honeycomb to obtain the ore they make cavity in which they light fire in suitable spot for the purpose of break the rock into piece by means of the elasticity of the heated water contain in the crevice with the additional assistance of iron implement the first breaking-up of the ore be do in the stream-work itself and the dead heap lay pile up on the ground so that in subsequent fire the flame of the piece of wood always reach the summit and by reason of the quality of the rock and the imperfection of the mode of procedure very considerable down-fall frequently occur the ore be divide into rich and quartziferous the former not be again melt but the latter be subject to a powerful and persistent roasting during which after a part of the sulphur antimony and arsenic have be exhale a kind of distillation of sulphate of copper and sulphate of iron take place which appear as stone or in ball on the surface of the quartz and could be easily detach -lrb- 135 -rrb- -lrb- the smelter -rrb- the furnace or smelting apparatus consist of a round hollow in clayey gound thirty centimeter in diameter and fifteen deep with which be connect a conical funnel of fire-proof stone incline at a angle of 30 ° carry up two bamboo-cane which be fit into the lower end of two notch pine-stem in these two slip cover all over with dry grass or feather move alternately up and down and produce the current require for the smelting -lrb- smelting -rrb- when the igorot obtain black copper or native copper by blast they prevent loss -lrb- by oxidation -rrb- by set up a crucible of good fire-proof clay in the form of a still by which mean it be easier for they to pour the metal into the form which it would acquire from the same clay the furnace be arrange they supply it with from eighteen to twenty kilogram of rich or roasted ore which accord to the repeat experiment of hernandez contain twenty per cent of copper and they proceed quite scientifically always expose the ore at the mouth of the funnel and consequently to the air-draft and place the coal at the side of the furnace which consist of loose stone pile one over another to the height of fifty centimeter the fire have be kindle and the blow apparatus already describe in operation thick cloud of white yellow and orange-yellow smoke be evolve from the partial volatilization of the sulphur arsenic and antimony for the space of a hour but as soon as only sulphurous acid be form and the heat by this procedure have attain its highest degree the blow be discontinue and the product take out this consist of a dross or rather of the collect piece of ore themselves which on account of the flinty contents of the stone compose the funnel be transform by the decomposition of the sulphurous metal into a porous mass and which could not be convert into dross nor form combination with silicious acid be deficient in the base as well as in the requisite heat and also of a very impure stone of from four to five kilogram weight and contain from fifty to sixty per cent of copper -lrb- the copper stone -rrb- several of these stone be melt down together for the space of about fifteen hour in a powerful fire and by this mean a great portion of the three volatile substance above name be again evolve after which they place they now heated red-hot in a upright position but so as to be in contact with the draught the coal however be at the side of the furnace after blow for a hour or half-an-hour they thus obtain as residuum a silicate of iron with antimony and trace of arsenic a stone contain from seventy to seventy-five per cent of copper which they take off in very thin strip at the same time use refrigerate vessel and at the bottom of the hollow there remain accord as the mass be more or less free from sulphur a larger or smaller quantity -lrb- always however impure -rrb- of black copper -lrb- purify the product -rrb- the purify stone obtain by this second process be again make red-hot by place they between row of wood in order that they might not melt into one another before the fire have free they from impurity the black copper obtain from the second operation and the stone which be re-melted at the same time be then subject to a third process in the same furnace -lrb- narrow by quarry stone and provide with a crucible -rrb- which produce a residuum of silicious iron and black copper which be pour out into clay mould and in this shape come into commerce this black copper contain from ninety-two to ninety-four per cent of copper and be tinge by a carbonaceous compound of the same metal know by its yellow color and the oxide on the surface arise from the slow cooling which will occur notwithstanding every precaution and the surface so expose to oxidation they beat with green twig when the copper which have be thus extract with so much skill and patience by the igorot be to be employ in the manufacture of kettle pipe and other domestic article or for ornament it be submit to another process of purification which differ from the precede only in one particular that the quantity of coal be diminish and the air-draught increase accord as the process of smelting draw near to its termination which involve the removal of the carbonaceous compound by oxidation santo find by repeat experiment that even from ore of the mean standard of twenty per cent only from eight to ten per cent of black copper be extract by the third operation so that between eight to twelve per cent still remain in the residuum or porous quartz of the operation -lrb- tagalog woman trader -rrb- it be difficult to procure the necessary means of transport for my baggage on the return journey to paracale the road be so soaked by the continuous rain that no one would venture he cattle for the purpose in mambulao the influence of the province on its western border be very perceptible and tagalog be understand almost better than bicol the tagalog element be introduce amongst the population by woman who with they family come here from lucban and mauban in the pursuit of trade they buy up gold and import stuff and other wares in exchange the gold acquire be commonly from fifteen to sixteen carat and a mark determine its quality the dealer pay on the average $ 11 per ounce but when as be usually the case it be -lrb- miner uncertain return -rrb- offer in smaller quantity than one ounce only $ 10 -lrb- 136 -rrb- they weigh with small roman scale and have no great reputation for honesty north camarine be thinly inhabit the population of the mining district have remove after the many undertaking which be artificially call into existence by the mining mania have be ruin the goldwasher be mostly dissolute and involve in debt and continually expect rich finding which but very seldom occur and which when they do occur be forthwith dissipate -- a fact which will account for champagne and other article of luxury be find in the shop of the very poor villager malaguit and matango during the dry season be say to be connect by a extremely good road but when we pass the two place be separate by a quagmire into which the horse sink up to they middle -lrb- labo -rrb- in labo a little village on the right bank of the river labo -lrb- which rise in the mountain of the same name -rrb- the condition to which we have advert be repeat -- vestige of the work of former mining company fast disappear and in the midst little pit be work by the native red lead have not be find here but gold have be and especially platinum which some experiment have prove to be lead-glance the mountain labo appear from its bell-shape and the stratum expose in the river bed to consist of trachytic hornblende half a league wsw after wade through mud a foot deep we reach the mountain dalla where lead-glance and gold be formerly obtain by a mining company and to the present day gold be obtain by a few native in the usual mode -lrb- wild cat mining -rrb- neither in the latter province nor in manila could i acquire more precise information respect the history of the numerous unfortunate mining enterprise thus much however appear certain that they be originate only by speculator and never properly work with sufficient means they therefore of necessity collapse so soon as the speculator cease from they operation -lrb- small output -rrb- north camarine yield no metal with the exception of the little gold obtain by the native in so unprofitable a manner the king of spain at first receive a fifth and then a tenth of the produce but the tax subsequently cease in morga 's time the tenth amount on a average to $ 10000 -lrb- which be keep quite secret -rrb- the profit consequently to above $ 100000 gemellus carrerus be inform by the governor of manila that gold to the value of $ 200000 be collect annually without the help of either fire or quicksilver and that paracale in particular be rich in gold no datum exist from which i could estimate the actual rate of produce and the answer to several inquiry deserve no mention the produce be at all event very small as well on account of the incompleteness of the mode of procedure as of the irregularity of labor for the native work only when they be compel by necessity -lrb- indang -rrb- i return down the stream in a boat to indang a comparatively flourishing place of smaller population but more considerable trade than daet the export consist principally of abacá and the import of rice -lrb- storm -rrb- a old mariner who have navigate this coast for many year inform I that the same wind prevail from daet as far as cape engaño the north-east point of luzon from October to march the north-east wind prevail the monsoon here begin with north wind which be of short duration and soon pass into the north-east and in January and February the east wind begin and terminate the monsoon the heaviest rain fall from October to January and in October typhoon sometimes occur begin from the north or north-east they pass to the north-west where they be most violent and then to the north and east sometimes as far as to the south-east and even to the south in march and April and sometimes in the beginning of may shift wind blow which bring in the south-west monsoon but the dry season of which April and may be the driest month be uninterrupted by rain thunder storm occur from June to November most frequently in August during the south-west monsoon the sea be very calm but in the middle of the north-east monsoon all navigation cease on the east coast in the outskirts of baler rice be sow in October and reap in march and April mountain rice be not cultivate chapter xvi -lrb- on foot to san miguel bay -rrb- send my baggage from daet to cabusao in a schooner i proceed on foot by the road to that place to the coast on the west side of the bay of san miguel we cross the mouth of the river in a boat which the horse swim after but they be soon abandon from unfitness at the mouth of the next river sacavin the water be so high that the bearer strip themselves naked and carry the baggage over on they head in simple jacket and cotton hose i find this precaution needless indeed accord to my experience it be both refreshing and salutary to wear wet clothes during a uniformly high temperature besides which one be thereby spare many a spring over ditch and many a roundabout course to avoid puddle which be already wet through we no longer fear after have wade over eight other little river we be oblige to leave the shore and pursue the road to colasus along steep slippery forest path the place lie right in the middle of the west side of the bay the sea-shore be very beautiful instead of a continuous and at the ebb ill-smelling border of mangrove which be never want in those place where the land extend into the sea the wave here reach the foot of the old tree of the forest many of which be wash underneath amongst the most remarkable be a fringe of stately old barringtonus cover with orchid and other epiphyte -- gorgeous tree when in flower the red stamen five inch long with golden yellow anther like tassel depend from the bough and they fruit of the size of the fist be doubly useful to the fisherman who employ they on account of they specific gravity in float he net and beat they to piece to stupefy the fish the foremost tree stand bent towards the sea and have be so deflected probably for a long time like many other whose remain still project out of the water the destruction of this coast appear to be very considerable amongst the climb palm one peculiar kind be very abundant the stem of which as thick as the arm either drag itself leafless along the ground or hang in arch above the branch carry a crown

direction of the flat coast which extend nnw to sse from the point of daet be here interrupt by the little peak of colasus which project to the east and have grow so rapidly that all old people remember it to have be lower in the visita colasi on the northern slope of the mountain the sea be so rough that no boat can live in it the inhabitant carry on fishing they fishing-grounds lie however on the southern slope of the mountain in the sheltered bay of lalauigan which we reach after thee hour ' journey over the ridge -lrb- by sea to cabusao -rrb- a four-oared baroto hire at this place as the weather be favorable be to have convey we in two hour to cabusao the port of naga but the wind swing round and a storm ensue thoroughly wet and not without loss we run to barceloneta a visita situate at a third of the distance the intelligent teniente of colasus whom we meet here also confirm the fact of the rapid growth of the little peak -lrb- unreliable excuse -rrb- in opposition to my wish to ascend the mountain great obstacle be say to exist when every one would be occupy in preparation for the easter festival which would hardly occur during the succeed week as these objection do not convince I a more substantial reason be discover the next morning inland shoe be excellent for the mud and particularly for horseback but for climb mountain or rough ground they would not last a day and the one remain pair of strong european shoe which i reserve for particular purpose have be give away by my servant who do not like climb mountain on the pretext they be very much too heavy for I -lrb- a shipwrecked family -rrb- the shore from barceloneta to cabusao be of the same character as the daet-colasus but run north and south the ground sandy clay be cover with a thick stratum of broken bivalve the road be very difficult as the high tide force we to climb between the tree and thick underwood on the way we meet a enterprising family who have leave daet with a cargo of coconut for naga and have be wreck here save only one out of five tinaja of oil but recover all the nut -lrb- 137 -rrb- they be live in a small hastily-run-up hut upon coconut rice fish and mussel in expectation of a favorable wind to return there be several variety of shore-bird but my gun would not go off although my servant in expectation of a hunt have clean it with especial care as he have lose the ramrod whilst clean it the charge be not withdraw before we reach cabusao when it be discover that both barrel be full of sand to above the touchhole -lrb- make palm-sugar -rrb- the coast be still more beautiful than on the precede day particularly in one place where the surge beat against a wood of fan-palm -lrb- corypha sp -rrb- on the side face the sea in group or row stand the tree bereft of they crown or lie overthrow like column amid the vast ruin of temple -lrb- one of they be three foot in diameter -rrb- and the sight immediately remind I of pompeius i could not account for the bareness of the trunk until i discover a hut in the midst of the palm in which two man be endeavor to anticipate the wave in they work of destruction by the preparation of sugar -lrb- tunguleh -rrb- for this purpose after strip off the leaf -lrb- this palm flowering at the top -rrb- the upper end of the stem be cut across the surface of the incision be incline about five degree towards the horizon and near its lower edge hollow out to a very shallow gutter the juice exude over the whole surface of the cut with the exception of the intersected exterior petiole and be collect in the shallow channel be conduct by a piece of banana-leaf two inch broad and four inch long into a bamboo-cane attach to the trunk in order to avert the rain from the saccharine issue which have a faint pleasantly aromatic flavor as of barley-sugar all the tree which have be tap be provide with cap form of bent and fold palm-leaf the average daily produce of each tree be four bamboo the interior of which be about three inch and a half in diameter when remove they be full to about eighteen inch which give somewhat more than ten quart daily -lrb- the money side -rrb- the produce of each tree of course be very unequal always intermittent it cease completely after two month -- at the utmost three month but the proportion of those newly cut to those cut at a earlier date be the same the yield of the incision be about equal the juice of thirty-three palm after evaporation in a iron pan immediately upon each collection produce one ganta or -lrb- there be four such collection -rrb- four ganta daily the weekly result be twenty ganta or two tinaja of sugar each worth two dollar and a half on the spot this statement derive from the people themselves probably show the proportion somewhat more unfavorable than it really be still accord to the opinion of a experienced mestizo the difference can not be very considerable assume the above figure as correct however one of these magnificent tree would give about one dollar and two-third or after deduct the laborer ' wages one real per diem about a thaler and two-third not a large sum truly but it be some consolation to know that even if man do not interfere these tree would in process of time fall victim to the breaker and that even if protect against external ravages they be doom to natural extinction after once produce fruit -lrb- neglect road -rrb- cabusao lie in the southern angle of san miguel bay which be almost on every side surround by high mountain and afford good anchorage for ship from here i repair across naga to the south coast four league from naga in the heart of ragay on the southern border of luzon be the small but deep harbor of pasacao and two hour by water conduct we to the intermediate visita pamplona whence the route be pursue by land the still-existing remnant of the old road be in a miserable condition and even at that dry season of the year scarcely passable the bridge over the numerous little ditch be break down and in many place right across the road lay large stone and branch of tree which have be bring there year before to repair the bridge and have be unused have ever since continue to obstruct the road -lrb- a french planter -rrb- in quitang between pamplona and pasacao where two brook unite themselves into one little river debouching at the latter place a young frenchman have establish a hacienda he be contented and hopeful and loudly praise the industry and friendliness of he people probably because they make fewer exaction foreigner as a rule seem to agree better with the native than spaniard of these exaction the bitterest complaint be rife of the injustice of the demand make upon the lower class in the settlement of they wages which if they do not immediately find the necessary hand for every employment do not correspond with the enhance value of the product and accord to they the native must even be drive from public employment to labor in they service -lrb- 138 -rrb- -lrb- the filipino as a laborer -rrb- the filipino certainly be more independent than the european laborer because he have fewer want and as a native landowner be not compel to earn he bread as the daily laborer of another yet with reference to wages it may be question whether any colony whatever offer more favorable condition to the planter than the philippine in dutch indium where the prevalence of monopoly almost exclude private industry free laborer obtain one-third of a guilder -- somewhat more than one real the usual wages in the wealthy province of the philippine -lrb- in the poorer it amount to only the half -rrb- and the javanese be not the equal of the filipino either in strength or intelligence or skill and the rate of wages in all the older slave state be well know for the cultivation of sugar and coffee mauritius and ceylon be oblige to import foreign laborer at great expense and to pay they highly and yet they be successful -lrb- pasacao -rrb- from quitang to pasacao the road be far worse than it have heretofore be and this be the most important road in the province before reach pasacao evident sign be visible on the denuded side of the limestone of its have be formerly wash by the sea pasacao be picturesquely situate at the end of the valley which be intersect by the itulan and extend from pamplona between wooded mountain of limestone as far as the sea the ebb tide here be extremely irregular from noon to evening no difference be observable and when the decrease just become visible the tide rise again immediately to the south and face the district the side of a mountain two thousand foot high and above one thousand foot broad have two year ago give way to the subterranean action of the wave the rock consist of a tough calcareous breccium full of fragment of mussel and coral but be shoeless i could not remain on the sharp rock sufficiently long to make a closer examination -lrb- a beautiful coast -rrb- for the same reason i be oblige to leave the ascent of the yamtik which i have before vainly attempt from libmanan unaccomplished from this point although i have the advantage of the company of a obliging french planter in a boat excursion in a north-westerly direction along the coast here we boat float along over garden of coral swarm with magnificently color fish and after two hour we reach a cavern in the limestone suminabang so low that one could stir in it only by creep which contain a few swallow and bat on the calebayan river on the further side of point tanaun we come upon a solitary shed we night-quarter here the limestone range be interrupt by a isolate cliff on the left bank of the little river consist of a crystalline rock chiefly compose of hornblende which moreover on the side expose to the water be surround completely by limestone -lrb- cattle -rrb- the surround mountain must swarm with wild boar under the thatched roof of we hut which serve as a shelter to occasional hunter more than a hundred and fifty lower jaw-bone be set up as hunting trophy the place appear as if create for the breeding of cattle soft with fodder grass and cover with a few group of tree with slope intersect by rustling brook it rise up out of the sea and be encompass by a steep wall of rock in the form of a semicircle and here cattle would find grass water shade and the protection of a enclose rampart while travel along the coast we have remark a succession of similar locality which however from lack of enterprise and from the dread of pirate be not utilize as soon as we supper be prepare we carefully extinguish we fire that it might not serve as a signal to the vagabond of the sea and keep night watch -lrb- a delusive cave -rrb- on the follow morning we intend to visit a cave never before enter but to we astonishment we find no proper cavern but only a entrance to a cavern a few foot in depth visible from a distance it must often have be pass by the hunter although as we be assure by we companion -- who be astonish at the delusion -- no one have venture to enter it from stress of superstitious terror -lrb- isolation of fertile region -rrb- the north coast of camarine as i have frequently mention be during the north-east monsoon almost unapproachable while the south coast screen by the outlying island remain always accessible the most fertile district of the eastern province which during summer export they produce by the northern port in the winter often remain for month cut off from all communication with the chief town because there be no road over the small strip of land to the south coast how much have be do by nature and how little by man to facilitate this intercourse be very evident when we reflect upon the condition of the road to pasacao lately describe in connection with the condition of matter in the east as show by the map -lrb- river highway -rrb- two river one come from the north-west and the other from the south-east and both navigable before they reach the border of the province flow through the middle of it in a line parallel with the coast -lrb- take no account of its winding -rrb- and after they junction send they water together through the estuary of cabusao into the bay of san miguel the whole province therefore be traverse through its center by two navigable river which as regard commerce form only one -lrb- cabusao and pasacao harbor -rrb- but the harbor of cabusao at the bottom of the bay of san miguel be not accessible during the north-east monsoon and have this further disadvantage that the intercourse of the whole of the eastern part of luzon with manila can be carry on only by a very circuitous route on the south coast on the other hand be the harbor of pasacao into which a navigable little river above a mile in width discharge itself so that the distance between this river highway and the nearest point of the bicol river amount to a little more than a mile the road connect the two sea lay out by a active alcalde in 1847 and maintain up to 1852 be however at the date of my inquiry in so bad a condition that a picul of abacá pay two real freight for this short distance in the dry season and in the wet season it could not be forward for double the price -lrb- 139 -rrb- -lrb- bad road raise freight -rrb- many similar instance may be bring forward in 1861 the english vice-consul report that in iloilo a picul of sugar have rise more than 2 r in price -lrb- as much as the cost of freight from iloilo to manila -rrb- in consequence of the bad state of the road between the two place which be only one league asunder -lrb- social and political reason for bad road -rrb- if without reference to transport by sea the island be not favor in so extraordinary a manner by innumerable river with navigable mouth a still greater proportion of they produce would not have be convertible into money the people as well as the local authority have no desire for road which they themselves construct by force labor and when complete must maintain by the same method for when no road be make the laborer be so much more easily employ in private operation even the parish priest generally be as little favorable to the planning of commercial intercourse by means of which trade prosperity and enlightenment would be introduce into the country and they authority undermine indeed the government itself up to within a short time since favor such a state of affair for bad road belong to the essence of the old spanish colonial policy which be always direct to effect the isolation of the separate province of they great transmarine possession and to prevent the growth of a sense of national interest in order to facilitate they government by the distant mother country -lrb- spanish economic backwardness -rrb- besides in spain itself matter be no better the means of communication there be so very deficient that as a instance merchandise be send from santander to barcelona round the whole iberian peninsula in preference to the direct route which be partly accomplish by railway -lrb- 140 -rrb- in estremadura the hog be feed with wheat -lrb- live animal can be transport without road -rrb- while at the same time the seaport be import foreign grain -lrb- 141 -rrb- the cause of this condition of affair in that country be to be seek less in a disorder state of finance than in the enforcement of the government maxim which enjoin the isolation of separate province chapter xvii -lrb- mt isaróg -rrb- the isaróg -lrb- pronounced issaró -rrb- rise up in the middle of camarine between san miguel and lagonoy bay while its eastern slope almost reach the sea it be separate on its western side by a broad strip of inundate land from san miguel bay in circumference it be at least twelve league and its height 1966 meter -lrb- 142 -rrb- very flat at its base it swell gradually to 16 ° and higher up to 21 ° of inclination and extend itself in its western aspect into a flat dome-shaped summit but if view from the eastern side it have the appearance of a circular chain of mountain rent asunder by a great ravine on coello 's map this ravine be erroneously lay down as extend from south to north its bearing really be west to east right in front of its opening and half a league south from goa lie the pretty little village of rungus by which it be know the exterior side of the mountain and the fragment of its large crater be cover with impenetrable wood respect its volcanic eruption tradition say nothing -lrb- primitive mountaineer -rrb- the higher slope form the dwelling-place of a small race of people whose independence and the custom of a primitive age have almost entirely separate they from the inhabitant of the plain one or two cimarron might occasionally have be attract hither but no such instance be remember the inhabitant of the isaróg be commonly though mistakenly call igorot and i retain the name since they tribal relationship have not yet be accurately determine they themselves maintain that they ancestor always dwell in that locality there be some who in the opinion of the parish priest of camarine speak the bicol language in the purest manner they manners and custom be very similar in many respects to what they be on the arrival of the spaniard and sometimes they also remind one of those prevail among the dyak of borneo at the present day -lrb- 143 -rrb- these circumstance give rise to the conjecture that they may be the last of a race which maintain its independence against the spanish rule and probably also against the little tyrant who rule over the plain before the arrival of the european when juan de salcedo undertake he triumphal march round north luzon he find everywhere at the mouth of the river seafare tribe live under many chieftain who after a short struggle be slay by the superior discipline and better arm of the spaniard or submit voluntarily to the superior race but he do not succeed in subdue the independent tribe in the interior and these be still to be find in all the larger island of the philippine group -lrb- similarity to indian archipelago condition -rrb- similar condition be find in many place in the indian archipelago the malay carry on trade and piracy possess the shore and they language prevail there the native be either subdue by they or drive into the forest the inaccessibility of which ensure to they a miserable but independent existence -lrb- 144 -rrb- -lrb- policy of non-intercourse with heathen -rrb- in order to break down the opposition of the wild race the spanish government forbid its subject under the penalty of one hundred blow and two year of force labor to trade or to have any intercourse with the heathen in the mountain who pay no tribute to he catholic majesty for although they would exchange they gold wax etc for other necessaries they will never change for the better probably this law have for century directly contribute to save the barbarian notwithstanding they small number from complete extermination for free intercourse between a people exist by agriculture and another live principally by the chase speedily lead to the destruction of the latter -lrb- christian mountaineer ' village -rrb- the number of the igorot of the isaróg however be much diminish by deadly battle between the different rancho and by the maraud expedition which until a short time since be annually undertake by the commissioner of tax in the interest of the government monopoly against the tobacco field of the igorot some few have be pacify -lrb- convert to christianity and tribute -rrb- in which case they be oblige to establish themselves in little village of scatter hut where they can be occasionally visit by the priest of the nearest place and in order to render the change easier to they a smaller tax than usual be temporarily impose upon such newly-obtained subject -lrb- tobacco monopoly war -rrb- i have defer the ascent of the mountain until the beginning of the dry season of the year but i learn in naga that my wish be hardly practicable because the expedition against the rancho of the mountain which i have already mention usually occur about this time as the wild people could not understand why they should not cultivate on they own field a plant which have become a necessity to they they see in the cuadrillero not functionary of a civilized state but robber against whom they be oblige to defend themselves by force and appearance contribute no less to confirm they in they error for these do not content themselves with destroy the plantation of tobacco but the hut be burn to the ground the fruit-tree hew down and the field lay waste such foray never occur without bloodshed and often develop into a little war which be carry on by the mountaineer for a long time afterwards even against people who be entirely uninterested in it -- filipino and european the expedition this year be to take place in the beginning of April the igorot consequently be in a state of great agitation and have a few day previously murder a young unarmed spaniard in the vicinity of mabotoboto at the foot of the mountain by bring he to the ground with a poison arrow and afterwards inflict twenty-one wound with the wood-knife -lrb- bolo -rrb- -lrb- a policy of peace -rrb- fortunately there arrive soon after a countermand from manila where the authority seem to have be gradually convince of the harmful tendency of such violent measure it could not be doubt that this intelligence would quickly spread amongst the rancho and act upon the advice of the commandant -lrb- upon whom very much against he inclination the conduct of the expedition have devolve -rrb- i lose no time in avail myself of the anticipated season of quiet the government have since adopt the prudent method of purchase the tobacco which be voluntarily cultivate by the igorot at the ordinary rate and where practicable encourage they to lay out new field instead of destroy those in existence -lrb- a populous fertile district -rrb- the next day at noon i leave naga on horseback the pueblo of mogarao canaman quipayo and calabanga in this fertile district follow so thickly upon one another that they form a almost uninterrupted succession of house and garden calabanga lie half a league from the sea between the mouth of two river the more southerly of which be sixty foot broad and sufficiently deep for large trading vessel -lrb- 145 -rrb- -lrb- a bare plain and wretched village -rrb- the road wind round the foot of the isaróg first to the north-east and then to the east soon the bloom hedge cease and be succeed by a great bare plain out of which numerous flat hillock raise themselves both hill and plain when we pass serve for pasturage but from August to January they be sow with rice and field of bata be occasionally see after four hour we arrive at the little village of maguiring -lrb- manguirin -rrb- the church of which a tumble-down shed stand on a equally naked hillock and from its neglect condition one might have guess that the priest be a native -lrb- many mountain water course -rrb- this hillock as well as the other which i examine consist of the débris of the isaróg the more or less decompose trachytic fragment of hornblende rock the space between which be fill up with red sand the number of stream send down by the isaróg into san miguel and lagonoy bay be extraordinarily large on the tract behind maguiring i count in three-quarter of a hour five considerable estuary that be to say above twenty foot broad and then as far as goa twenty-six more altogether thirty-one : but there be more as i do not include the smallest and yet the distance between maguiring and goa in a straight line do not exceed three mile this account for the enormous quantity of steam with which this mighty condenser be feed i have not meet with this phenomenon on any other mountain in so strike a manner one very remarkable circumstance be the rapidity with which the brimming rivulet pass in the estuary enable they to carry the trading vessel sometimes even ship into a main stream -lrb- if the expression may be allow -rrb- while the scanty contribution of they kindred stream on the northern side have scarcely acquire the importance of a mill-brook these water from they breadth look like little river although in reality they consist of only a brook up to the foot of the mountain and of a river 's mouth in the plain the intermediate part be absent -lrb- comparison with javan mountain district -rrb- the country here be strikingly similar to the remarkable mountain district of the gelungúng describe by junghuhn -lrb- 146 -rrb- yet the origin of these rise grounds differ in some degree from that of those in java the latter be due to the eruption of 1822 and the great fissure in the wall of the crater of the gelungúng which be turn towards they show unmistakably whence the material for they formation be derive but the great chasm of the isaróg open towards the east and therefore have no relation to the numberless hillock on the north-west of the mountain behind maguir they run more closely together they summit be flatter and they side steeper and they pass gradually into a gently inclined slope rent into innumerable cleft in the hollow of which as many brook be actively employ in convert the angular outline of the little island into these round hillock the third river behind maguiring be larger than those precede it on the sixth lie the large visita of borobod and on the tenth that of ragay the rice field cease with the hill country and on the slope which be well drain by deep channel only wild cane and a few group of tree grow pass by many village whose hut be so isolate and conceal that they might remain unobserved we arrive at five o'clock at tagunton from which a road practicable for carabao cart and use for the transport of the abacá grow in the district lead to goa and here detain by sickness i hire a little house in which i lay for nearly four week no other remedy offer themselves to I but hunger and repose -lrb- useful friend -rrb- during this time i make the acquaintance of some newly-converted igorot and win they confidence without they i would have have great difficulty in ascend the mountain as well as to visit they tribe in its farm without any danger -lrb- 147 -rrb- when at last i be able to quit goa my friend conduct I as the first step to they settlement where have be previously recommend and expect i easily obtain the requisite number of attendant to take into they charge the animal and plant which be collect for I -lrb- a heathen mountaineer ' settlement -rrb- on the follow morning the ascent be commence even before we arrive at the first rancho i be convince of the good report that have precede I the master of the house come towards we and conduct we by a narrow path to he hut after have remove the foot-lance which project obliquely out of the ground but be dexterously conceal by brushwood and leave -lrb- 148 -rrb- a woman employ in weave at my desire continue she occupation the loom be of the simplest kind the upper end the chain-beam which consist of a piece of bamboo be fix to two bar or post and the weaver sit on the ground and to the two notch end of a small lath which supply the place of the weave beam hook on a wooden bow in the arch of which the back of the lath be fit place she foot against two peg in the ground and bend she back she by means of the bow stretch the material out straight a netting-needle longer than the breadth of the web serve instead of the weaver 's shuttle but it can be push through only by considerable friction and not always without break the chain of thread a lath of hard wood -lrb- caryota -rrb- sharpen like a knife represent the trestle and after every stroke it be place upon the edge after which the comb be push forward a thread put through and strike fast and so forth the web consist of thread of the abacá which be not spin but tie one to another -lrb- a giant fern hedge -rrb- the hut i visit deserve no special description compose of bamboo and palm-leaf they be not essentially different from the dwelling of poor filipino and in they neighborhood be small field plant with bata maize caladium and sugar-cane and enclose by magnificent polypody fern one of the highest of these which i cause to be fell for the purpose measure in the stem nine meter thirty centimeter in the crown two meter twelve centimeter and its total length be eleven meter forty-two centimeter or over thirty-six foot -lrb- simple stringed instrument -rrb- a young lad produce music on a kind of lute call baringbau consist of the dry shaft of the scitamina stretch in the form of a bow by means of a thin tendril instead of gut half a coco shell be fix in the middle of the bow which when play be place against the abdomen and serve as a sound board and the string when strike with a short wand give out a please hum sound realize the idea of the harp and plectrum in they simplest form other accompany the musician on jew ' harp of bamboo as accurate as those of the mintra on the malay peninsula and there be one who play on a guitar which he have himself make but after a european pattern the hut contain no utensil besides bow arrow and a cooking pot the possessor of clothes bear they on he person i find the woman as decently clothe as the filipino christian woman and carry besides a forest knife or bolo as a mark of entire confidence i be take into the tobacco field which be well conceal and protect by foot-lance and they appear to be carefully look after -lrb- the people and they crop -rrb- the result of my familiarity with this people both before and after this opportunity may be briefly sum up : they live on the higher slope of the mountain never indeed below 1500 foot each family by itself it be difficult to ascertain how many of they there may now be as but little intercourse take place amongst they in the part of the mountain belong to the district of goa they number be estimate at about fifty man and twenty woman include the child : but twenty year before the population be more numerous they food consist principally of bata besides some gabus -lrb- caladium -rrb- a little maize be likewise cultivate as well as some ubus -lrb- dioscorea -rrb- and a small quantity of sugar-cane for chew -lrb- batatas -rrb- in lay out a bata field a wood be partially clear the earth loosen with the blunt forest knife -lrb- bolo -rrb- and the bulb or layer then plant and within four month the harvest begin and continue uninterruptedly from the time the creep plant strike root and form tuber -lrb- rotation of crop -rrb- after two year however the produce be so much diminish that the old plant be pull up in order to make room for new one obtain from the runner the field be then change or other fruit cultivate thereon but with the addition of manure a piece of land fifty braza long and thirty wide be sufficient for the support of a family only occasionally in the wet season do this resource fail and then they resort to gabus which appear to be as easily cultivate on wet as on dry ground but be not so profitable as bata the young shoot of the gabus be plant at distance of a vara and if consume in a proper manner ought not to be crop till after a year each family kill weekly one or two wild hog stag be rare although i obtain a fine pair of horn and they do not use the skin bow and arrow be use in hunting some poison and some not every rancho keep dog which live principally on bata and also cat to protect the field against rat and they also have poultry -lrb- game cock a spanish innovation -rrb- but no game cock which have be first introduce into the philippine by the spaniard be seldom if ever want in the hut of the filipino but the inhabitant of the isaróg be as yet free from this passion -lrb- trade -rrb- the few product of a more advanced civilization which they require they obtain by the sale of the spontaneous production of they forest chiefly wax and resin -lrb- pilus -rrb- -lrb- 149 -rrb- apnik dagiangan -lrb- a kind of copal -rrb- and some abacá wax which be much in request for church solemnity fetch half a dollar per catty and resin average half a real per chinanta business be transact very simply filipino have intercourse with the igorot make a contract with they and they collect the product and bring they to a place previously agree on where the filipino receive they after pay down the stipulate price -lrb- religion -rrb- physician and magician or person suppose to be possess of secret power be unknown every one help himself in order to arrive at a clear understanding of they religious view a longer intercourse would be necessary but they certainly believe in one god or at least say so when they be closely question by christian and have also loosely acquire several of the external practice of catholicism which they employ as spell -lrb- respect for woman and aged -rrb- hunting and hard labor constitute the employment of man in general as well as in the philippine the practice of employ woman as beast of burden -- which although it exist among many of the people of europe for example the basque wallachian and portuguese be almost peculiar to barbarous nation -- seem to have be lose in the philippine as far back as the time of its discovery by the spaniard and even among the wild people of the isaróg the woman engage only in light labor and be well treat every family support its aged and those unfit for labor -lrb- medicine -rrb- headache and fever be state to I as the prevalent malady for which burnt rice pound and mixed to a pap with water be take as a remedy and in case of severe headache they make a incision in the forehead of the sufferer they prevalence be explain by the habit of neutralize the ill effect of drinking water in excess when they be heat by the consumption of warm water in large dose and the rule hold with regard to coco-water the remedy for immoderate use of which be warm coco-water they muscular power be small and they be not able to carry more than fifty pound weight to any considerable distance -lrb- manufacture -rrb- besides the chase and agriculture they occupation be restricted to the manufacture of extremely rude weapon for which they purchase the iron when require from the filipino and of the coarse web make by the woman and of wicker work every father of a family be master in he own house and acknowledge no power higher than himself in the event of war with neighbor tribe the bravest place himself at the head and the rest follow he as long as they be able there be no deliberate choosing of a leader -lrb- death custom -rrb- on the whole they be peaceful and honorable towards each other although the idle occasionally steal the fruit of the field and should the thief be catch the person rob punish he with blow of the rattan without be under any apprehension of vengeance in consequence if a man die he nearest kinsman go out to requite he death by the death of some other individual take at random the rule be strictly enforce for a dead man a man must be kill for a woman a woman and for a child a child unless indeed it be a friend they encounter the first victim that offer be kill latterly however owe to the unusual success attain by some of they in represent the occurrence of death as a unavoidable destiny the custom be say to have fall into desuetude and the relative do not exact the satisfaction this be easy in the case of the decease be a ordinary person but to the present day vengeance be require in the event of the death of a beloved child or wife if a man kill a woman of another house she nearest kinsman endeavor to kill a woman of the house of the murderer but to the murderer himself he do nothing and the corpse of the victim thus slay as a death-offering be not bury nor be its head cut off and she family in they turn seek to avenge the death by murder this be reckon the most honorable course should the murderer however be too strong to be so overcome any weaker person be it who it may be slay in retaliation and hence probably the comparatively small number of woman -lrb- marriage -rrb- polygamy be permit but even the most courageous and skilful seldom or never have more than one wife a young man wish to marry commission he father to treat with the father of the bride as to the price which latterly have greatly increase but the average be ten bolo cost from four to six real each and about $ 12 in cash and the acquisition of so large a sum by the sale of wax resin and abacá often take the bridegroom two year the bride-money go partly to the father and partly to the nearest relation every one of whom have a equal interest if there should be many of they almost nothing remain for the father who have to give a great feast on which occasion much palm-wine be drunk -lrb- sexual crime -rrb- any man use violence towards a girl be kill by she parent if the girl be willing and the father hear of it he agree upon a day with the former on which he be to bring the bride 's dowry which should he refuse to do he be catch by the relation bind to a tree and whip with a cane adultery be of most rare occurrence but when it do take place the dowry be return either by the woman who then acquire she freedom or by the seducer whom she then follow the husband have not the right to detain she if he take the money or even if he should refuse it but the latter contingency be not likely to arise since that sum of money will enable he to buy for himself a new wife -lrb- basira ravine -rrb- in the afternoon we reach a vast ravine call basira 973 meter above uacloy and about 1134 meter above the sea extend from south-east to north-west between lofty precipitous range cover with wood its base which have a inclination of 33 ° consist of a naked bed of rock and after every violent rainfall give issue to a torrent of water which discharge itself violently here we bivouac and the igorot in a very short time build a hut and remain on the watch outside at daybreak the thermometer stand at 139 ° r -lrb- 150 -rrb- -lrb- at the summit -rrb- the road to the summit be very difficult on account of the slippery clay earth and the tough network of plant but the last five hundred foot be unexpectedly easy the very steep summit be cover with a very thick growth of thinly leave knot mossy thibaudium rhododendra and other dwarf wood whose innumerable tough branch run at a very small height along the ground and parallel to it form a compact and secure lattice-work by which one mount upwards as on a slightly inclined ladder the point which we reach \* \* \* be evidently the highest spur of the horseshoe-shaped mountain side which bound the great ravine of rungus on the north the top be hardly fifty pace in diameter and so thickly cover with tree that i have never see its like we have not room to stand my active host however go at once to work though the task of cut a path through the wood involve severe labor and chop off the branch build therewith on the top of the lop tree a observatory from which i should have have a wide panoramic view and a opportunity for take celestial altitude have not everything be envelop in a thick mist the neighbor volcano be visible only in glimpse as well as san miguel bay and some lake in the interior immediately after sunset the thermometer register 125 ° r -lrb- 151 -rrb- -lrb- the descent -rrb- on the follow morning it be still overcast and when about ten o'clock the cloud become thicker we set out on we return it be my intention to have pass the night in a rancho in order next day to visit a solfatara which be say to be a day 's journey further but my companion be so exhaust by fatigue that they ask for at least a few hour ' rest -lrb- fern and orchid -rrb- on the upper slope i observe no palm with the exception of calamus but polypody -lrb- fern -rrb- be very frequent and orchid surprisingly abundant in one place all the tree be hang at a convenient height with flowering aërids of which one could have collect thousand without any trouble the most beautiful plant be a medinellum of so delicate a texture that it be impossible to preserve it -lrb- carbonic acid spring -rrb- within a quarter of a hour north-east of uacloy a considerable spring of carbonic acid burst from the ground deposit abundance of calcareous sinter we torch be quickly extinguish and a fowl cover with a cigar-box die in a few minute to the supreme astonishment of the igorot to whom these phenomenon be entirely new -lrb- farewell to mountaineer -rrb- on the second day of rest my poor host who have accompany I back to uacloy still feel so weary that they be not fit for any undertaking with naked head and belly they squat in the burning sun in order to replenish they body with the heat which they have lose during the bivouac on the summit for they be not allow to drink wine when i finally leave they on the follow day we have become such good friend that i be compel to accept a tame wild pig as a present a troop of man and woman accompany I until they see the glitter roof of maguiring when after the exchange of hearty farewell they return to they forest the native whom i have take with I from goa have prove so lazy and morose that nearly the whole task of make the path through the forest have fall upon the igorot from sheer laziness they throw away the drinking water of which they be the porter and the igorot be oblige to fetch water from a considerable distance for we bivouac on the summit in all my troublesome march i have always do better with cimarron than with the civilized native the former i have find oblige trustworthy active and acquaint with locality while the latter generally display the opposite quality it would however be unjust to form a conclusive opinion as to they comparative merit from these fact for the wild people be at home when in the forest what they do be do voluntarily and the stranger when he possess they confidence be treat as a guest -lrb- force labor -rrb- but the filipino be reluctant companion polista who even when they receive a high rate of wages consider that they be act most honorably when they do as little as possible at any rate it be no pleasure to they to leave they village in order to become luggage-porter or beater of road on fatiguing march in impracticable district and to camp out in the open air under every deprivation for they still more than for the european peasant repose be the most agreeable refreshment the less comfort any one enjoy at home the greater be the reluctance with which he leave it and the same thing may be observe in europe -lrb- a petition for liquor -rrb- as the igorot be not permit to have cocoa-palm for the preparation of wine vinegar and brandy so that they might not infringe the monopoly of the government they present I with a petition entreat I to obtain this favor for they the document be put together by a filipino writer in so ludicrously confuse a manner that i give it as a specimen of philippine clerkship -lrb- 152 -rrb- at all event it have the best of result for the petitioner be accord twice as much as they have pray for -lrb- wind and plant season -rrb- the south-west monsoon last in this region -lrb- district of goa -rrb- from April to October April be very calm -lrb- navegación de señoras -rrb- from June to August the south-west wind blow steadily march April and may be the driest month there be shift wind in march and the beginning of April while from October to December be the time of storm s francisco -lrb- 4th October -rrb- bring bad weather rice be plant in September and reap in February chapter xviii -lrb- mt iriga -rrb- from the isarog i return through naga and nabua to iriga the ascent of which i at length accomplish -lrb- the ascent -rrb- the chief of the montesino have receive daily ration for twenty-two man with whom he profess to make a road to the summit but when on the evening of the third day he come himself to iriga in order to fetch more provision on the pretext that the work still require some time for execution i explain that i should endeavor to ascend the mountain on the follow morning and request he to act as guide he consent but disappear together with he companion during the night the filipino in the tribunal have be good enough to hold out the prospect of severe punishment in case the work perform should not correspond to the work day after fruitless search for another guide we leave buhus in the afternoon and pass the night in the rancho where we have previously be so hospitably receive the fire be still burn but the inhabitant on we approach have flee about six o'clock on the follow morning the ascent begin after we have go through the forest by avail ourselves of the path which we have previously beat it lead we through grass three or four foot in height with keen-edged leaf succeed by cane from seven to eight foot high of the same habitat with we arundo phragmite -lrb- but it be not in flower -rrb- which occupy the whole of the upper part of the mountain as far as the edge only in the ravine do the tree attain any height the lower declivity be cover with aroid and fern towards the summit be tendril and moss and here i find a beautiful new and peculiarly shaped orchid -lrb- 153 -rrb- the cimarron have cut down some cane and beat down we road for ourselves with bolo we arrive at the summit a little before ten o'clock it be very foggy in the hope of a clear evening or morning i cause a hut to be erect for which purpose the cane be well fit the native be too lazy to erect a lodging for themselves or to procure wood for a watchfire they squat on the ground squeeze close to one another to warm themselves eat cold rice and suffer thirst because none of they would fetch water of the two water-carrier whom i have take with I one have inadvertently upset he water on the road and the other have throw it away because he think we should not

through a few gap could one reach the bank right across the mouth of the quinalus lie in the lake a bar of black mud the softest part of which be indicate by some insignificant channel of water as we could not get over the bar in a large boat two small skiff be bind together with a matting of bamboo and provide with a awning by means of this contrivance which be draw by three strong carabao -lrb-

it to ensure they safety by make for the land the place on the coast destitute of other arm than wooden pike be completely expose to the pirate who have firmly establish themselves in catanduane birus and several small island and seize ship with impunity or rob man on the land almost daily fresh robbery and murder be announce from the village on the shore during a plunder expedition the man catch be employ at the oar and at its close sell as slave and on the division of the spoil one of the crew fall to the share of the dato -lrb- moro chief -rrb- who fit out the vessel -lrb- 155 -rrb- the

bisayan island come the same cry for help the government however be powerless against the evil if the complaint be indeed very urgent they would send a steamer into the water most infested but it hardly ever come in sight of pirate although the latter be carry on they depredation close in front and behind -lrb- government steamer easily elude -rrb- at samar the principal town i subsequently meet with a government steamer which for fourteen day past have be nominally engage in cruise against the pirate but the latter generally forewarn by they spy perceive the smoke of the steamer sufficiently soon to slip away in they flat boat and the officer know beforehand that they cruise would have no other result than to show the distressed province that they outcry be not altogether unnoticed -lrb- 158 -rrb- -lrb- steam gunboat more successful -rrb- twenty small steam gunboat of light draught have shortly before be order from england and be nearly ready the first two indeed arrive soon after in manila -lrb- they have to be transport in piece round the cape -rrb- and be to be follow by the rest and they be at one time almost successful in deliver the archipelago from these burdensome pest -lrb- 159 -rrb- at least from the proscribed moro who come every year from the sulu sea mostly from the island of tawitawus arrive in may at the bisaya and continue they

of the victorium regium and tuber of red and blue nympha -lrb- water-lily -rrb- those in the first flask be spoil as might have be expect but in that fill with moist clay two tuber have throw out shoot of half a inch in length and appear quite sound i plant they at once and in a few day vigorous leaf be develop one of these beautiful plant which have be originally intend for the buitenzorg garden in java remain in legaspus the other i send to manila where on my return i see it in full bloom in the charcoal two victorium seed have throw out root above a inch in length which have rot off most likely they have be tear up by the custom-house inspector and have afterwards rot for the neck of the bottle be break and the charcoal appear as if it have be stir i communicate the brilliant result of he mode of packing to the inspector of the botanical garden at berlin who make a second consignment direct to java which arrive in the best condition so that not only the victorium but also the one which have be derive in berlin from a african father and a asiatic mother now adorn the water-basin of java with red pond-rose -lrb- the latter plant probably those of the philippine also -rrb- -lrb- carpenter difficulty -rrb- be compel by the continuous rain to dry my collection in two oven before pack they i find that my servant have burn the greater part so that the remains find a place in a roomy chest which i purchase for a dollar at a auction this unfortunately lack a lid to procure which i be oblige in the first place to liberate a carpenter who have be imprison for a small debt secondly to advance money for the purchase of a board and the redemption of he tool out of pawn and even then the work when it be begin be several time break off because previous claim of violent creditor have to be discharge by labor in five day the lid be complete at the cost of three dollar it do not last long however for in manila i have to get it replace by a new one -lrb- off to samar -rrb- at legaspus i availed myself of a opportunity to reach the island of samar in a small schooner it be situate south-east from luzon on the farther side of the strait of san bernardino which be three league in breadth at the moment of my departure to my great regret my servant leave I that he might rest a little from he fatigue for pepe be good-natured very skilful and always even-tempered -lrb- lose a clever assistant -rrb- he have learn much from the numerous spanish soldier and sailor resident in cavite he native place where he use to be playfully call the spaniard of cavite roving from one place to another be he delight and he quickly acquire acquaintance he know especially how to gain the favor of the lady for he possess many social accomplishment be equally able to play the guitar and to milk the carabao-cow when we come to a pueblo where a mestiza or even a daughter of the country -lrb- creole -rrb- dwelt he would when practicable ask permission to milk a cow and after bring the señora some of the milk under pretext of be the interpreter of my wish he would maintain such a flow of ingeniously courteous conversation praise the beauty and grace of the lady and most modestly allow he prodigious travel adventure to be extract from he that both knight and esquire beam with brilliant radiance a present be always welcome and bring we many a little basket of orange and carabao milk be excellent with chocolate : but it seem as if one seldom have the opportunity of milk a cow unfortunately pepe do not like climb mountain and when he be to have go with I he either get the stomach-ache or give away my strong shoe or allow they to be steal the native one however be allow to remain untouched for he know well that they be fit only for ride and derive comfort from the fact in company with I he work quickly and cheerfully but when alone it become tedious to he particularly he find friend who hinder he and then he would abandon he skinning of the bird which therefore become putrid and have to be throw away pack be still more disagreeable to he and consequently he do it as quickly as possible though not always with sufficient care as on one occasion he tie up in one and the same bundle shoe arsenic-soap drawing and chocolate notwithstanding trifling fault of this kind he be very useful and agreeable to I but he do not go willingly to such a uncivilized island as samar and when he receive he wages in full for eight month all in a lump and so become a small capitalist he could not resist the temptation to rest a little from he labor

September be not so constant as the north-east the last-named three month constitute the dry season which however be often interrupt by thunderstorm not a week indeed pass without rain and in many year a storm arise every afternoon at this season of the year ship can reach the east coast but during the north-east monsoon navigation there be impossible these general circumstance be subject to many local deviation particularly on the south and west coast where the uniformity of the air current be disturb by the mountainous island lie in front of they accord to the estado geografico of 1855 a extraordinarily high tide call dolo occur every year at the change of the monsoon in September or October it rise sometimes sixty or seventy foot and dash itself with fearful violence against the south and east coast do great damage but not last for any length of time the climate of samar and leyte appear to be very healthy on the coast in fact to be the best of all the island of the archipelago dysentery diarrhoea and fever occur less frequently than in luzon and european also be less subject to they attack than in that place -lrb- only the coast settle -rrb- the civilized native live almost solely on its coast and there be also bisayan who differ in speech and manners from the bicol in about the same degree that the latter do from the tagalog road and village be almost

widely-spread tradition the settlement be originally in samar itself in the middle of the rice-field which continue to the present day in that place until the repeat inroad of sea-pirate drive the inhabitant in spite of the inconvenience attend it to protect themselves by settle on the south coast of the little island which rise steeply out of the sea -lrb- 163 -rrb- the latter consist of almost horizontal bank of tufa from eight to twelve inch in thickness the stratum be continually eat away by the wave at low watermark the upper layer break off and thus the uppermost part of the stratum which be of a tolerably uniform thickness be cleft by vertical fissure and look like the wall of a fortress press for space the church and the convent have take up every level bit of the rock at various height and the effect of this accommodation of architecture to the requirement of the ground though not design by the architect be most picturesque -lrb- deterioration in the town -rrb- the place be beautifully situate but the house be not so frequently as formerly surround by little garden while there be a great want of water and foul odor prevail two or three scanty spring afford a muddy brackish water almost at the level of the sea with which the indolent people be content so that they have just enough wealthy people have they water bring from samar and the poorer class be sometimes compel by the drying-up of the spring to have recourse to the same place the spring-water be not plentiful for bathing purpose and sea-bathing not be in favor the people consequently be very dirty they clothing be the same as in luzon but the woman wear no tapi only a camisa -lrb- a short chemise hardly cover the breast -rrb- and a saya mostly of coarse stiff guinara which form ugly fold and when not color black be very transparent but dirt and a filthy existence form a better screen than opaque garment the inhabitant of lauang rightly indeed enjoy the reputation of be very idle they industry be limit to a little tillage even fish be so neglect that frequently there be a scarcity of fish in the absence of road by land there be hardly any communication by water and trade be mostly

unless a valid protest be make either by the parish priest or by the elector the one who have the most vote be forthwith name gobernadorcillo for the coming year subject to the approval of the superior jurisdiction at manila which however always consent for the influence of the priest would provide against a disagreeable election the election of the other functionary take place in the same manner after the new gobernadorcillo have be first summon into the hall in order that if he have any important objection to the officer then about to be elect he may be able to make they the whole affair be conduct very quietly and with dignity -lrb- 165 -rrb- -lrb- unsatisfactory force labor -rrb- on the follow morning accompany by the oblige priest who be follow by nearly all the boy of the

rice-field and coco-grove extend but the latter be conceal by a thick border of nipa palm and lofty cane be only visible occasionally through the gap the sandy bank at first flat become gradually steeper and the rock soon show itself close at hand with firm bank of sandy clay contain occasional trace of indistinguishable petrifaction a small mussel -lrb- 167 -rrb- have pierce the clay bank at the water-line in such number that they look like honeycomb about twelve we cook we rice in a isolate hut amongst friendly people the woman whom we surprise in dark ragged clothing of guinara draw back ashamed and soon after appear in clean chequered saya with earring of brass and tortoise-shell comb when i draw a little naked girl the mother force she to put on a garment about two we again step into the boat and after rowing the whole night reach a small visita cobocobo about nine in the forenoon the rower have work without interruption for twenty-four hour exclusive of the two hour ' rest at noon and though somewhat tired be in good spirit -lrb- salta sangley ridge -rrb- at half-past two we set out on the road over the salta sangley -lrb- chinese leap -rrb- to tragbucan which distant about a mile in a straight line be situate at the place where the calbayot which empty on the west coast at point hibaton become navigable for small boat by means of these two river and the short but troublesome road a communication exist between the important station of catarman on the north coast and calbayot on the west coast the road which at its best part be a small path in the thick wood uninvaded by the sun and frequently be only a track pass over slippery ridge of clay disappear in the mud puddle in the intervene hollow and sometimes run into the bed of the brook the watershed between the catarman and calbayot be form by the salta sangley already mention a flat ridge compose of bank of clay and sandstone which succeed one another ladder-wise downward on both its side and from which the water collect at the top descend in little cascade in the most difficult place rough ladder of bamboo be fix i count fifteen brook on the north-east side which feed the catarman and about the same number of feeder of the calbayot on the south-west side about forty minute past four we reach the highest point of the salta sangley about ninety foot above the sea and at half-past six we get to a stream the highest part of the calbayot in the bed of which we wander until its increase depth force we in the dark laboriously to beat out we path through the underwood to its bank and about eight o'clock we find ourselves opposite the visita tragbucan the river at this place be already six foot deep and there be not a boat after shout entreaty and threat for a long time the people who be startle out of sleep by a revolver shot agree to construct a raft of bamboo on which they put we and we baggage the little place which consist of only a few poor hut be prettily situate surround as it be by wooded hillock on a plateau of sand fifty foot above the reed-bordered river -lrb- on the calbayot river -rrb- thanks to the activity of the teniente of catarman who accompany I a boat be procure without delay so that we be able to continue we journey about seven o'clock the bank be from twenty to forty foot high and with the exception of the cry of some rhinoceros bird which flutter from bough to bough on the top of the tree we neither hear nor see a trace of animal life about half-past eleven we reach taibago a small visita and about half-past one a similar one magubay and after two hour ' rest at noon about five o'clock we get into a current down which we skilfully float almost without admit any water the river which up to this point be thirty foot broad and on account of many project branch of tree difficult to navigate here be twice as broad about eleven at night we reach the sea and in a complete calm row for the distance of a league along the coast to calbayot the convent at which place afford a commanding view of the island lie before it a thunderstorm oblige we to postpone the journey to the chief town catbalogan -lrb- or catbalonga -rrb- which be seven league distant until the afternoon in a long boat form out of the stem of one tree and furnish with outrigger we travel along the shore which be margin by a row of low-wooded hill with many small visita and as night be set in we round the point of napalisan a rock of trachytic conglomerate shape by perpendicular fissure with round edge into a series of projection like tower which rise up out of the sea to the height of sixty foot like a knight 's castle -lrb- catbalogan -rrb- at night we reach catbalogan the chief town of the island with a population of six thousand which be picturesquely situate in the middle of the western border in a little bay surround by island and neck of land difficult to approach and therefore little guard not a single vessel be anchor in the harbor the house many of which be of board be neater than those in camarine and the people though idle be more modest more honorable more oblige and of cleaner habit than the inhabitant of south luzon through the courtesy of the governor i quickly obtain a roomy dwelling and a servant who understand spanish -lrb- a ingenious mechanic -rrb- here i also meet a very intelligent filipino who have acquire great skill in a large variety of craft with the simplest tool he improve in many point on my instrument and apparatus the purpose of which he quickly comprehend to my entire satisfaction and give many proof of considerable intellectual ability -lrb- the fly monkey -rrb- in samar the fly monkey or lemur -lrb- the kaguang of the bisayan -- galeopithecus -rrb- be not rare these animal which be of the size of the domestic cat belong to the quadrumana but like the fly squirrel they be provide with a bird-like membrane which commence at the neck and pass over the fore and hinder limb reach to the tail by means of which they be able to glide from one tree to another at a very obtuse angle -lrb- 168 -rrb- body and membrane be clothe with a very short fur which nearly equal the chinchilla in firmness and softness and be on that account in great request while i be there six live kaguang arrive as a present for the priest -lrb- three light gray one dark brown and two greyish brown all with irregularly distribute spot -rrb- and from these i secure a little female with she young -lrb- a hasty and unfounded judgment -rrb- it appear to be a very harmless awkward animal when liberate from its fetter it remain lie on the ground with all its four limb stretch out and its belly in contact with the earth and then hop in short awkward leap without thereby raise itself from the ground to the nearest wall which be of planed board arrive there it feel about it for a long time with the sharp claw which be bent inwards of its fore-hand until at length it realize the impossiblity of climb it at any part it succeed by means of a corner or a accidental crevice in climb a foot upward and fall down again immediately because it have abandon the comparatively secure footing of its hinder limb before its fore-claw have obtain a firm hold it receive no hurt as the violence of the fall be break by the fly membrane which be rapidly extend these attempt which be continue with steady perseverance show a astonishing deficiency of judgment the animal endeavor to do much more than be in its power to accomplish all its endeavor therefore be

it probably would have exercise its judgment to a greater extent and form a more correct estimate of its ability the animal repeat its fruitless effort so often that i no longer take any notice of it and after some time it disappear : but i find it again in a dark corner under the roof where it would probably have wait for the night in order to continue its flight evidently it have succeed in reach the upper edge of the board wall by squeeze its body between this and the elastic covering of bamboo hurdle-work which lay firmly impose upon it so that the poor creature which i have rashly conclude be stupid and awkward have under the circumstance manifest the greatest possible skill prudence and perseverance -lrb- a promise of rare animal and wild people -rrb- a priest who be present on a visit from calbigan promise I so many wonder in he district -- abundance of the rarest animal and cimarrone uncivilize in the highest degree -- that i accompany he on the follow day in he journey

the case on this coast -rrb- a row of small picturesque island succeed one another and be exactly four league from catbalogan but calbigan which we reach towards evening be situate two league nne from umauas surround by rice-field forty foot above the river of the same name and almost a league and a half from its mouth a tree with beautiful violet-blue panicle of blossom be especially abundant on

friend he catch two poisonous serpent -lrb- 169 -rrb- which we encounter on the road by dexterously seize they immediately behind the head so that they be incapable of do harm and when he command they to lie still he take the precaution of place he foot on they neck in the chase i hurt my foot so severely against a sharp-pointed branch which be conceal by the mud that i be oblige to return to catbalogan without effect my object the inhabitant of calbigan be consider more active and circumspect than those on the west coast and they be praise for they honesty i find they very skilful and they seem to take a evident pleasure in make collection and prepare plant and animal so that i would gladly have take with I a servant from the place but they be so reluctant to leave they village that all the priest 's effort to induce one to ride with we be fruitless -lrb- a coral garden -rrb- at a short distance north-west from catbalogan a most luxuriant garden of coral be to be observe in less than two fathom at the ebb on a yellow carpet of calcareous polyp and sponge group of leather-like stalk finger-thick lift themselves up like stem of vegetable growth they upper end thickly cover with polyp -lrb- sarcophyton pulmo esp -rrb- which display they rose of tentaculum wide open and resplendent with the most beautiful vary color look in fact like flower in full bloom very large

detain I some day in the chief town i proceed up the bay which extend southwards from catbalogan and from west to east as far as parana its northern shore consist of ridge of earth regular and of equal height extend from north to south with gentle slope towards the west but steep declivity on the east and terminate abruptly towards the sea nine little village be situate on this coast between catbalogan and parana from the hollow amidst coco and betel palm they expand in isolate group of house up the gentle western slope and on reach the summit terminate in a little castle which hardly afford protection against the pirate but generally form a pretty feature in the landscape in front of the southern edge of the bay and to the south-west many small island and wooded rock be visible with the mountain of leyte in the high-ground constitute a ever-shifting series of view -lrb- parana -rrb- as the man owe to the sultry heat the complete calm and almost cloudless sky sleep quite as much as they row we do not reach parana before the afternoon it be a clean village situate on a declivity between twenty and a hundred and fifty foot above the sea the side which stand perpendicularly in the sea consist of gray bank of clay recede landward and overspread with a layer of fragment of mussel the interval between which be fill up with clay and over the latter be a solid breccium cement with lime compose of similar fragment in the clay bank be well-preserved petrifaction so similar in color habitat and aspect to many of those in the german tertiary formation that they might be take for they the breccium also be fossil probably also tertiary at all event the identity of the few species which be recognisable in it -- cerithium pecten and venus -- with live species could not be

sun and rain the frame be furnish with a light roof of pandanus -lrb- poor road -rrb- the road be pretty nearly as bad as those at the salta sangley and with the exception of the sea-shore which be sometimes available there appear to be none better in samar after three hour we reach the loquilocun which come from the north here touch its most southerly point and then flow south-east to the great ocean through the kind care of the governor i find two small boat ready which be propel with wonderful dexterity by two man squat at the extreme end and -lrb- run the rapid -rrb- glide between the branch of the tree and rock into the bed of the rapid mountain torrent amidst loud cheer both the boat glide down a cascade of a foot and a half in height without ship any water -lrb- loquilocun -rrb- the little village of loquilocun consist of three group of house on three hillock the inhabitant be very friendly modest and oblige and so successful in collect that the spirit of wine which i have with I be quickly consume in catbalogan my messenger be able with difficulty to procure a few small flask through the awkward arrangement of a too oblige friend my own store have be send to a wrong address do not reach I until some month afterwards and the palm-wine which be to be buy in samar be too weak one or two boat go out daily to fish for I but i obtain only a few specimen which belong to almost as many species and genus probably the bad custom of poisoning the water in order to kill the fish -lrb- the pound fruit of a barringtonium here be employ for the purpose -rrb- be the cause of the river be so empty of fish -lrb- numerous small stream -rrb- after a few day we leave the little place about half-past nine in the forenoon pack closely in two small boat and by seven minute past one when we reach a inhabit hut in the forest we have descend more than forty stream of a foot and a foot and a half and more in depth the more important of they have name which be correctly give on coello 's map and the follow be they distance by the watch : -- at ten o'clock we come to a narrow rocky chasm at the extremity of which the water fall several foot below into a large basin and here we unloaded the boat which hitherto have under skilful management wind they way like well-trained horse between all the impediment in the bed of the river and over all the cascade and wave almost without take any water only two man remain in each boat who loudly cheer shot downward in do which the boat be fill to the brim -lrb- jasper and coal -rrb- opposite this waterfall a bank of rubbish have be form by the alluvium in which besides fragment of the subjacent rock be find well-rounded piece of jasper and porphyry as well as some bit of coal contain several pyrites which have probably be bring during the rain from higher up the river its origin be unknown to the sailor from fifty-six minute past eleven to twelve o'clock there be a uninterrupted succession of rapid which be pass with the greatest dexterity without take in water somewhat lower down at about three minute past twelve we take in so much water that we be compel to land and bale it out at about fifteen minute past twelve we proceed onward the river now be on the average sixty foot broad on the edge of the wood some slender palm hardly ten foot high be remarkable by they frequency and many phalaenops by they display of blossom which be of rare occurrence neither bird nor ape nor serpent be observe but large python as thick as one 's leg be say to be not unfrequent -lrb- big python -rrb- about thirty-six minute past twelve we reach one of the most difficult place -- a succession of wave with many rock project out of the water between which the boat now in full career and with rapid evolution glide successfully the adventure be accomplish with equal skill by the two crew who exert they power to the utmost at seventeen minute past one we arrive at -lrb- dini portage -rrb- dini the most considerable waterfall in the whole distance and here we have to take the boat out of the water and avail ourselves of the liana which hang down from the lofty forest tree like rope we drag they over the rock at twenty-one minute past two we resume we journey and from twenty-two minute past to half past eight we descend a irregular stair compose of several ledge ship much water up to this point the loquilocun flow in a rocky bed with -lrb- for the most part -rrb- steep bank and sometimes for a long distance under a thick canopy of bough from which powerful tendril and fern more than a fathom in length be suspend here the country be to some extent open flat hillock with low underwood come to view and on the north-west loftier wood mountain the last two hour be notable for a heavy fall of rain and about half past five we reach a solitary house occupy by friendly people where we take up we quarter for the night -lrb- down the river -rrb- on the follow morning the journey be continue

cover by the sea during the flow but be open during the ebb when its salt taste be hardly perceptible in order to test the water a well be form by sink a deep bottomless jar and from this after the water have flow for the space of half a hour a sample be take which to my regret be afterwards lose the temperature of the water of the spring at eight o'clock in the forenoon be 277 ° of the

only in samar and live exclusively on charcoal my first mago be in the begin somewhat voracious but he disdain vegetable food and be particular in he choice of insect devour live grasshopper with delight -lrb- 172 -rrb- it be extremely ludicrous when he be feed in the day time to see the animal standing perch up perpendicularly on he two thin leg with he bare tail and turn he large head -- round as a ball and with very large yellow owl-like eye -- in every direction look like a dark lantern on a pedestal with a circular swivel only gradually do he succeed in fix he eye on the object present to he but as soon as he do perceive it he immediately extend he little arm sideways as though somewhat bashful and then like a delighted child suddenly seize it with hand and mouth at once he deliberately tear the prey to piece during the day the mago be sleepy short-sighted and when disturbed morose but with the decrease daylight he expand he pupil and move about in a lively and agile

boat man by sixteen rower be fit out for the purpose with a smaller crew they would not have venture to undertake the journey on they return home a thunderstorm break over they and the sailor believe it to be a punishment for they outrage be prevent only by the fear of make the matter worse from throw coffin and skull into the sea fortunately the land be near and they row with all they might towards it and when they arrive i be oblige to take the object out of the boat myself as no native would touch they -lrb- the cavern 's contents -rrb- notwithstanding i be the next morning successful in find some resolute individual who accompany I to the cavern in the first two which we examine we find nothing the third contain several broken coffin some skull and potsherd of glaze and crudely paint earthenware of which however it be impossible to find two piece that belong to each other a narrow hole lead from the large cavern into a obscure space which be so small that one could remain in it only for a few seconds with the burning torch this circumstance may explain the discovery in a coffin which be eat to piece by worm and quite mouldered away of a well-preserved skeleton or rather a mummy for in many place there be carcass clothe with dry fiber of muscle and skin it lay upon a mat of pandanus which be yet recognizable with a cushion under the head stuff with plant and cover with

drag the boat over the stony bed in this manner we pass through a sharp curve twelve foot in height form by two rock throw opposite to each other into a tranquil oval-shaped basin of water enclose in a circle of limestone wall incline inwards of from sixty to seventy foot in height on the upper edge of which a circle of tree permit only a misty sunlight to glimmer through the thick foliage a magnificent gateway of rock fifty to sixty foot high and adorn with numerous stalactite raise itself up opposite the low entrance and through it we could see at some distance the upper portion of the river bath in the sun -lrb- a beautiful grotto -rrb- a cavern of a hundred foot in length and easily climb open itself in the left side of the oval court some sixty foot above the surface of the water and it end in a small gateway through which you step on to a projection like a balcony stud with stalactite from this point both the landscape and the rocky cauldron be visible and the latter be see to be the remainder of a stalactitic cavern the roof of which have fall in the beauty and peculiar character of the place have be feel even by the native who have call it sogoton -lrb- properly a bay in the sea -rrb- in the very hard limestone which be like marble i observe trace of bivalve and multitude of spine of the sea-urchin but no well-defined remains could be knock off the river could still be follow a short distance further upward and in its bed there be disjointed fragment of talcose and chloritic rock -lrb- fishing -rrb- a few small fish be obtain with much difficulty and amongst they be a new and interesting species viviparous -lrb- 183 -rrb- a ally species -lrb- h fluviatili bleeker -rrb- which i have two year previously find in a limestone cavern on nusa kambangan in java likewise contain live young one the net employ in fishing appear to be suit to the locality which be a shallow river full of transparent block it be a fine-meshed longish four-cornered net have its ample side fasten to two pole of bamboo which at the bottom be provide with a kind of wooden shoe which curve upward towards the stem when push forwards the fisherman take hold of the upper end of the pole push the net which be hold obliquely before he and the wooden shoe cause it to slide over the stone while another person drive the fish towards he -lrb- fossil bed -rrb- on the right bank below the cavern and twenty foot above the surface of the water there be bed of fossil pectunculus tape and placuna some of which from the fact of they barely adhering by the tip must be of very recent date i pass the night in a small hut which be quickly erect for I and on the follow day attempt to pass up the river as far as the limit of the crystalline rock but in vain in the afternoon we set out on we return to basey which we reach at night -lrb- recent elevation of coast -rrb- basey be situate on a bank of clay about fifty foot above the sea which towards the west elevate itself into a hill several hundred foot in height and with steep side at twenty-five to thirty foot above the sea i find the same recent bed of mussel as in the stalactitic cavern of sogoton from the statement of the parish priest and of other person a rapid elevation of the coast seem to be take place in this country thirty year ago ship could lie alongside the land in three fathom of water at the flood whereas the depth at the same place now be not much more than one fathom immediately opposite to basey lie two small island genamok and tapontonan which at the present time appear to be surround by a sandbank at the lowest ebb-tide twenty year ago nothing of the kind be to be see suppose these particulars to be correct we must next ascertain what proportion of these change of level be due to the flood and how much to volcanic elevation which if we may judge by the neighbor active solfatara at leyte must always be of considerable amount -lrb- crocodile -rrb- as the priest assure we there be crocodile in the river basey over thirty foot in length those in excess of twenty foot be numerous the oblige father promise I one of at least twenty-four foot whose skeleton i would gladly have secure and he send out some man who be so practice in the capture of these animal that they be dispatch to distant place for the purpose they contrivance for capture they which i however never personally witness consist of a light raft of bamboo with a stage on which several foot above the water a dog or a cat be bind alongside the animal be place a strong iron hook which be fasten to the swimming bamboo by means of fiber of abacá the crocodile when it have swallow the bait and the hook at the same time endeavor in vain to get away for the pliability of the raft prevent its be tear to piece and the peculiar elasticity of the bundle of fiber prevent its be bite through the raft serve likewise as a buoy for the capture animal accord to the statement of the hunter the large crocodile live far from human habitation generally select the close vegetation in a oozy swamp in which they belly drag heavily along leave trail behind they which betray they to the initiate after a week the priest mention that he party have send in three crocodile the largest of which however measure only eighteen foot but that he have not keep one for I as he hope to obtain one of thirty foot he expectation however be not fulfil -lrb- ignatius bean -rrb- in the environs of basey the ignatius bean grow in remarkable abundance as it also do in the south of samar and in some other of the bisayan island it be not meet with in luzon but it be very likely that i have introduce it there unwittingly its sphere of propagation be very limited and my attempt to transplant it to the botanical garden of buitenzorg be fruitless some large plant intend for that purpose which during my absence arrive for I at daraga be incorporate by one of my patron into he own garden and some which be collect by himself and bring to manila be afterwards lose every effort to get these seed -lrb- kernel -rrb- which be use over the whole of eastern asia as medicine to germinate miscarry they have be boil before transmission ostensibly for they preservation but most probably to secure the monopoly of they -lrb- strychnine -rrb- accord to flueckinger -lrb- 184 -rrb- the gourd-shaped berry of the climb shrub -lrb- ignatium amara l strychno ignatii berg ignatiana philippinica lour -rrb- contain twenty-four irregular egg-shaped seed of the size of a inch which however be not so poisonous as the ignatius bean which taste like crack-nut in these seed strychnine be find by pelletier and caventou in 1818 as it subsequently be in crack-nut the former contain twice as much of it as the latter viz one and a half per cent but as they be four time as dear it be only produce from the latter -lrb- cholera and snake-bite cure -rrb- in many household in the philippine the dangerous drug be to be find as a highly prize remedy under the name of pepita de catbalonga gemelli careri mention it and quote thirteen different use of it dr rosenthal -lrb- synopsis plantarum diaphor p 363 -rrb- say : -- in indium it have be employ as a remedy against cholera under the name of papecta papecta be probably a clerical error in k lall dey 's indigenous drug of indium it be call papeeta which be pronounced pepita in english and pepita be the spanish word for the kernel of a fruit it be also hold in high estimation as a antidote for the bite of serpent father blanco -lrb- flora of the philippine 61 -rrb- state that he have more than once prove its efficacy in this respect in he own person but he caution against its employment internally as it have be fatal in very many case it should not be take into the mouth for should the spittle be swallow and vomit not ensue death would be inevitable the parish priest of tabaco however almost always carry a pepita in he mouth from 1842 he begin occasionally to take a ignatius bean into he mouth as a protection against cholera and so gradually accustom himself to it when i meet he in 1860 he be quite well and ascribe he health and vigor expressly to that habit accord to he communication in case of cholera the decoction be successfully administer in small dose introduce into tea but it be most efficacious when mix with brandy it be apply as a liniment -lrb- superstition regard the bisayan bean -rrb- huc also -lrb- thibet i 252 -rrb- commend the express juice of the kouo-kouo -lrb- faba ign amar -rrb- both for internal and external use and remark that it play a great part in chinese medicine no apothecary 's shop be without it formerly the poisonous drug be consider a charm as it be still by many father camel -lrb- 185 -rrb- state that the catbalogan or bisayan-bean which the indian call igasur or mananaog -lrb- the victorious -rrb- be generally worn as a amulet round the neck be a preservative against poison contagion magic and philtre so potent indeed that the devil in propium persona could not harm the wearer especially efficacious be it against a poison communicate by breathing upon one for not only do it protect the wearer but it kill the individual who wish to poison he camel further mention a series of miracle which superstition ascribe to the ignatius bean -lrb- coconut -rrb- on the southern half of the eastern border on the shore from borongan by lauang as far as guiuan there be considerable plantation of coco which be most imperfectly apply to the production of oil from borongan and its visita twelve thousand pitcher of coconut oil be yearly export to manila and the nut consume by man and pig would suffice for at least eight thousand pitcher as a thousand nut yield eight pitcher and a half the vicinity of borongan alone yield annually six million nut for which assume the average produce at fifty nut one hundred-twenty thousand fullbearing palm be require the statement that they number in the above-mentioned district amount to several million must be a exaggeration -lrb- get coco oil -rrb- the oil be obtain in a very rude manner the kernel be rasp out of the woody shell of the nut on rough board and leave to rot and a few boat in a state of decay elevated on post in the open air serve as reservoir the oil drop through they crevice into pitcher place underneath and finally the board be subject to pressure this operation which require several month for its completion yield such a bad dark-brown and viscid product that the pitcher fetch only two dollar and a quarter in manila while a superior oil cost six dollar -lrb- 186 -rrb- -lrb- oil factory -rrb- recently a young spaniard have erect a factory in borongan for the better preparation of oil a winch turn by two carabao set a number of rasp in motion by means of toothed wheel and leather strap they be somewhat like a gimlet in form and consist of five iron plate with dentate edge which be place radiate on the end of a iron rod and close together form a blunt point towards the front the other end of the rod pass through the center of a disk which communicate the rotary motion to it and project beyond it the workman take a divide coconut in he two hand hold its interior arch which contain the oil-bearing nut with a firm pressure against the revolving rasp at the same time urge with he breast which be protect by a padded board against the project end of the rod the fine shred of the nut remain for twelve hour in flat pan in order that they may be partially decompose they be then lightly press in hand-press and the liquor which consist of one-third oil and two-third water be catch in tub from which at the end of six hour the oil float on the surface be skim off it be then heat in iron pan contain 100 liter until the whole of the water in it have evaporate which take from two to three hour in order that the oil may cool rapidly and not become dark in color two pailful of cold oil free from water be pour into it and the fire quickly remove to a distance the compress shred be once more expose to the atmosphere and then subject to a powerful pressure after these two operation have be twice repeat the rasped substance be suspend in sack between two strong vertical board and crush to the utmost by means of clamp screw and repeatedly shake up the refuse serve as food for pig the oil which run from the sack be free from water and be consequently very clear and be employ in the cooling of that which be obtain in the first instance -lrb- 187 -rrb- -lrb- limited output -rrb- the factory produce fifteen hundred tinaja of oil it be in operation only nine month in the year from December to February the transport of nut be prevent by the tempestuous sea there be no land communication the manufacturer be not successful in procure nut from the immediate vicinity in sufficient quantity to enable he to carry on he operation without interruption nor during the favorable season of the year could he lay up a store for the winter month although he pay the comparatively high price of three dollar per thousand -lrb- illogical business -rrb- while the native manufacture oil in the manner just describe they obtain from a thousand nut three and a half pot which at six real each fetch twenty-one real that be three real less than be offer they for the raw nut these datum which be obtain from the manufacturer be probably exaggerated but they be in the main well found and the traveller in the philippine often have the opportunity of observe similar anomaly for example in daet north camarine i buy six coconut for one cuarto at the rate of nine hundred and sixty for one dollar the common price there on my ask why no oil-factory have be erect i receive for answer that the nut be cheaper singly than in quantity in the first place the native sell only when he want money but he know that the manufacturer can not well afford to have he business suspend so careless of the result he make a temporary profit and never think of ensure for himself a permanent source of income -lrb- sugar vender -rrb- in the province of laguna where the native prepare coarse brown sugar from sugar-cane the woman carry it for league to the market or expose it for sale on the country road in small loaf -lrb- panoche -rrb- generally along with buyo every passenger chat with the seller weigh the loaf in the hand eat a bit and probably pass on without buy any in the evening the woman return to she home with she wares and the next day repeat the same process -lrb- disproportionate price -rrb- i have lose my special note but i remember that in two case at least the price of the sugar in these loaf be cheaper than by the picul moreover the government of the day anticipate the people in set the example by sell cigar cheaper singly than in quantity -lrb- uncertain trading -rrb- in europe a speculator generally can calculate beforehand with the greatest certainty the cost of production of any article but in the philippine it be not always so easy independently of the uncertainty of labor the regularity of the supply of raw material be disturb not only by laziness and caprice but also by jealousy and distrust the native as a rule do not willingly see european settle amongst they and engage successfully in local operation which they themselves do not understand how to execute and in like manner the creole be reserve with foreigner who generally be superior to they in capital skill and activity besides jealousy suspicion also play a great part and this influence the native as well against the mestizo as against the castilian enough take place to the present day to justify this feeling but formerly when the most thrifty subject could buy governorship and shamelessly fleece they province such outrageous abuse be say to have be permit until in process of time suspicion have become a kind of instinct amongst the filipino chapter xxi -lrb- leyte -rrb- the island of leyte between 9 ° 49 ' and 11 ° 34 ' n and 124 ° 7 ' and 125 ° 9 ' e gr be above twenty-five mile in length and almost twelve mile broad and contain one hundred seventy square mile as i have already remark it be divide from samar only by the small strait of san juanico the chief town tacloban or taclobang lie at the eastern entrance of this strait with a very good harbor and uninterrupted communication with manila and have consequently become the chief emporium of trade to leyte biliran and south and east samar -lrb- 188 -rrb- -lrb- oblige spanish official -rrb- the local governor likewise show I much oblige attention indeed almost without exception i have since my return retain the most agreeable remembrance of the spanish official and therefore if fitting opportunity occur i could treat of the impropriety of the administration with greater impartiality -lrb- locust -rrb- in the afternoon of the day after my arrival at tacloban on a sudden there come a sound like the rush of a furious torrent the air become dark and a large cloud of locust sweep over the place -lrb- 189 -rrb- i will not again recount that phenomenon which have be so often describe and be essentially the same in all quarter of the globe but will simply remark that the swarm which be more than five hundred foot in width and about fifty foot in depth its extremity be lose in the forest be not think a very considerable one it cause vigilance but not consternation old and young eagerly endeavor to catch as many of the delicate creature as they could with cloth net and flag in order as dampier relate to roast they in a earthen pan over fire until they leg and wing drop off and they head and back assume the color of boil crab after which process he say they have a pleasant taste in burma at the present day they be consider as delicacy at the royal court -lrb- 190 -rrb- -lrb- plan for they extermination -rrb- the locust be one of the greatest plague of the philippine and sometimes destroy the harvest of entire province the legislación ultramarina -lrb- iv 504 -rrb- contain a special edict respect the extirpation of these devastate pest as soon as they appear the population of the invade locality be to be draw out in the greatest possible number under the conduct of the authority in order to effect they destruction the most approved means for the attainment of this object be set forth in a official document refer to the adoption of extraordinary measure in case of public emergency and in this the locust be place midway between sea-pirate and conflagration of the various means that have be contrived against the destructive creature that at time appear in incredible number but have be as frequently ineffectual as otherwise only a few will be now mention on April 27 1824 the sociedad economica determine to import the bird the martin -lrb- graculum sp -rrb- which feed by instinct on locust in the autumn of the following year the first consignment arrive from china in 1829 a second and in 1852 again occur the item of $ 1311 for martin -lrb- tacloban to tanauan -rrb- on the follow day i proceed with the priest of dagamus -lrb- there be road in leyte -rrb- from tacloban southward to palo and tanauan two flourish place on the east coast hardly half a league from the latter place and close to the sea a cliff of crystal lime rock rise up out of the sandy plain which be level up to this point it be of a greyish-green quartzose chlorite schist from which the enterprising father have endeavor with a perseverance worthy of better success to procure lime by burn after a ample breakfast in the convent we proceed in the afternoon to dagamus and on the next day to burauen -lrb- 191 -rrb- -lrb- a please people -rrb- the country be still flat coco-grove and rice-field here and there interrupt the thick forest but the country be thinly inhabit and the people appear more cheerful handsomer and cleaner than those of samar south of burauen rise the mountain ridge of manacagan on the further slope of which be a large solfatara which yield sulphur for the powder manufactory in manila and for commerce a spanish sailor accompany I where the road pass through swamp we ride on carabao the pace of the animal be not unpleasant but the stretch across the broad back of the gigantic carabao of the philippine be very fatiguing a quarter of a hour beyond burauen we cross the daguitan which flow south-west to north-east and be a hundred foot broad its bed be full of large volcanic block and soon after a small river in a broad bed and some hundred pace farther one of a hundred and fifty foot in breadth the two latter be arm of the burauen they flow from west to east and enter the sea at dulag the second arm be originate only the precede year during a flood -lrb- the height of hospitality -rrb- we pass the night in a hut on the northern slope of the manacagan which the owner on see we approach have voluntarily quit and with he wife and child seek other lodgings the custom of the country require this when the accommodation do not suffice for both party and payment for the same be neither demand nor except very rarely tender -lrb- up the manacagan -rrb- about six o'clock on the follow morning we start and about half-past six climb by a pleasant path through the forest to the ridge of the manacagan which consist of trachytic hornblende and about seven o'clock we cross two small river flow north-west and then by a curve reach the coast at dulag from the ridge we catch sight towards the south of the great white heap of débris of the mountain danan glimmer through the tree about nine o'clock we come through the thickly-wooded crater of the kasibous and further south to some shed in which the sulphur be smelt -lrb- sulphur -rrb- the raw material obtain from the solfatara be buy in three class : firstly sulphur already melt to crust secondly sublimate which contain much condensed water in its interstice and thirdly in the clay which be divide into the more or less rich from which the greatest quantity be obtain coconut oil which be throw into flat iron pan hold six arroba be add to the sulphurous clay in the proportion of six quart to four arroba and it be melt and continually stir the clay which float on the surface now free from the sulphur be skim off fresh sulphurous clay be throw into the cauldron and so on in two or three hour six arroba of sulphur on a average may be obtain in this manner from twenty-four arroba of sulphurous clay and pour into wooden chest it be mould into block of about four arroba half the oil employ be recover by throw the clay which have be saturate with it into a frame form by two narrow bamboo hurdle place at a sharp angle the oil drop into a sloping gutter of bamboo which be place underneath and from that flow into a pot the price of the sulphur at manila vary between -lrb- price -rrb- $ 125 and $ 450 per picul i see the frame full of clay from which the oil exude but the operation itself i do not unfortunately then witness and i can not explain in what manner the oil be add from some experiment make on a small scale therefore under essentially different condition and never with the same material it appear that the oil accelerate the separation of the sulphur and retard the access of the air to the sulphur in these experiment the sulphur contain in the bottom of the crucible be always color black by the separation of charcoal from the oil and it be necessary to purify it by distillation beforehand of this however the smelter at leyte make no mention and they even have no apparatus for the purpose while they sulphur be of a pure yellow color -lrb- hot spring -rrb- some hundred of pace further south a hot spring -lrb- 50 ° r -rrb- -lrb- 192 -rrb- twelve foot broad flow from the east deposit silicious sinter at its edge -lrb- a solfatara -rrb- as we follow a ravine stretch from north to south with side one hundred to two hundred foot in height the vegetation gradually cease the rock being of a dazzling white or color by sublimate sulphur in numerous place thick cloud of vapor burst from the ground with a strong smell of sulphurated water at some thousand pace further the ravine bend round to the left -lrb- east -rrb- and expand itself to the bay and here numerous silicious spring break through the loose clay-earth which be permeate with sulphur this solfatara must formerly have be much more active than it be now the ravine which have be form by its destruction of the rock and be full of lofty heap of débris may be one thousand foot in breadth and quite five time as long at the east end there be a number of small boiling quagmire which on force a stick into the mat ground send forth water and steam in some deep spot further west gray white red and yellow clay have be deposit in small bed over each other give they the appearance of variegated marl -lrb- petrify water -rrb- to the south right opposite to the ridge which lead to burauen may be see a basin twenty-five foot broad in a cavern in the white decompose rock from which a petrifying water contain silicious acid flow abundantly the roof of the cavern be hang with stalactite which either be cover with solid sulphur or consist entirely of that substance -lrb- danan solfatara -rrb- on the upper slope of the danan mountain near to the summit so much sulphur be deposit by the vapor from the sulphurated water that it may be collect with coconut shell in some crevice which be protect against the cooling effect of the atmospheric air it melt together in thick brown crust the solfatara of danan be situate exactly south of that below at the end of the ravine of the kasiboi the clay earth from which the silicic acid have be wash out by the rain be carry into the valley where it form a plain the greater part of which be occupy by a small lake malaksan -lrb- sour -rrb- slightly impregnate with sulphuric acid its surface which by reason of the very flat bank be protect against the weather i find to be about five hundred pace long and one hundred broad from the elevation of the solfatara a rather large fresh-water lake surround by wooded mountain be see through a gap exactly south which be name jaruanan the night be pass in a ruin shed at the south-east of the lake malaksan and on the follow morning we climb the south side of the mountain ridge and skirt the solfatara of the danan arrive in a hour and a half at lake jaruanan -lrb- jaruanan lake -rrb- this lake as well as the malaksan inspire the native with superstitious fear on account of the suspicious neighborhood of the solfatara and therefore have not be profane by either mariner fisher or swimmer and be very full of fish for the purpose of measure its depth i have a raft of bamboo construct and when my companion see I float safely on the lake they all without exception spring into it and tumble about in the water with infinite delight and loud outcry as if they wish to indemnify themselves for they long abstinence so that the raft be not ready before three o'clock the sounding at the center of the basin which be at the southern edge steeper than on the north give thirteen braza or over twenty-one meter of depth the greatest length of the lake amount to nearly eight hundred vara -lrb- six hundred and sixty-eight meter -rrb- and the breadth to about half as much as we return in the evening by torchlight over the crest of the mountain to we night-quarter at the lake we pass by the very modest dwelling-place of a married pair three branch project outwards from the principal trunk of a tree and lop at equal point sustain a hut of bamboo and palm-leaf of eight foot square a hole in the floor form the entrance and it be divide into a chamber and ante-chamber and four bamboo pole support above and below two layer of bamboo one of which furnish a balcony and the other a shop in which betel be sell -lrb- to dulag -rrb- the day after my return to burauen a obliging spanish merchant drive I through the fertile plain of volcanic sand on which rice maize and sugar-cane be cultivate to dulag which lie directly to the west on the shore of the tranquil sea the distance -lrb- accord to coello three league -rrb- hardly amount to two league from this place point guiuan the south point of samar appear like a island separate from the mainland and further south -lrb- n 102 ° 4 ' to 103 ° 65 ° s -rrb- jomonjol be see the first island of the archipelago sight by magellan on April 16 1521 at dulag my former companion join we in order to accompany we on the journey to the bito lake the arrangement of transportation and of provision and still more the due consideration of all the proposition of three individual each of whose claim be entitle to equal respect occupy much time and require some address we at length sail in a large casco -lrb- barge -rrb- southwards along the coast to the mouth of the river -lrb- up mayo river -rrb- mayo which accord to the map and the information there give be say to come from the bito lake we proceed upward in a boat but be inform at the first hut that the lake could be reach only by make a long circuit through swampy forest when most of we party propose to return various reason besides the want of unanimity in the conduct of we adventure which have proceed thus far delay we arrival at abuyog until eleven o'clock at night in the first place on we way we have to cross a small branch of the mayo and after that the bito river the distance of the latter from abuyog -lrb- extravagantly set down on coello 's map -rrb- amount to fourteen hundred braza accord to the measurement of the gobernadorcillo which be probably correct -lrb- 193 -rrb- -lrb- a unpromising road -rrb- the follow day as it rain heavily be employ in make inquiry respect the road to the bito lake we receive very varied statement as to the distance but all agree in paint the road thither in a discouraging light a troublesome journey of at least ten hour appear to we to be what most probably await we -lrb- bito lake -rrb- on the morrow through a pleasant forest road we reach in a hour the bito river and proceed in boat which we meet there up the river between flat sandy bank cover with tall cane and reed in about ten minute some tree fall right across the stream compel we to make a circuit on land which in half a hour bring we again to the river above the obstacle here we construct raft of bamboo upon which immerse to the depth of half a foot the material be very loosely adjust we reach the lake in ten minute we find it cover with green conferva a double border of pistium and broad-leaved reed grass six to seven foot high enclose it all round on the south and west some low hillock rise up while from the middle it appear to be almost circular with a girdle of forest coello make the lake much too large -lrb- four instead of one square mile -rrb- and its distance from abuyog can be only a little over a league with the assistance of a cord of liana tie together and rod place in a line we find its breadth five hundred and eighty-five braza or nine hundred and seventy-seven meter -lrb- in the broadest part it might be a little over one thousand meter -rrb- and the length as compute from some imperfect observation one thousand and seven braza -lrb- sixteen hundred and eighty meter -rrb- consequently less than one square mile sounding show a gently inclined basin eight braza or over thirteen meter deep in the middle i would gladly have determine the proportion with more accuracy but want of time the inaccessibility of the edge of the bank and the miserable condition of we raft allow of only a few rough measurement -lrb- a forest home -rrb- not a trace of human habitation be observable on the shore but a quarter of a hour 's distance from the northern edge we find a comfortable hut surround by deep mud and prickly calamus the tenant of which however be live in plenty and with greater convenience than many dweller in the village we be very well receive and have fish in abundance as well as tomato and capsicum to season they with and dish of english earthenware out of which to eat they -lrb- snare swine -rrb- the abundance of wild swine have lead the settler to invent a peculiar contrivance by which they be apprise of they approach even when asleep and guide to they trail in the darkness a rope make of strip of banana tie together and upwards of a thousand foot in length be extend along the ground one end of which be attach to a coconut shell full of water which be suspend immediately over the sleeping-place of the hunter when a pig come in contact with the rope the water be overturn by the jerk upon the sleeper who seize the rope in he hand be thereby conduct to he prey the principal employment of we host appear to be fishing which be so productive that the roughest apparatus be sufficient there be not a single boat but only loosely-bound raft of bamboo on which the fisher sink as we ourselves do on we raft half a foot deep move about amongst the crocodile which i never behold in such number and of so large a size as in this lake some swam about on the surface with they back project out of the water it be strike to see the complete indifference with which even two little girl wade in the water in the face of the great monster fortunately the latter appear to be satisfy with they ample ration of fish four kind of fish be say to be find in the lake amongst they a eel but we get only one -lrb- 194 -rrb- -lrb- a secret still -rrb- early on the follow morning we native attendant be already intoxicate this lead to the discovery of another occupation of the settler which i do not hesitate to disclose now that the government monopoly have be abolish they secretly distil palm-brandy and carry on a considerable trade in it and this also explain to I why the horror of the road to the mayo river and to abuyog have be paint in such warm color -lrb- 195 -rrb- we return on we raft to the place where we have find they a distance of about fifteen hundred foot and onward through wild cane with large cluster of flower -lrb- saccharum sp -rrb- sixteen foot high east by north we get to we boat and then to the bar whence after a march of a hour and a half we reach abuyog from abuyog we return by water to dulag and by land to burauen where we arrive at night sooner than we hostler have expect for we catch they sleep in we bed -lrb- tobacco prohibition -rrb- not long ago much tobacco be cultivate in this country and be allow to be sell to the peasantry under certain condition but recently it be forbid to be sell except by the government who themselves determine its value at so very low a rate that the culture of tobacco have almost entirely cease as the tobacco company however have already erect store and appoint collector the know one rightly foresee that these step would be follow by compulsory labor even as it occur in other place the east coast of leyte be say to be rise while the west be be destroy by the sea and at ormog the sea be say to have advance about fifty ell -lrb- 196 -rrb- in six year chapter xxii -lrb- the bisayan -rrb- the bisayan -- at least the inhabitant of the island of samar and leyte -lrb- i have not become closely acquaint with any other -rrb- -- belong to one race -lrb- 197 -rrb- they be physically and intellectually in character dress manners and custom so similar that my note which be originally make at different point of the two island have after removal of the numerous repetition fuse into one which afford a more complete picture and afford at the same time opportunity for the small difference where they do occur to stand out more conspicuously -lrb- mountaineer -rrb- there be no negrito either in samar or leyte but cimarronese who pay no tribute and who do not live in village but independently in the forest unfortunately i have have no personal intercourse with they and what i have learn respect they from the christian inhabitant of samar be too uncertain to be repeat but it do seem certain that all these cimarronese or they ancestor have trade with the spaniard and that they religion have appropriate many catholic form thus when plant rice and accord to ancient practice set apart some of the seed to be offer in the four corner of the field as sacrifice they be accustom to repeat some mutilate catholic prayer which they appear to consider as efficacious as they old heathenish one some have they child baptize as well as it cost nothing but save in these respects they perform no other christian or civil obligation they be very peaceable neither make war with one another nor have poison arrow instance of cimarronese who go over to christianity and village life together with tribute and servitude be very rare and the number of the civilized who return to the forest in order to become cimarronese be on the other hand very inconsiderable indeed --

child and when they number become too great drive they out with blow some conceal themselves in the chamber and these become the dato other in the kitchen and these become the slave the rest go down the stair and become the people chapter xxiii -lrb- port of entry -rrb- in 1830 seven new port be open as a experiment but owe to great fraud in the charge be soon afterwards close again in 1831 a custom-house be establish at zamboanga on the south-west point of mindanao and in 1855 sual in the gulf of lingayen one of the safest harbor on the west coast of luzon and iloilo in panay be throw open and in 1863 cebu on the island of the same name for the direct communication with foreign country -lrb- old zamboanga fort -rrb- before 1635 the spaniard have establish a fort at zamboanga which although it certainly could not wholly prevent the piratical excursion against the colony yet considerably diminish they -lrb- 209 -rrb- until 1848 from eight hundred to fifteen hundred individual be state to have be carry off yearly by the moro -lrb- 210 -rrb- the establishment of this custom-house have therefore be base upon political rather than commercial motive it be find desirable to open a easily accessible place to the piratical state of the sulu sea for the disposal of they product -lrb- export -rrb- trade up to the present date be but of very inconsiderable amount the export consist chiefly of a little coffee -lrb- in 1871 nearly six thousand picul -rrb- which from bad management be worth thirty per cent less than manila coffee and of the collect product of the forest and of the water such as wax bird ' - nest tortoise-shell pearl mother-of-pearl and edible holothurium this trade as well as that with sulu be entirely in the hand of the chinese who alone possess the patience adaptiveness and adroitness which be require for the purpose -lrb- sual 's foreign trade -rrb- sual be specially important for its export of rice and its foreign trade be therefore affect by the result of the harvest in saigon burma and china in 1868 when the harvest in those country turn out good sual carry on only a coast trade -lrb- cebu -rrb- cebu -lrb- with a population of 34000 -rrb- be the chief town of the island of the same name the seat of government and of the bishop of the bisaya and within forty-eight hour from manila by steamer it be as favorably situate with regard to the eatern portion of the bisayan group as iloilo be for the western and be acquire increase importance as the emporium for its product sugar and tobacco be obtain from bohol rice from panay abacá from leyte and mindanao and coffee wax spanish cane and mother-of-pearl from misami -lrb- mindanao -rrb- its distance from samar be twenty-six from leyte two and a half from bohol four and from negro eighteen mile -lrb- cebu island -rrb- the island of cebu extend over seventy-five square mile a lofty mountain range traverse it from north to south divide the east from the west side and its population be estimate at 340000 -- 4533 to the square mile the inhabitant be peaceable and docile theft occur very seldom and robbery never they occupation be agriculture fishing and weave for home consumption cebu produce sugar tobacco maize rice etc and in the mountain potato but the rice produce do not suffice for they requirement there be only a little level land and the deficiency be import from panay -lrb- land tenure -rrb- the island possess considerable bed of coal the full yield of which may now be look for as the duty on export be abandon by a decree of the 5th of may 1869 -lrb- 211 -rrb- while in luzon and panay the land be for the most part the property of the peasantry in cebu it mostly belong to the mestizo and be let out by they in very small allotment upon lease the owner of the soil know how to keep the peasant in a state of dependence by usurious loan and one of the result of this abuse be that agriculture in this island stand lower than in almost any other part of the archipelago -lrb- 212 -rrb- -lrb- customhouse datum -rrb- the entire value of the export in 1868 amount to $ 1181050 of which sugar to the value of $ 481127 and abacá to the value of $ 378256 go to england abacá amounting to $ 112000 to america and tobacco to $ 118260 to spain the import of foreign goods mostly by the chinese come through manila where they purchase from the foreign import house the value of these import amount in 1868 to $ 182522 of which $ 150000 be for english cotton stuff the entire import of the island be estimate at $ 1243582 and the export at $ 226898 among the importation be twenty chest of image a sign of the deeply-rooted worship of the virgin formerly the product for exportation be buy up by the foreign merchant mostly chinese mestizo but now they be buy direct from the producer who thus obtain better price in consequence of the abolition of the high brokerage to this and to the energy of the foreign merchant under favorable circumstance be the gradual improvement of agriculture principally to be ascribe -lrb- iloilo -rrb- iloilo be the most important of the newly open port be the central point of the bisayan group and situate in one of the most thickly populated and industrious province nichola loney -lrb- 213 -rrb- estimate the export of goods weave from the fiber of the piña from iloilo and the neighboring province at about one million dollar annually the harbor be excellent be completely protect by a island which lie immediately before it and at high tide there be about twelve foot of water close in shore for vessel to lie in on account of the bar however ship of a deeper draught than this be oblige to complete they load outside previous to the opening of the new harbor all the province be compel as well to bring they product intend for exportation to manila as to receive from the same place they foreign import the cost of which therefore be greatly increase through the extra expense incur by the double voyage reload brokerage and wharfage charge accord to a write account by n loney it be show how profitable even after a few year the opening of iloilo have be to the province immediately adjoining -- the island of panay and negro -lrb- sugar -rrb- the higher price which can be obtain for directly export sugar combine with the facility and security of the trade as contrast with the late monopoly enjoy by manila have occasion a great extension of the cultivation of that article not only in iloilo but also in antique and negro many new plantation have arise and the old one have be enlarged as much as possible and not less important have be the progress in the manufacture in 1857 there be not one iron mill to be find on the island so that in work with the wooden mill about thirty per cent of the sap remain in the cane even after it have thrice pass through the old wooden press which be work by steam or carabao have now be supplant by new one and these the native planter have no difficulty in obtain as they can get they on credit from the warehouse of the english importer instead of the old chinese cast-iron pan which be in use far superior article have be import from europe and many large factory work by steam-power and with all modern improvement have be establish in agriculture likewise creditable progress be noticeable improve plough cart and farm implement generally be to be have in plenty these change naturally show how important it be to establish at different point extend over two hundred mile of the archipelago commercial center where it be desirable that foreigner should settle without these latter and the facility afford to credit which thereby ensue the sudden rise and prosperity of iloilo would not have be possible inasmuch as the mercantile house in that capital would have be debar from trading with unknown planter in distant province otherwise than for ready money a large number of half-caste too who before trade in manufacture goods purchase in manila be enable after this to send they goods direct to the province to the foreign firm settle there and as ultimately neither these latter nor the chinese retail dealer could successfully compete with they the result have be that as much to they own profit as to that of the country they have betake themselves to the cultivation of sugar in this manner important plantation have be establish in negro which be manage by native of iloilo : but there be a scarcity of laborer on the island -lrb- land dispute -rrb- foreigner now can legally acquire property and possess a marketable title in which respect the law until a very recent period be of a extremely uncertain nature land be to be obtain by purchase or when not already take up by denuncium -lrb- ie priority of claim -rrb- in such case the would-be possessor of the land must enter into a undertaking in the nearest of the native court to cultivate and keep the say land in a fit and serviceable condition should no other claim be put in notice be thereupon give of the grant and the magistrate or alcalde conclude the compact without other cost than the usual stamp duty -lrb- lack of capital for large plantation -rrb- many mestizo and native not have the necessary capital to carry on a large plantation successfully sell the field which they have already partially cultivate to european capitalist who be thus relieve of all the preliminary tedious work evidently the colonial government be now sincerely dispose to favor the lay out of large plantation -lrb- lack of road -rrb- the want of good road be particularly feel : but with the increase of agriculture this defect will naturally be remedy and moreover most of the sugar factory be situate on river which be unnavigable even by flat freight boat the value of land in many part of the country have double within the last ten year -lrb- 214 -rrb- -lrb- sugar price -rrb- up to 1854 the picul of sugar be worth in iloilo from $ 105 to $ 125 and seldom over $ 200 in manila in 1866 $ 325 and in 1868 $ 475 to $ 500 in iloilo the business in iloilo therefore show a increase of $ 175 per picul -lrb- 215 -rrb- -lrb- negro -rrb- at the end of 1856 there be as many as twenty european establish on the island of negro as sugar planter besides a number of mestizo some of they be work with steam machinery and vacuum pan the general rate of pay be from $ 205 to $ 300 per month on some plantation the principle of acsa ie part share be in operation the owner let out a piece of ground provide draught cattle and all necessary plough implement to a native who work it and supply the mill with the cut cane receive as payment a share generally a third of the product in negro the violet cane be cultivate and in manila the white -lrb- otaheitus -rrb- the land do not require manure on new ground or what we may term virgin soil the cane often grow to a height of thirteen foot a vast improvement be to be observe in the mode of dress of the people piña and silk stuff be beom quite common advance in luxury be always a favorable sign accord to the increase of requirement industry flourish in proportion -lrb- the future sugar market -rrb- as i have already mention californium japan china and australium appear design by nature to be the principal consumer of the product of the philippine island certainly at present england be the best customer but nearly half the account be for sugar in consequence of they own custom duty sometimes it happen that not more than one-fourth of the sugar crop be sufficiently refine to compete in the australian and californian market with the sort from bengal java and the mauritius the remain three-fourth if particularly white must perforce undertake the long voyage to england despite the high freight and certain loss on the voyage of from ten to twelve per cent through the leakage of the molasses the inferior quality of the philippine sugar be at once perceive by the english refiner and be only tax at 8 per cwt while purer sort pay 10s to 12s -lrb- 216 -rrb- -lrb- a valuable by-product -rrb- in this manner the english custom favor the inferior quality of manufactured sugar the colonial government do not allow those engage in the manufacture of sugar to distil rum from the molasses until the year 1862 they have therefore little inducement to extract at a certain expense a substance the value on which they be not permit to realize but under ordinary circumstance the distillation of the rum not only cover the cost of refining but give in addition a fair margin of profit chapter xxiv -lrb- manila hemp -rrb- one of the most interesting production of the island be manila hemp the french who however hardly use it call it silk-plant because of its silky appearance the native call the fiber bandalum and in commerce -lrb- generally speak -rrb- abacá just as the plant from which it be obtain -lrb- abacá -rrb- the latter be a wild species of banana grow in the philippine island know also as arbol de cañamo -lrb- hemp-tree -rrb- musa textili lin it do not differ in appearance to any great extent from the edible banana -lrb- musa paradisiaca -rrb- one of the most important plant of the torrid zone and familiar to we as be one of we most beautiful hot-house favorite -lrb- undetermined plant relation -rrb- whether this and the musa -lrb- m troglodytarum m sylvestri and other -rrb- frequently know too as m textili be of the same species have not yet be determine the species musacea be herbaceous plant only the outer stem consist of crescent-shaped petiole cross one another alternately and encircle the thin main stem these petiole contain a quantity of bast fiber which be use as string but otherwise be of no commercial value the serviceable hemp fiber have up to the present time be exclusively obtain from the southern portion of the philippine -lrb- abacá district -rrb- the southern camarine and albay be favorably adapt for the cultivation of this plant as be also the island of samar and leyte and the adjacent island and cebu likewise although a portion of the so-called cebu hemp come from mindanao in negro the bast-banana thrive only in the south not in the north and iloilo which produce most of the hemp cloth -lrb- guinara -rrb- be oblige to import the raw material from the eastern district as it do not flourish in the island of panay in capiz it be true some abacá may be notice grow but it be of trifling value hitherto all attempt strenuous though the effort be to acclimatize the growth of hemp in the western and northern province have fail the plant rarely grow as high as two foot and the trouble and expense be simply unremunerative this failure may be account for by the extreme dryness prevail during many month of the year whereas in the eastern province plentiful shower fall the whole year round -lrb- peculiar to the philippine -rrb- the great profit which the manila hemp have yield in the few year since its production however have give encouragement to still further experiment so that indeed it will shortly be show whether the cultivation of abacá be to be confine to its present limited area while the edible species of banana have spread itself over the whole surface of the earth within the tropics on the volcanic mountain of western java a species of the musacea grow in great luxuriance the government have not however make any real effort to cultivate it and what have be do in that respect have be effect up to the present date by private enterprise various writer have state that abacá be to be obtain in the north of the celebe bickmore however say positively that the inhabitant have make great effort in attempt its successful cultivation have abandon it again in favor of the cultivation of coffee which be find to be far more profitable -lrb- 217 -rrb- accord to previous statement guadaloupe appear to be able to produce abacá -lrb- fiber of the m textili -rrb- -lrb- 218 -rrb- and pondicherry and guadaloupe have produce fabric weave from abacá and french guiana stuff from the fiber of the edible banana -lrb- 219 -rrb- all these however be only experiment -lrb- superiority of fiber -rrb- royle affirm that the manila hemp -lrb- abacá fiber -rrb- excel the russian in firmness lightness and strength in tension as well as in cheapness and have only the one disadvantage that rope make from it become stiff in wet weather the reason however be find in the manner in which it be spin and may be avoid by proper preparation -lrb- 220 -rrb- through the better preparation of the raw material in manila by means of adequate machinery these difficulty have be overcome but abacá no longer have the advantage of superior cheapness as the demand have increase much faster than the supply during the year 1859 it be worth from # 22 to # 25 per ton in 1868 # 45 per ton while russian hemp fetch # 31 per ton thus in nine year it rise to double its value -lrb- banana variety -rrb- in albay there be about twelve variety of the best banana cultivate which be particularly favor by the quality of the soil the cultivation be extremely simple and entirely independent of the season the plant thrive best on the slope of the volcanic mountain -lrb- in which albay and camarine abound -rrb- in open space of the wood protect by the tree which cast they shadow to a extent of about sixty foot in expose level ground they do not thrive so well and in marshy land not at all -lrb- cultivation -rrb- in the lay out of a new plantation the young shoot be generally make use of which sprout so abundantly from the root that each individual one soon become a perfect plant in favorable ground the custom be to allow a distance of about ten foot between each plant in poor ground six foot the only care necessary be the extermination of the weed and clear away the undergrowth during the first season later on the plant grow so luxuriantly and strongly that they entirely prevent the growth of anything else in they vicinity the protection afford by the shade of the tree at this period be no longer require the young bud find sufficient protection against the sun 's ray under cover of the fan-like leave only in exceptional case contrary to the usual practice be the plant raise from seed the fruit when ready be cut off and dry though care must be take that it be not over ripe otherwise the kernel will not germinate these latter be about the size of peppercorn and the extraction of they in the edible species almost always bring about decay two day before sowing the kernel be take out of the fruit and steep overnight in water on the follow day they be dry in a shady place and on the third day they be sow in hole a inch deep in fresh unbroken and well-shaded forest ground allow six inch distance between each plant and row after a year the seedling which be then about two foot high be plant out and tend in the same way as the sucker -lrb- difference with abacá -rrb- while many of the edible banana bear fruit after one year and a few variety even after six month the abacá plant require on a average three year to produce its fiber in a proper condition when raise from sucker four year and raise from year-old seedling even under the most favorable condition two year -lrb- cutting -rrb- on the first crop only one stalk be cut from each bush but later on the new branch grow so quickly that they can be cut every two month -lrb- 221 -rrb- after a few year the plant become so strong and dense that it be scarcely possible to push through they bast be in its best condition at the time of blossom but when the price of the fiber happen to stand high in the market this particular time be not always wait for -lrb- prejudice against cut after blossom -rrb- plant which have blossom cease to be profitable in any way by reason of the fiber become too weak -- a matter of too great nicety for the unpractical consumer on the other side of the atlantic to decide upon and one in which despite inquiry and careful inspection they might be deceive there really be no perceptible reason why the fiber should become weaker through fructification which simply consist in the fact of the contents of the vascular cell change into soluble matter and gradually ooze away the consequence of which be that the cell of the fiber be not replenish these on the contrary acquire additional strength with the age of the plant because the empty cell cling so firmly together by means of a certain resinous deposit that it be impossible to obtain they unbroken without a great deal of trouble the idea may have erroneously arise from the circumstance that previously to dry as with hemp the old plant be pick out and allow to be throw away though not without considerably increase the rate of pay which already consume the greater part of the general expense -lrb- 222 -rrb- -lrb- extract the fiber -rrb- in order to obtain the bast the stalk above ground be closely prune and free from leaf and other encumbrance each leaf be then singly divide into strip -- a cross incision be make through the membrane on the inner or concave side and connect by means of the pulpy part -lrb- the parenchym -rrb- cling together in this manner as much as possible of the clear outer skin only remain behind another method be to strip the bast from the undivided stem to effect this the operator make a oblique incision in the skin of the under part of the stalk draw the knife gradually to the tip and strip off the whole length as broad a piece as possible and the operation be repeat as many time as practicable this method of handling be more productive than the one previously describe but on the other hand it take considerably more time and for that reason be not often practice the strip of bast be then draw under a knife the blade of which be three inch broad by six long fasten at one end to the extremity of a flexible stick so that it be suspend perpendicularly over a well-smoothed block and at the other end to a handle connect by means of a cord to a treadle which can be press firmly down as occasion require the workman draw the bast without any regard to quality between the knife and block commence in the middle and then from side to side the knife must be free from notch or all indentation accord to the direction of father blanco -lrb- 223 -rrb- -lrb- laborer ' work and wages -rrb- three hired-men usually get twenty-five pound per day one worker cut up the stalk strip off the leaf and attend to the supply the second frequently a boy spread out the strip and the third draw they under the knife a single plant have be know to yield as much as two pound of fiber but the most favorable average rarely afford more than one pound and plant grow in indifferent soil scarcely a sixth of that quantity the plantation be work either by the owner or by day-laborer who when the market price be very low take half share of the crop harvest by they in these case a industrious workman may obtain as much as one picul in a week during my stay exceptionally low price rule -- sixteen and one-half real per picul undelivered the workman could therefore in six day earn half the amount viz eight and a quarter real at a rate of one and three-eighths real per day the day 's pay at that time be half a real and board a quarter of a real make together three-quarter of a real -lrb- profit -rrb- by daily pay half share the workman therefore earn daily 075 r or 1375 r wages amount to per picul 12 6 r or 8 25 r profit of the planter after deduction of the wages 3 9 r or 8 25 r -lrb- lupi and bandalum -rrb- the edge of the petiole which contain much finer fiber than the middle part be separately divide into strip a inch wide and with strong pressure be draw several time under the knife this substance which be call lupi be in high request be employ in the native weave while be chiefly use for ship ' rigging -lrb- 224 -rrb- -lrb- grade of lupi -rrb- lupi accord to the fineness of the fiber be sort into four class -- first binani second totogna third sogotan and fourth cadaclan a bundle of these be then take up in the left hand and while with the right the first three sort be insert between the finger the fourth be hold between the thumb and forefinger this last description be no longer use in fine weave and be therefore sell with bandalum after the fine sort have be pound in a rice-mortar in order to render the fiber soft and pliable they be severally knot into one another and convert into web -lrb- lupi fabric -rrb- generally the first sort be work as woof with the second as warp and the third as warp with the second as woof the fabric so weave be nearly as fine as piña fabric -lrb- nipis de piña -rrb- and almost equal the best quality of cambric and notwithstanding the many little nodule occasion by the tangling of the fiber which may be discern on close inspection be clearer and stouter and possess a warmer yellowish tint -lrb- 225 -rrb- as to these last three quality -- purity flexibility and color -- they stand in relation to cambric somewhat as cardboard to tissue-paper -lrb- weave -rrb- weave such fabric on very simple loom be exceedingly troublesome as the fiber which be not spin but twist very frequently break the finest stuff require so great a amount of dexterity patience and time in they preparation and for that reason be so expensive that they would find no purchaser in europe where there be the competition of cheap machine-made goods they fine warm yellowish color also be object to by the european woman who be accustom to linen and calico strongly blue in the wash in the country however high price be pay for they by the rich mestizo who understand the real goodness of they quality -lrb- bandalum fabric -rrb- the fiber of the inner petiole which be softer but not so strong as the outer be call tupus and sell with bandalum or mix with tapi and use in the native weave bandalum also serve for weave purpose and in that portion of the archipelago where the native abacá plantation be the entire dress of both sex be make of coarse guinara still coarser and stronger fabric be prepare for the european market such as crinoline and stiff muslin use by dressmaker -lrb- a pre-spanish product -rrb- before the arrival of the spaniard the native wear stuff from abacá which become a important article of export only some few decade since this be in great measure due to the enterprising spirit of two american firm and would not have be attain without great perseverance and liberal pecuniary assistance -lrb- unbusinesslike early method -rrb- the plant flourish without any care or attention the only trouble be to collect the fiber and the bounteousness of nature have provide they against want the native shirk even this trouble when the market price be not very entice in general low price be scarcely to be reckon on because of the utter indifference of the laborer over whom the trader do not possess enough influence to keep they at work advance to they be make both in goods and money which the creditor must repay either by produce from he own plantation or by give a equivalent in labor -lrb- 226 -rrb- as long as the produce stand high in price everything go on pretty smoothly although even then through the dishonesty of the worker and the laziness extravagance and mercantile incapacity of the middleman considerable loss frequently ensue if however price experience any considerable fall then the laborer seek in any and every way to get out of they uncomfortable position whilst the percentage of profit secure to the middleman be barely sufficient to cover the interest on he outlay nevertheless they must still continue the supplies inasmuch as they possess no other means of secure payment of they debt in the future the laborer in they turn bring bitter complaint against the agent to the effect that they be force to severe labor unprofitable to themselves through they acceptance of advance make to they at most exorbitant rate and the agent -lrb- generally mestizo or creole -rrb- blame the crafty greedy extortionate foreigner who shamelessly tempt the lord of the soil with false promise and bring about they utter ruin -lrb- change to a safer basis -rrb- as a general rule the crafty foreigner experience a considerable diminution of he capital it be just so that one of the most important firm suffer the loss of a very large sum at length however the american who have capital invest in this trade succeed in put a end to the custom of advance which hitherto have prevail erect store and press on they own account and buy through they agent direct from the grower all earlier effort tend in this direction have be effectually thwart by the spaniard and creole who consider the profit derive from the country and especially the inland retail trade to be they own by prescriptive right they be particularly jealous of the foreign intruder who enrich themselves at they expense consequently they place every obstacle in they way if it depend upon the will of these people all foreigner would be eject from the country -- the chinese alone as workman -lrb- coolie -rrb- be allow to remain -lrb- 227 -rrb- -lrb- anti-chinese feeling -rrb- the same feeling be exhibit by the native towards the chinese whom they hate for be industrious and trustworthy worker all attempt to carry out great undertaking by means of chinese labor be frustrate by the native workman intimidate they and drive they away either by open violence or by secret persecution and the colonial authority be reproach for not afford suitable protection against these and similar outrage that as a rule great undertaking do not succeed in the philippine or at least do not yield a profit commensurate with the outlay and trouble be a fact beyond dispute and be solely to be ascribe to many of the circumstance relate above -lrb- good work for good pay -rrb- there be those however who explain these mishap in other way and insist upon the fact that the native work well enough when they be punctually and sufficiently pay the government at any rate appear gradually to have come to the conclusion that the resource of the country can not be properly open up without the assistance of the capital and enterprise of the -lrb- tardy justice to foreigner -rrb- foreigner and therefore of late year it have not in any way interfere with they establishment in 1869 they right of establishment be tardily concede to they by law -lrb- abacá production and prospects -rrb- at this period the prospects of the abacá cultivation seem very promising and since the close of the american war which have the effect of cause a considerable fall in the value of this article in america the price have be steadily increase it be state -lrb- on authority -rrb- that in 1840 136034 picul of abacá to the value of $ 397995 be export the value per picul be reckon at about $ 209 the rate gradually rise and stand between four and five dollar -- and during the civil war reach the enormous sum of nine dollar per picul -- the export of russian hemp prevent however a further rise this state of affair occasion the lay out of many new plantation the produce of which when it come on the market after three year be value at $ 350 per picul in consequence of the price have return to they normal condition and even then it pay to take up a exist plantation but not to lay out a new one this rate continue until 1860 since which time it have gradually rise -lrb- only during the american civil war be there any stoppage -rrb- and it now stand once more as high as during the civil war and there be no apparent prospect of a fall so long as the philippine have no competitor in the trade in 1865 the picul in manila never cost less than $ 7 which two year previously be the maximum value and it rise gradually until $ 950 be ask for ordinary quality the production in many province have reach the extreme limit and a further increase in the former at least be impossible as the work of cultivation occupy the whole of the male population -- a evidence surely that a suitable recompense will overcome any natural laziness of the native -lrb- 228 -rrb- a examination of the follow table will confirm the accuracy of these view : -- -lrb- export of manila hemp -rrb- export of abacá -lrb- in picul -rrb- to 1861 1864 1866 1868 1870 1871 great britain 198954 226258 96000 125540 131180 143498 north america atlantic port 158610 249106 280000 294728 327728 285112 californium 6600 9426 -- 14200

commercial report prussian consular report belgian consular report english consular report market report th & co -lrb- large local consumption -rrb- the consumption in the country be not contain in the above schedule and be difficult to ascertain but it must certainly be very considerable as the native throughout entire province be clothe in guinara the weave of which for the family requirement generally be do at home -lrb- sisal-hemp -rrb- sisal also sisal-hemp or as it be sometimes know mexican grass have for some year past be use in the trade in increase quantity as a substitute for abacá which it somewhat resemble in appearance though want that fine gloss which the latter possess it be somewhat weaker and cost from # 5 to # 10 less per ton it be only use for ship ' rig the refuse from it have be find a extremely useful adjunct to the material ordinarily use in the manufacture of paper the technologist for July 1865 call attention to the origin of this substitute in a detailed essay differ essentially from the representation contain in the u s agricultural report publish at washington in 1870 and the grow importance of the article and the ignorance prevail abroad as to its extraction may render a short account of it acceptable the description show the superior fineness of the abacá fiber but not its greater strength -lrb- 229 -rrb- -lrb- variety of sisal -rrb- sisal-hemp which be name after the export harbor of sisal -lrb- in the north-western part of the peninsula -rrb- be by far the most important product of yucatan and this rocky sun-burnt country seem peculiarly adapt to the growth of the fiber in yucatan the fiber be know as jenequem as indeed the plant be obtain from it of the latter there be seven sort or variety for purpose of cultivation only two the first and seventh be also to be find in a wild state first chelem apparently identical with agave angustifolium this rank first second yaxcus -lrb- pronounced yachkus from yax green and tri agave -rrb- the second in order this be use only for fine weave third saccus -lrb- pronounced sakkus sack white -rrb- the most important and productive supply almost exclusively the fiber for exportation each plant yield annually twenty-five leave weigh twenty-five pound from which be obtain one pound of clear fiber fourth chucumcus similar to no 3 but coarser fifth babcus the fiber very fair but the leaf rather small therefore not very productive sixth citamcus -lrb- pronounced kitamkus kitam hog -rrb- neither good nor productive seventh cajun or cajum probably fourcroya cubensis leave small from four to five inch long -lrb- machine-spinning -rrb- the cultivation of sisal have only in recent time be prosecute vigorously and the extraction of the fiber from the leaf and the subsequent spin for ship ' rigging be already do by steam-machinery this occupation be especially practice by the maya indian a memorial of the toltec who bring it with they upon they emigration from mexico where it be in vogue long before the arrival of the spaniard -lrb- profit -rrb- the sisal cultivation yield a annual profit of 95 per cent a mecate equal to five hundred seventy-six square yard -lrb- vara -rrb- contain sixty-four plant give sixty-four pound of clear fiber of the value of $ 384 which after deduct $ 171 the cost of obtain it leave $ 213 remain the harvesting commence from four to five year after the first lay out of the plantation and continue annually for about fifty or sixty year -lrb- banana substitute unsatisfactory -rrb- in tropical country there be scarcely a hut to be see without banana tree surround it and the idea present itself to many to utilize the fiber of these plant at that time entirely neglect which might be do by the mere labor of obtain it besides which the little labor require for they proper cultivation be quickly and amply repay by they abundant fruitfulness -lrb- 230 -rrb- this idea however under the exist circumstance would certainly not be advantageous in the philippine as it do not pay to obtain bast from the genuine abacá plant as soon as it have bear fruit the fiber of the edible banana might very well be use as material for paper-making though obtain it would cost more than the genuine bandalum -lrb- fiber-extracting machinery -rrb- in the report of the council of the society of art london may 11 1860 attention be call to a machine invent by f burke of montserrat for obtain fiber from banana and other endogenous plant while all the earlier machine work the fiber parallelwise this one operate obliquely on it the consequence of which be that it be turn out particularly clear with this machine from seven to nine per cent of fibrous substance may be obtain from the banana the tropical fiber company have send these machine to demerara also to java and other place with the design of spin the fiber of the edible banana and also to utilize some portion of the plant as material in the manufacture of paper proof have already be bring forward of fiber obtain in this manner in java the value of which to the spinner have be reckon at from # 20 to # 25 it do not appear however that these promising experiment have lead to any important result at least the consular report which have come to hand contain no information on the subject in the obtain of bandalum in the philippine this machine have not yet be use nor have it even be see though the english consul in he latest report complain that all the hitherto ingeniously construct machine have prove virtually useless the bast of the edible banana continue still to be use in the philippine notwithstanding that the plant instead of be grow as in many part of america in large well-tended garden be here scatter around the hut but the forwarding of the raw material the local transport and the high freightage will always render this material too expensive for the european market -lrb- consider always its very ordinary quality -rrb- -- # 10 per ton at the very least while sparto grass -lrb- lygaeum spartum loeffl -rrb- -lrb- paper-making material -rrb- which be import some few year since in considerable quantity for the purpose of paper-making cost in london only # 5 per ton -lrb- 231 -rrb- the jute -lrb- corchurus casulari -rrb- coffee-sack supply another cheap paper material these serve in the fabrication of strong brown packing paper as the fiber will not stand bleaching accord to p symmond the united state in recent year have largely use bamboo the rind of the adansonium digita also yield a extremely good material in particular paper make entirely from new zealand flax deserve consideration be by virtue of its superior toughness eminently suit for bill paper -lrb- preferability of discard cloth -rrb- it must not be overlook that in the manufacture of paper worn linen and cotton rag be the very best material that can be employ and make the best paper moreover they be generally to be have for the trouble of collect they after they have once cover the cost of they production in the form of clothing material when through be fray by repeat washing they undergo a preparation which particularly adapt they to the purpose of paper-making -lrb- increase use of wood and straw -rrb- the more paper-making progress the more be ligneous fiber bring forward particularly wood and straw which produce really good paste all the raw material be import from a distance that england take so much sparto be easily explain by the fact that she have very little straw of she own for most of the grain consume by she be receive from abroad in a granulated condition chapter xxv -lrb- tobacco revenue -rrb- of all the production of the country tobacco be the most important so far -lrb- at least -rrb- as concern the government which have the cultivation of this plant its manipulation and sale the subject of a extensive and strictly guard monopoly and derive a very considerable portion of the public revenue therefrom -lrb- 232 -rrb- as to the objection raise against this revenue on the score of its be oppose to justice and morality many other source of revenue in the colonial budget might be condemn -lrb- such as the poll-tax gaming and opium license the brandy trade and the sale of indulgence -rrb- yet none be so invidious and pernicious as the tobacco monopoly -lrb- injustice of the monopoly -rrb- often in the course of this narrative of my travels i have have occasion to commend the clemency of the spanish government in glare contrast therewith however stand the management of the tobacco regulation they appropriate the field of the peasantry without the slightest indemnification -- field which have be bring under cultivation for they necessary means of sustenance force they under penalty of bodily punishment to raise on the confiscate property a article which require a immense amount of trouble and attention and which yield a very uncertain crop and they then value the harvest leaf arbitrarily and without any appeal and in the most favorable case pay for they at a nominal price fix by themselves to be pay at all indeed appear to have be a favor for it have not be do in full now for several year in succession spain regularly remain indebted to the unlucky peasant in the amount of the miserable pittance allow from one year 's end to another the government order the official to exact a higher return from the impoverished population of the tobacco district and even reward informer who after point out field already own but which be consider suitable to the cultivation of tobacco be install into possession of the proclaimed land in the place of the original owner for proof of these accusation one need only peruse a few paragraph contain in the follow stringent regulation entitle general instruction -lrb- 233 -rrb- and further a few extract from the official dispatch of intendant-general agius to the colonial minister : -- -lrb- 234 -rrb- -lrb- résumé of regulation -rrb- cap 25 § 329 the compulsory system of cultivation in cagayan new vizcaya gapan igorot and abra to remain in force § 331 the director-general of the government be authorize to extend compulsory labor to the other province or to abolish it where already introduce these instruction may be alter wholly or in part as occasion require § 332 price may be either increase or lower § 337 claim or action concern the possession of tobacco land pend before the usual tribunal shall not prevent such land from be use for the purpose of tobacco cultivation the present proprietor be under strict obligation to continue the cultivation either in person or by substitute -lrb- if he omit to do so the magistrate or judge take upon himself to appoint such substitute -rrb- § 351 the collector have receive denuncy ie information that land adapt to tobacco grow be lie fallow and that it be private property in case such land be really suitable to the purpose of tobacco cultivation the owner thereof be hereby summon to cultivate the same with tobacco in preference to anything else at the expiration of a certain space of time the land in question be to be hand over to the informer be it known however that notwithstanding these enactment the possessory title be not lose to the owner but he be compel to relinquish all rights and usufruct for three year cap 27 § 357 a important duty of the collector be to insure the greatest possible extension of the tobacco cultivation upon all suitable land but in particular upon those which be specially convenient and fertile land which although suitable for tobacco grow be previously plant with rice or corn shall as far as practicable be replace by forest clearing in order as far as possible to prevent famine and to bring the interest of the native into harmony with those of the authority § 351 in order that the work which the tobacco cultivation require may not be neglect by the native and that they may perform the field work necessary for they sustenance it be order that every two person work together shall between they cultivate eight thousand square vara that be two and one-half acre of tobacco land § 362 should this arrangement fail to be carry out either through age sickness or death it shall be leave to the priest of the district to determine what quantity of work can be accomplish by the little child have regard to they strength and number § 369 every collector who consign from he district 1000 fardo more than in former year shall receive for the overplus a double gratuity but this only where the proportion of first-class leaf have not decrease § 370 the same gratuity will be bestow when there be no diminution in bulk and one-third of the leaf be of first-class quality the follow

-rrb- be introduce into the philippine soon after the arrival of the spaniard by the missionary who bring the seed with they from mexico -lrb- 235 -rrb- the soil and climate be favorable to its production and the pleasure derive from it be speedily discover by the native naturally assist in its rapid adoption next to the cuban tobacco and a few sort of turkish -lrb- 236 -rrb- it be admit to be the best and in the colony it be assert by competent judge that it would soon surpass all other if the exist regulation be abolish and free trade establish there can be no doubt in the mind of impartial observer that the quality and quantity of the produce might be considerably increase by such a change on the other hand many of the prejudiced official certainly maintain the direct contrary the real question be to what extent these expectation may be realize in the fulfilment of such a measure of course bearing in mind that the judgment be sway by a strong desire for the abolition of a system which interfere at present with they prospects of gain but the fact be that even now the native grown tobacco notwithstanding all the defect inseparable from a illicit trade be equal to that produce by the -lrb- high grade of philippine product -rrb- government official in they own factory and be value at the same rate with many of the havana brand and the government cigar of the philippine be prefer to all other throughout eastern asia indeed rich merchant to whom a difference of price be no object as a rule take the manila cigar before havana -lrb- manila tobacco handicapped -rrb- accord to agius -lrb- memoria 1871 -rrb- in the european market the manila tobacco be admit to be without any rival with the sole exception of the vuelta abajo of cuba and most certainly in the asiatic and oceanic port its superior quality be undisputed as the havana tobacco lose its flavor on the long voyage to these country but now from year to year it be surely lose its reputation if then the manila cigar have not hitherto succeed in make themselves acceptable in europe on account of they inferiority the blame be attributable simply to the system of compulsory labor and the chronic insolvency of the insular treasury whilst the produce of other tobacco country have steadily progress in quality in consequence of free competition the fame of the manila cigar may also have suffer in some slight measure from the wide-spread though perfectly erroneous idea that they contain opium -lrb- hamper by government restriction -rrb- how greatly the produce might be increase by means of free trade be show under other circumstance by the example of cuba at the time when the government there monopolize the tobacco trade the crop be only partly sufficient to cover the home consumption whereas at the present time cuba supply all the market of the world -lrb- 237 -rrb- the decision of captain-general de la gandara upon this question be in the highest degree worthy of notice in a m report to the colonial minister march 1858 concern a measure for render the regulation of the tobacco monopoly still more stringent he say : if the tobacco cultivation be place without restriction into the hand of private trader we shall most probably in a few year be in a position to command nearly all the market in the world most of the island produce tobacco accord to the quality of the produce the tobacco province rank in the follow order : first cagayan and isabelum second igorot third island of mindanao fourth bisaya fifth nueva ecija -lrb- origin of monopoly -rrb- from the government order date November 20 1625 it be evident that even at that early period the sale of betel nut palm spirit -lrb- toddy -rrb- tobacco etc be a government monopoly : but it do not seem to have be very strictly carry out the tobacco monopoly as it stand at present the whole trade of which from the sowing of the seedling plant to the sale of the manufactured article be exclusively in the hand of the government be first introduce by captain-general josé basco y varga and a government order under date of January 9 1780 -lrb- confirm by departmental regulation December 13 1781 -rrb- further enact that the tobacco regulation should be extend to the philippine island in like manner as in all spanish possession in this and the other hemisphere -lrb- de uno y otto mundo -rrb- -lrb- governor basco 's innovation -rrb- before the administration of this very jealous governor for a period of two hundred year the colony receive annual contribution from new spain -lrb- situado de nueva españa -rrb- in order to relieve the spanish exchequer from this charge basco introduce -lrb- at that time national economic idea prevail of make the natural resource of a state supply its immediate want -rrb- a plan upon which fifty year later java model its culture system in the philippine however the condition for this system be less favorable in addition to the very slight submissiveness of the population there be two great obstacle in the opposition of the priest and the want of trustworthy official of all the provincial trade bring into existence by the energy of basco the indigo cultivation be the only one that remain in the hand of private individual the tobacco trade still be a government monopoly -lrb- 238 -rrb- basco first of all confine the monopoly to the province immediately contiguous to the capital in all of which the cultivation of tobacco be forbid under penalty of severe punishment except by person duly authorize and in the service of the government -lrb- 239 -rrb- in the other province the cultivation be to a certain extent permit but the supply remain after deduction of what be consume in each province be to be sell to the government only -lrb- speculation with public fund -rrb- in the bisaya the magistrate purchase the tobacco for the government and pay for it at the rate previously fix by the government factory at manila and they be allow to employ the surplus money of the government treasury chest for this purpose a worse system than this could scarcely be devise official think only of they own private advantage suffer no competition in they province employ they official power to oppress the producer to the utmost extent and thereby naturally check the production and the government treasury chest consequently suffer frequent loss through bankruptcy inasmuch as the magistrate who draw a salary of $ 600 and pay a license of from $ 100 to $ 300 for the right of trading in order to make money quickly engage in the most hazardous speculation in 1814 this stupid arrangement be first put a end to and forthwith the tobacco supplies from the bisaya increase through the competition of the private dealer who then for the first time have the power of purchase and from 1839 the planter be empower to obtain higher price than those afford by the greedy monopolize magistrate at present the follow general regulation be in force subject however to continual variation in detail -lrb- change bring improvement -rrb- by a departmental order September 5 1865 the cultivation of tobacco be permit in all the province though the produce be allow to be sell only to the government at the price regulate by they the wholesale purchase be make in luzon and the adjacent island in fardo -lrb- 240 -rrb- by colleccion that be direct through the finance official who have the management of the plant from the sowing but in the bisaya by acopio that be the government official buy up the tobacco tender by the grower or speculator by the cwt -lrb- different usage in bisaya and mindanao -rrb- in the bisaya and in mindanao everybody be allow to manufacture cigar for he own particular use though trade therein be strictly prohibit and advance to the tobacco grower be also make there while in luzon and the neighbor island the government provide seed and seedling plant here however no land which be adapt to the cultivation of tobacco be allow to be use for any other purpose of agriculture -lrb- crude system of grading -rrb- as the financial administration be unable to classify the tobacco at its true value as might be do be free competition permit they have adopt the expedient of determine the price by the size of the leave the care necessary to be bestow upon the training of the plant in order to produce leaf of the require size be at least a guarantee of a certain amount of proper attention and handle even if it be productive of no other direct good -lrb- 241 -rrb- -lrb- burden knowingly increase -rrb- it be well know at madrid how the tobacco monopoly by oppress the wretched population interfere with the prosperity of the colony yet to the present day the government measure have be so arrange as to exact a still larger gain from this very impolitic source of revenue -lrb- kill the goose that lay the golden egg -rrb- a government order of January 1866 direct the tobacco cultivation in the philippine to be extend as much as possible in order to satisfy the requirement of the colony the mother country and also the export trade and in the memorial already quote reform be propose by the captain-general in the spirit of the goose with golden egg by graft new monopoly upon those already exist he believe that the tobacco produce can be increase from 182102 cwt -lrb- average of the year 1860 to 1857 -rrb- to 500000 and even 800000 cwt meantime with a view to obtain increase price the government resolve to export the tobacco themselves to the usual market for sale and in the year 1868 this resolution be really carry out it be send to london where it secure so favorable a market that it be at once decree that no tobacco in manila should thenceforth be sell at less than $ 25 per cwt -lrb- 242 -rrb- this decree however refer only to the first three quality the quantity of which decrease in a relative measure with the increase pressure upon the population even in the table annex to the record of la gandara this be very clearly show whilst the total produce for 1867 stand at 176018 cwt -lrb- not much under the average of the year 1860 to 1857 viz 182102 cwt -rrb- the tobacco of the first class have decrease in quantity since 1862 from over 13000 to less than 5000 cwt -lrb- gift to spain of unusable tobacco -rrb- the fourth fifth and sixth class the greater part of which would before have be burnt but which now form no inconsiderable portion of the total crop be in the open market positively unsaleable and can be utilize only in the form of a bonus to spain which annually receive under the title of atencione á la peninsula upward of 100000 cwt if the colony be not compel to pay half the freight of these gift spain would certainly ask to be relieve of these mark of attention see that accord to the decision of the chief of the government the greater portion of this tobacco be of such inferior quality that it can find no purchaser at any price it be impossible that its value should cover either the cost of carriage or the custom duty moreover this tobacco tribute be a great burden on the colonial budget which in spite of all deficit be charge with the expense attend the collection of the tobacco its packing its cost of local transport and half the expense of its carriage to europe -lrb- de la gandara 's propose reform -rrb- date in march 1871 -- the beginning of a golden age if de la gandara 's plan have be carry out and he expectation realize -- there exist a excellent statement from the intendant-general address to the minister of colony point out plainly to the chief of the government the disadvantage arise from this mode of administration and urge the immediate repeal of the monopoly in the next place proof be adduced support by official voucher that the profit derive from the tobacco monopoly be much smaller than usual the total average receipt of the tobacco administration for the five year 1855 to 1869 accord to official account amount to $ 5367262 for the year 1866 to 1870 only $ 5240935 the expense can not be accurately estimate inasmuch as there be no strict account obtainable if however the respective expense charge in the colonial budget be add together they amount to $ 3717322 of which $ 1812250 be for purchase of raw tobacco -lrb- slight real profit from monopoly -rrb- besides these expense pertain exclusively to the tobacco administration there be still many other different item to be take into account yet the cost incur in this branch of the service would be save if not altogether at least largely if the state surrender the tobacco monopoly the total of the disbursement must certainly at the very lowest be estimate at $ 4000000 so therefore the state receive only a net profit of $ 1357000 but even this be not to be reckon on in the future for if the government do not speedily cease carry on this trade they will be force into a very considerable and unavoidable expense to begin with they must erect new factory and warehouse better machinery must be buy wages will have to be considerably increase and above all means must be devise to pay off the enormous sum of $ 1600000 in which the government be indebted to the peasant for the crop of 1869 and 1870 and to assure cash payment for future harvest this be the only possible mode of prevent the decay of the tobacco cultivation in the different province as well as relieve the misery of the wretched inhabitant -lrb- suffering and law-breaking thru the monopoly -rrb- later agius prove how trifling in reality the arrears be on account of which the government be abandon the future of the colony and show the misfortune of which i shall mention these briefly only a few result from the monopoly he represent that the people of the tobacco district who be the richest and most contented of all in the archipelago find themselves plunge into the deepest distress after the increase of the government due they be in fact far more cruelly treat than the slave in cuba who from self-interested motive be well-nourished and take care of whereas in this case the produce of compulsory labor have to be deliver to the state at a arbitrarily determine price and even this price be pay only when the condition of the treasury which be invariably in difficulty permit frequently they very mean of subsistence fail they in consequence of they be forbid to carry on the cultivation and the unfortunate people have no other resource for the relief of they press necessity be compel to alienate the debtor 's bond which purchase the fruit of they enforce toil but have be leave unpaid thus for a inconsiderable deficit of about $ 1330000 the whole population of one of the richest province be throw into abject misery a deep-rooted hatred naturally arise between the people and they ruler and incessant war ensue between the authority and they subject besides which a extremely dangerous class of smuggler have recently arise who even now do not confine themselves to mere smuggling but who on the very first opportunity present by the prevail discontent will band themselves together in one solid body the official administrator too be charge with gross bribery and corruption which whether true or not occasion great scandal and engender increase disrespect and distrust of the colonial administration as well as of the spanish people generally -lrb- 243 -rrb- -lrb- grow opposition to the monopoly -rrb- the precede memorial have be not only write but also print and it seem to indicate that gradually in spain and also in wider circle people be become convinced of the untenableness of the tobacco monopoly yet in spite of this powerful review it be consider doubtful by competent judge whether it will be give up so long as there be any apparent or appreciable return derive therefrom these acknowledge evil have long be know to the colonial government but from the frequent change of minister and the increase want of money the government be compel so long as they be in office to use all possible means of obtain profit and to abstain from carry out these urgent reform lest they own immediate downfall should be involve therein let we however cherish the hope that increase demand will cause a rise in the price a few particularly good crop and other propitious circumstance would relieve at once the insular treasury from its difficulty and then the tobacco monopoly might be cheerfully surrender one circumstance favorable to the economical management of the state that would be produce by the surrender of the tobacco monopoly would be the abolition of the numerous army of official which its administration require this might however operate reversely in spain the number of place-hunter create must be very welcome to the minister in power who thus have the opportunity of provide they creature with profitable place or of ship off inconvenient person to the antipode from the mother-country free of cost the colony be it know have not only to pay the salary but also to bear the cost of they outward and homeward voyage any way the custom be so liberally patronize that occasionally new place have to be create in order to make room for the newly-arrived nominee -lrb- 244 -rrb- -lrb- wholesale rate highter than retail government -rrb- at the time of my visit the royal factory could not turn out a supply of cigar commensurate with the requirement of commerce and this bring about a peculiar condition of thing the wholesale dealer who purchase cigar in very considerable quantity at the government auction pay higher than the retail rate at which he could buy they singly in the estancia in order therefore to prevent the merchant draw they stock from the estancia it be determine that only a certain quantity should be purchase which limit no merchant dare exceed a very intricate system of control assist by espionage have to be employ in see that no one through different agent and different estancia collect more than the authorise supply and violation of this rule when discover be punish by confiscation of the offender 's stock everybody be free to purchase cigar in the estancia but nobody be permit to sell a chest of cigar to a acquaintance at cost price several spaniard with whom i have speak concern these strange regulation maintain they to be perfectly just as otherwise all the cigar would be carry off by foreigner and they would not be able themselves in they own colony to smoke a decent cigar -lrb- money juggling -rrb- there be as i afterwards learn a still more urgent reason for the existence of these decree the government value they own gold at sixteen dollar per ounce while in commerce it fetch less and the premium on silver have at one time rise to thirty-three per cent moreover on account of the insufficient quantity of copper money for minor currency the small change frequently gain a premium on the silver dollar so much so that by every purchaser not less than half a dollar be realize in exchange the dollar from five to fifteen per cent discount be charge it be profitable therefore to purchase cigar in the estancia with the gold ounce and then to retail they in smaller quantity nominally at the rate of the estancia both premium together might in a extreme case amount to as much as forty-three per cent -lrb- 245 -rrb- -lrb- direction for cultivate tobacco -rrb- not be able to give a description of the cultivation of tobacco from personal knowledge and experience i refer the reader to the follow short extract from the cartillum agricolum : -- direction for prepare and lay out the seed bed -- a suitable piece of land be to be enclose quadrilaterally by boundary plough two or three time clear of all weed and root make somewhat sloping and surround by a shallow ditch the bed of which be to be divide by drain about two foot wide the soil of the same must be very fine must be ground almost as fine as powder otherwise it will not mix freely and thoroughly with the extremely fine tobacco seed the seed be to be wash and then suspend in cloth during the day in order to allow the water to run off after which it be to be mix with a similar quantity of ash and strew carefully over the bed the subsequent successful result depend entirely upon the careful performance of this work from the time the seed first begin to sprout the bed must be keep very clean in dry weather sprinkle daily and protect from bird and animal by bramble strew over and by means of light mat from storm and heavy rain after two month the plant will be between five and six inch high and generally have from four to six leave they must then be replant this occur suppose the seed-bed to have be prepare in September about the beginning or the middle of November a second sowing take place on the 15th of October as much as a precaution against possible failure as for obtain plant for the lowland concern the land most advantageous to the tobacco and its cultivation replanting of the seedling -- land must be choose of middling grain somewhat difficult calciferous soil be particularly recommend when it be richly fertilize with the remains of decayed plant and not less than two foot deep and the deeper the root be insert the higher will the plant grow of all the land adapt to the tobacco cultivation that in cagayan be the best as from the overflow of the large stream which occur every year it be lay under water and annually receive a new stratum of mud which render the soil particularly productive plantation prepare upon such soil differ very materially from those less favored and situate on a higher level in the former the plant shoot up quickly as soon as the root strike in the latter they grow slowly and only reach a middling height again in the fertile soil the plant produce quantity of large strong juicy leave give promise of a splendid harvest in the other case the plant remain considerably smaller and grow sparsely sometimes however even the lowland be flood in January and February and also in march when the tobacco have already be transplant and grow to some little height in that event everything be irreparably lose particularly if the flood should occur at a time when it be too late to lay out new plantation high-lying land also must therefore be cultivate in the hope that by very careful attention it may yield a similar return in October these field must be plough three or four time and harrowed twice or thrice on account of the flood the lowland can not be plough until the end of December or the middle of January when the work be light and simple the strongest plant in the seed-bed be choose and set in the prepared grounds at a distance of three foot from each other care be take that the earth cling to the root be not shake off of the care necessary to be bestow upon the plant -- in the east a little screen form by two clod be to be erect with a view to protect the plant from the morning sun and retain the dew for a longer time the weed to be carefully exterminate and the wild shoot remove a grub which occasionally appear in great number be particularly dangerous rain be very injurious immediately before the ripen when the plant be no longer in a condition to secrete the gummy substance so essential to the tobacco which be soluble in water would be draw off by the action of the rain tobacco which have be expose to bad weather be always deficient in juice and flavor and be full of white spot a certain sign of its bad quality the injury be all the greater the nearer the tobacco be to its ripening period the leaf hang down to the ground then decay and must be remove if the subsoil be not deep enough a carefully tend plant will turn yellow and nearly wither away in wet season this do not occur so generally as the root in insufficient depth be enable to find enough moisture cutting and manipulation of the leaf in the dry shed -- the topmost leaf ripen first they be then of a dark yellow color and inflexible they must be cut off as they ripen collect into bundle and bring to the shed in covered cart in wet or cloudy weather when the nightly dew have not be thoroughly evaporate by the sun they must not be cut in the shed the leaf be to hang upon cord or split spanish cane with sufficient room between they for ventilation and dry the dry leaf be then lay in pile which must not be too big and frequently turn over extreme care must be take that they do not become overheate and ferment too strongly this operation which be of the utmost importance to the quality of the tobacco demand great attention and skill and must be continue until nothing but a aromatic smell of tobacco can be notice come from the leaf but the necessary skill for this manipulation be only to be acquire by long practice and not from any write instruction chapter xxvi -lrb- importance of chinese -rrb- a important portion of the population remain to be discuss viz the chinese who be destine to play a remarkable part inasmuch as the development of the land-cultivation demand by the increase trade and commercial intercourse can be affect only by chinese industry and perseverance manila have always be a favorite place for chinese immigrant and neither the hostility of the people nor oppress and prohibitory decree for a long time by the government not even the repeat massacre have be able to prevent they come the position of the island south-east of two of the most important of the chinese province must necessarily have bring about a trade between the two country very early as ship can make the voyage in either direction with a moderate wind as well in the south-west as the north-east monsoon -lrb- early chinese association -rrb- in a few old writer may even be find the assertion that the philippine island be at one time subject to the dominion of china and father gaubil -lrb- lettre edifiante -rrb- mention that jaung-lo -lrb- of the ming dynasty -rrb- maintain a fleet consist of 30000 man which at different time proceed to manila the presence of they ship as early as the arrival of magellan in the extreme east of the archipelago as well as the china plate and earthenware vessel discover in the excavation plainly show that the trade with china have extend far earlier to the most distant island of the archipelago it form the chief support of the young spanish colony and after the rise of the encomienda be nearly the only source of its prosperity it be fear that the junk would offer they cargo to the dutch if any obstacle be put in the way of they come to manila the colony certainly could not maintain its position without the sangley -lrb- 246 -rrb- who come annually in great number in the junk from china and spread all over the country and in the town as -lrb- industrial and commercial activity -rrb- shopkeeper artisan gardener and fisherman besides which they be the only skillful and industrious worker as the filipino under the priestly domination have forget altogether many trade in which they have engage in former time i take these fact from morga -lrb- unsuccessful attempt at restriction -rrb- in spite of all this the spaniard have from the very commencement endeavor rigorously to limit the number of the chinese who be then as they be now envy and hate by the native for they industry frugality and cunning by which mean they soon become rich they be a abomination moreover in the eye of the priest as be irreclaimable heathen whose example prevent the native from make progress in the direction of christianity and the government fear they on account of the strong bond of union exist between they and as be subject of so powerful a nation whose close proximity threaten the small body of spaniard with destruction -lrb- 247 -rrb- fortunately for the latter the ming dynasty which at that time be hasten to its downfall do not think of conquest but wickedly disposed power which spring into existence upon they downfall bring the colony into extreme danger -lrb- limahong and the mandarin ' visit -rrb- in the attack of the note pirate limahong in 1574 they escape destruction only by a miracle and soon new danger threaten they afresh in 1603 a few mandarin come to manila under the pretence of ascertain whether the ground about cavite be really of gold they be suppose to be spy and it be conclude from they peculiar mission that a attack upon the colony be intend by the chinese -lrb- early massacre of chinese -rrb- the archbishop and the priest incite the distrust which be feel against the numerous chinese who be settle in manila mutual hate and suspicion arise both party fear one another and prepare for hostility the chinese commence the attack but the united force of the spaniard be support by the japanese and the filipino twenty-three thousand accord to other report twenty-five thousand of the chinese be either kill or drive into the desert when the news of this massacre reach china a letter from the royal commissioner be send to the governor of manila that noteworthy document show in so strike a manner how hollow the great government be at that time that i have give a literal translation of it at the end of this chapter -lrb- chinese laborer limit -rrb- after the extermination of the chinese food and all chinese other necessaries of life be difficult to obtain on account of the utter unreliability of the native for work but by 1605 the number of chinese -lrb- 248 -rrb- have again so increase that a decree be issue limit they to six thousand these to be employ in the cultivation of the country while at the same time they rapid increase be take advantage of by the captain-general for he own interest as he exact eight dollar from each chinaman for permission to remain in 1539 the chinese population have rise to thirty thousand accord to other information to forty thousand when they revolt and be reduce to seven thousand the native who generally be so listless and indifferent show the utmost eagerness in assist in the -lrb- another massacre -rrb- massacre of the chinese but more from hatred of this industrious people than from any feeling of friendship towards the spaniard -lrb- 249 -rrb- -lrb- the pirate kog-seng -rrb- the void occasion by this massacre be soon fill up again by chinese immigrant and in 1662 the colony be once more menace with a new and great danger by the chinese pirate kog-seng who have under he command between eighty and one hundred thousand man and who already have dispossess the dutch of the island of formosa he demand the absolute submission of the philippine he sudden death however save the colony and occasion a fresh outbreak of fury against the chinese settler in manila a great number of whom be butcher

-lrb- 251 -rrb- -lrb- another expulsion -rrb- in 1709 the jealousy against the chinese once more have reach such a height that they be accuse of rebellion and particularly of monopolize the trade and with the exception of the most serviceable of the artisan and such of they as be employ by the government they be once again expel spanish writer praise the salutariness of these measure allege that under the pretence of agriculture the chinese carry on trade they be cunning and careful make money and send it to china so that they defraud the philippine annually of a enormous amount sonnerat however complain that art trade and commerce have not recover from these severe blow though he add fortunately the chinese in spite of prohibitory decree be return through the corrupt connivance of the governor and official -lrb- thrifty trader -rrb- to the present day they be blame as be monopolist particularly by the creole and certainly by means of they steady industry and natural commercial aptitude they have appropriate nearly all the retail trade to themselves the sale of european import goods be entirely in they hand and the wholesale purchase of the produce of the country for export be divide between the native creole and the chinese the latter take about one-half before this time only the native and creole be permit to own ship for the purpose of forwarding the produce to manila in 1757 the jealousy of the spaniard break out again in the form of a new order from madrid direct the expulsion of the chinese and in 1759 the decree of banishment which be repeatedly evade be carry into effect : but as the private interest of the official do not happen to coincide with those of the creole trader the consequence be that the chinese soon stream back again in incredible number and make common cause with the english upon they invasion in 1762 -lrb- 252 -rrb- -lrb- anda 's and 1819 massacre -rrb- thereupon sr anda command that all the chinese in the philippine island should be

greater part of the european in manila also fall victim to the fury of the populace but the spaniard generally be spare the prejudice of the spaniard especially of the creole have always be direct against the chinese tradesman who interfere unpleasantly with the fleecing of the native and against this class in particular be the law of limitation aim they would willingly have let they develop the country by farm but the hostility of the native generally prevent this -lrb- expulsion of merchant from manila -rrb- a decree issue in 1804 command all chinese shopkeeper to leave manila within eight day only those who be marry be allow to keep shop and they residence in the province be permit only upon the condition that they confine themselves entirely to agriculture magistrate who allow these to travel in they district be fine $ 200 the deputy-governor $ 25 and the wretched chinese be punish with from two to three year ' confinement in iron in 1839 the penalty against the chinese be somewhat mitigate but those against the magistrate be still maintain on account of they venality in 1843 chinese ship be place upon term of equality with those of other foreign country -lrb- leg ult

themselves of this opportunity in order to escape the heavy poll-tax but in general they soon betake themselves to trading once more -lrb- oppressive taxation -rrb- of late year the chinese have not suffer from the terrible massacre which use formerly to overtake they neither have they suffer banishment the official be content to suppress they activity by means of heavy and oppressive tax for instance at the end of 1867 the chinese shopkeeper be annually tax $ 50 for permission to send they goods to the weekly market this be in addition to a tax of from $ 12 to $ 100 on they occupation and

in the state of south america the chinese seem destine in time either to supplant every other element or to find a mixed race upon which to stamp they individuality in the western state of the union they number be rapidly on the increase and the factory in californium be work entirely by they achieve result that can not be accomplish by european labor -lrb- mongolian vs caucasion in america -rrb- one of the most interesting of the many question of large comprehensiveness which connect themselves with the penetration of the mongolian race into america which up till now it have be the fashion to regard as the inheritance of the caucasian be the relative capacity of labor possess by both these two great race who in the western state of america have for the first time measure they mutual strength in friendly rivalry both be there represent in they most energetic individuality -lrb- 254 -rrb- and every nerve will be strain in carry on the struggle inasmuch as no other country pay for labor at so high a rate -lrb- efficiency and reliability of chinese labor -rrb- the condition however be not quite equal as the law place certain obstacle in the way of the chinese the court do not protect they sufficiently from insult which at time be aggravate into malicious manslaughter through the ill-usage of the mob who hate they bitterly as be reserve uncompanionable worker nevertheless the chinese immigrant take they stand firmly the western division of the pacific railway have be chiefly build by the chinese who accord to the testimony of the engineer surpass workman of all other nationality in diligence sobriety and good conduct what they lack in physical power they make up for in perseverance and work intelligently together the unique and nearly incredible performance that take place on April 28 1859 when ten mile of railway track be lay in eleven work hour along a division of land which have in no way be prepared beforehand be accomplish by chinese workman and indeed only by they could it have be practicable -lrb- 255 -rrb- -lrb- chinese cleverness and industry -rrb- of course the superiority of the european in respect chinese of the highest intellectual faculty be not for a moment to be doubt but in all branch of commercial life in which cleverness and perserver industry be necessary to success the chinese certainly appear entitle to the award to we it appear that the influx of chinese must certainly sooner or later kindle a struggle between capital and labor in order to set a limit upon demand perceptibly grow beyond moderation -lrb- chinese problem in america -rrb- the increase chinese immigration already intrude upon the attention of american statesman question of the utmost social and political importance what influence will this entirely new and strange element exercise over the conformation of american relation will the chinese find a state in the state or go into the union on term of political equality with the other citizen and form a new race by alliance with the caucasian element these problem which can only be touch upon here in a transitory form have be deal with in a masterly manner by pumpelly in he work across america and asia publish in london in 1870 letter of the commissary-general of chinchew to don pedro de acuña governor of the philippine to the powerful captain-general of luzon : have be give to understand that the chinese who proceed to the kingdom of luzon in order to buy and sell have be murder by the spaniard i have investigate the motive for these massacre and beg the emperor to exercise justice upon those who have engage in these abominable offence with a view to security in the future in former year before my arrival here as royal commissioner a chinese merchant name tioneg together with three mandarin go with the permission of the emperor of china from luzon to cavite for the purpose of prospect for gold and silver which appear to have be a excuse for he find neither gold nor silver i thereupon pray the emperor to punish this imposter tioneg thereby make patent the strict justice which be exercise in china it be during the administration of the ex-viceroy and eunuch that tioneg and he companion name yanglion utter the untruth already state and subsequently i begged the emperor to transmit all the papers bear upon the matter together with the minute of tioneg 's accusation when i myself examine the before-mentioned papers and know that everything that the accuse tioneg have say be utterly untrue i write to the emperor and state that on account of the untruth which tioneg have be guilty of the castilian entertain the suspicion that he wish to make war upon they and that they under this idea have murder more than thirty thousand chinese in luzon the emperor comply with my request punish the accuse yanglion though he omit to put he to death neither be tioneg behead or confine in a cage the chinese people who have settle in luzon be in no way to blame i and other discuss this with the emperor in order to ascertain what he pleasure be in this matter as well as in another namely the arrival of two english ship on the coast of chinchew -lrb- fukien or amoy district -rrb- -- a very dangerous circumstance for china and to obtain he imperial majesty 's decision as to both these most serious matter we also write to the emperor that he should direct the punishment of both these chinese and in acknowledge we communication he reply to we in respect to the english ship which have arrive in china that in case they have come for the purpose of plunder they should be immediately command to depart thence for luzon and with regard to the luzon difficulty that the castilian should be advise to give no credence to rogue and liar from china and both the chinese who have discover the harbor to the english should be execute forthwith and that in all other matter upon which we have write to he we will should be he upon receipt of this message by we -- the viceroy the eunuch and myself -- we hereby send this we message to the governor of luzon that he excellency may know the greatness of the emperor of china and of he empire for he be so powerful that he command all upon which the sun and moon shine and also that the governor of luzon may learn with what great wisdom this mighty empire be govern and which power no one for many year have attempt to insult although the japanese have seek to disturb the tranquillity of korea which belong to the government of china they do not succeed but on the contrary be drive out and korea have remain in perfect security and peace which those in luzon well know by report year ago after we learn that so many chinese perish in luzon on account of tioneg 's lie many of we mandarin meet together and resolve to leave it to the consideration of the emperor to take vengeance for so great a massacre and we say as follow : -- the country of luzon be a wretched one and of very little importance it be at one time only the abode of devil and serpent and only because -lrb- within the last few year -rrb- so large a number of chinese go thither for the purpose of trading with the castilian have it improve to such a extent in which improvement the accuse sangleye materially assist by hard labor the wall be raise by they house build and garden lay out and other matter accomplish of the greatest use to the castilian and now the question be why have no consideration be pay for these service and these good office acknowledge with thanks without cruelly murder so many people and although we write to the king twice or thrice concern the circumstance he answer we that he be indignant about the before-mentioned occurrence and say for three reason it be not advisable to execute vengeance nor to war against luzon the first be that for a long time till now the castilian have be friend of the chinese the second that no one can predict whether the castilian or the chinese would be victorious and the third and last reason be because those whom the castilian have kill be wicked people ungrateful to china they native country they elder and they parent as they have not return to china now for very many year these people say the emperor he value but little for the foregoing reason and he command the viceroy the eunuch and myself to send this letter through those messenger so that all in luzon may know that the emperor of china have a generous heart great forbearance and much mercy in not declare war against luzon and he justice be indeed manifest as he have already punish the liar tioneg now as the spaniard be wise and intelligent how do it happen that they be not sorry for have massacre so many people feel no repentance thereat and also be not kinder to those of the chinese who be still leave then when the castilian show a feeling of good-will and the chinese and sangleye who leave after the dispute return and the indebted money be repay and the property which be take from the sangleye restore then friendship will again exist between this empire and that and every year trading-ship shall come and go but if not then the emperor will allow no trading but on the contrary will at once command a thousand ship of war to be build man with soldier and relation of the slay and will with the assistance of other people and kingdom who pay tribute to china wage relentless war without quarter to any one and upon its conclusion will present the kingdom of luzon to those who do homage to china this letter be write by the visitor-general on the 12th of the second month a contemporary letter of the ruler of japan form a somewhat notable contrast : -- letter of daifusama ruler of japan to the governor don pedro de acuña in the year 1605 : i have receive two letter from you excellency as also all the donation and present describe in the inventory amongst they be the wine make from grape which i enjoy very much in former year you excellency request that six ship might come here and recently four which request i have always comply with but my great displeasure have be excite by the fact that of the four ship upon whose behalf you excellency interpose one from antonio make the journey without my permission this be a circumstance of great audacity and a mark of disrespect to I do you excellency wish to send that ship to japan without my permission independently of this you excellency and other have many time discuss with I concern the antecedent and interest of japan and many other matter you request respect which i can not comply with this territory be call xincoco which mean ` consecrate to idol ' which have be honor with the highest reverence from the day of we ancestor until now and whose action i alone can neither undo nor destroy wherefore it be in no way fitting that you law should be promulgate and spread over japan and if in consequence of these misunderstanding you excellency 's friendship with the empire of japan should cease and with I likewise it must be so for i must do that which i think be right and nothing which be contrary to my own pleasure finally i have hear it frequently say as a reproach that many japanese -- wicked corrupt man -- go to you kingdom remain there many year and then return to japan this complaint excite my anger and therefore i must request you excellency henceforth not to allow such person to return in the ship which trade here concern the remain matter i trust you excellency will hereafter employ you judgment and circumspection in such a manner as to avoid incur my displeasure for the future chapter xxvii -lrb- spain 's discovery and occupation -rrb- the philippine be discover by magellan on the 16th of march 1521 -- st lazarus ' day -lrb- 256 -rrb- but it be not until 1564 -lrb- 257 -rrb- after many previous effort have miscarry that legaspus who leave new spain with five ship take possession of the archipelago in the name of philip ii the discoverer have

mindanao and sulu independent -rrb- numerous wild tribe in the interior however the mahomedan state of mindanao and the sulu group for example have to this day preserve they independence the character of the people as well as they political disposition favor the occupancy there be no mighty power no old dynasty no influential priestly domination to overcome no tradition of national pride to suppress the native be either heathen or recently proselytize superficially to islamism and live under numerous petty chief who rule they despotically make war upon one another and be easily subdue such a community be call barangay and it form to this day though in a considerably modified form the foundation of the constitutional law -lrb- spanish improvemnt -rrb- the spaniard limit the power of the petty chief uphold slavery and abolish hereditary nobility and dignity substitute in its place a aristocracy create by themselves for service render to the state but they carry out all these change very gradually and cautiously -lrb- 260 -rrb- the old usage and law so long as they do not interfere with the natural course of government remain untouched and be operative by legal sanction and even in criminal matter they validity be equal to those emanate from the spanish court to this day the chief of barangay with the exception of those bear the title of don have no privilege save exemption from the poll-tax and socage service -lrb- unthinking policy of greed -rrb- they be virtually tax-collectors excepting that they be not pay for such service and they private means be make responsible for any deficit the prudence of such a measure might well be doubt without regard to the fact that it tempt the chief to embezzlement and extortion and it must alienate a class of native who would otherwise be a support to the government -lrb- high character of early administrator -rrb- since the measure adopt in alleviation of the conquest and occupancy succeed in so remarkable a manner the governor and they subordinate of those day at a time when spain be powerful and chivalrous naturally appear to have be distinguish for wisdom and high spirit legaspus possess both quality in a marked degree hardy adventurer be tempt there as in america by privilege and inducement which power afford they as well as by the hope which fortunately for the country be never realize of its be rich in auriferous deposit in luzon for instance hernando riquel state that there be many goldmine in several place which be see by the spaniard the ore be so rich that i will not write any more about it as i might possibly come under a suspicion of exaggerate but i swear by christ that there be more gold on this island than there be iron in all biscay -lrb- conqueror on commission -rrb- they receive no pay from the kingdom but a formal right be give they to profit by any territory which be bring into subjection by they some of these expedition in search of conquest be enterprise undertake

anew -lrb- the feudal encomienda -rrb- the whole country at the outset be completely divide into these living the defraying of which form by far the largest portion of the expense of the kingdom investiture of a similar nature exist more or less in a territory of considerable extent the inhabitant of which have to pay tribute to the feoffee and this tribute have to be raise out of agricultural produce the value of which be fix by the feudal lord at a very low rate but sell by he to the chinese at a considerable profit the feudal lord moreover be not satisfy with these receipt but hold the native in a state of slavery until forbid by a bull of pope gregory xiv date April 18 1591 kafir and negro slave whom the portuguese import by way of indium be however still permit -lrb-

1575 he visit the bisaya and check the covetousness of the encomendero so that at least during he rule they relax they system of extortion towards the end of sande 's government -lrb- 1575-80 -rrb- a furious quarrel break out between the priest and the encomendero the first preach against the oppression of the latter and memorialize philip ii thereon the king command that the native should be protect as the extortionate greed of the feudal chief have exceed all bound and the native be then at liberty to pay they tribute either in money or in kind the result of this well-intentioned regulation appear to have produce a greater assiduity both in agriculture and trade as the native prefer to work without coercion not on account of extreme want -lrb- salcedo most illustrious of the conqueror -rrb- and here i may briefly refer to the achievement of juan de salcedo the most illustrious of all the conqueror support by he grandfather legaspus with forty-five spanish soldier he fit out a expedition at he own expense embark at manila in may 1572 examine all part of the west coast of the island land in all the bay which be accessible to he light-draught ship and be well receive by the native at most of the place he generally find great opposition in penetrate into the interior yet he succeed in subdue many of the inland tribe and when he reach cape bojeador the north-west point of luzon the extensive territory which at present form the province of zambale pangasinan and iloco notre and sur acknowledge the spanish rule the exhaustion of he soldier oblige salcedo to return in vigan the present capital of ilocos sur he construct a fort and leave therein for its protection he lieutenant and twenty-five man while he himself return accompany only by seventeen soldier in three

course of time to paracale where he embark in a boat for manila be capsize and rescue from drown by some pass native -lrb- the corte of the philippine -rrb- in the meantime legaspus have die and lavezare be provisionally carry on the government salcedo hear of this with vexation at be pass over but when he recover from he jealousy he be entrust with the subjugation of camarine which he accomplish in a short time in 1574 he return to iloco in order to distribute annuity among he soldier and to receive he own share while still employ upon the building of vigan he discover the fleet of the notorious chinese pirate limahong who bent upon take possession of the colony be then pass that part of the coast with sixty-two ship and a large number of soldier he hasten at once with all the help which he could summon together in the neighborhood to manila where he be nominate to the command of the troops in the place of the already depose master of the force and he drive the chinese from the town which they have destroy they then withdraw to pangasinan and salcedo burnt they fleet which exploit be achieve with very great difficulty in 1576 this corte of the philippine die -lrb- 261 -rrb- -lrb- commercial importance of early manila -rrb- apart from the priest the first-comer consist only of official soldier and sailor and to they naturally fall all the high profit of the china trade manila be they chief market and it also attract a great portion of the external indian trade which the portuguese have frighten away from malacca by they excessive cruelty the portuguese it be true still remain in macao and the molucca : but they want those remittance which be almost exclusively seek after by the chinese viz the silver which manila receive from new spain -lrb- spain and portugal unite -rrb- in 1580 portugal together with all its colony be hand over to the spanish crown and the period extend from this event to the decay of portugal -lrb- 1580-1640 -rrb- witness the

portuguese possession in malacca and indium all that lie between cape singapore and japan be subject to luzon they ship cross the ocean to china and new spain and drive so magnificent a trade that if it be only free it would be the most extraordinary that the world could show it be incredible what glory these island confer upon spain the governor of the philippine treat with the king of cambodium

downfall of portugal occasion the loss of she colony once more spanish policy the government of the priest and the jealousy of the spanish merchant and trader especially do everything that remain to be do to prevent the development of agriculture and commerce -- perhaps on the whole fortunately for the native -lrb- philippine history unimportant and unsatisfactory -rrb- the subsequent history of the philippine be in all its particulars quite as unsatisfactory and uninteresting as that of all the other spanish-american possession ineffectual expedition against pirate and continual dispute between the clerical and secular authority form the principal incident -lrb- 263 -rrb- -lrb- undesirable emigrant from spain -rrb- after the first excitement of religious belief and military renown have subside the mind of those who go later to these outlying possession consist generally as they do of the very dregs of the nation be seize with a intense feeling of selfishness and fraud and speculation be the natural sequence the spanish writer be full of description of the wretched state of society then exist which it be unnecessary to repeat here -lrb- english occupation -rrb- the colony have scarcely be molest by external enemy with the exception of pirate in the earliest time the dutch have engage occasionally in attack on the bisaya but in 1762 -lrb- during the war of the bourbon succession -rrb- a english fleet suddenly appear before manila and take the surprised town without any difficulty the chinese ally themselves with the english a great insurrection break out among the filipino and the colony under the provisional government of a feeble archbishop be for a time in great danger it be reserve for other dignitary of the church and anda a energetic patriot to inflame the native against the foreigner and the opposition incite by the zealousness of the priest grow to such a extent that the english who be confine in the town be actually glad to be able to retreat in the following year the news arrive from europe of the conclusion of peace but in the interval this insurrection bring about by the invasion have rapidly and considerably extend and it be not suppress until 1765 when the work be accomplish by create enmity among the different tribe -lrb- 264 -rrb- but this be not do without a loss to the province of iloco of two hundred sixty-nine thousand two hundred and seventy person -- half of the population as represent by zuñiga -lrb- many minor uprising from local grievance -rrb- severity and want of tact on the part of the government and they instrument as well as bigoted dissension have cause many revolt of the native yet none it be true of any great danger to the spanish rule the discontent have always be confine to a single district as the native do not form a united nation neither the bond of a common speech nor a general interest bind the different tribe together the state communication and law among they scarcely reach beyond the border of the village and they dependency -lrb- danger from mestizo and creole -rrb- a consideration of far more importance to the distant metropolis than the condition of the constantly excited native who be politically divide among themselves and really have no steady object in view be the attitude of the mestizo and creole whose discontent increase in proportion to they number and prosperity the military revolt which break out in 1823 the leader of which be two creole might easily have terminate fatally for spain the latest of all the rising of the mestizo seem to have be the most dangerous not only to the spanish power but to all the european population -lrb- 265 -rrb- -lrb- cavite 1872 mutiny -rrb- on the 20th of January 1872 between eight and nine in the evening the artillery marine and the garrison of the arsenal revolt in cavite the naval base of the philippine and murder they officer and a lieutenant who endeavor to carry the intelligence to manila fall into the hand of a crowd of native the news therefore do not reach the capital until the next morning when all the available troops be at once dispatch and after a heavy preliminary struggle they succeed the following day in storm the citadel a dreadful slaughter of the rebel ensue not a soul escape among they be not a single european but there be many mestizo of whom several be priest and lawyer though perhaps the first account write under the influence of terror may have exaggerate many particulars yet both official and private letter agree in describe the conspiracy as be long contemplated widely spread and well plan the whole fleet and a large number of troops be absent at the time engage in the expedition against sulu a portion of the garrison of manila be to rise at the same time as the revolt in cavite and thousand of native be to precipitate themselves on the caras blancas -lrb- pale face -rrb- and murder they the failure of the conspiracy be it appear only attributable to a fortunate accident -- to the circumstance namely that a body of the rebel mistake some rocket fire upon the occasion of a church festival for the agreed signal and commence the attack too soon -lrb- 266 -rrb- -lrb- sum up -rrb- let I be permit in conclusion to bring together a few observation which have be scatter through the text touch the relation of the philippine with foreign country and briefly speculate thereon -lrb- credit due spain -rrb- credit be certainly due to spain for have better the condition of a people who though comparatively speak highly civilized yet be continually distract by petty war have sink into a disorder and uncultivated state the inhabitant of these beautiful island upon the whole may well be consider to have live as comfortably during the last hundred year protect from all external enemy and govern by mild law as those of any other tropical country under native or european sway -- owe in some measure to the frequently discuss peculiar circumstance which protect the interest of the native -lrb- friar a important factor -rrb- the friar also have certainly have a essential part in the production of the result -lrb- they defect have work out for good -rrb- spring from the lowest order inure to hardship and want and on term of the closest intimacy with the native they be peculiarly fit to introduce they to a practical conformity with the new religion and code of morality later on also when they possess rich living and they devout and zealous interest in the welfare of the mass relax in proportion as they income increase they materially assist in bring about the circumstance already describe with they favorable and unfavorable aspect further possess neither family nor good education they be dispose to associate themselves intimately with the native and they requirement and they arrogant opposition to the temporal power generally arise through they connection with the native with the altered condition of thing however all this have disappear the colony can no longer be keep secluded from the world every facility afford for commercial intercourse be a blow to the old system and a great step make in the direction of broad and liberal reform the more foreign capital and foreign idea and custom be introduce increase the prosperity enlightenment and self-respect of the population the more impatiently will the exist evil be endure -lrb- contrast with english colony -rrb- england can and do open she possession unconcernedly to the world the british colony be unite to the mother country by the bond of mutual advantage viz the production of raw material by means of english capital and the exchange of the same for english manufacture the wealth of england be so great the organization of she commerce with the world so complete that nearly all the foreigner even in the british possession be for the most part agent for english business house which would scarcely be affect at least to any marked extent by a political dismemberment it be entirely different with spain which possess the colony as a inherit property and without the power of turn it to any useful account -lrb- menace to spanish rule -rrb- government monopoly rigorously maintain insolent disregard and neglect of the mestizo and powerful creole and the example of the united state be the chief reason of the downfall of the american possession the same cause threaten ruin to the philippine : but of the monopoly i have say enough -lrb- grow american influence -rrb- mestizo and creole it be true be not as they formerly be in america exclude from all official appointment but they feel deeply hurt and injure through the crowd of place-hunter which the frequent change of ministry send to manila the influence also of the american element be at least visible on the horizon and will be more noticeable when the relation increase between the two country at present they be very slender the trade in the meantime follow in its old channel to england and to the atlantic port of the united state nevertheless whoever desire to form a opinion upon the future history of the philippine must not consider simply they relation to spain but must have regard to the prodigious change which a few decade produce on either side of we planet -lrb- powerful neighbor -rrb- for the first time in the history of the world the mighty power on both side of the ocean have commence to enter upon a direct intercourse with one another -- russium which alone be larger than any two other part of the earth china which contain within its own boundary a third of the population of the world and america with ground under cultivation nearly sufficient to feed treble the total population of the earth russium 's future role in the pacific ocean be not to be estimate at present -lrb- china and america -rrb- the trade between the two other great power will therefore be presumably all the heavier as the rectification of the press need of human labor on the one side and of the corresponding overplus on the other will fall to they -lrb- near predominance of the pacific -rrb- the world of the ancient be confine to the shore of the mediterranean and the atlantic and indian ocean suffice at one time for we traffic when first the shore of the pacific re-echoed with the sound of active commerce the trade of the world and the history of the world may be really say to have begin a start in that direction have be make whereas not so very long ago the immense ocean be one wide waste of water traverse from both point only once a year from 1603 to 1769 scarcely a ship have ever visit californium that wonderful country which twenty-five year ago with the exception of a few place on the coast be a unknown wilderness but which be now cover with flourish and prosperous town and city serve by a sea-to-sea railway and its capital already rank the third of the seaport of the union even at this early stage of its existence a central point of the world 's commerce and apparently destine by the propose junction of the great ocean to play a most important part in the future -lrb- the mission of america -rrb- in proportion as the navigation of the west coast of america extend the influence of the american element over the south sea the captivating magic power which the great republic exercise over the spanish colony -lrb- 267 -rrb- will not fail to make itself feel also in the philippine the american be evidently destine to bring to a full development the germ originate by the spaniard as conqueror of modern time represent the age of free citizen in contrast to the age of knighthood they follow with the plow and the axe of the pioneer where the former advance under the sign of the cross with they sword -lrb- superiority over spanish system -rrb- a considerable portion of spanish-america already belong to the united state and have since attain a importance which could not possibly have be anticipate either under the spanish government or during the anarchy which follow with regard to permanence the spanish system can not for a moment be compare with that of america while each of the colony in order to favor a privileged class by immediate gain exhaust still more the already enfeebled population of the metropolis by the withdrawal of the best of its ability america on the contrary have attract to itself from all country the most energetic element which once on its soil and free from all fetter restlessly progress have extend its power and influence still further and further the philippine will escape the action of the two great neighboring power all the less for the fact that neither they nor they metropolis find they condition of a stable and well-balanced nature -lrb- need of philippine awakening -rrb- it seem to be desirable for the filipino that the above-mentioned view should not speedily become accomplished fact because they education and training hitherto have not be of a nature to prepare they successfully to compete with either of the other two energetic creative and progressive nation they have in truth dream away they best day part ii state of the philippine in 1810 by toma de comyn -lrb- population -rrb- the enumeration of the native for the assessment of tribute in the manner ordain by the standing regulation of the intendant of new spain be not observe in the philippine island nor indeed would this be a easy task the wide extent of the twenty-seven province of which they be compose scatter as they be through the great space comprehend between the southern part of mindanao and the almost desert island know by the name of batane and babuyane to the north of that of luzon present almost insurmountable obstacle and in some measure afford a excuse for the omission among these obstacle may be mention the necessity of wait for the favorable monsoon to set in in order to perform the several voyage from one island to the other the encumber state of the grounds in many part the irregular and scattered situation of the settlement and dwelling the variety among the native and they dialect the imperfect knowledge hitherto obtain of the respective limit and extent of many district the general want of guide and auxiliary on whom reliance can be place and above all the extreme repugnance the native evince to the payment of tribute a circumstance which induce they to resort to all kind of stratagem in order to elude the vigilance of the collector and conceal they real number -lrb- estimate -rrb- the quinquennial census as regularly enjoin be thus find impracticable no other means be leave than to deduce from the annual list transmit by the district magistrate to the superintendent 's office and those form by the parish curate a prudent estimate of the total number of inhabitant subject to we law and religion yet these datum although the only one and also the most accurate it be possible to obtain for this reason inspire so little confidence that it be necessary to use they with great caution it be evident that all the district magistrate and curate do not possess the same degree of care and minuteness in a research so important and the omission or connivance of they respective delegate more or less general render it probable that the number of tribute not include in the annual return be very considerable if to this we add the leged exemption from tribute justly grant to various individual for a certain number of year or during the performance of special service we shall easily be convince of the imperfection of result derive from such insecure principle \* \* \* i have carefully form my estimate correspond to the year 1810 and by confront they with such datum as i possess relate to the population of 1791 i have deduce the console assurance that under a parity of circumstance the population of these island far from have diminish have in the interval greatly increase -lrb- ratio to tribute -rrb- from the collective return recently make out by the district magistrate it would appear that the total number of tribute amount to 386654 which multiply by six and one-half produce the sum of 2515406 at which i estimate the total population include old man woman and child i ought here to observe that i have choose this medium of six and one-half between the five person estimate in spain and eight in the indy as constitute each family or entire tribute for although the prodigious fecundity of the woman in the latter hemisphere and the facility of maintain they numerous offspring both the effect of the benignity of the climate and they sober way of live sufficiently warrant the conclusion that a greater number of person enter into the composition of each family i have in this case be induce to pay deference to the observation of religious person intrust with the care of soul who have assure I that whether it be owe to the great mortality prevail among child or the influence of other local cause in many district each family or entire tribute do not exceed four and one-half person -lrb- foreigner and wild tribe -rrb- to the above amount it be necessary to add 7000 sangley -lrb- chinese -rrb- who have be enumerate and subject to tribute for although in the return preserve in the public office they be not rate at more than 4700 there be ample reason for conclude that many who be wander about or hide in the province have elude the general census the european spaniard and spanish creole and mestizo do not exceed 4000 person of both sex and all age and the distinct caste or modification know in america under the name of mulatto quadroon etc although find in the philippine island be generally confound in the three class of pure native chinese mestizo and chinese besides the above distinction various infidel and independent nation or tribe exist more or less savage and ferocious who have they dwelling in the wood and glen and be distinguish by the respective name of aeta ingolot negrillo igorot tinguiane etc nor be there scarcely a province in luzon that do not give shelter to some of those isolate tribe who inhabit and possess many of the mountainous range which ramificate and divide the wide and extended plain of that beautiful island -lrb- origin of race -rrb- the original race by which the philippine be people be beyond doubt malayan and the same that be observe in sumatra java borneo and the other island of this immense archipelago the philippine islander very different from the malabar whose feature possess great regularity sweetness and even beauty only resemble the latter in color although they excel they in stature and the good proportion of they limb the local population of the capital in consequence of its continual communication with the chinese and other asiatic with the mariner of various nation with the soldiery and mexican convict who be generally mulatto and in considerable number send to the island yearly in the way of transportation have become a mixture of all kind of nation and feature or rather a degeneration from the primitive race -lrb- manila 's population -rrb- manila the capital of the philippine island at present contain a population of from one hundred forty to one hundred fifty thousand inhabitant of all class but it ought however to be understand that in this computation be include the populous suburb of santa cruz san fernando binondo tondo quiapo san sebastian san anton and sampaloc for although each be consider as a distinct town have a separate curate and civil magistrate of its own the subsequent union that have take place rather make they appear as a prolongation of the city divide into so many ward and parish in the center of which they respective church be build among the chief provincial town several be find to contain a population of from twenty to thirty thousand soul and many not less than ten to twelve thousand finally it be a generally receive opinion that besides the moro and independent tribe the total population of the philippine island subject to the authority of the king be equal to three million -lrb- cotton -rrb- among the varied production of the philippine for many reason none be so deserving of attention as cotton its whiteness and find staple give to it such a superiority over that of the rest of asia and possibly of the world that the chinese anxiously seek it in order pereferably to employ it in they most perfect texture and purchase it thirty per cent dearer than the best from british indium notwithstanding this extraordinary allurement the vicinity of a good market and the positive certainty that however great the exportation the growth can never equal the consumption and immense demand for this article it have nevertheless hitherto be find impossible to extend and improve its cultivation in such a way as to render it a staple commodity of the country owe to this lamentable neglect be it that the annual exportation do not exceed five thousand arroba -lrb- 125000 lb -rrb- whereas the british import into china at the annual rate of 100000 bale or 1200000 arroba produce in they establishment at bombay and calcutta and which sell at the medium price of fifteen tael for one hundred thirty pound yield the net amount of $ 4800000 -lrb- its advantage -rrb- this want of attention to so important a branch of agriculture be the more to be regret as the island abound in situation peculiarly adapt for the cultivation of cotton and the accidental failure of the crop in some province might easily be make up by they success in other the culture of this plant be besides extremely easy as it require no other labor than clear the grounds from brush-wood and lightly turn up the earth with a plough before the seed be scatter which be do the planter leave the crop to its own chance and in five month gather abundant fruit if at the time the bud open it be not burn by the north wind or rot with unseasonable shower -lrb- restricted cultivation -rrb- the province of iloco and batanga be the only one in which the cultivation of cotton be pursue with any degree of zeal and care and it greatly tend to enrich the inhabitant this successful example have not however hitherto excited emulation in those of the other province and thus the only production of the philippine island of which the excellence and superior demand in trade be as well know as its culture be easy owe to strange fatality and cause which will be hereafter notice be leave almost in a neglect state or at most confine to the narrow limit of local consumption -lrb- indigo -rrb- pangasinan pampanga bataan la laguna tayaba and camarine produce indigo of various class and although its preparation or the extraction of the dye be in most of the above province still perform in a equally imperfect manner several small improvement have recently be make which have better the quality more particularly in la laguna the only district in which attempt have be make to imitate the process use in guatemalum as well with regard to the construction and number of vat necessary as the precipitation of the color particle -- detach from the plant by the agitation of the water in the other place the whole of the operation be perform in a single vat and the indigo obtain be not unfrequently impregnate with lime and other extraneous substance -lrb- increase culture -rrb- whatever may have be the cause of this evident backwardness from the period of the establishment of the philippine company in these island and in consequence of the exertion of some of the director to promote the cultivation of indigo at that time very little known the native have slowly though gradually be reconcile to it and discover it to be one of the most advantageous branch of industry although accompany with some labor and expose to the influence of drought and excessive heat as well as to the risk attendant on the extraordinary anticipation of the rainy season have of late year pay more attention to it the quintal of indigo of the first class cost the planter from $ 35 to $ 40 at most and in the market of manila it have be sell from $ 60 to $ 130 accord to the quality and the greater or lesser demand for the article at the season as however everything in this colony move within a small circle it be not possible to obtain large quantity for exportation not only because of the risk in advance the indian sum of money on account of he crop but also owe to the annual surplus seldom exceed from two to two thousand five hundred distribute in many hand and collect by numerous agent equally interested in make up they return-cargo -lrb- sugar -rrb- the cultivation of the sugar-cane be more or less extend to all the province of these island owe to its consumption among the native be both great and general but those of la pampanga and pangasinan be more particularly devote to it these two province alone annually produce about 550000 arroba -lrb- 13750000 lb -rrb- of which one-third be usually export in chinese and other foreign vessel in extraordinary season the amount export greatly exceed the quantity above state as for example happen in the monsoon of 1796 when the planter come down to the port of manila and by contract export upward of nine million weight of the first and second quality the price of this article have experience many variation of late year but the medium may be estimate at $ 6 for one hundred twenty-five pound of the first quality and $ 5 for the second -lrb- method of manufacture -rrb- the superior quality of the sugar of the philippine be acknowledge when compare to that produce in the island of java china or bengal notwithstanding in the latter country it may naturally be conclude that greater pain and care be bestow on its manufacture the pressure of the cane in the philippine island be perform by means of two coarse stone cylinder place on the ground and move in opposite direction by the slow and unequal pace of a carabao a species of ox or buffalo peculiar to this and other asiatic country the juice be convey to a iron caldron and in this the other operation of boil skim and cleanse take place till the crystallization or adhering of the sugar be complete all these distinct part of the process in other colony be perform in four separate vessel confide to different hand and consequently experience a much greater degree of care and dexterity after be properly clay the sugar acquire such a state of consistency that when ship in canvas bag they become almost petrified in the course of the voyage without moisten or purge as i understand be the case with those of bengal -lrb- silk -rrb- among the useful object to which the patriotic society of manila -lrb- amigos del pais -rrb- direct they attention from the very moment of they formation the planting of mulberry tree seem to have meet with peculiar encouragement the society rightly judge that the naturalization of so valuable a commodity as silk in these island would materially increase the resource of the colony and there be reason to hope that besides local consumption the growth might in time be so much extend as to supply the want of new spain which be not less than 80000 lb amount to from $ 350000 to $ 400000 convey there in the galleon annually send to the port of acapulco by the manila merchant which article they be now compel to contract for in china -lrb- mulberry tree -rrb- the society give the first impulse to this laudable project and then the governor of the island don josé basco anxious to realize it with this view send colonel charle conely on a special commission to the province of camarine this zealous officer and district magistrate in the year 1786-1788 cause 4485782 mulberry tree to be plant in the thirty district under he jurisdiction and incalculable be the happy result which would have attend a plan so extensive and commence with so much vigor if it could have be continue with the same zeal by he successor and not at once destroy through a mistaken notion of humanity with which soon after the departure of governor basco they proceed to exonerate the filipino from all agricultural labor that be not free and spontaneous in conformity as be then allege to the general spirit of we indian legislation as it be natural to expect the total abandonment of this valuable branch follow a measure so fatal and notwithstanding the effort subsequently make by the royal company in order to obtain its restoration as well in camarine as the province of tondo all they exertion be in vain though it must be allow that at the time several untoward circumstance contribute to thwart they anxious wish notwithstanding this failure the project far from be deem impracticable would beyond all doubt succeed and under powerful patronage completely answer the well-founded hope of its original conceiver and promoter the native themselves would soon be convince of the advantage to be derive from the possession of a article in so many way applicable to they own fine texture and besides the variety of district in the island prove to be suitable to the cultivation of this interesting tree it be a known fact that many of the old mulberry grove be still in existence -lrb- beeswax -rrb- the bisaya cagayan and many other province produce wax in considerable abundance which the indian collect from the natural hive form in the cavity of the tree and it be also bring down by the infidel native from the mountain to the neighbor town the quality certainly be not the best and notwithstanding attempt have be make to cleanse it from the extraneous particle with which it be mixed it always leave a considerable sediment on the lower part of the cake and never acquire a entire whiteness its consumption be great especially in the capital and after supply the want of the country a annual surplus of from six hundred to eight hundred quintal be appropriate for exportation -lrb- neglect market -rrb- this certainly might be convert into a article of extreme importance especially for the kingdom of peru which in peaceable time receive its supplies from spain and even from the island of cuba but for this purpose it would be necessary to adopt the plan recommend by the enlighten zeal of the patriotic society and previously encourage the establishment of artificial hive and the plantation of aromatic and flowering shrub which so easily attract and secure the permanency of the rove swarm always ready to undertake fresh labor this as well as many other point have hitherto be entirely overlook -lrb- black pepper -rrb- the production be cultivate in the province of tayaba batanga and la laguna but in such small quantity that notwithstanding the powerful allurement of all kind constantly hold out by the royal company during the long period of twenty year they agent have never be able to collect in more than about 64000 lb annually after every encouragement the most that have be attain with the native be confine to they plant in some district fifty to one hundred pepper-vine round they hut which they cultivate in the same way as they would plot of flower but without any other labor than support the plant with a proportioned stake clear the ground from weed and attend to daily irrigation -lrb- a possibility -rrb- this article therefore scarcely deserve a place amongst the flourish branch of agriculture at least till it have be raise from its present depressed state and the grounds lay out in regular and productive pepper-grove till this be do to a corresponding extent it must also be exclude from the number of production furnish by these island to commerce and exportation more particularly if we consider that notwithstanding the great fragrance of the grain as well as its general superiority over the rest of asia so great a difference exist in the actual price that this can never be compensate by its greater request in the market of europe and much less enable it to compete with that of the british and dutch till its abundance have considerably lower its primitive value -lrb- not popular -rrb- finally although a infinity of grounds be to be find adapt to the rapid propagation of pepper-vine as may easily be infer from the analogy and proximity of the philippine island to the other of this same archipelago so well know for they growth of spice it must be confess that it be a species of culture by no means popular among the philippine native and it would be almost require too much from they inconstancy of character to wish they to dedicate they land and time to the raising of a production which besides demand considerable care be greatly expose to injury and even liable to be destroy by the severity of the storm which frequently mark the season with difficulty would they be induce to wait five year before they be able to gather the uncertain fruit of they labor and patience if therefore it should ever be deem a measure of policy to encourage the growth of black pepper it will be necessary for the government to order the common belong to each town and adapt to this species of plantation to be appropriate to this use by impose on the inhabitant the obligation of take care of they and draw from the respective coffer of each community the necessary fund for the payment of the laborer and the other expense of cultivation if this can not be do it will be necessary to wait till the general condition of the country be improve when through the spirit of emulation and the enterprise of the planter be duly patronize and support present difficulty may be overcome and the progressive result of future attempt will be then find to combine the interest of individual with the general welfare of the colony -lrb- coffee -rrb- so choice be the quality of the coffee produce in the island of luzon especially in the district of indang and silang in the province of cavite that if it be not equal to that of mocha i at least consider it on parallel with the coffee of bourbon but as the consumption and cultivation be extremely limit it can not with any propriety be yet number among the article contribute to the export-trade -lrb- cocoa -rrb- cocoa be something more attend to in consequence of the use of chocolate be greatly extend among the native of easy circumstance that of the island of cebu be esteem superior to the cocoa of guayaquil and possibly it be not excel by that of soconusco as however the quantity raise do not suffice for the local consumption guayaquil cocoa meet a ready sale and be generally bring in return-cargo by the ship come from acapulco and those belong to the philippine company dispatch from callao the shipping port of lima the cultivation of these two article in the philippine be on the same footing as that of pepper which as above state be rather a object of luxury and recreation than one of speculation among the filipino the observation and rule point out in the precede article be in a general sense applicable to both these branch of industry -lrb- cinnamon -rrb- cinnamon grove or tree of wild cinnamon be to be find in every province in mindanao a dutchman some year ago be employ by order of the government in examine the forest and make experiment with a view to discover the same tree of this species that have give so much renown to ceylon but whether it be owe to a failure in the discovery or when the plant be find as at the time be say to be the case the same result be not produce from the want of skill in prepare or strip off the bark certain it be that the laudable attempt totally fail or rather the only advantage gain have be the extract from the bark and more tender part of the branch of the tree a oil or essence of cinnamon vigorous and aromatic in the extreme -lrb- experiment in laguna -rrb- about the same time a land-owner of the name salgado undertake to form a extensive plantation of the same species in the province of la laguna and succeed in see upward of a million cinnamon tree thrive and grow to a considerable size but at last he be reluctantly compel to desist from he enterprise by the same reason which lead to the failure of mindanao -lrb- need of experienced cultivator -rrb- these fact be of sufficient authority for we place the cinnamon tree among the indigenous production of the philippine island and consider they general excellence above those of the same nature in the rest of asia it may reasonably be conclude that without the tree be identically the same the cinnamon with which it be clothe will be find finer than that yield by the native plant of the island of ceylon and this circumstance consequently hold out a hope that in the course of time it may become a article of traffic as estimable as it would be new in order however that this flattering prospect may be realize it will be requisite for the government to procure some family or person from the above island acquaint with the process of strip off the bark and prepare the cinnamon by dexterously offer allurement correspond to the importance of the service which although in itself it may probably be a extremely simple operation as long as it be unknown will be a insuperable obstacle to the propagation of so important a agricultural pursuit -lrb- nutmeg -rrb- two species of nutmeg be know here the one in shape resemble a pigeon 's egg and the other of a perfectly spherical form but both be wild and little aromatic and consequently hold in no great esteem -lrb- rice -rrb- rice be the bread and principal aliment of these native for which reason although its cultivation be among the most disagreeable department of husbandry they devote themselves to it with astonishing constancy and alacrity so as to form a complete contrast with they characteristic indifference in most other respects this must however be take as a certain indication of the possibility of train they up to useful labor whenever they can be lead on in a proper manner -lrb- high yield -rrb- the earth correspond with surprising fertility to the labor of the filipino rewarding he in the good season with ninety and even as high as one hundred per cent a fact i have fully ascertain and of which i besides possess undoubted proof obtain from the parish-curate of la pampanga as however the province be frequently visit with dreadful hurricane -lrb- call in the country baguio -rrb- desolate by locust and expose to the effect of the great irregularity of nature which in these clime often act in extreme the crop of this grain be precarious or at least no reliance can be place on a certain surplus allow a annual exportation to china on this account rice can not be place in the list of those article which give support to the external trade -lrb- dye and cabinet wood -rrb- the sibucao or logwood and ebony in both which these island abound be the only wood in any tolerable request the first be sell with advantage in bengal and the other meet a ready sale in the port of china in the absence of that bring from the island of bourbon which be a quality infinitely superior both be however article of no great consumption for be bulky and possess little intrinsic value they will not bear the high charge of freight and other expense attendant on the navigation of the asiatic sea and can only suit the shipper as cargo who be anxious not to return to the above country in ballast hence as a object of export trade these article can not be estimate at more than $ 30000 per annum -lrb- timber -rrb- i deem it superfluous to dwell on a multitude of other good and even precious wood in timber with which the philippine island be gifted because this be a subject already sufficiently well understand and a complete collection of specimen as well as some large block be besides transmit some year ago to the king 's dockyard it may however be proper to remark that the establishment near the capital for shipbuilding and mast be much more expensive than be generally suppose as well on account of the difficulty experience in drag the tree from the interior of the mountain to the water 's edge as the want of regularity and foresight with which these operation have be usually conduct besides these reason as it be necessary that the other material requisite for the construction and complete armament of vessel of a certain force should come from europe it be neither easy nor indeed would it be economical as be erroneously assert to carry into effect the government project of annually build in the colony a ship of the line and a frigate it ought further to be observe that no stock of timber cut at a proper season and well cure have be lie in and although the wages of the native carpenter and caulker be moderate no comparison whatever can be make between the daily work they perform and that which be do in the same space of time in we dock-yard of spain -lrb- ship building advantage -rrb- notwithstanding however the impediment above state as it be undeniable that abundance of suitable timber be to be obtain and as the conveyance of the remainder of the necessary naval store to the philippine island be shorter and more economical than to the coast of californium it possibly might answer at least many mariner be of this opinion in case it be deem expedient to continue build at san bla the brig and corvette necessary for the protection of the military post and mission situate along the above coast to order they preferably to be build in cavite give timely advice and previously take care to make the necessary arrangement -lrb- gold -rrb- gold abound in luzon and in many of the other island but as the mountain which conceal it be in possession of the pagan tribe the mine be not work indeed it may be say they be scarcely know these mountaineer collect it in the brook and streamlet and in the form of dust offer it to the christian who inhabit the neighbor plain in exchange for coarse goods and fire-arm and it have sometimes happen that they have bring it down in grain of one and two ounce weight the native of the province of camarine partly devote themselves to the working of the mine of mambulao and paracale which have the reputation of be very rich but far from avail themselves in the smallest degree of the advantage of art they content themselves with extract the ore by means of a extremley imperfect fusion which be do by place the mineral in shell and then heat they on ember a considerable waste consequently take place and although the metal obtain be good and high color it generally pass into the hand of the district-magistrate who collect it at a price infinitely lower than it be worth in trade it be a generally receive opinion that gold mine be equally to be meet with in the province of caraga situate on the coast of the great island of mindanao where as well as in other point this metal be meet with equal to twenty-two karat the quantity however hitherto bring down from the mountain by the pagan tribe and that obtain by the tributary filipino have not be a object of very great importance -lrb- copper -rrb- well-founded reason exist for presume that in the province of iloco mine of virgin copper exist a singular production of nature or at least not very common if the generality of combination under which this metal present itself in the rest of the globe be duly consider this be partly infer from the circumstance of its have be notice that the igorot who occasionally come down from the mountain to barter with the christian use certain coarse jar or vessel of copper evidently make by themselves with the use of a hammer without any art or regularity and as the ignorance of these demi-savage be too great for they to possess the notion necessary for the separation of the component part which enter into the combination of mineral and much less for the construction of furnace suitable to the smelting and formation of the mould it be conclude they must have find some vein of copper entirely pure which without the necessity of any other preparation they have be able to flatten with the hammer and render maleable so as to convert it into the rough vessel above speak of -lrb- cinnabar -rrb- the district-magistrate of caraga don augustin de ioldus receive a special commission from the government to explore and obtain information respect a mine of cinnabar which be say to be situate under he jurisdiction and i have be inform of another of the same species in the island of samar the working of which have cease for a considerable time not because the prospect be unfavorable but for the want of a intelligent person to superintend and carry on the operation the utility of such a discovery be too obvious not to deserve on the part of government the most serious attention and every encouragement to render it available and it be to be hope that as the first step have already be take in this important disclosure the enterprise will not be abandon but on the contrary that exertion will be make to obtain aid and advice from the miner ' college of mexico as the best means of remove doubt and act with judgment in the affair -lrb- iron -rrb- iron in mineral form be to be find at various point on luzon and those engage in work it without the necessity of digging collect the iron-bearing stone that constitute the upper stratum these when place in fusion generally yield about forty per cent clear metal this be the case in the mountain of angat situate in the province of bulacan and also in the vicinity of the baliwag river in morong however belong to the province of la laguna where the cannon-ball factory be establish the ore yield under twenty-two per cent its quality be in general better than the biscayan iron accord to formal experiment and a report make in 1798 to governor don rafael maria de aguilar by two biscayan master-smith from the squadron of admiral alava witness to this test be the count de avile and don felix de la rosa proprietor of the mine of morong and angat and the factor of the philippine company don juan francisco urroroz notwithstanding its advantage this interesting branch of industry have not yet pass beyond the most rude principle and imperfect practice owe to the want of correct information as to the best process and scarcity of fund on the part of the proprietor to carry on they work without the aid of roll or slit mill indeed unprovided with the most essential instrument they have hitherto confine themselves to convert they iron into plow share bolo hoe and such other agricultural implement leave the chinese of amoy in quiet possession of the advantage of be allow to market annual supplies of all kind of nail the boiler use on the sugar plantation pot and pan as well as other article in this line which might easily be manufacture in the island -lrb- sulphur -rrb- in the island of leyte abundance of sulphur be meet with and from thence the gunpowder work of manila be supply at very reasonable price jasper cornelian and agate be also find in profusion in many of these province everything indeed promise varied mineral wealth worthy of exciting the curiosity and useful research of mineralogist who unfortunately have not hitherto extend they labor to these remote part of the globe -lrb- pearl -rrb- pearl fishery be from time to time undertake off the coast of the island of mindanao and also near smaller island not far from cebu but with little success and less constancy not because there be a scarcity of fine pearl of a bright color and considerable size but on account of the diver ' want of skill and they just dread of the shark which in great number infest these sea amber be frequently gather in considerable lump in the vicinity of samar and the other visayan island as well as mother-of-pearl tortoise-shell and red and black coral of the latter kind of which i have see shaft as thick as my finger and six or eight foot long -lrb- estate -rrb- the proprietor of estate in the philippine be of four class the most considerable be that of the religious order augustinian and dominican who cultivate they respective land on joint account or let they out at a moderate ground-rent which the planter pay in kind but far from live in opulence and accumulate the immense revenue some of the religious community enjoy in america they stand in need of all they earn and possess for they maintenance and in order to be enable to discharge the various duty and obligation annex to the mission with which they be entrust -lrb- spanish planter -rrb- the second class comprehend the spanish proprietor whose number possibly do not exceed a dozen of person and even they labor under such disadvantage and have to contend with so many obstacle under the exist order of thing that compel to divide they land into rice plantation in consequence of this be the species of culture to which the native be most inclined and to devote a considerable portion of they to the grazing of horn cattle no one of they be in a situation to give to agriculture the variety and extent desire or to attain any progress in a pursuit which in other colony rapidly lead to riches -lrb- filipino farmer -rrb- the third consist of the principal mestizo and native and be in fact that which constitute the real body of farm proprietor in the fourth and last may be include all the other native who generally possess a small strip of land situate round they dwelling or at the extremity of the various town and settlement form by the conqueror besides what they may have obtain from they ancestor in the way of legal inheritance which rights have be confirm to they by the present sovereign of the colony -lrb- aid to agriculture -rrb- it will beyond doubt in some measure dissipate the distrust by which the filipino be actuate when the new and paternal exertion of the superior government to ameliorate he present situation be fully know and when that valuable portion of we distant population be assure that they rights will henceforth be respect and those exaction and compulsory levy which formerly so much dishearten they be totally abolish on the other hand a new stimulus will be give by the living example and fresh impulse communicate to the province by other family emigrate and settle there nurture in the spirit and principle of those reform in the idea and maxim of government by which the present era be distinguish a practical participation in these advantage will most assuredly awaken a spirit of enterprise and emulation that may be extremely beneficial to agriculture and as the want of the native increase in proportion as they be enable to know and compare the comfort arise out of the presence and extension of convenience and luxury in they own town they will naturally be lead to possess and adopt they -lrb- plan for progress -rrb- so salutary a change however can only be the work of time and as long as the government confines itself to a system merely protect the effect must consequently be slow as it be therefore necessary to put in action more powerful spring than the ordinary one it will be find expedient partly to relax from some of those general principle which apply to society differently constitute or rather form of other perfectly distinct element as relate to the subject under discussion i fortunately discover two means point out in the law themselves essentially just and at the same time capable of produce in this populous colony more than in any other the desire result the legislator founding himself on the common obligation of the subject to contribute something in return for the protection he receive and to co-operate in the increase of the power and opulence of the state proscribe idleness as a crime and point out labor as a duty and although the regulation touch the native breathe the spirit of humanity and exhibit the wisdom with which they be originally form they nevertheless concur and be direct to this primary object in they the distribution of vacant land as well as of the native at fair daily wages to clear they be universally allow and these it seem to I be the means from a equitable and intelligent application of which the most beneficial consequence may be expect -lrb- confiscate unused land -rrb- the first can not be attend with any great difficulty because all the province abound in waste and vacant land and scarcely be there a district in which some be not to be find of private property completely uncultivated and neglect and consequently susceptible as above state of be legally transfer for this reason alone to the possession of a active owner let they nature however be what it may in they adjudication it be of the greatest importance to proceed with uniformity by consecrate in a most irrevocable manner the solemnity of all similar grant public interest and reason in the philippine island require that in all such case deference only should be pay to demand justly interpose and formally establish within a due and fixed period but after full and public notice have be give by the respective judicial authority of the title about to be grant the counter claim the native may seek to put in after the lapse of the period prefix should be peremptorily disregard although at first sight this appear a direct infringement on the imprescriptible rights of property it must be consider that in some case individual interest ought to be sacrifice to the general good and that the balance use when treat of the affair of state be never of that rigid kind as if apply to those of minor consideration the fact be that by this mean many would be induce to form estate who have hitherto be withhold by the dread of involve themselves and spend they money in law suit at the same time the native gradually accustom themselves to this new order of thing would lay aside that disposition to strife and contention which form so peculiar a trait in they character and that antipathy and odium would also disappear with which they have usually view the agricultural undertaking of spaniard -lrb- compulsory labor -rrb- proceeding to the consideration of the second means of accelerate the improvement of agriculture viz the distribution of the native it will suffice to say that it would be equally easy to show that it be absolutely necessary rigorously to carry into effect in the philippine island whatever the law on this subject prescribed otherwise we must give up all those substantial hope entertain of the felicity of the colony we be no longer in a situation to be restricted to the removal of ordinary obstacle and the season be go by in which as heretofore it enter into we policy to employ no other than indirect stimulant -- in order to incline the filipino to labor it be evident that admonition and offer of reward no longer suffice nor indeed have the advantageous term propose to they by some planter with a view to withdraw the lower order of the native such as the timaua and cagliane plebeian from the idle indifference in which they be sink be of any avail they want and wish be easily supply the whole of they happiness seem to depend on quiet and repose and they highest enjoyment on the pleasure of sleep energy however and a certain degree of severity must be employ if permanent resource be to be call forth and if the progressive settlement of european family and the formation of estate proportion to the fertility of the soil and capability of the country be to enter into the view of government in vain would grant and transfer of vacant and useless land be make to new and enterprising proprietor unless at the same time they can be provide with laborer and experience every other possible facility in order to clear enclose and cultivate they hence follow the indispensable necessity of appeal to the system of distribution as above point out for what class of laborer can be obtain in a country where the whites be so few unless it be the native should they object to personal service should they refuse to labor for a equitable and daily allowance by which mean they would also cease to be burden to the state and to society be they not to be compel to contribute by this mean to the prosperity of which they be member in a word to the public good and thus make some provision for old age if the soldier convey away from he native land submit to danger and be unceasingly expose to death in defense of the state why should not the filipino moderately use he strength and activity in till the field which be to sustain he and enrich the commonwealth -lrb- the undeveloped philippine -rrb- besides thing in the philippine island wear a very different aspect to what they do on the american continent where as authorize by the say law a certain number of native may be impress for a season and send off inland to a considerable distance from they dwelling either for the purpose of agriculture or work the mine provide only they be take care of during they journey maintain and the price of they daily labor as fix by the civil authority regularly pay to they the immense valley and mountain susceptible of cultivation especially in the island of luzon be once settle and the facility of obtain hand increase such legal act of compulsion far from be any longer necessary will have introduce a spirit of industry that will render the labor of the field supportable and even desirable and in this occupation all the tributary native of the surround settlement can be alternately employ by the day or week and thus do they work almost at the door of they own hut and as it be in sight of they wife and child -lrb- no legal obstacle to force labor -rrb- if after what have be above state the apparent opposition obstacle to which at first sight strike the eye in law 40 title 12 book 6 speaking on this subject and expressly refer to the philippine island should be allege no more will be necessary than to study its genuine sense or read it with attention in order to be convince of its perfect concordance with the essential part of the other law of the indy already quote in explanation and support of the system of distribute the laborer the above-mentioned law do indeed contain a strict recommendation to employ the chinese and japanese not domiciliate in preference to the native in the establishment for cut timber and other royal work and further enjoin that use be only to be make in emergency and when the preservation of the state should require it it have however happen that since the remote period at which the above be promulgate not only all contract and commerce have cease but also every communication with japan have be interrupted and for a number of year not a single individual of that ferocious race have exist in the philippine island with regard to the chinese who be suppose to be numerous in the capital of late year they have diminish so much that accord to a census make by order of the government in the year 1807 no more than four thousand seven hundred be find on the register and if in consequence of they secrete themselves or withdraw into the interior a third more might be add to the above amount they total number would still remain very inconsiderable and infinitely inferior to what be require not only for the tillage of the estate but even for the royal work -lrb- substitute laborer want -rrb- as therefore the japanese have totally disappear and the number of chinese be evidently inadequate to the want of agriculture it almost necessarily follow that the practice of distribute the filipino laborer as allow by the aforesaid law of the indy under all circumstance be the only alternate left even if against the adoption of this measure it should be attempt to urge the ambiguous sense of the conclude part of the second clause it would be easy to comprehend its true intent and meaning by refer to law 1 title 13 book 5 which say : that consider the inconvenience which would arise from do away with certain distribution of grounds garden estate and other plantation in which the indian be interested as a matter on which the preservation of those distant dominion and province depend it be ordain that compulsory labor and such distribution as be advantageous to the public good shall continue after so point a explanation and a manifestation so clear of the spirit of we legislation in this respect all further comment would be useless and no doubt whatever can be any longer entertain of the expediency and even of the justice of put the plan of well-regulated distribution in practice as a powerful means to promote the agriculture and secure to spain the possession of these valuable dominion of the indian sea -lrb- manufacture -rrb- it would be impossible to gainsay don juan francisco urroz of the philippine company in he detailed and accurate report to the managing committee in 1802 when he observe : that the philippine island from time immemorial be acquaint with and still retain that species of industry peculiar to the country adapt to the custom and want of the native and which constitute the chief branch of they clothing this although confine to coarse article may in its class be call perfect as far as it answer the end for which it be intend and if a attempt be make to enumerate the quantity of mat handkerchief sheet and a variety of other cloth manufacture for this purpose only in the province of tondo laguna batangas ilocos cagayan camarines albay visaya etc immense supplies of each kind would appear which give occupation to a incalculable number of loom indistinctly work by indian chinese and sangleyan mestizo indeed all the class in they own humble dwelling build of cane and thatched with palm leave without any apparatus of regular manufacture -lrb- native cloth weave -rrb- with equal truth be i enable to add that the natural ability of these native in the manufacture of all kind of cloth fine as well as coarse be really admirable they succeed in reduce the harsh filament of the palm-tree know by the name of abaca to such a degree of fineness that they afterwards convert they into texture equal to the best muslin of bengal the beauty and evenness of they embroidery and open work excite surprise in short the damask table-cloths ornamental weave texture of cotton and palm-fibre intermix with silk and manufacture in the above-mentioned province clearly prove how much the inhabitant of the philippine island in natural ability and dexterity resemble the other people of the asiatic region it must nevertheless be allow that a want be notice of that finish and polish which the perfection of art give to each commodity but this circumstance ought not to appear strange if we consider that entirely devoid of all methodical instruction and ignorant also of the importance of the subdivision of labor which contribute so greatly to simplify shorten and improve the respective excellence of all kind of work the same native gin and clean the cotton and then spin and weave it without any other instrument than they hand and foot aid only by the course and unsightly loom they themselves construct in a corner of they hut with scarcely anything else than a few cane and stick -lrb- aptitude for but no development of manufacturing -rrb- from the precede observation it may easily be deduce that although the native succeed in prepare with admirable dexterity the production of they soil and therewith satisfy the greatest part of they domestic want fact which certainly manifest they talent and aptitude to be employ in work of more taste and delicacy manufacturing industry be nevertheless far from be generalize nor can it be say to be place with any degree of solidity on its true and proper basis hence arise those great supplies of goods annually import into the country for the purpose of make up the deficiency of the local manufacture -lrb- improve method and machinery need -rrb- the regular distribution or classification of the assemblage of operation which follow each other in graduation from the rough preparation of the first material till the same have arrive at they perfect state of manufacture instead of be practice be entirely unknown the want of good machinery to free the cotton from the multitude of seed with which it be encumber so as to perform the operation with ease and quickness be the first and greatest obstacle that occur and its tediousness to the native be so repugnant that many sell they crop to other without separate the seed or decline grow the article altogether not to be plague with the trouble of clean it as the want of method be also equal to the superabundance or waste of time employ the expense of the goods manufacture increase in the same proportion under such evident and great disadvantage for which reason far from be able to compete with those bring from china and british indium they only acquire estimation in the interior when want to supply the place of the latter or in case of accidental scarcity -lrb- scanty export -rrb- in a word the only manufactured article annually export from the philippine island be eight to twelve thousand piece export of light sail cloth two hundred thousand pound of abaca cordage assorted and six hundred carabao hide and deer skin which can scarcely be consider in a tan state \/ for although the royal company from the time of they establishment long continue to export considerable quantity of dimity calico stripe check and coverlid as well as other cotton and silk goods it be more with a view to stimulate the district of iloco to continue in the habit of manufacturing and thus introduce among the inhabitant of that province a taste for industry than the expectation of gain by the sale of this kind of merchandise either in spain or any of the section of america at length wearied with the loss experience by carry on this species of mercantile operation without answer the principal object in view they resolve for the time be to suspend venture attend with such discouraging circumstance -lrb- need of encouragement -rrb- notwithstanding so many impediment it would not however be prudent in the government entirely to abandon the enterprise and lose sight of the advantage the country offer or indeed to neglect turn the habitual facility of the native to some account far from there exist any positive grounds for despair of the progress of manufacture industry it may justly be presume that whenever the sovereign by adopt a different line of policy shall allow the unlimited and indistinct settlement of all kind of foreign colonist and grant they the same facility and protection enjoy by national one they will be induce to flock to the philippine island in considerable number lure by the hope of accumulate fortune in a country that present a thousand attraction of every kind many no doubt will preferably devote themselves to commerce other to agricultural undertaking and also to the pursuit of mining but necessarily some will turn they attention and employ they fund in the formation of extensive manufacture aid by intelligent instructor and suitable machinery the newly-introduced information and art be thus diffuse it be natural to expect they will be progressively adopt by a people already possess a taste and genius for this species of labor by which mean manufacturing industry will soon be raise from the state of neglect and unprofitableness in which it be now leave -lrb- internal commerce handicapped -rrb- the circulation of the country production and effect of all kind among the inhabitant of the province which properly speak constitute they internal commerce be tolerably active and considerable owe to the great facility of conveyance afford by the number of river and lake on the margin of which the filipino be fond of fix they dwelling this commerce might be infinitely greater if it be not obstruct by the monopoly of the magistrate in they respective district and the unjust prerogative exercise by the city of impose rate and arbitrary price on the very person who come to bring the supplies nevertheless as the iniquituous operation of the district magistrate however active they may be besides be restrict by they financial ability regularly consist of arrangement to buy up only the chief article and those which promise most advantage with least trouble as that restless inquietude which impel man on under the hope of better he condition act even amidst rigor of oppression a certain degree of stimulus and scope be still leave in favor of internal trade -lrb- inter-island traffic -rrb- hence it follow that there be scarcely a island or province that do not carry on some traffic or other by keep up relation with its neighbor which sometimes extend as far as the capital where in proportion as the produce and raw material find a ready market return suitable and adequate to the consumption of each place respectively be obtain if however it would be difficult to form a idea even in the way of approximation of the exchange which take place between the various province a task that would render it necessary to enumerate they one by one it be equally so to make a estimate of the total amount of this class of operation carry on in manila they common center situate in the bottom of a immense bay bath by a large river and the country round divide by a infinite number of stream and lake descend from the province by which the capital be surround the produce and effect be daily bring in and go out of suburb so extend in a diversity of small vessel and canoe without its be possible to obtain any exact account of the multiplicity of transaction carry on at one and the same time in a city build on so large a scale -lrb- local market -rrb- besides the traffic found on ordinary consumption the necessity of obtain assortment of home-manufactured as well as import goods in order to supply the market know by the name of tiangui and which be hold weekly in almost every town there be another species of speculation peculiar to the rich native and sangley mestizo a industrious race and also possess of the largest portion of the specie this consist in the anticipated purchase of the crop of indigo sugar rice etc with a view to fix they own price on the produce thus contract for when resell to the second hand a propensity to barter and traffic in all kind of way be indeed universal among the native and as the principal spring which urge on internal circulation be already in motion nothing more be want than at once to destroy the obstacle previously point out and encourage the extension of luxury and comfort in order that by the number of the people 's want be increase as well as the means of supply they the force and velocity of action may in the same proportion be augmented -lrb- external commerce -rrb- under external commerce generally be comprise the relation the philippine island keep up with other nation with the spanish possession in america and with the mother country or in other word the sum total of they import and export -lrb- outside deterrent -rrb- many be the cause which within the last ten or twelve year have influence the mercantile relation of these island and prevent they organization on permanent and known principle the chief one no doubt have be the frequent and unforeseen change from peace to war which have mark that unhappy period and as under similar circumstance merchant more than any other class of person be in the habit of act on extreme there have be occasion in which mislead by the exaggerated idea of the galleon of acapulco and anxious to avail themselves of the first price generally also the highest foreign speculator have inundate manila with goods by a competition from all quarter and other owe to the channel be obstruct when this market have experience a absolute scarcity of commodity as well as of fund necessary to continue the usual and almost only branch of commerce leave the frequent failure of the sugar and indigo crop have also in many instance restrain the north american and other neutral from come to these island with cargo and induce they to prefer java where they be at all time sure of find return besides the influence of these extraordinary cause on the uncertainty and irregularity of external commerce no small share must also be attribute to the strangeness of the peculiar constitution of the country or the principle on which its trade be establish -lrb- domestic discouragement -rrb- scarcely will it be believe in the greater part of civilized europe that a spanish colony exist between asia and america whose merchant be forbid to avail themselves of they advantageous situation and that as a special favor only be they allow to send they effect to mexico once a year but under the follow restriction it be a necessary condition that every shipper shall be a member of the board of trade -lrb- consulado -rrb- and therein entitle to a vote which suppose a residence of some year in the country besides the possession of property of he own to the amount of $ 8000 he be compel to join with the other member in order to be enable to ship he goods in bale of a determined form and dimension in one single vessel arrange fit out and command by officer of the royal navy under the character of a war ship he have also to contribute he proportion of $ 20000 which in the shape of a present be give to the commander at the end of every round voyage he can not in any way interfere in the choice or quality of the vessel notwithstanding he property be to be risk in she and what complete the extravagance of the system be that before anything be do he must pay down twenty-five or forty per cent for freight accord to circumstance which money be distribute among certain canon of the church alderman subaltern of the army and widow of spaniard to whom a give number of ticket or certify permit to ship be grant either as a compensation for the smallness of they pay or in the way of a privilege but on express condition that although they themselves be not member of the board of trade they shall not be allow to negotiate and transfer they to person not have that quality in the custom house nothing be admit unless the number of bale ship be accompany by correspond permit and as it besides frequently happen that there be a degree of competition between the party seek to try they fortune in this way the original holder of the permit very often hang back in such a manner that i have see $ 500 offer for the transfer of a right to ship three bale which scarcely contain goods to the amount of $ 1000 such nevertheless be the truth and such the exact description of the famous acapulco ship which have excite so much jealousy among the merchant of seville and cadiz and give rise to such a infinite number of dispute and lawsuit -lrb- business irregularity -rrb- so complete a deviation from the rule and maxim usually receive in trade could not fail to produce in the philippine island as in fact it have effect equally extraordinary with regard to those who follow this pursuit the merchant of manila be in fact entirely different from the one in cadiz or amsterdam without any correspondent in the manufacturing country and consequently possess of no suitable advice of the favorable variation in the respective market without broker and even without regular book he seem to carry on he profession on no one fix principle and to have acquire he routine of business from mere habit and vague custom he contract be make out on stamped paper and he bill or promissory note no other than long and diffuse writings or bond of which the date and amount be keep more in the shape of bundle than by any due entry on he book and what at once give the most clear idea of this irregularity be the singular fact that for the space of twenty-five and possibly fifty year only one bankrupt have present the state of he affair to the board of trade in conformity to the regulation prescribe by the general statute of bankruptcy whereas number of case have occur in which these merchant have waste or secrete the property of other with impunity hence have arise those irregularity subterfuge and dispute in a word the absence of all mercantile business carry on in a scrupulously punctual and correct manner hence also have follow that distrust and embarrassment with which commercial operation be attend as well as the difficulty of calculate they fluctuation on the other hand as in order to send off a expedition by the annual ship to acapulco the previous consent of the majority of the incorporated merchant be necessary before this point be decide month be pass in intrigue and dispute the peremptory period arrive and if the article want be in the market they be purchase up with precipitation and pay for with the money the shipper have be able to obtain at a interest from the administrator of pious and charitable fund in this manner compel to act almost always without plan or concert yet accustom to gain in the market of acapulco notwithstanding so many impediment and the exorbitant premium pay for the money lend these merchant follow the strange maxim of risk little or no property of they own and unaware or rather disregard the importance of economy in the expense and regularity of they general method of live it be not possible they can ever accumulate large fortune or form solid and well-accredited house -lrb- merchant discourage -rrb- thus oppress by a system as unjust as it be absurd and conduct they affair in the way above describe it be not strange that these gentleman at the same time yield to the indolence consequent on the climate should neglect or behold with indifference all the other secondary resource which the supply the want of the country and the extensive scope and variety of its produce offer to the man of active mind hence it follow as already observe that the whole of the interior trade be at present absorb by the principal native the sangley mestizo of both sex and a few chinese peddler -lrb- the outlook brighten -rrb- notwithstanding however the defective manner in which the generality of the merchant act some already be begin to distinguish themselves by the prudence of they conduct by forwarding in time they order to the manufacturer of indium and china and in other respects guide themselves by the principle which characterize the intelligent merchant finally it be to be presume that as soon as the government shall have throw down this singular and preposterous system that have be the cause of so many disorder and proclaim the unlimited freedom of philippine commerce the greater part of these people will rise up from the state of inaction in which they now live and the relation of the colony will then assume the course and extent correspond to its advantage of position at least if we national merchant should not act up to the impulse give to all kind of mercantile enterprise by the beneficial hand of the sovereign foreigner will not be want who rely on due toleration will be induce to convey they fortune and family to the philippine island and vigorously encourage the exportation of they valuable production amply secure the fruit of they laudable activity and well-combined speculation -lrb- capital employ in commerce -rrb- be a person judge from the number constitute the body of register merchant and suppose all of they to possess the essential requisite prescribe by we commercial regulation to form a prudent estimate of the amount of capital employ by they he calculation would turn out extremely erroneous for besides the case with which regulation of this kind be elude many be merely nominal trader and there be other whose mercantile existence be purely artificial for they be sustain in a temporary manner by means of a forced species of circulation peculiar to this country this consist in obtain the acquiescence of the administrator of pious and charitable fund let out at interest to renew the bond they hold during other successive risk wait as it be till some fatal tempest have swallow up the vessel in which these merchant suppose they property to be embark and at once cancel all they obligation on the other hand neither excessive expense nor the shipment of large quantity of goods to acapulco can in any way be take as a just criterion whereby to judge of the fortune of individual because in the first there be great uniformity every one more or less enjoy exteriorly the same easy circumstance notwithstanding the disparity of real property and in the second considerable fiction prevail many person ship under the same mark and even when the shipper stand alone he might have be provide with the necessary fund from the pious and charitable establishment possibly without risk a dollar of he own in the whole operation under circumstance so dubious far from presume to give a decide opinion on the subject i be compel to judge from mere conjecture and guide only by the knowledge and experience i have be able to acquire during my long residence there in conformity thereto i be incline to believe that the total amount of capital belong to and employ in the trade of the philippine island do not at present exceed two and a half million dollar with evident sign of rapid decline if the merchant do not in time abandon the ruinous system of chiefly carry on they speculation with money obtain at interest -lrb- large sum hoard -rrb- the two and a half million dollar thus attribute to the merchant form however the smaller part of the fund distribute among the other class and the total amount of the circulate medium of the colony might be consider a object sufficiently worthy of be ascertain owe to the great light it would throw on the present state of the inhabitant but it be in vain to attempt any calculation of the kind at least without the aid of datum possess a certain degree of accuracy the only thing that can be affirm be that during the period of more than two hundred and fifty year which have elapse since the conquest the ingress of specie into the philippine island have be constant they annual ship have seldom come from new spain without bring considerable sum in return and if some of they have be lose many other without be confine to the one million of dollar constitute the ordinary amount of the permit have not unfrequently come back with triple that sum for which reason there be ample grounds of judge the estimate correct which fix the total importation of dollar during the whole of that long period of year to be equal to four hundred million it may further be observe that as in the sangley mestizo economy and avarice compete with intelligence and activity in accumulate wealth and as they be scatter among the principal island and in possession of the best land and the most lucrative business of the interior there be ample motive for presume that these industrious and sagacious people have gradually although incessantly amass immense sum in specie but it would be impossible to point out they amount distribution or the secret place in which they be hoard -lrb- pious and charitable fund ' capital -rrb- the assemblage of pious legacy temporality and other fund and property place under the care of several administrative committee for purpose as well religious as charitable constitute the chief capital employ in external trade and notwithstanding the failure which from time to time occur the subsequent accumulation of the enormous premium obtain for fund lay out in maritime speculation both in time of peace and war not only suffice to make up all loss of the above kind but also to secure the punctual payment of such charitable pension and other charge as be to be deduct from the respective profit of this species of stock its total amount accord to a official report make by order of the head committee of the sink fund include temporality and queen marium of austrium 's endowment for the college of las marianas together with other fund of the same kind not comprehend in the decree of abolition at the commencement of the year 1809 amount to $ 2470390 and as the sea-risk of that and the following year be successful and the outstanding amount punctually recover the aggregate sum arise out of the above description of property may now be estimate at more than three million of these fund three distribution be generally make viz one part be appropriate to the china risk at from twelve to eighteen per cent premium accord to circumstance and also those to madras calcutta and batavia at from sixteen to twenty-two per cent the second which generally be in the largest proportion be employ in risk to acapulco at various premium from 27 to 45 per cent and the third be leave in hand as a kind of guarantee of the stability of the original endowment -lrb- covet by spanish treasury -rrb- in the great exigency of the royal treasury experience during the last year of the administration of sr soler the royal decree of consolidación be extend to the philippine island under the pretext of guard the fund belong to public charity and religious endowment sea-risk the income of which when secure on good mortgage do not generally exceed five per cent many in spain not yield above four but the remarkable difference between this plan and the one above describe together with various and other weighty reason allege by the administrator cause the dreaded effect of this new regulation to be suspend and whilst the head committee of manila be consult they doubt and request fresh instruction from the court at home order come out not to make any alteration in measure relate to this description of property -lrb- easy capital but lessen profit -rrb- accustom in they limited calculation to identify the resource offer by the fund belong to this class of establishment with the very existence of the colony the needy merchant easily confound they personal with the general interest and few stop to consider that the identical means of carry on trade without any capital of they own although they have accidentally enrich a small number of person eventually have absorb the principal profit and possibly be the chief cause of the unflourishing state of the colony at large without fear the charge of rashness it may in fact be assert that if these charity and pious endowment have never exist public prosperity in the philippine island would as in other part have be the immediate effect of the unite effort of the individual member of the community and of the experience acquire in the constant prosecution of the same object as however a progress of this kind although certain must necessarily have be at first extremely slow and as on the other hand the preference give to mercantile operation undertake with the fund belong to public charity have its origin in the assemblage of vice so remarkable in the very organization of the body of philippine merchant any new measure on this subject might be deem inconsistent that at once deprive they of the use of resource on which they have be accustom to rely without remove those other defect which excuse if not encourage the continuation of the present system without therefore appeal to violent remedy it be to be hope that in order to render plan of reform effectual it will be sufficient under more propitious circumstance to see property bring from other country to these island as well as person come to settle in they capable of manage it with that intelligence and economy require by trade the competition of those who speculate at random would then cease or what be the same as money obtain at a premium could not then be lay out with the same advantage by the merchant as if it be they own it will be necessary to renounce the fallacious profit hold out by the public charity till at least they be place on a level with exist circumstance and bring in to be of real service to the honorable planter and laborious merchant in they accidental exigency cease to be as hitherto the indirect cause of idleness dissipation and the ruin of a infinite number of family -lrb- mercantile shipping -rrb- the vessel which the district magistrate of the province employ in carry on they trade with the capital and those belong to some of the richer merchant together with such as be own by the native and mestizo on a approximate calculation amount to twelve thousand ton include ship brig schooner galley barge etc for the want of better datum this estimate be found only on reasonable conjecture aid by the advice of experienced person for although the greatest part of these vessel be build by the native in the neighborhood of they own town no register be keep of they number and dimension nor do they carry with they the usual certificate those belong to the merchant that be ship and brig of a certain size have already begin to frequent the port of china java the coast of coromandel bengal and the isle of france avail themselves of the lucrative freight which formerly enriched and encouraged foreign ship the other class of vessel although perfectly adequate to the coast trade can not in general be apply to larger enterprise on account of they not be sufficiently strong and capacious the seaman be not apprentice or as it be usually call matriculate but they frequent cross from island to island they familiarity with regional tempest voyage to various part of america and the occupation of fishing follow by the inhabitant of the coast serve to train up a large body of dexterous and able mariner who at all time can be have without any compulsion to complete the crew -lrb- need of nautical school -rrb- the want of a public school for the teaching of navigation be however sensibly feel as well as great inconvenience from the scarcity of person capable of be trust with the command of vessel and the ignorance that prevail of the water of this dangerous archipelago repeat royal order have be send over for the board of trade to proceed to the institution of so useful a establishment and in the meantime a medium have be resort to in order to supply the deficiency by allow the free admission of foreign mate provide they exhibit proof of they acquaintance with navigation and profess the catholic worship shipowner nevertheless experience great difficulty particularly at time when the acapulco ship be fitting out for although she be consider as a vessel of war and command by officer of the royal navy the plan of she equipment be so singular that in addition she require the extra aid of one chief mate and three under one -lrb- royal phillipine company -rrb- the various modification this corporate body have successively experience have in great measure change the essence of its original constitution and the remonstrance of its director found on the experience of a long series of year at length induce the government at home to sanction alteration dictate by exist circumstance the project of raise these island from the neglect state in which they be and in some measure to place they in contact with the mother country accompany by a wish to give a new and great impulse to the various branch of industry which constitute the importance of a colony could not have be more laudable but as be afterwards see the instrument employ be not adequate to the object in view at the same time that the company be charge to promote and by means of they fund to vivify the agriculture and industry of these province the necessary power and facility to enable they to reap the fruit of they sacrifice be withhold the protection grant to this establishment do not go beyond a general recommendation in favor of its enterprise and in short far from enjoy the exclusive preponderance obtain at they commencement by all the other asiatic company that of the philippine island labor under particular disadvantage -lrb- local progress under adverse condition -rrb- notwithstanding a organization so imperfect scarcely have the agent of the new company arrive at manila when they distribute through the country they numerous dependent commission to encourage the native by advance of money they establish subaltern factory in the province of iloco bataan cavite and camarine purchase land deliver out agricultural implement found manufactury of cotton cloth contract for the crop of produce at very high price offer reward and in short they put in motion every partial resource they be able to avail themselves of and they limited means allow it would be extremely easy for I in this place to enter a particular enumeration of the important service of this kind render by the company and to exhibit in the most evident point of view the advantage thence derive to these island if besides be slightly touch upon in the precede article this task have not be already ably perform by the factor don juan francisco urroz in he accurate report on this subject address to the govern committee of the company in 1803 in justice i will nevertheless observe that this establishment anxiously resolve to attain the end propose in spite of so many obstacle constantly follow up its expensive system without be dishearten nor do the contrariety with which the royal audiencium or high court of justice frequently paralyze its plan the indifference of the governor or the general opposition and jealousy of the other class in any way tend to relax its effort till at length convinced of the impossibility of successfully contend alone and without any other arm than its own reduce capital and on the other hand well aware that a political body of this kind in vain seek to unite within itself the triple and opposite character of agriculturalist manufacturer and merchant a determination be take to alter the plan and withdraw the factory establish in the province and by adopt a rigid economy and confine the operation in future to the purchase of such produce and manufacture article as suit they trade and be voluntarily bring by the native to they store the expense of the company be curtail and a plan of reform introduce into all they speculation by this mean also they always secure a advantageous vent for the production of the country after have be the chief spring by which agriculture be promote and encourage in a direct manner -lrb- handicapped in outside trade -rrb- the most beneficial reform however introduce by this establishment into its system have in reality be derive from the variation or rather correction of its plan and enterprise purely maritime the government be desirous to increase the relation of this colony by every possible means and to convert it into a common center of all the operation of the new company at first require of the agent that the purchase and collection of goods from the coast of coromandel bengal and china destine for spain should take place at manila either by purchase the article in that market or through the medium of previous contract to deliver they there from this it be easy to infer that the company be infallibly expose to the harsh term the respective contractor seek to impose upon they as well with regard to price as quality unless in many case they prefer be leave without the necessary assortment hence may it without the smallest exaggeration be affirm that sum up all the surcharge under which the shipment leave the port of manila and compare they with those which might have be send direct from the above-mentioned point and without so extraordinary a détour as the one prescribe by law the difference that follow in the prime cost of the cargo be not less than 80 per cent the urgent manner however in which the director of the company do not cease to deplore and complain of so evident a hardship at length have the desire effect and after exist ten or twelve year so preposterous a system be successfully overthrow and permission obtain from the king for the establishment of spanish factory in the neighborhood of the china and indium manufacture as well as the power of address shipment direct to those foreign dominion the enlighten policy of they respective government do not allow they to hesitate in give a favorable reception to we factor and vessel and the purchase and shipment of asiatic goods be thus realize without the old obstruction the company be reasonably lead to hope be able soon to increase its operation and progressively present more satisfactory result to the shareholder when those political convulsion succeed soon after which have unhinge or destroy all the ordinary relation of trade compel they to abandon they hope till the wished-for calm should be again restore -lrb- temporary expedient of 1803 -rrb- in consequence of the new character and route give to the commercial enterprise of the company as authorize by a royal decree of July 12 1803 the function of the manila factor be reduce to the annual shipment of a cargo of asiatic goods to peru value at $ 500000 but only as long as the war last and till the expiration of the extraordinary permit grant through the goodness of the king and also to the transmit to china and bengal of the specie bring from america and the collect of certain quantity of indigo sugar or other produce of the island with a view to gain by resell it in the same market consequently the moment thing return to they pacific and ordinary course will be the period when the necessity of the future existence of this establishment will cease or at least when the propriety will be evident of its reform or assimilation to the other commission house carry on trade in vera cruz mexico etc which not be hire establishment do not create expense when they cease to transact business -lrb- competition of foreign merchant -rrb- against a measure of this kind it would be useless to allege that by the exclusive privilege to introduce spirit and european effect into the colony the company have contract the obligation of always keep it properly supply that they very institution have for the basis the general improvement of the island and in order duly to comply with these duty it become indispensably necessary to keep up the present expensive establishment for in the first place in order to render it incumbent on the company to introduce a indefinite quantity of european article it previously would be necessary to provide a vent for they and this can never be the case unless the exclusion of all competitor in the market be rigorously carry into effect as thing now be the north american english french and every other nation that wish openly usurp this privilege by constantly inundate the island with spirit and all kind of effect and it be very evident that this same abuse which authorize the infraction of the above privilege if in that light it could in any way be consider totally exonerate the company from all obligation by they contract under a different understanding besides the circumstance which have take place since the publication of the royal decree create the above establishment into a corporate body in the year 1785 have entirely change the order establish in this respect in the first place the port of manila have be open to foreign nation in consequence of the disinterested representation of the company itself and for the direct advantage of general trade nor be it necessary to prevent we new guest from abuse the facility thus grant to they and much less to confine they to the mere introduction of asiatic goods the original plea make use of in the second as soon as the inhabitant of the philippine island become familiar with the more useful and elegant object of convenience and luxury which they be enable to purchase from foreigner at reasonable price it be natural for they to pay little regard to the superfluous aid of the company more particularly when the latter be no longer able to sustain the competition either in the sale or supply of a multitude of article which thanks to we own national simplicity be scarcely know in spain whence they outward-bound cargo be divide hence it follow that far from the importation and supplies of the company be miss it may with great reason be presume that this formal renunciation of this ideal privilege of theirs must rather have contribute to secure in a permanent manner adequate supplies for all the want and whim of the inhabitant of the colony and that the publicity of such a determination would act as a fresh allurement successively to bring to the port of manila a host of foreign speculator anxious to avail themselves of a fresh opening for commercial pursuit -lrb- company not a philanthropy -rrb- the other objection found on the mistaken notion of its be inherent in and belong to the very essence of the company to promote the general improvement of the philippine island if well consider will appear equally unjust it be in fact a ridiculous although too generally receive a prejudice to suppose that the founder of this establishment propose to themselves the plan of sink the money of the shareholder in clear the land and perfect the rude manufacture of these distant island to imagine this to have be one of the principal object of the institution or to suppose that on this hard condition they various privilege and exemption be grant to they be so far from the reality of the fact that it would only be necessary to read with attention the 26th article of the quote royal decree of creation in order more correctly to comprehend the origin and constitutive system of this political body the latter say the duke de almodovar be reduce to two principal point : the first of which be the carrying of the trade of asia with that of america and europe and the second the encouragement and improvement of the production and manufacture industry of the island the one be the essential attribute of the company constitute its real character of a mercantile society and in the other respect it become a auxiliary of the government to whom the duty allude to more immediately belong if to the above we add the preamble of the 43rd article of the new decree of 1803 the recommendation make to the company to contribute to the prosperity of the agriculture and manufacturing industry of the island will appear as a limited and secondary consideration for even if the question be carry to extreme it could never extend to any more than the application of four per cent of the annual profit of the company indistinctly to both branch if however any doubt still remain the explanation or solution recently give to this question would certainly remove they because by the simple fact of its be express in the latter part of the aforesaid 43rd article -lrb- profit percent to go to spain -rrb- that the above-mentioned four per cent be to be lay out with the king 's approbation in behalf of the agriculture and manufacturing industry of spain and the philippine island it be clear that the king reserve and appropriate to himself the investment of the amount to be deduct from the general dividend in order to apply it where and how may be deem most advisable consequently far from consider the company in that respect under a obligation to contribute to the improvement of the philippine exclusively the only thing that can be require of they when they charter be withdraw be the repayment to the royal treasury of the four per cent on they profit for a purpose so vaguely define in follow up this same train of argument it would seem that in order to render the amount to be deduct from the eventual profit of the company in the course of time a productive capital in the hand of the sovereign the fund of the society not only ought not to be divert to the continuation of project which consume they but on the contrary it be necessary to place at they disposal the direct means by which these fund can be increase in order to make up to the company in some measure the enormous loss experience of late year and at once free they commerce from the shackle with which it have hitherto be obstruct -lrb- need of special privilege -rrb- finally after twenty-four year of impotent and gratuitous effort in the philippine and of the most obstinate opposition on the part of they rival it be now time for the company by give up the ungrateful struggle to reform in every respect they expensive establishment in manila and to direct they principal endeavor to carry into effect the project so imperfectly trace out in the new decree of 1803 the opinion of the most vehement enemy of the privileged body tacitly approve this exception in they favor adam smith avowedly hostile to all monopoly feel himself compel to confess that without the incentive which exclusive company offer to the individual of a nation carry on little trade possibly they confine capital would cease to be destine to the remote and uncertain enterprise which constitute a commerce with the east indy -lrb- spanish commerce in its infancy -rrb- we commerce compare with that of other nation notwithstanding what may be say on this subject be most assuredly yet in a state of infancy that with asia more especially with the exception of the royal company be almost unknown to all other class if it be therefore wish to exclude we many rival from so lucrative a branch of trade as that which constitute supplies for the consumption of the peninsula and its dependency the means be obvious the most material fact be in fact already do the navigation to the various port of asia be familiar to the company 's navy they factor and clerk have acquire a practical knowledge of that species of trade essential to the undertaking as well as such information as be at first unknown but after the great misfortune this body have experience it will be indispensably necessary to aid and invigorate they with large supplies of money follow the example of other government in similar case in order that the successful issue of they future operation may compensate they past loss and worthily correspond with the magnitude of the object -lrb- philippine a burden to spain -rrb- this asiatic colony although consider as confer great lustre on the crown and name of we monarch by exhibit the vast extent of the limit of he dominion have in reality be during a long series of year a true burden to the government or at least a possession whose chief advantage have redound in favor of other power rival of we maritime importance notwithstanding all that have be say on the score of real utility certain it be that the philippine establishment have cost the treasury large sum of money although within the last twenty-five or thirty year it must be confess that the public revenue have experience a considerable increase and of itself have become a object of some consequence to the state -lrb- profit from tobacco monopoly and foreign trade -rrb- among the various cause which have contribute to produce so favorable a alteration the chief one have be the establishment of the tobacco monopoly on behalf of the crown and the opening of the port of manila to the flag of other nation at peace with spain the first have considerably increase the entry into the public treasury and the second have tend to multiply the general mass of mercantile operation independent of the other beneficial effect this last measure must have produce in a country whose resource trade and consumption have from the time of the conquest experience the fatal shackle impose by jealousy and ignorance -lrb- improvement in public finances -rrb- the improve aspect the colony soon assume by the introduction of this new system as be natural awaken the attention of minister and induce they more easily to consent to the measure subsequently propose to they principally intend to place those distant dominion on a footing of permanent security so as to enable they to repel any fresh attempt on the part of a enemy as however the production of the country increase the public expense also become greater although always in a much smaller proportion with the exception of the interval between the year 1797 and 1802 when the government fearful of a second invasion be compel at its own expense to provide against the danger with which these island be then threaten if therefore as appear from the official report of the treasurer-general larzabal in my possession the receipt at the treasury in 1780 amount only to $ 700000 include the situado or annual allowance for the expense of government send from new spain and after the ordinary charge of administration have be pay a surplus of $ 170000 remain in the hand of the treasurer at present we have the satisfaction to find that the revenue be equal to $ 262517650 and the expense do not exceed $ 217973187 by which mean a annual surplus of $ 44544462 be leave applicable to the payment of the debt contract during the extraordinary period above mention now reduce to about $ 900000 and afterwards transferable to the general fund belong to the crown -lrb- economy over spanish-american colonial administration -rrb- with regard to the administrative system it be in every respect similar to the one observe in we government of america with this difference only that in the philippine island greater economy prevail in salary as well as in the number of person employ in former time the establishment of intendency or board of administration be deem expedient in manila iloco camarine iloilo and cebu but they be soon afterwards reform or rather lay aside on account of they be deem superfluous i would venture to state the grounds on which this opinion be then form but as the sphere in which the king 's revenue act in these island increase and extend which naturally will be the case if the plan and improvement dictate by the present favorable circumstance be carry into effect i do not hesitate to say that it will be necessary again to appeal to the establishment of a greater number of board for the management and collection of the various branch of the revenue whether they be call intendency or by any other name as it will be extremely difficult for the administration to do its duty on the confine and inadequate plan under which it be at present organize -lrb- fiscal system -rrb- under its existing form it be constitute in the follow manner : the governor of the island in he quality of superintendent or administrator general and as unite in himself the power of intendent of the army preside at the board of administration of the king 's revenue which be place in the immediate charge of a treasurer and two clerk the principal branch have they respective general director on whom the provincial administrator depend and the civil magistrate in the quality of sub-delegate collect within they respective district the tribute pay by the native in money and produce and manage everything else relate to the king 's revenue in ordinary case the general law of the indy govern and especially be the ordinance or regulation of the intendent of new spain -lrb- mexico -rrb- order to be observe in the philippine it ought further to be observe that in these island the same as in all the vice-royalty and government of america there be a distinct body of royal decree in force which in themselves constitute a code of considerable size -lrb- opposition to tobacco monopoly -rrb- the process of convert the consumption of tobacco into a monopoly meet with a most obstinate resistance on the part of the inhabitant and the greatest circumspection and constancy be necessary for the governor don josé basco to carry this arduous enterprise into effect accustom to the cultivation of this plant without any restriction whatever and habituate to its use from they infancy it appear to the people the extreme of rashness to seek simultaneously to extirpate it from the face of the greatest part of the island of luzon in order to confine its culture within the narrow limit of a particular district they be equally revolt at the idea of give to a common article a high and arbitrary value when besides it have become one of the first necessity every circumstance however be dispassionately consider and the principle once admit that it be expedient for the colony to maintain itself by mean the least burdensome to the inhabitant it certainly must be acknowledge that although odious on account of its novelty and defective in the mode of its execution a resource more productive and at the same time less injurious could not have be devise hence be it that the partisan of the opposite system be strangely mislead by found they calculation on false datum when they allege that a substitute equivalent to the increase revenue suppose to arise out of the monopoly of tobacco might have be resort to by order a proportionate rise in the branch of tribute in fact no one who have the least experience in matter of this kind can be ignorant of the open repugnance the native have always evince to the payment of the ordinary head-tax -lrb- cedulum -rrb- and the broil to which its collection have give rise besides if well examine no theory be more defective and more oppressive on account of the disparity with which it operate than this same wrongly-boasted impost for however desirous it may be to simplify the method of collect the general revenue of a state if the best plan be to be adopt that be if public burden be to be render the least obnoxious it be necessary preferably to embrace the system of indirect contribution in which class to a certain degree the monopoly of all those article may be consider as include which be not rigorously of the first necessity and only compel the individual to contribute when he own will induce he to become a consumer -lrb- doubling of insular revenue thru tobacco -rrb- let this be as it may certain it be that to governor basco we be indebted for have double the annual amount of the revenue of these island by merely render the consumption of tobacco subservient to the want of the crown it be he who place these island in the comfortable situation of be able to subsist without be dependent on external supplies of money to meet the exigency of government it ought however to be remark that although they have be in the habit of receive the annual allowance of $ 250000 for which a stand credit be open by the government at home on the general treasury of new spain considerable sum have nevertheless on various occasion be remit from the philippine to spain through the channel of the captain-general \* \* \* if these remittance have be suspend for some year past it have evidently be owe to the imperious necessity of apply the ordinary proceeds of the revenue as well as other extraordinary means to unforeseen contingency arise out of peculiar circumstance -lrb- tobacco belt -rrb- the planting and cultivation of tobacco be now confine to the district of gapan in pampanga province to that of cagayan and to the small island of marinduque the amount of the crop raise in the above three point and sell to the king may on a average be estimate at fifty thousand bale grow in the follow proportion : gapan forty-seven thousand bale cagayan two thousand and marinduque one thousand this stock resell at the monopoly price yield a sum equal to about one million of dollar and deduct therefrom the prime cost and all other expense legally chargeable on this branch the net proceeds in favor of the revenue amount to $ 550000 or upward of one hundred twenty-two per cent this profit be so much more secure as it rest on the positive fact that however great the quantity of the article sell furtively and by evade the vigilance of the guard as the demand and consumption be excessive and always exceed the stock on hand a ready sale can not fail to be have for all the stock place in the hand of the agent of the monopoly from this it may also be infer how much the net proceeds of this branch would be increase if without venture too far in extend the plantation and consequent purchase care be take to render the supplies more proportionate to the consumption for by a clear profit of one hundred twenty-two per cent fall on a larger capital it follow that a corresponding result would be obtain in a word the sale far from decline or be in any way deem precarious be susceptible of a great increase consequently this branch of revenue merit the serious attention of government beyond all other -lrb- defective sale system -rrb- it be however to be lament that instead of every facility be give to the sale of tobacco and the consumption thus encourage the public meet with great difficulty and experience such frequent obstacle and deficiency in the supplies that with truth it may also be say the sale be affect in spite of the administrator themselves in the capital alone it be a generally receive opinion that a third part more would there be consume if instead of compelling the purchaser to receive the tobacco already manufacture or fold he be allow to take it from the store in its primitive state and if the minor establishment in the province be constantly supply with good quality a infinitely larger quantity might be sell and by this mean a great deal of smuggling also prevent such however be the neglect and irregularity in this department that it frequently happen in town somewhat distant from manila no other tobacco be to be meet with than what the smuggler sell and if perchance any be to be find in the monopoly store it be usually of the worst quality that can be imagine -lrb- loss from preventable cause -rrb- i pass over in silence the other defect gradually introduce as evil in a greater or lesser degree inseparable from this part of public administration in every country in which it have be deem necessary to establish monopoly but i can not refrain from again insist on the urgency with which those in power ought to devote themselves firmly and diligently to the destruction of abuse which have hitherto paralyze the progress of the branch in question because i be well persuade that whenever corresponding means be adopt it will be possible in a short time to double the proceeds what these means be it be not easy nor indeed essential to particularize in a rapid sketch like this of the lead feature and present state of the philippine island i shall therefore merely remark that it will be in vain to wish the person engage in the management of this department to exert they real zeal and sincerely co-operate in the view of government as long as they be not place beyond the necessity of follow other pursuit and gain a livelihood in another way in a word unless they have a salary assign they correspond to the confidence and value of the important object entrust to they charge no plan of reform can be render efficient -lrb- abuse by revenue officer -rrb- at the same time step be take to augment the revenue arise out of tobacco it would be desirable as much as possible to improve the method use with regard to those who gather in the crop by endeavor to relieve they from the heavy condition impose upon they condition which besides expose they to the odious effect of revenue-law by they very nature bring upon they many unpleasant consequence and often total ruin in order that a correct opinion may be form of these defect it will suffice to observe that under pretext of prevent smuggling the guard and they agent watch visit and if i may use the expression live among the plantation from the moment the tobacco-seedling appear above ground till the crop be gather in after compelling the filipino planter to cut off the head of the stem in order that the plant may not become too luxurious the surveyor then proceed to set down not only the number of plant cultivate on each estate but even the very leave of each distinguish they six quality in order to call the farmer to account respectively when they make a defective delivery into the general store in the latter case they be compel to prove the death of the plant and even to account for the leaf miss when count over again under the penalty of be expose to the rigor of the revenue law -lrb- burdensome and unprofitable inspection -rrb- it can not indeed be deny that by this mean two important object be attain at one and the same time the one the gradual improvement of the tobacco and the other the greater difficulty of secrete the article but on the other hand how great be the inconvenience incur independent of the singularity and consequent oppression of a regulation of this kind as well as its too great minuteness and complication it be attend with very considerable expense and render it necessary to keep on foot a whole army of guard and clerk who tyrannize over and harass the people without any real motive for such great scrupulosity and profusion i make this observation because i can not help think that the same result might nearly be obtain by adopt a more simple and better regulate system i be not exactly aware of the one follow in the island of cuba but as far as i understand the matter it be simply reduce to this : the grower there merely present they bale to the inspector and if pronounce to be sound and good the stipulate amount be pay over to they but if the quality be bad the whole be invariably burnt thus all sale detrimental to the public revenue be prevent and i do not see why the same step could not be take in the philippine island it must not however be understand that i presume to speak in a decisive tone on a subject so extremely delicate and that require great practical information which i readily acknowledge i do not possess i merely wish by means of these slight hint to contribute to the commencement of a reform in abuse and to promote the adoption of a plan that may have for basis the relief of the grower and at the same time advance the prosperity of this part of the royal revenue -lrb- coco and nipa wine monopoly -rrb- the monopoly of coco and nipa or palm-wine be a branch of public revenue of sufficient magnitude to merit the second place among the resource render available to the expenditure of these island convert into a monopoly some year ago in like manner as the consumption of tobacco it have experience several change in its plan of administration this be at one time carry on for account of the king at other by the privilege be let out at auction till at length the board of control convinced of the great profit gain by the contractor resolve at once to take the direction of this departure under they own charge and make arrangement for its better administration have with this view establish general deposit and licensed house for the sale of native wine with proper superintend clerk they soon begin to reap the fruit of so judicious a determination in 1780 the privilege of sell the coco and nipa wine be farm out to the highest bidder for no more than $ 45200 and subsequently the increase have be so great owe to the improvement adopt that at present net proceeds equal to $ 200000 on a average may be rely upon in proof of this the proceeds of this branch in the year 1809 may be quote when the total balance receive at the treasury after all expense have be pay amount to $ 221426 in the follow manner : administration of manila and district $ 201250 administration of la pampanga and district 12294 administration of pangasinan and district 7882 -- $ 221426 the prime cost and other expense that year amount to no more than $ 168557 by which mean on the whole operation a net profit of thirteen and one-half per cent result in favor of the treasury -lrb- wine monopoly district -rrb- the monopoly of native wine comprehend the whole of the island of luzon except the province of cagayan zambale nueva ecija camarine and albay and be under the direction of three administrator who act independently of each other in they respective district and have at they disposal a competent number of guard these administrator receive in the licensed establishment the coco and nipa wine at price stipulate by the grower that of the coco be pay for at the rate of two dollar per jar contain twenty ganta equal to twelve arroba seven azumbre and half a cuartillo castilian measure and at fourteen real in the place nearest the depot the nipa wine be lay at six and one-half real the jar indistinctly price which although extremely low be still consider advantageous by the filipino themselves more particularly when it be besides understand that from the circumstance of they be grower of this article they be exempt from military service as well as several other tax and public charge -lrb- coco-wine -rrb- the coco-wine be a weak spirit obtain in the follow manner : the tree that produce this fruit be crown by a assemblage of large flower or corolla from the center or calix of which issue a fleshy stem fill with juice the indian cut the extremity of this stem and incline the remainder in a lateral manner introduce it into a large hollow tube which remain suspended and be find full of sweet and sticky liquor which the tree in this manner yield twice in every twenty-four hour -lrb- tuba -rrb- this liquid call tuba in the language of the country be allow to ferment for eight day in a large vessel and afterwards distil by the indian in they uncouth still which be no other than large boiler with a head make of lead or tin render tight by means of clay and with a pipe frequently make out of a simple cane which convey the spirit to the receive vessel without pass like the serpentine tube use in ordinary still through the cooling vat which so greatly tend to correct the vice of a too quick evaporation the tuba obtain in level and hot situation be much more spirituous than that produce in cold and shady place in the first six jar of juice be sufficient to yield one of spirit and in the latter as many as eight be requisite a much greater number however would be want to rectify this spirit so as to render it equal to what be usually know by holland proof i be not positively certain what degree of strength the coco-brandy or as it be usually call coco-wine possess but it be evidently inferior to the weakest make in spain from the juice of the grape the only circumstance require for it to be approve of and receive into the monopoly-store be its be easily ignite by the application of a light candle -lrb- nipa brandy -rrb- the nipa be a small tree of the class of palm which grow in a very bushy form and multiply and prosper greatly on the margin of river and watery tract of land the tuba or juice be extract from the tree whilst in its flowering state in the same way as that of the coco and afterwards distil by a similar process but it be more spirituous from six to six and a half jar be sufficient to yield one of wine the great difference remark in the price of these two species of liquor arise out of the great number of use to which the fruit of the cocal or coco tree be applicable and the increase of expense and labor requisite to obtain the juice owe to the great height of the plant and the frequent danger to which the caritone or gatherer be expose in pass from one tree to another which they do by slide along a simple cane -lrb- bamboo -rrb- -lrb- little drunkenness -rrb- the impost on or rather monopoly of native wine be in itself little burdensome to the community as it only fall on the lower and most dissipate order in society and for this reason it be not susceptible of the same increase as that of tobacco of which the use be more general and now become a object of the first necessity the native of the philippine island be by nature so sober that the spectacle of a drunken man be seldom notice in the street in the capital where the most corrupt class of they reside it be admirable to see the general abstinence from a vice that degrade the human species the consumption of the coco and nipa wine be nevertheless considerable for it be use in all they festivity cock-fight game marriage etc accordingly if it be desire to augment the annual sale of these liquor no way could be more efficient than to increase the number of they festive meeting and seek pretext to encourage public diversion so long as these do not go contrary to the well-regulated order of society and conflict with the duty of those who be intrust with its superintendence -lrb- extension of monopoly urge -rrb- i be still of opinion however that without rest the prosperity of this branch of the public revenue on principle possess of so immoral a tendency it might be render more productive to the treasury if the monopoly could be introduce into the other district adapt to its establishment by this i mean to say that as hitherto the monopoly have be partial and enforce more in the way of a trial than in a general and permanent manner much remain to be do and consequently great scope be leave for improvement in this department of the public revenue this most assuredly may be attain if all the local circumstance and impediment more or less superable which the matter itself present be only take into due account and proper exertion make to study and discover the various indirect means of increase the total mass of contribution by apply a system more productive and analogous to the nature of the philippine island with regard to the revenue of the two particular article above treat on i merely wish to make it understand that far from introduce by means of the monopoly a new vice into the province in which i recommend its establishment it would rather act in a certain degree at least as a corrective to pre-existing evil and the government would derive advantage from a article of luxury by subject its consumption to the same shackle under which it stand in the northern province where its administration be establish and carry on for account of the royal treasury -lrb- former custom usage -rrb- in former time when only vessel belong to the asiatic nation visit the port of manila with effect from the coast of coromandel or the china junk and now and then a spanish vessel come from or go to the island of java with spice for account of philippine merchant the receipt of duty be leave in charge of a single royal officer and the valuation of merchandise make by he in concert with two merchant name by the government but with the knowledge and assistance of the king 's attorney-general the modification and change which have subsequently take place in this department have however be frequent as be evidently show by the historical extract from the proceedings institute before the council of the indy by the merchant of seville and cadiz in opposition to those of the philippine island print in madrid 1736 in folio by order of the say council but as it do not enter into my view to speak of time so remote i shall confine my remark to this branch consider under its present form -lrb- custom house -rrb- in conformity to royal order of march 15 and may 5 1786 the royal custom house of manila be definitively organize on its new plan and from 1788 be place under the immediate charge of a administrator-general a controller a treasurer aid by a competent number of guard inspector etc and in every respect regulate on the plan establish in the other custom house the freedom of the port be grant to foreign nation a privilege before enjoy only by those purely asiatic and a new line of trade commence by the company the competition in merchandise soon begin to increase as well as the revenue arise therefrom in such manner that although the exportation of goods be limit to the cargo of the acapulco ship of which the duty be not payable till she arrival there notwithstanding also the property import by the company from china and indium and destine for they own shipment be exempt from duty and above all the continual interruption experience by the maritime commerce of the island within the last fifteen or twenty year the net proceeds of the custom house from the period above mention of its establishment till the close of 1809 have not be less than from $ 138000 to $ 140000 on a average independent of the amount of the king 's fifth on the gold of the country which be collect by the same administrator in consequence of its be trivial as well as the two per cent belong to the board of trade and by they collect under that title and afterwards separately apply to the average-fund and which usually may be estimate from $ 20000 to $ 25000 the general duty now levy in the custom house be the following : -lrb- port charge and duty -rrb- six per cent almojarisfago be on all kind of merchandise import in foreign bottom under a valuation make by the surveyor in conformity to the respective price of the market at the time on importation it usually be regulate by a increase of 50 % on the prime cost of indium goods and of 33 1\/3 % on those from china this duty may be consider as in fact equal to nine per cent on the former and eight on the latter six per cent or the same duty on all foreign goods although import in national bottom three per cent on spanish goods import under the national flag equal accord to the above estimate to 4 and 4 1\/2 % two per cent board of trade duty indistinctly on all foreign property equivalent to 2 1\/2 or 3 % twenty-five per cent anchorage due levy on the total amount of the almojarisfago duty a additional of two and one-half per cent a new and temporary duty call subvencion appropiate to the payment of the loan make to the king by the cadiz board of trade and leviable on all kind of import goods and of course equal accord to the usual mode of valuation to about three per cent three per cent on the exportation of coin silver and gold of the country in dust and ingot a additional or duty of subvencion or temporary duty on the above equal to one-half per cent one and a half per cent under the same rate on all kind of goods and equal to two or two and one half per cent one and one-half per cent on the amount of the cargo of the acapulco ship on leave the port of manila equal to 3\/4 % on the real prime cost -lrb- slight concession to the company -rrb- the company be consider in the same light as the rest of the merchant in the graduation and payment of duty on such goods as they sell out of they own store for local consumption to the company with the exemption only of the board of trade rate of 2 % and 3 % on the exportation of silver accord to a special privilege and in conformity to the 61st article of the new royal decree of 1803 besides the duty above enumerate there be another trifling one establish for local purpose of peso merchante be a rate for the use of the king 's scale levy accord to a extremely equitable tariff on certain article only of solid weight such as iron copper etc the raw material as well as all kind of manufacture article belong to the island be exempt from duty on they entry in the port and river of manila but some of the first be subject to the most unjust of all exaction that be to a arbitrary tax and to the obligation of be retail out on board the vessel in which they have be bring down and deliverable only to person bear a write order sign by the sit member of the municipal corporation among this class of article may be mention the coco of cebu and the wax and oil of the bisaya which be rate as object of the first necessity -lrb- undervaluation of galleon goods -rrb- with regard to the respective duty on the cargo annually dispatch by the merchant of manila to new spain the practice of galleon be tolerably well regulate a extreme latitude be give to the moderate rate at which it be order to value the goods contain in the manifest by which mean these be frequently put down at only one-half of they original prime cost the commission to frame the scale of valuation which be to be in force for five year after which time it be renew be leave to three merchant and make subject to the revision of the king 's attorney-general -lrb- fiscal -rrb- and the approbation of the governor consequently such be the nature of the tariff on which these operation be found the 33 1\/3 % to which the royal duty amount on the $ 500000 stipulate in the permit do not in fact affect the shipper beyond the rate of 15 per cent in consequence of the great difference between the prime cost and valuation of the article correspond to the permit or what be the same thing between the $ 500000 nominal value and $ 1100000 or $ 1200000 the real amount of the cargo in question the most remarkable circumstance however be that the officer of the revenue in acapulco collect the above-mentioned 33 1\/3 % in absolute conformity to the manila valuation and not accord to the value of the goods in america and without any other formality than a comparison of the cargo with the ship 's papers in honor of truth it ought to be further observe that although the manila merchant by this mean seek to exempt himself from the part of the enormous duty with which it have be attempt to paralyze the only commercial intercourse he carry on with new spain in every other respect connect with this operation he act in a sufficiently legal manner and if at they return those vessel have be in the habit of bring back near a million of dollar in a smuggled way it must be acknowledge that it be the harshness of the law which compel the merchant to become a smuggler for accord to the strange regulation by which he be thwart in the return represent the proceeds of he outward operation he must either bring the money to the philippine island without have it declare on the ship 's papers or be oblige to leave the greatest part of it in the hand of other subject to such contingency as happen in trade as long therefore as the present limitation subsist which only authorize return equal to double the value of the outward-bound cargo this species of contraband will inevitably continue the governor also actuate by the principle of reason and natural justice will as they have hitherto do wink at the infraction of the fiscal law a forbearance in fact indirectly beneficial to they inasmuch as it eventually contribute to the general improvement of the colony indeed without this species of judicious condescension trade would soon stand still for the want of the necessary fund to carry it on -lrb- unbusinesslike custom way -rrb- it will readily be acknowledge that in like manner as the good organization of custom house be favorable to the progress of general commerce so nothing be more injurious to its growth and the enterprise of merchant than any uncertainty or arbitrary conduct in the levying of duty to be pay by they this arise out of the circumstance of every merchant enter on a new speculation be anxious to have as the principal ground work of he combination a perfect knowledge of the exact amount of he disbursement in order to be enable to calculate the final result with some degree of certainty consider in this point of view the system adopt in the island be certainly deplorable since it must be acknowledge that the principle and common rule of all other commercial country be there unknown for example this year a cargo arrive from china or bengal and the captain turn in he manifest the custom-house surveyor then commence the valuation of the goods of which he cargo be compose : i say they commence because it be a common thing for they not to have finish the estimate of the scale and amount of corresponding duty till the expiration of two four and not unfrequently six month the rule they affect to follow in this valuation be that of the price current in the market and in order to ascertain what these be they be see go round inquire in the shop of the sangley -lrb- chinese -rrb- till at length finding it useless to go in search of correct and concurrent datum in a place where there be neither broker nor public auction they be force to determine in a arbitrary manner and as the adage go always take good care to see they employer on the right side of the hedge the grand work be end with all this form and prolixity the sentence of the surveyor be irrevocable the bondsman of the captain who in the meanwhile have usually sell he cargo and depart with a fresh one for another destination pay in the amount of the duty thus regulate by law -lrb- variation in valuation -rrb- the practical defect and injurious consequence of such a system as this it would be unnecessary to particularize it would however be less intolerable if once put in force it could serve the merchant as a guide in the valuation of he property for a determine number of successive year what however render this assessment more prejudicial be its instability and uncertainty and the repetition of the same operation i have just describe every year and with every cargo that arrive but under distinct valuation accord to the report or humor of the day besides these great defect and irregularity the philippine custom house observe the singular practice of not allow the temporary landing of goods enter in transitu and for re-exportation as be do on the bonding system in all country where exertion be make by those in authority for the extension and improvement of commerce in every possible way of course much less will they consent to the drawback or return of any part of the duty on goods enter outwards even though they be still on board the very vessel in which they originally come ship beyond all doubt the wrongly understand severity of such a system have and will continue to prevent many vessel from frequent the port of manila and try the market unable to rely on the same liberal treatment they can meet with in other place -lrb- the areca-nut -rrb- the bonga or areca-nut be the fruit of a very high palm-tree not unlike the one that bear the date and the nut similar to the latter hang in great cluster from below the protuberance of the leaf or branch its figure and size resemble a common nut but solid like the nutmeg divide into small piece it be place in the center of a small ball make of the tender leave of the buyo or betel pepper lightly cover with slack lime and this composition constitute the celebrated betel of asia or as it be here call the buyo the latter differ from that use in indium inasmuch only as it contain cardamomom -lrb- buyo monopoly unsatisfactory -rrb- the government anxious to derive advantage in aid and support of the colony from the great use the inhabitant make of the buyo many year ago determine to establish the sale of the bonga its principal ingredient into a monopoly either by hire the privilege out or place it under a plan of administration in the form in which it now stand both scheme have be try but neither way have this branch be make to yield more than $ 30000 indeed the annual proceeds usually have not exceed $ 25000 in 1809 the total amount of sale be $ 48610 and deduct from this sum the prime cost and expense of administration the net profit in favor of the treasury be equal to no more than $ 27078 or upward of 125 1\/2 % in 1780 the privilege of sell the bonga be let out at public auction for the sum of $ 15765 and this compare with the present proceeds clearly show that although the increase have not advance equally with the other branch of the revenue it be far from have decline it must nevertheless be confess that on the present footing on which it stand the smallness of the proceeds be not worth the trouble require in the collection and even if the amount be still greater it could never serve as a excuse for the oppression and violence to which this monopoly frequently give rise -lrb- hardship on areca-nut planter -rrb- as the tree produce the bonga be not confine to any particular grounds and indiscriminately grow in all the plan have be adopt of compelling the filipino to gather and bring in the fruit raise on they land to the depot nearest the district in which they reside there they be pay from two two and one-half three and three and one-half real per thousand accord to the distance from which they come : and in order to prevent fraud the surveyor belong to the revenue go out at certain time of the year to examine the bonga plantation and the tree be count they estimate the fruit that be oblige the proprietor to undertake to deliver in two hundred nut for each bearing tree whether or not hurricane deteriorate or destroy the produce or thief plunder the plantation as very frequently happen in case deficiency be prove against he he be compel to pay for they in money at the rate of twenty-five real per thousand the price at which the king sell they in the monopoly-store besides the precise condition of deliver in two hundred bonga nut accord to the stipulation impose upon he presuppose the previous exclusion of all the injured or green one and although the ordinary tree usually yield as many as three hundred nut each great number be nevertheless spoil if to the adverse accident arise out of the storm and robbery we add the effect of the whim or ill-humor of the receiver it be not easy to imagine to what a length the injury extend which befall the man who have the folly or misfortune to become a planter of this article -lrb- folly of monopoly plan -rrb- on the other hand as in the conveyance from the minor to the larger depot fraud be frequently commit and the heaping together of many million of nut inevitably produce the fermentation and rapid putrefaction of a great number of they it consequently follow that the waste must be immense or if it be determine to sell all the stock lay in without any distinction in quality and price the public must be very badly serve and displeased as in fact too often happen since therefore the habit of use the buyo be still more prevailing than that of tobacco when suitable supplies can not be have in the monopoly store the consumer naturally resort to the contraband channel although he encounter some risk and expend more money it be also very natural that the desire of gain should thus lead on and daily expose a number of needy person anxious by this mean to support and relieve the want of they family return however to what more immediately concern the grower i do not know that the oppressive genius of fiscal law have in any country of the globe invent one more refinedly tyrannic than to condemn a man to a certain degree at least as have hitherto be the case to the punishment of tantalus for the law forbid the filipino to touch the fruit of the tree plant with he own hand and which hang in tempting and luxuriant abundance round he humble dwelling -lrb- its modification desirable -rrb- it would be easy for I to enumerate many other inconvenience attend this branch of public revenue on the footing on which it now stand if what have already be say do not suffice to point out the necessity of change the system as those in authority be anxious that the treasury should gain more and the king 's subject suffer less the strong prejudice entertain against this source of revenue the inconsiderable sum it produce and the complicated form of its organization have in reality be sufficient motive to induce many to become strenous advocate for the total abolition of the monopoly i do not however on this account see any reason for altogether deprive the government of a productive resource as this might soon be render if it be place under regulation less odious and more simple in themselves i nevertheless agree that the perfect monopoly of the areca fruit or bonga be impracticable till the tree indiscriminately plant be cut down and in the same way as the tobacco plantation fresh and definite grounds be lay out for its cultivation on account of the revenue i be further aware that this measure be less practicable than the first for independent of all the other obstacle it would be necessary to wait till the new plantation yield fruit and also that the public should consent to refrain from masticate buyo in the meanwhile a pretension as mad as it would be to require that the eating of salt should be dispense with for a give number of year but what difficulty would there be for example in the proprietor pay so much a year for each bonga tree to the district magistrate the governor of the nearest town or the cabeza de barangay or chief of the clan into which the native be divide in the same manner as the filipino pay he tribute -lrb- tree-tax preferable -rrb- the only one i anticipate be that of fix the amount in such way that at the same time this resource be make to produce a increase income of some moment it may act as a moderate tax on a indefinite property the amount of which augment in the same price may be reimburse to the proprietor by the great body of consumer it be not in fact easy to foresee or estimate by any means of approximation the alteration in the current price of the bonga that would result from the indefinite freedom of its cultivation and sale especially during the first year although for this reason it would be impossible to ascertain what proportion the impost on the tree would then bear with regard to the value of the fruit the error that might accrue would be of little moment as long as precaution be take to adopt a very low rate of comparison and a proportionably equitable one as the basis of taxation supposing then that the price of the bonga should decline from twenty-five real at which it be now sell in the monopoly store to fifteen real per thousand in the general market and a tax of one-fourth real should be lay on each tree value at two hundred bonga nut it be clear that this would be equal to no more than 8 1\/2 % or what be the same the tax would be in the proportion one to twelve with the proceeds of each tree and the more the value of the fruit be raise the more would the rate of contribution diminish it ought at the same time to be observe that under the above estimate that be suppose the price of the article to remain at fifteen real the 8 1\/2 % at which rate the tax be regulate would not perhaps exceed five or six per cent on a more minute calculation in the first place because at the time of make out the return of the tree -lrb- exception of immature and aged tree -rrb- those only ought to be set down which be in they full vigor exclude such as through the want or excess of age only yield a small proportion of fruit and in the second because in the number register the tree would only be rate at two hundred although it be well know they usually yield three hundred in order by this mean the better to avoid all motive of complaint in this point of view and by adopt similar rule of probability it seem to I that the government would not risk much by a attempt to change the present system into a tax levy on the tree itself on a plane similar to the one above propose more particularly by do it in a temporary manner and render it completely subservient to the correction subsequent experience might suggest in this particular -lrb- difficulty of estimate probable revenue -rrb- the difficulty be in this manner overcome with regard to the prudent determination of the rate at which the proprietor of the bonga plantation ought to contribute let we now proceed to estimate by approximation the annual sum that would thus be obtain as however this operation be unfortunately complicate and in great measure depend on the previous knowledge of the total number of tree liable to the tax proposed detail with which we be at not present prepared it be impossible to come at any very accurate result all that can be do be to endeavor to demonstrate in general term the great increase the revenue would experience by the adoption of the new plan and the real advantage result from it to the contributor themselves all which may be easily deduce from the follow calculation let we in the first instance suppose that the consumer of buyo in the whole of the island do not exceed one million of person and that each one make use of three bonga per day this consumption at the end of the year would then amount to 1095000000 nut we will next divide this sum by two hundred at which the product of each tree one with another be rate and the result will be 5475000 tree -lrb- greater however than at present -rrb- this number be tax at the rate of one-fourth real would leave the sum of $ 17109375 and deduct therefrom the $ 25000 yield by this branch under its present establishment together with $ 5132 equal to three per cent pay to the district magistrate for the charge of collection we should still have a annual increase in favor of the treasury equal to $ 14096175 it might perhaps be object that in this case the proprietor instead of receive as before two and one-half real for every thousand bonga would have to disburse one and one-fourth real in the mere act of pay one-fourth real for each tree a circumstance which at first sight seem to produce a difference not of one and one-fourth but of three and one-fourth real per thousand against he though in reality far from this be the case if we take into consideration the deficiency the swear receiver usually lay to he charge the fruit he reject owe to its be green or rotten and the many and expensive grievance he be expose to in he capacity of grower it will be see that he disbursement under these head frequently exceed the amount he in fact have to receive -lrb- tax only a surcharge ultimately pay by consumer -rrb- if in addition to this we bear in mind that on condition of see himself free from guard and a variety of insupportable restriction constitute the very essence of a monopoly he would in all probability gladly pay much more than the tax in question all the doubt arise on this point will entirely disappear finally consider in its true light we shall not find in the measure above describe anything more than a very trifling discount require of the proprietor from the price at which he sell he bonga and which as already notice ultimately fall on the consumer alone -lrb- estimate conservative -rrb- the moderate estimate i have just form ought to inspire the more confidence from its be well know that the use of the buyo be general among the inhabitant of these island the calculation as it now stand rest only on one million consumer for each of whom i have only put down three bonga per day whereas it be customary to use much more nor have i take into account the infinite number of nut waste after be convert into the buyo a fact equally well know indeed as the object propose be no other than to prove the main part of my assertion and i trust this be satisfactorily do i have not deem it necessary to include in the above calculation a greater number of minute circumstance nor attempt to deduce more favorable result which with the scope before I i be most assuredly warrant in do -lrb- advantage -rrb- in a word from the concurrence of the fact and reason above adduce the follow proposition may without any difficulty be lay down first that the increase of revenue produce by the reform in question would in all probability exceed $ 150000 per annum secondly that the filipino would soon comprehend and gladly consent to a change of this kind in the mode of contribute of which the advantage would be apparent thirdly that the person employ in the old establishment might with greater public utility be apply to other purpose and lastly that the civil magistrate would not be harass with so many strife and lawsuit and so many melancholy victim of the monopoly and its officer would cease to drag a wretched existence in the prison and place of hard labor in these island -lrb- cockpit licens -rrb- the cock-pit branch of the revenue be hire out by the government and the license be separately set up at auction for the respective province its nature and regulation be so well know that they do not require a particular description the general obligation of the contractor be the same as those in new spain perhaps the only difference observe in this public exhibition in the philippine island consist in its greater simplicity owe to its be frequent only by the native the whites who be present at this kind of diversion be very few or indeed none -lrb- inconsiderable income -rrb- the cock-pit be open two day in the week and the lessee of they receive half a real from every person who enter besides the extra price they charge those who occupy the best seat the owner of the fight cock for the spur stall for the sale of buyo refreshments etc notwithstanding all this and although cock-fighting be so general and favorite a amusement among these people -lrb- the rooster may justly be consider as the distinctive emblem of the filipino -rrb- the annual proceeds of this branch be inconsiderable although it must be acknowledge that it have greatly increase since the year 1780 when it appear the license be let at auction for only about $ 14000 owe no doubt to the exclusive privilege of the contractor not have be extend to the province as be afterwards gradually do -lrb- provincial cockpit revenue -rrb- the total sum pay to the government by the renter of this branch accord to the auction return in 1810 amount to $ 40141 in the follow order for the province : tondo $ 18501 cavite 2225 la laguna 2005 pampanga 3000 bulacan 6900 batanga 2000 pangasinan 1200 bataan 1050 iloilo 1600 iloco 600 tayaba 400 cebu 360 albay 300 total $ 40141 -lrb- possibility of increase -rrb- the cause to which the increase that have take place within the last twenty-five or thirty year be chiefly to be attribute have already be point out and for this reason it would appear that by adopt the same plan with regard to the fourteen remain province of which this captaincy-general be compose hitherto free from the imposition of this tax a augmentation might be expect proportionate to the population they circumstance and the greater or lesser taste for cock-fight prevail among they respective inhabitant at the commencement no doubt the rental would be low and of course the price at which the licens be let out would be equally so but the experience and profit derivable from this kind of enterprise would not fail soon to excite the competition of contractor and in this way add to the revenue of the government this be so obvious that i can not help suspect attempt have at some period or other be make to introduce the establishment of this privilege in some of the province allude to at the same time i be persuade that owe to the affair not have be view in its proper light seek on the contrary to obtain a immediate and disproportionate result the authority have be too soon disheartened and give up the project without a fair trial all town and district murmur and at first object to tax however light they may be but at length if they be not excessive the people become reconcile to they the one here propose be neither of this character nor can it be deem odious on account of its novelty the native be well aware that they brethren in the other province be subject to it and that in this nothing more be do than render the system uniform i therefore see no reason why the establishment of this branch of revenue should not be extend to all the point of the island at the commencement let it produce what it may since constancy and time will bring thing to the same general level -lrb- indian tribute -rrb- the too great condescension and mistaken humanity of the government on the one hand and the fraud and selfishness of the provincial sub-delegate or collector on the other have concur to change a contribution the most simple into one of the most complicated branch of public administration the first cause have be owe to a too general acquiescence to receive the amount of tribute in the produce peculiar to each province instead of money and the second because as the above officer be the person intrust with the collection whenever the sale have hold out to they any advantage they have be in the habit of appropriate the several article to themselves without allow any benefit to the treasury if the prospective sale of the produce appear unfavorable it be then forward on to the king 's store in manila surcharge with freight expose to many risk and the value greatly diminish by waste and many other cause no order or regularity be thus observe in this respect and the sale of the produce transmit to the king 's store be regulate by the greater or lesser abundance in the general market and a considerable stock besides left remain from one year to another and eventually spoil it be impossible to form any exact estimate of this branch if to these complicated matter we add the radical vice arise out of the infidelity of the head of clan -lrb- cabeza de barangay -rrb- the difficulty of ascertain the defect of the return make out by they the variation annually occur in the number of those exempt either through age or other legal motive and above all the frequently inevitable tardiness with which the district magistrate send in they respective account it will be readily acknowledge that no department require more zeal in its administration and no one be more susceptible of all kind of fraud or attend with more difficulty -lrb- a conservative estimate -rrb- in this state of uncertainty with regard to this particular branch i have guide myself by the last general return of tribute make out in the accountant-general 's office on the best and most recent datum and calculate indistinctly the whole value in money i have deem it proper afterwards to make a moderate deduction on account of the difference above state and arise out of the collection of the tribute in kind the expense of conveyance shipwreck average and other cause already enumerate -lrb- fix charge -rrb- in conformity to this calculation the total proceeds of this branch of revenue amount to $ 505215 from which sum be deduct in the primitive stage of the account the amount of ecclesiastical stipend the pay of the troops under the immediate order of the chief district magistrate in they quality of war-captain together with all other extraordinary expense incur in the province by order of the government the remainder be afterwards forward to the king 's treasury it ought however to be observe that the above aggregated sum be more or less liable to deficiency accord to the greater or lesser degree of punctuality on the part of the sub-collector in make up account and the solidity of they respective surety the failure of this kind experience by the revenue be so frequent that accord to the return of the accountant-general those which occur between the year 1762 and 1809 be no less than $ 215765 notwithstanding the great precaution at all time take to prevent such considerable injury by every means compatible with the precarious tenure of property possess by both principal and surety in this country all the above circumstance be therefore take into due consideration and the ordinary and extraordinary discount make from the total amount of tribute the real sum remain or the net annual proceeds of the above branch have usually not be rate at more than $ 190000 and $ 200000 a sum respectively extremely small and which possibly might be double without the necessity of recur to any other measure than a standing order for the collect of the tribute in money as by this mean the variety of expense and complication above enumerate would be avoid and the king 's revenue no longer expose to any other deficiency than those arise out of the insolvency of the sub-collector and they surety or casual risk and the trifling charge pay for the conveyance of the money if in opposition to this it should be allege that it would be advisable to except some of the province from this general rule owe to the advantage the government might derive from certain tribute be pay in kind i do not hesitate to answer that i see no reason whatever why this should be do because if for example any quality of rigging or sail cloth be annually require it would be easy to obtain it either by early contract or by lay in the article at the current market price indeed all supplies which do not rest on this footing would be to defraud the native of the fruit of he industry and in the final result this would be the same as require of he double or triple tribute contrary to the spirit of the law which unfortunately be too frequently the case under the exist system -lrb- preferability of tribute in money -rrb- consider this affair in another point of view it would be easy for I to demonstrate if it be necessary the mistaken idea that the native be benefit by receive in kind the amount of the tribute he have to pay at the low price mark in the tariff use as a standard by show the extortion and brokerage if i may so term it to which the practice give rise on the part of the district collector it will however suffice to call the attention of my reader to the smallness of the sum constitute the ordinary tribute when reduce to money in order for they to be convince that it would be superfluous as well as hazardous to attempt to point out how this branch might be render more productive to the state and at the same time less burdensome to the contributor more particularly when the rate assess do not exceed ten real per year a sum so small that generally speak no family can be find unable to hoard it up if they have any inclination so to do the prevail error however in this respect i be confident arise out of a principle very different from the one to which it be usually attribute the tributary native be in fact dispose to pay the quota assign to he into the hand of the chief of he clan in money in preference to kind because independent of the small value at which the article in kind be rate in the tariff he be then expose to no expense as he now be for the conveyance of he produce and effect nor be he liable to so many accident but as the chief of each clan have to deliver in he forty or fifty tribute to the head magistrate who be answerable for those of the whole province it be natural for he to endeavor to make he corresponding payment in some equivalent afford he a profit at the same time the provincial magistrate speculate on a larger scale on the produce arise out of he jurisdiction seek to obtain from the government a profitable commutation in kind for that which the original contributor would have prefer pay in money in order the better to attain he purpose he assert as a pretext the impossibility of collect in the tribute under another form allege moreover the relief the native derive from this mode whereas if only duly examine such a pretence be found on the avarice rather than the humanity of the magistrate leave to one side the defect attributable to the present mode of collection and consider the tribute as it be in itself the attentive observer must confess that in no part of we indy be this more moderate and indeed it be evident that the law generally relate to the native of these island seem to distinguish they with a decide predilection above those of the various section of america -lrb- item in tribute -rrb- the tribute in its origin be only eight real per family but the necessity of provide for the increase expense of the government give rise to this rate be afterwards raise to ten the sangley mestizo pay double tribute and the sangley contribute at the rate of $ 6 per head besides this all pay a yearly sum applicable to the fund belong to the community and the above two cast pay three real more as a church rate and under the name of the sanctuary the whole be in the following form : entire native tribute tribute of mestizo sangley 8 real original tribute 16 real $ 6 each 1 1\/2 real for expense of troops 3 1\/2 real to tithe 1 10 real amount of tribute 20 real $ 675 1 real community fund 1 3 real sanctuary rate 3 14 real total annual disbursement 24 real $ 675 the male commence pay tribute at twenty year of age and the female at twenty-five if before they have not enter the matrimonial state and in both the obligation cease at the age of sixty the chief of clan or cabezas de barangay and they eldest son or in default of child the person adopt in they stead that be a entire tribute and a half be exempt from this tax as a remuneration for the trouble and responsibility they may have in collect in the forty or fifty tribute of which they respective clan be compose besides these there be various other class of exempt person such as the soldier who have serve a certain number of year those who have distinguish themselves in any particular manner in the improvement of industry or agriculture and other who have receive special certificate on just and equitable grounds in sum up the total number of exempt person on a average in the whole of the province they will be find in the proportion of fifty to every thousand entire tribute -lrb- chinese tax -rrb- the head-tax of the sangley have usually be attend with so many difficulty in its collection owe to the facility with which they absent or secrete themselves and the many stratagem this cunning and artful race employ to elude the vigilance of the commissioner that the government have at length find itself compel to let out this branch as be do in 1809 when it be dispose of in the name of one of they for the moderate sum of $ 30000 notwithstanding it be a generally receive opinion that the number of this description of chinese constantly reside in the island be above 7000 which at the rate of $ 6 per head would raise this proportion of the tax as high as $ 42000 -lrb- community fund -rrb- the community fund belong to each town have in conformity to the regulation under which they be administer a special or i might say local application but collect together into one stock as be now the case and directly administer by the government they produce a more general utility the head town of the province a for example require to rebuild the public prison or town-hall and its own private fund be not sufficient to defray the expense of the work in question in this case therefore the government give order for the other dependent town to make up the deficiency by take they proportion from they respective coffer as all have a equal interest in the propose object be carry into effect the king 's officer in consequence thereof draw the corresponding sum from these fund the whole of which be under they immediate superintendence and in order that the surplus of this stock may not stand still but obtain every possible increase in a country where the premium for money be excessive when let out at a maritime risk it be order that some part shall be appropriate in this way and on the same term as those observe by the administrator of the charity fund belong to the misericordium -lrb- charity -rrb- establishment and the third order of st franci which be another of the great advantage of assemble this class of property in consequence of this judicious regulation and the success with which this measure have hitherto be attend the community fund have go on increase in such a way that notwithstanding the sum draw from it for the purpose of construct causeway bridge and other municipal object at the commencement of 1810 the stock in hand amount to no less than $ 200000 and it be natural to suppose when the outstanding premium due shall have be pay in a considerable augmentation will take place this branch although not exactly comprehend in those which constitute the revenue of the government have so obvious a analogy with that of tribute that i have not deem it any essential deviation from the order and method i have hitherto observe in this work to introduce it in this place as in itself it do not deserve to be class under a distinct head -lrb- tribute burdensome -rrb- notwithstanding the truth of what have be say with regard to the moderate rate of the tribute impose on the native of the philippine island it would be extremely desirable if he could be altogether exonerate from a charge which he bear with great repugnance by some other substitute be adopt indirectly produce a equivalent compensation in the first place because the just motive of complaint would cease cause not only by the tribute but also the manner of its collection and a end would then be put to those intrigue and extortion the district magistrate commit under the title of zealous collector of the king 's revenue and the power of a multitude of subaltern tyrant comprehend under the denomination of chief of native clan -lrb- cabeza de barangay -rrb- would then also fall to the ground a power which if now employ for the purpose of oppress and trample on the liberty of inferior might some day or other be convert into a instrument dangerous and subversive of we preponderance in the country in the second place if among all the civilized nation a head-tax -lrb- poll-tax -rrb- be in itself odious it must incontestably be much more so among those whose unlettered state far from allow they to know that the social order require a certain class of sacrifice for its better preservation make they attribute exaction of this kind to a abuse of superiority hence be they lead to consider these restraint as the symbol of they own slavery and degradation as in fact the native in these island have ample reason for do when the legal exemption of the whites be consider without any other apparent reason than the difference in color independent of this the substitute above allude to would be extremely expedient inasmuch as it would greatly simplify the plan of administration the accountant 's department would be free from the most painful part of its labor and the district magistrate and sub-collector would not so frequently be entangled in they account and expose to expensive and interminable lawsuit as now so often happen -lrb- possible revenue substitute -rrb- the difficulty however of find out this compensation or substitute be a matter of some consideration on the one hand if it be attempt to distribute the proceeds arise out of the tribute on other branch such as tobacco native wine bonga and custom house it would at first sight appear possible through the medium of a almost invisible augmentation in the respective sale price and in the king 's duty that this important object might easily be attain but on the other it might be apprehend that the additional value put on the article above-mentioned would produce in they consumption a diminution equal to the difference in price in which case no advantage would be gain the practicability of the operation in my opinion depend on the proportion in which the means of obtain the article in question respectively stand with the probability of they be consume i will explain myself if for example the annual stock of tobacco lay in should be insufficient to meet the want of the consumer as constantly occur it be clear that this article when monopolize will bear a small augmentation of price not only without any inconvenience or risk but with the moral certainty of obtain a positive increase of revenue the necessary effect of the total consumption of the tobacco lay in and sell but as this do not happen with the branch of native wine of which the stock usually exceed the demand and as the bonga also be not susceptible of this improvement owe to the small place it occupy among the other resource of the revenue no other means be leave than to add to the duty of export on silver and of import on foreign merchandise a percentage equivalent to the deficiency not lay on tobacco unless it should be deem more advisable to levy a sumptuary contribution on coach horse and servant and especially on all kind of edifice and house build of stone and mortar situate both within and without the capital -lrb- objection to tribute-paying -rrb- however this may be whatever the king lose in revenue by the abolition of the native tribute no doubt could be make up by a appeal to other way and mean it be well-known that many of the indian tribe refuse to become subject of the crown and object to enter into general society on account of the odious idea they have form of pay tribute or as they understand it the obligation of give something for nothing notwithstanding those who voluntarily submit themselves to we law be exempt from tribute and this charge fall only on they descendant but of this they must either be ignorant or they regret deprive they posterity of that independence in which they themselves have be bring up and thus transmit to they slavery as a inheritance as soon therefore as a general exemption of this kind without distinction of cast should be make public the native would quit they fastness and secluded place and satisfy with the security offer to they would be see come down to the plain in search of convenience of civilized life and all gradually would be reduce to christianity hence the increase of production and they consumption as well as the extension of agriculture industry and internal commerce the diminution of smuggling tobacco would soon follow progress would be make in the knowledge of the mine and natural riches of the country and financially greater facility would present themselves in gradually carry into effect its entire conquest and civilization advantage of such great and extraordinary importance deserve to be seriously weigh and to this valuable department of public administration the early attention of those in authority ought to be call let due inquiry be make and soon shall we discover the substantial benefit which would be derive to the treasury from the adoption of this measure as popular as it be just and also conformable to the liberal spirit of the time in support of the precede argument it ought further to be observe that when all the branch constitute the king 's revenue be well organize bring to they most productive state and the public debt contract under unforeseen exigency pay off as long as present circumstance do not vary a annual surplus of revenue equal to more than $ 500000 will be leave and as the proceeds of the particular branch of tribute do not amount to this sum it be evident they abolition may take place not only without any derangement or onerous consequence to the administration but even without any deficiency be experience or any necessity to recur to the treasury of new spain for extraordinary aid these reason acquire still greater force when it be remember that as thing now be all the branch of public revenue be in a progressively improve condition and as the whole be still susceptible of a much more productive organization the annual surplus of receipt will rapidly become greater and consequently also the necessity will diminish of continue to burden this portion of he majesty 's dominion with contribution in order to meet the expense of they defense and preservation finally well convinced of the advantageous result which in every sense would emanate from the revision and reform propose i abstain from offer in support of my argument a variety of other reflection which occur to I not to be too diffuse on this subject trusting that the hint i have already throw out will be more than sufficient to excite a interest and promote a thorough and impartial investigation of concern highly important to the future welfare and security of this colony -lrb- subaltern branch -rrb- besides the six precede branch which constitute the chief mass of the public revenue in these island there be several smaller one of less consideration and amount some have a direct application to the general expense of the local government and the other intend as remittance to spain a distinction of little import and scarcely deserving of notice since the object of the present sketch be to convey information on a large scale respect the king 's revenue in these island as some of they however yield proceeds more regular than the other i have class together the receipt of the pope 's bull or bulas de cruzada playing-card tithe stamp and gunpowder under the head of subaltern branch with regard to the rest to the general statement already quote in conformity to the return with which i have be favor from the public office these five branch produce in the year 1809 $ 4509075 in the follow proportion : sale expense net proceeds pope 's bull $ 1536075 $ 442225 $ 1093850 playing card 11539125 932625 1060650 tithe 1249300 -- 1249300 stamp 446750 32150 414600 gunpowder 7307625 401125 6905375 -- -- -- $ 51168125 $ 607775 $ 45090375 -lrb- tithe -rrb- the scanty proceeds of the tithe will naturally appear remarkable but it ought to be remember that besides the ordinary tribute the native pay half a real under this denomination without any distinction of person or any reference whatever to they respective mean the total amount of which be already add to the tribute and for this reason not repeat in this place in addition also no tithe be levy except on land belong to spaniard church regular clergy ecclesiastical corporation etc and even then the article of rice wheat pulse indigo and sugar be alone liable the above branch be all in charge of administrator and from this plan it certainly would be advisable to separate the tithe and farm they out at public auction as be propose by the king 's officer of the treasury in they report on this as well as other point concern the revenue and dated October 24 1792 from the net proceeds of the gunpowder the expense of its manufacture confide to the commandant of artillery ought seemingly to be deduct but as they can not be ascertain with any degree of certainty and as besides they be comprehend in the general expense of that department a separate deduction may be dispense with -lrb- disbursement and general expense -rrb- in order to form a correct idea of the annual amount of the expenditure incur by the administration and defense of the philippine island it be not necessary in this place to distinguish each item separately or to enumerate they with they respective sum or particular denomination some general observation on this subject ought nevertheless to be make with a view to point out the reform of which this important department of the public revenue be susceptible in the part relate to the interior administration or government ample room be certainly leave for that kind of economy arise out of the adoption of a general system little complicated but it be besides indispensably necessary that at the same time the work be simplife and useless hand dismiss the salary of those who remain should be proportionally increase in order to stimulate they in the due performance of they duty it might also be find advisable to create a small number of officer of a superior order who would be enable to co-operate in the collection of the king 's revenue and the encouragement of agriculture commerce and navigation in they respective department the additional charge in this respect can not be of any great consequence although in reality by the receipt increase through the impulse of a administrative order more perfect and the expense be always the same the main object so anxiously seek for in another way would be thus attain -lrb- defense expense -rrb- the reverse however happen with regard to the expense of defense as i have call they the better to distinguish they from those purely relate to the interior police or administration every sacrifice most assuredly ought to appear small when the object be to preserve a country from fall into the hand of a enemy and it ought not to excite surprise if during the course of the last fifteen year several million of dollar have be expend in the philippine in order to shield they from so dreadful a misfortune but the late memorable revolution in the peninsula have give rise to so great a change in we political relation and it be extremely improbable that these island will be again expose to the same danger and alarm that the government may now without any apparent risk dispense with a considerable part of the preparation of defense at one time deem indispensably necessary a colony that have no other strong place to garrison than its capital and on the loyalty of whose inhabitant there be sufficient motive to rely ought in my opinion to be consider as adequately provide against all ordinary occurrence in time of peace with the 4000 regular more or less of all arm the usual military establishment in case any suspicion should arise of a early rupture with the only power whose force can inspire the governor of these island with any kind of apprehension mean will not be want to a active and provident minister of give proper advice so as to allow sufficient time for the assemble of the battalion of provincial militia and all the other necessary preparation of defense before the enemy be in a attitude to effect a invasion of a country so far distant from he own possession on the coast of malabar and coromandel consequently by disband the corps of provincial infantry cavalry and artillery which continue uselessly to be keep on foot a annual saving of from $ 220000 to $ 250000 would take place a amount too great to be expend unless imperiously call for by the evident dread of a premeditated attack from a hostile quarter -lrb- shipping reform -rrb- the navy be another of the department in which reform may be introduce of no small moment to the treasury of course by the government merely dispense with the policy of keep in readiness two large ship to convey to acapulco the cargo for which the manila merchant enjoy a annual licence and leave to the latter the full liberty of follow up they speculation on they own account and risk in vessel of they own individually or with joint stock a saving would result in favor of the crown equal to $ 140000 to $ 150000 per annum and without prevent the receipt in acapulco of the customary duty of $ 160000 or $ 166000 correspond to the say licens this will evidently be the case because as long as the large disposal of fund of the charitable institution be employ in maritime risk and the private property of other be besides add to they the amount of the operation undertake by the merchant of the philippine to new spain when divest of all restraint will always exceed $ 500000 per annum nor be there now any further occasion for the government to continue grant this species of gratuitous tutelage to a body of man possess of ample means to manage they own affair and who demand the same degree of freedom and only seek a protection similar to that enjoy by they fellow-countryman in other part of the king 's dominion -lrb- galleon graft -rrb- in case the above reform should be adopt it might be deem requisite for the government to undertake the payment of some of the charge under the exist order of thing defray out of the freight to which the merchandise ship in the acapulco trader be liable because calculate the freight at the usual rate of $ 200 for each three bale or the amount of one ticket out of the one thousand constitute the entire cargo and of which one-half or $ 100000 more or less be appropriate to the ecclesiastical chapter municipality officer of the regular army -lrb- exclude captain and the other higher rank -rrb- and the widow of spaniard who in this case would be loser independent of the remain $ 100000 or 500 ticket distribute among the 200 person have a right to ship to acapulco it would at first sight appear reasonable for the treasury to indemnify the above description of person by a compensation equivalent to the privation they experience through the new arrangement of the government but as the practice of abuse constitute no law and what be give through favor be different to that which be require by justice there be no reason whatever why the treasury should be bind to support the widow of private person from the mere circumstance of they deceased husband have be spaniard more particularly if it be consider that far from have acquire any special merit during they lifetime most of they voluntarily leave they native country for the purpose of increase they fortune and other be banish from it owe to they bad conduct neither can it be say that the municipality have a legal right in the case before state to receive any equivalent for the value of they respective annual ticket which when dispose of usually amount to about $ 20000 in the first place because it be well-known that the eleven alderman 's seat of which that body be compose seat which can either be sell or resign originally do not cost as much as $ 50000 and clearly the principal invest be out of all kind of proportion with the enormous premium or income claim in the second place although the above municipal situation be originally purchase with a view to obtain some advantage these formerly be very different to what they be at present when the great increase of shipper to acapulco or in more plain term of purchase of ticket compete to obtain they have give to these permit a value more than triple to that they possess thirty year ago -lrb- indemnify the alderman -rrb- in order therefore to do away with all motive of doubt and dispute as well as for many other reason of public utility the best plan in my opinion would be to return to each alderman he money and the present municipal constitution be dissolve the number of member might be reduce to four with they corresponding registrar and like the two ordinary alcalde elect every year without any other reward than the honor of preside over and represent they fellow-citizen under this supposition the only class entitle to compensation strictly speak would be the ecclesiastical chapter and the subaltern officer whose respective pay and appointment be not in fact sufficient for the decency and expense of they rank in society of course it would then be necessary to grant they more adequate allowance but accord to reasonable calculation the sum total annually require would not exceed $ 30000 consequently the reform project with regard to the acapulco ship would still eventually produce to the treasury a saving of from $ 60000 to $ 70000 in the first year of its adoption and of $ 110000 to $ 120000 in every succeed one -lrb- the navy -rrb- it be on the other hand undeniable that if the royal navy and cruise vessel or those belong to the island and under the immediate order of the captain-general be unite into one department and place under one head considerable economy would ensue and all motive of discord and emulation be moreover remove such would be the case if the change be attend with no other cirumstance than the consequent diminution of commander subaltern officer and clerk but it would be also proper to unite the arsenal and adopt a more general uniformity in the operation and dependence of this part of the public service it be equally certain that during peaceful time the two schooner and sixty gunboat constitute the number of the above-mentioned cruise vessel would be in great measure useless whilst in case of a rupture they be not sufficient to protect the trade of these island from the attack of a enemy notwithstanding they now cost the government considerable sum in repair etc in order to keep they fit for service the government ought therefore to guard against this waste of public money without however neglect the defense of the island object which in my opinion might easily be reconcile intelligent person have judge that by reduce the naval force to two frigate two schooner and about a dozen gunboat the essential want of the colony would be duly answer in ordinary time and some of the vessel might then be destine to pursue hydrographical labor in the archipelago which unfortunately be in a most backward state whilst other could be send on they periodical cruise against the moro by this mean at least the navy department would be greatly simplify and cease to be eternally burdensome to the government with regard to the superfluous gunboat it would be expedient to distribute they gratuitously among the marine province and bisayan island on the only condition of they be always keep fit for service as in one sense the great expense of maintain they would be thus save by the treasury and another the inhabitant of those portion of the coast would be in possession of means sufficiently powerful to repel the aggression of the moro who commit great ravages on they settlement finally if besides the reform of which the army and navy be susceptible it be consider that the public work such as prison school bridge and causeway so expensive in other country in the philippine be construct by the native on the most reasonable term out of the community fund that there be no necessity to build fortification and maintain numerous garrison that the clergy to whose zeal and powerful influence the preservation of these island be chiefly due do not cost the treasury annually above $ 200000 and that the geographical situation of the colony in great measure shield it from the attack of external enemy it will readily be confess that a wise and firm government might undertake without the dread of have to encounter any great obstacle a administrative system in a general point of view infinitely more economical than the one hitherto follow might be able to extirpate numerous abuse and by call forth the resource of the country gradually raise it to a flourishing condition and cause it hereafter to contribute largely to the other want of the crown hence be it that the distinguished voyager la pérouse -lrb- chap 15 -rrb- contemplate these island with a political eye do not hesitate to affirm that a powerful nation possess of no other colony than the philippine that should succeed in establish there a form of government best adapt to they advantageous circumstance would justly disregard all the other european establishment in africa and america -lrb- objectionable office-holder -rrb- in we colony appointment and command far from be seek as a means to obtain a good reputation or as afford opportunity of contribute to public prosperity be it be too well know only solicit with a view to amass wealth and then retire for the purpose of enjoy it commercial pursuit be besides attend with so many advantage that those only decline follow they who be divest of money and friend whilst the situation in the revenue be so few in number compare with the many candidate who solicit they that they be consequently well appoint it follow that the excess left without occupation besides be considerable be generally compose of needy person and not the most suitable to exercise the delicate function of collector and magistrate in the province from this class nevertheless the host of officer be usually take who under the name of collector surveyor and assessor of tribute intervene in or influence the public administration owe to the variety and great number of person emigrate to america ample field no doubt be there leave for selection by which mean the viceroy may frequently meet with person suitable and adequate to the above trust if prudent step be only take but in this respect the case be very different in the philippine where chance alone occasionally bring over a european spaniard unemployed or friendless in these remote island also more than in any other quarter people seek to live in idleness and as much as possible without work or much trouble as long as hope be entertain of do something in the acapulco speculation every other pursuit be view with indifference and the office of district or provincial magistrate be only solicit when all other resource have fail or as a remedy against want as the applicant for these situation be therefore not among the most select class it very frequently happen that they fall into extremely improper and unworthy hand it be in fact common enough to see a hairdresser or a lackey convert into a governor a sailor or a deserter transform into a district magistrate collector or military commander of a populous province without any other counsellor than he own crude understanding or any other guide than he passion such a metamorphosis would excite laughter in a comedy or farce but realize in the theater of human life it must give rise to sensation of a very different nature who be there that do not feel horror-struck and tremble for the innocent when he see a being of this kind transfer from the yard-arm to the seat of justice decide in the first instance on the honor live and property of a hundred thousand person and haughtily exact the homage and incense of the spiritual minister of the town under he jurisdiction as well as of the parish curate respectable for they acquirement and benevolence and who in they own native place would possibly have reject as a servant the very man whom in the philippine they be compel to court and obey as a sovereign in vain do the law ordain that such office shall not be give away to attendant on governor and member of the high court of justice for under pretext of the scarcity of european experience in the colony means be find to elude the statute by convert this plea into a exception in favor of this description of person by such important office be fill in this manner it be easy to conceive the various hardship to which many of the province and district be expose nor can any amelioration be expect as long as this plan be persist in and the excess of the party go without punishment -lrb- evil from official in trade -rrb- independent however of the serious injury and great error person of the class above describe can not fail to commit in the exercise of they function purely judicial the consequence of they inordinate avarice be still more lamentable and the tacit permission to satisfy it grant to they by the government under the specious title of a licence to trade hence may it be affirm that the first of the evil and the one the native immediately feel be occasion by the very person the law have destine for he relief and protection in a word he experience injury from the civil magistrate preside over the province who at the same time be the natural enemy of the inhabitant and the real oppressor of they industry it be a known and melancholy fact that far from promote the felicity of the province intrust to they care the magistrate attend to nothing else but they own fortune and personal interest nor do they hesitate as to the means by which they object be to be attain scarcely be they seat in the place of authority when they become the chief consumer purchaser and exporter of every thing produce and manufacture within the district under they command thus convert they licence to trade into a positive monopoly in all lucrative speculation the magistrate seek to have the largest share in all he enterprise he call in the forced aid of he subject and if he deign to remunerate they labor at most it be only on the same term as if they have be work on account of the king these unhappy people bring in they produce and crude manufacture to the very person who directly or indirectly be to fix upon they a arbitrary value to offer such and such a price for the article be the same as to say another bidding shall not be make to insinuate be to command -- the native be not allow to hesitate he must either please the magistrate or submit to he persecution be besides free from all competition in the prosecution of he traffic since he be frequently the only spaniard resident in the province the magistrate therein act with unbounded sway without dread and almost without risk of he tyranny ever be denounce to the superior tribunal -lrb- speculate in tribute -rrb- in order however that a more correct idea may be form of the iniquitous conduct of many of these public functionary it be necessary to lay open some part of they irregular dealings in the collection of the indian tribute it be well know that the government anxious to conciliate the interest of the tributary class with those of the revenue frequently commute the pecuniary capitation tax into a obligation to pay the amount in produce or manufacture a season come when owe to the failure of the crop the production have rise to a excessive price and consequently infinitely above the ordinary rate affix by law which be generally the lowest and the native unable to keep they bargain without considerable injury or endanger the subsistence of they numerous family implore the favor of the magistrate petition he to lay they calamitous situation before the superior government in order to have the payment of they tribute in kind remit and offer to pay it in money this be the precise moment when as he own profit depend on the misery of the province under he command he endeavor to misuse the accidental power with which he be invest hence it happen that instead of act as a beneficent mediator and support the just solicitation of the native he at first disregard they petition and then all at once transform himself into a zealous collector issue he notification send he satellite into the very field to seize on the produce and in a most inexorable manner insist on collect till necessity compel he to suspend the measure the principal object be attain that be have now become master of the gleanings and scanty crop of he bereft subject on a sudden he disposition change he be move to pity and in the most pathetic language describe to the government the ravages do to the plantation by the hurricane and the utter impossibility of collect in the tribute that year in kind on such a remonstrance he easily obtain permission to change the standing order and proceeding on to collect in some of the remain tribute in money merely to save appearance with perfect impunity he put the finish stroke to the wicked act he have commence by apply to himself all the produce he collector have gather in and place to the credit of the treasury the total amount of the tribute correspond to he jurisdiction in money suppose for example that this have happen in the province of antique where the payment of the capitation-tax generally take place in the unhusk rice rate at two real per cavan and through the effect of a bad season this article should rise as high as ten or twelve real it be clear that the magistrate by account for the tribute with the revenue office in money and collect they in kind at the rate fix by law would by the sale gain a profit of 400 or 500 per cent at the same time the native by the mere circumstance of then pay in kind would have pay the tribute correspond to five or six year in a single one without on that account have free himself from the same charge in the following season -lrb- no check on extortion -rrb- when the extortionate act as these be practice to what length may it not be expect the other excess and abuse of authority be carry to the above it ought moreover to be add that the provincial magistrate have no lieutenant and be unprovided with any other auxiliary in the administration of justice except a accompanying witness and a native director that the scrutiny of they account to which they formerly be subject be now abolish and in short that they have no check upon they or indeed any other person to bear testimony to they irregularity except the friendless and miserable victim of they despotism and avarice notwithstanding however what be above state it sometimes happen that a magistrate be to be meet with distinguish from the rest by he prudence and good conduct but this be a miracle for by the very circumstance of he be allow to trade he be place in a situation to abuse the wide power confide to he and preferably to attend to he personal interest in fact if the principle be in itself defective it must naturally be expect the consequence will be equally baneful the lamentable abuse here notice be but too true as well as many other pass over in silence and the worst of all be that there be no hope of remedy they thoroughly unless the present system of interior administration be altogether change in vain would it be to allege the possibility of remove the evil by the timely and energetic interposition of the protector of the native for although this office be in itself highly respectable it can not in any way reach the multitude of excess commit and much less prevent they not only because the minister who exercise it reside in the city where complaint be seldom bring in unless they come through the channel of the parish curate but also on account of the difficulty of fully establish the charge against the magistrate in the way the native be at present depress by fear and threat as well as restrained by the sub-governor and other inferior officer of justice who be dependent upon and hold they situation from the magistrate be interested in they monopoly and extortionate act be keep from public view -lrb- less complaisant law need -rrb- if therefore it be not possible entirely to eradicate the vice under which the interior administration of these island labor owe to the difficulty of find person possess of the necessary virtue and talent to govern in a upright and judicious manner let we at least prevent the evil out of the too great condescension of we own law in the infancy of colony it have be the maxim of all government to encourage the emigration and settlement of inhabitant from the mother-country without pay much attention to the means by which this be to be do it be not to be wonder at that for reason of state defect be overlook -- at such period be even deem necessary hence the relaxation in the law in favor of those who quit they native land carry over with they to strange country they property and acquirement hence no doubt also be derive the full power grant to those who take in charge the subjection and administration of the new province in order that they might govern and at the same time carry on they traffic with the native notwithstanding the manifest incompatibility of the two occupation or rather the certainty that ought to have be foresee that public duty would generally be postpone when place in competition with private interest and the anxious desire of acquire wealth subsequently that happen which be in fact to be dread viz what at first be tolerate as a necessary evil sanction by the lapse of time have at length become a legitimate right or rather a compensation for the suppose trouble attach to the fulfillment of the duty of civil magistrate whilst they as already observe think of nothing but themselves and undergo no other trouble or inconvenience than usually fall on the lot of any other private merchant in the philippine at least many year have elapse since the native peaceably submit to the dominion of the king every motive have cease that could formerly and in a certain degree justify the indulgence so much abused at the same time that no plausible pretext whatever exist for its further continuation although hitherto the number of whites compare to that of the people of color have not be great as the whole of the provincial magistracy collectorship and subaltern government do not exceed twenty-seven the scarcity of spaniard ought not to be allege as a sufficient reason nor can it be doubt these situation might at any time be properly fill if the person on whom the choice should fall be only certain of live with decency and in a suitable manner without be carry away with the flattering hope of withdraw from office with ten twenty and even as high as fifty thousand dollar of property as have heretofore be the case but satisfied with a due and equivalent salary they might receive as a reward for the public service they perform i do not therefore see why the government should hesitate in resolve to put a stop to evil which the people of the philippine have not cease to deplore from the time of the conquest by proscribe under the most severe penalty the power of trading as now exercise by the provincial magistrate the time be come when this struggle between duty and sordid interest ought to end and reason as well as enlighten policy demand that in this respect we legislation should be reform in order that the mace of justice instead of be prostitute in search of lucre may henceforwards be wholly employ in the support of equity and the protection of society -lrb- urgence of reform -rrb- the only objection which at first sight might be start against the suggestion here throw out be the increase expense which would fall on the treasury owe to the necessity of appropriate competent salary for the interior magistrate under the new order of thing independent however of the fact that the rapid improvement the province must assume in every point of view would superabundantly make up this trifling difference yet suppose the sacrifice be gratuitous and even of some moment it ought not on that account to be omit since there be no public object more important to the sovereign himself than to make the necessary provision for the decorum of the magistracy the due administration of justice and the maintenance of good order among he subject the position be establish that a number of whites more than sufficient might be obtain eligible and fit to perform the duty of civil magistrate which they would be induce to undertake if adequate term be only propose it would seem that no ill consequence might be expect from at once assimilate the regulation of these provincial judicature to those of the corregimiento or mayoralty of town in spain or in make out a express statute on a triple scale for three class of magistrate grant to they emolument equivalent to the greater or lesser extent of the respective jurisdiction as far as regard the pay it ought to be so arrange as to act as a sufficient stimulus to induce european colonist to embrace this career in a fix and permanent way which hitherto they have only resort to as a five year ' speculation conformably to this suggestion and owe to the lesser value attach to money in indium compare with europe on account of the greater abundance of the necessaries of life i be of opinion that it would be expedient to affix a annual allowance of $ 2000 to each of the appointment of the six principal and most populous province $ 1500 for the next in importance and for the twelve or thirteen remain at the rate of $ 1000 each leave to the candidate the option of rise accord to they length of service and good conduct from the lowest to the highest as be the case in spain -lrb- object to be gain -rrb- the first part of the plan above point out embrace two object the one be to prevent the provincial magistrate from carry on traffic thus deprive they of every pretext to defraud the native of what be they own and the other to form in the course of a few year a class of man hitherto unknown in the philippine island who teach by practice may be enable to govern the province in a more correct and regular manner and acquire more extended knowledge especially in the judicial proceedings of the first instance which owe to this defect frequently compel the litigant to incur useless expense and greatly embarrass the ordinary course of justice although the second part at first seem to involve a increase expense of $ 36000 or $ 37000 annually when well consider this sum will be find not to exceed $ 20000 because it will be necessary to deduct from the above estimate the amount of three per cent under the exist regulation allow to the magistrate for the collection of the native tribute in they character of subdelegate generally amount to $ 16000 or $ 17000 besides only take into account such real and effective disbursement or extraordinary expense as in fact they may legally have incur in the performance of they duty should it however be deem expedient from cause just in they nature hereafter to exonerate the native from the obligation of pay tribute by which mean the amount deducted for the three per cent commission could not then be bring into account let I be allow to ask what enlighten government would hesitate submit to a additional expense of so trifle a import in exchange for behold more than two million of man forever free from the extortionate act of they old magistrate and through the effect of the new regulation the latter convert into real father of the people over whom they be place how different would then be the aspect these fine province would present to the eye of the philosophical observer who would in that case be able to calculate to what a extent the progress of agriculture and industry in these island might be carry -lrb- demoralization of over-seas service -rrb- nevertheless i do not wish to insinuate that by the better organization of the provincial government the present irregularity and abuse of authority would entirely cease because i be aware more especially in the indy that the person who hold public situation usually have too exaggerated idea of they own personal importance and easily mistake the gratification of they own whim for firmness of character in the necessity of cause themselves to be respect still it be a incontestable fact that by remove the chief temptation and rescind altogether the license to trade the just complaint prefer by the native against the spaniard would cease the motive of those continual dispute which arise between the magistrate and the minister of the gospel exercise they function in the same province and the zealous defender of the rights of they parishioner would be remove and the inhabitant of manila extend they mercantile operation to the interior without the dread of see they obstruct through the powerful competition of the magistrate in authority there would be induce to settle in or connect themselves with the province and thus diffuse they knowledge activity and money among the inhabitant the true means of encourage the whole what have already be say will suffice to convince the lover of truth and the friend of general prosperity how urgent it be to introduce as early as possible the reform propose into the interior administration of this important although neglect colony and it be to be hope that the government guide by these same sentiment will not be lead away by those narrow-minded people who predict danger from every thing that be new but after due and mature deliberation resolve to adopt a measure dictate by reason and at the same time conformable to the best interest of the state of little avail would have be the valor and constancy with which legaspus and he worthy companion overcome the native of these island if the apostolic zeal of the missionary have not second they exertion and aid to consolidate the enterprise the latter be the real conqueror they who without any other arm than they virtue win over the good will of the islander cause the spanish name to be beloved and give to the king as it be by a miracle two million more of submissive and christian subject these be the legislator of the barbarous horde who inhabit the island of this immense archipelago realize by they mild persuasion the allegorical prodigy of amphion and orpheus -lrb- pioneer philippine government a theocracy -rrb- as the mean the missionary call in to they aid in order to reduce and civilize the indian be preach and other spiritual labor and although scatter about and act separately they be still subject to the authority of they prelate who like so many chief direct the grand work of conversion the government primitively establish in these colony must necessarily have partake greatly of the theocratical order and beyond doubt it continue to be so till by the lapse of time the number of colonist increase as well as the effective strength of the royal authority so as to render the govern system uniform with that establish in the other ultramarine dominion of spain this be also deduce from the fragment still remain of the first constitution or mode of government introduce in the batane island and mission of cagayan administer by the dominican friar in a spiritual and temporal manner as well as from what may frequently be observe in the other province by any one who bestow the smallest attention although the civil magistracy have since be regulate and they respective attribute determine with due precision it have not hitherto be possible notwithstanding the pain take to make the contrary appear to do without the personal authority and influence the parish curate possess over they flock the government have in fact constantly be oblige to avail themselves of this aid as the most powerful instrument to insure respect and a due subordination in such manner that although the parish curate be not at present equally authorize to interfere in the civil administration in point of fact they be themselves the real administrator -lrb- standing of parish priest -rrb- it happen that as the parish curate be the consoler of the afflict the peacemaker of family the promoter of useful idea the preacher and example of every thing good as in he liberality be see to shine and the indian behold he alone in the midst of they without relative without traffic and always busy in they care and improvement they become accustomed to live satisfied and contented under he paternal direction and deliver up to he the whole of they confidence in this way render the master of they wish nothing be do without the advice or rather consent of the curate the subaltern governor on receive a order from the superior magistrate before he take any step go to the minister to obtain he sanction and it be he in fact who tacitly give the mandate for execution or prevent its be carry into effect as the father of he flock he arrange or direct the lawsuit of he parishioner it be he who draw out they writings go to the capital to plead for the indian oppose he prayer and sometimes he threat to the violent act of the provincial magistrate and arrange every thing in the most fit and quiet manner in a word it be not possible for any human institution to be more simple and at the same time more firmly establish or from which so many advantage might be derive in favor of the state as the one so justly admire in the spiritual ministry of these island it may therefore be consider a strange fatality when the secret and true art of govern a colony so different from any other as be that of the philippine consist in the wise use of so powerful a instrument as the one just describe that the superior government within the last few year should have be so much delude as to seek the destruction of a work which on the contrary it be above all other advisable to sustain in this as well as many other case we see how difficult or rather how absurd it be to expect to organize a system of government indistinctly adapt to the genius and disposition of all nation however great the discordance prevail in they physical and moral constitution hence it follow that by wish to assimilate the administrative plan of these province to the one adopt in the section of america inconvenience be unceasingly meet with evidently arise out of this erroneous principle whatever may be assert to the contrary there be no medium it be necessary to insure obedience either through dread and force or respect must be excite by means of love and confidence in order to be convince that the first be not practicable it will only be necessary to weigh well the follow circumstance and reflection the number of the whites compare to that of the native be so small that it can scarcely be estimate in the proportion of 15 to 25000 these province infinitely more populous than those of america be entirely deliver up to the charge of provincial -lrb- friar only check on official -rrb- magistrate who carry with they to the seat of they respective government no other troops than the title of military commandant and they royal commission on parchment besides the friar it sometimes happen that no other white person be to be find in a entire province but the preside magistrate it be the duty of the latter to collect in the king 's revenue to pursue robber appease tumult raise man for the regiment in garrison at manila and cavite regulate and head he people in case of a external invasion and in short it be he who be to do everything in the character of magistrate and in the name of the king consider therefore the effective power require for the due performance of so great a variety of duty and the want of that species of support experience by he who be charge with they can it be deny that it would be risk the security of these dominion too much to attempt forcibly to control they with means so insufficient if the inhabitant become tumultuous and rise up on whom will the magistrate call for aid to repress and punish they in such a predicament be any other alternative leave he than to fly or die in the struggle if among civilized nation it be deem indispensable that authority should always appear accompany with force how can it be expect among indian that the law will otherwise be respect when leave naked and unsupported -lrb- missionary ' achievement -rrb- evidently it be necessary to appeal to aid of another kind and to employ means which although indirect one be beyond all dispute the best adapt to the peculiar circumstance of the country -- mean which by influence the mind excite veneration subdue the rude understanding of the inhabitant and incline they to bear we dominion without repugnance it be well understand what these means be how much they be at hand and how greatly also they have always be envy by other european nation who have seek to extend and consolidate they conquest in both the indy let we listen to la pérouse if we wish to know and admire the army with which we missionary subdue the native of both california let we read dispassionately the wonderful deed of the jesuit in other part of america and above all let we visit the philippine island and with astonishment shall we there behold extend range stud with temple and spacious convent the divine worship celebrate with pomp and splendor regularity in the street and even luxury in the house and dress school of the first rudiment in all the town and the inhabitant well verse in the art of write we shall there see causeway raise bridge of a good architecture build and in short all the measure of good government and police in the greatest part of the country carry into effect yet the whole be due to the exertion apostolic labor and pure patriotism of the minister of religion let we travel over the province and we shall there see town of 5000 10000 and 20000 indian peacefully govern by one weak old man who with he door open at all hour sleep quiet and secure in he dwelling without any other magic or any other guard than the love and respect with which he have know to inspire he flock and when this be contemplate can it be deem possible through foolish jealousy and vain wish for those person only point out by the general law in ordinary case to intervene in the government of the native that the fruit of so much time constancy be not to be lose but also by hereafter disregard and reject a co-operation as efficient as it be economical that attempt should purposely be make to destroy the mainspring of the whole of this political machine -lrb- curtail priestly authority -rrb- such nevertheless be the mistaken idea which within the last few year have unhappily lead to the adoption of measure diametrically oppose to the public interest under the pretext of curtail the excessive authority of the parish-curate the superior government not satisfy with have deprive the minister of the faculty of personally prescribe certain correctional punishment which although of little moment when apply with discretion greatly contribute to fortify they ascendency and consequently that of the sovereign but in order to exclude and divest they of all intervention in the civil administration a direct attempt have also be make to lower the esteem in which they be hold by awaken the distrust of the indian and as much as possible remove he to a greater distance from they in proof of this and in order that what have be say may not be deem a exaggeration it will suffice to quote the substance of two regulation remarkable for they obvious tendency to weaken the influence and credit of the spiritual administrator by one of these it be enact that in order to prevent the abuse and notorious malversation of the fund of the sanctuary specially applicable to the expense of the festivity and worship of each parish and arise out of the real and half for this purpose contribute by each tributary person and collect and privately administer by the curate the same shall hereafter be keep in a chest with three key and lodge in the head-town of each province the key be to be leave one in possession of the chief magistrate another in the hand of the governor of the respective town and the remain one with the parish-curate by the other measure it be declare as a standing rule that no indian who may lately have be employ in the domestic service of the curate shall in he own town be consider eligible to any office belong to the judicial department on measure of this kind comment be unnecessary they meaning and effect can not be mistaken i shall therefore merely observe that no untimely means could have be devise more injurious to the state to the propagation of religion and even to the native themselves it be in fact a most strange affair that such endeavor should have be make to impeach the purity by at the same time degrade the respectable character of the parish-curate more particularly at a period when owe to partality and the scarcity of religious man it would have seem more natural to uphold and by new inducement encourage the zeal and authority of the remain few this step appear the more singular i repeat at a moment when neither by suspend the send out of missionary to china and the almost entire abandonment of the spiritual conquest of the igorot and other infidel tribe inhabit the interior of these island have the above spanish laborer be able to carry on the ordinary administration nor prevent entire province from be transfer as be now the case into the hand of indian and mestizo clergyman of the sangley race who through they great ignorance corrupt moral and total want of decorum universally incur the contempt of the flock commit to they care and in consequence of they tyrannical conduct cause the people to sigh for the mild yoke of they ancient pastor -lrb- friar bulwark of spanish rule -rrb- if therefore it be the wish of the government to retain the subjection of this colony and raise it to the high degree of prosperity of which it be susceptible the first thing in my opinion that ought to be attend to be the good organization of its spiritual administration on this subject we must not deceive ourselves i again repeat that as long as the local government in consequence of the want of military force and owe to the scarcity of european do not in itself possess the means of insure obedience no other alternative remain it be necessary to call in to its aid the powerful influence of religion and to obtain from the peninsula fresh supplies of missionary as in they nature the latter be essentially different from the other public functionary it be well know they neither seek nor aspire to any remuneration for they labor they only hope be to obtain in the opinion of the community at large that degree of respect to which they justly consider themselves entitle let therefore they pre-eminence be retain to they : let they be treat with decorum the care and direction of the indian confide to they charge and they always be find unite in support of justice and the legitimate authority -lrb- unwise to discredit priest -rrb- nothing be more unjust and of nothing have the spiritual director of the province so much reason to complain than the little discernment with which they have sometimes be judge and condemn by cause the misconduct of some of they individual member to affect the whole body hence be it that no one can read without shame and indignation the insidious suggestion and allusion derogatory to they character contain in the regulation of government frame at manila in the year 1758 and which although modify by order of the king be at the present moment still in force owe to the want of other and find in a print form in the hand of every one grant that in some particular instance real cause of complaint might have exist yet in the end what do it matter if here and there a religious character have abuse the confidence repose in he as long as the spirit by which the generality of they be actuate correspond to the sanctity of they state and be besides conformable to the view of government why should we be eternally run after a ideal of perfection which can never be meet with nor indeed be this necessary in the present construction of society -lrb- testimony in they behalf -rrb- if however any weight be to be attach to imposture with which from personal motive attempt have be make to obscure the truth and prejudice the public mind against the regular clergy or if the just defense on which i have enter should be attribute to partiality or visionary impression let the archive of the colonial department be open and we shall there find the report draw up by order of the king on November 26 1804 by the governor of the philippine island don rafael maria de aguilar with a view to convey information regard the enquiry at that time institute respect the reduction of the inhabitant of the island of mindoro a report extremely honorable to the regular clergy and dictate by the experience that general have acquire during a period of more than twelve year he have govern therein also will be see the answer to the consultation address to he successor in the command don mariano fernandez de folgueras under date of April 25 1809 in which he most earnestly beseech the king to endeavor by every possible means to send out religious missionary deplore the decline and want of order he have observe with he own eye in the town administer by native clergyman and point out the urgent necessity of intrust the spiritual government of these province to the dexterous management of the former testimony of such weight be more than sufficient at once to refute the calumny and contrary opinion put forth on this subject and at the same time serve as irrefragable proof of the scrupulous impartiality with which i have endeavor to discuss so delicate a matter in a general point of view i have allude to the erroneous system which during the last few year have be pursue by the government with regard to the parish-curate employ in the interior and also sufficiently point out the advantage reasonably to be expect if the government act on a different policy or rather guide by other motive of state instead of follow the literal text of we indian legislation should come to the firm determination of indirectly divest themselves of a small portion of they authority in favor of the religious laborer who be act on the spot have say thus much i shall proceed to such further detail as be more immediately connect with the present chapter -lrb- ecclesiastical organization -rrb- the ecclesiastical jurisdiction be exercise by the metropolitan archbishop of manila aid by the three suffragan of nueva segovia nueva cacere and cebu the archbishopric of manila comprehend the province of tondo bulacan pampanga bataan cavite laguna de bay zambale batanga and the island of mindoro the bishopric of nueva segovia comprehend the province of pangasinan the mission of ituy and paniqui the province of iloco cagayan and the mission of the batane island that of nueva caceres comprehend the province of tayaba nueva ecija camarine and albay that of cebu comprehend the island of cebu and bohol iloilo capiz and antique in the island of panay the island of la paragua negro and samar misami caraga and zamboanga in that of mindanao and the mariana island the archbishop have a salary of $ 5000 and the bishop $ 4000 each the curacy exceed 500 and although all of they originally be in charge of person belong to the religious order owe to the expulsion of the jesuit and the excessive scarcity of regular clergy so many native priest have gradually be introduce among they that at present nearly half the town be under they direction the rest be administer by the religious order of st augustine st dominic and st franci in the follow manner : town the augustinian 88 the barefooted augustinian -lrb- recoleto -rrb- 52 the dominican 57 the franciscan 96 total 293 it ought however to be observe that since the detailed statement be make out from which the above extract have be take so many member of the religious order have die that it have be necessary to replace they in many town with native clergyman as a temporary expedient and till new missionary shall arrive from spain -lrb- dual supervision over friar -rrb- the monastic curate be immediately subject to they provincial superior in the character of friar but depend on the diocesan bishop in they quality of parish priest and in like manner obey they own provincial vicar as well as those of the bishop they be alternately eligible to the dignity of they own order and generally promote or relieve from they ministry at the discretion of the provincial chapter or accord to the final determination of the vice-patron or bishop affix to the triple list present to he besides the ordinary obligation attach to the care of soul they be enjoin to assist at the election of governor and other officer of justice in they respective town in order to inform the chief magistrate respect the aptitude of the person propose for election on the triple list and to point out the legal defect attributable to any of they on this account they be not however allow to interfere in the smallest degree with any of these proceedings and much less make a formal proposal as most assuredly would be advisable if permit so to do in favor of any particular person or person in they opinion fit for the discharge of the above mention duty it be they obligation to ascertain the correctness of the tribute list present to they for they examination and signature by the chief of the clan by carefully compare they with the register keep in they own department and also to certify the general return without which requisite the statement transmit by the chief magistrate to the accountant-general 's office be not admit above all they be bind to affix they signature to the effective payment make by the magistrate to they parishioner on account of daily labor and to certify similarly the value of material employ in public work besides the above they be continually call upon to draw up circumstantial report or declaration require by the superior tribunal they receive frequent injunction to co-operate in the increase of the king 's revenue and the encouragement of agriculture and industry in a word there be scarcely a thing to which they attention be not call and to which it be not expect they should contribute by they influence directly or indirectly -lrb- allowance from treasury -rrb- the royal treasury pay they a annual allowance equal to $ 180 in kind and money for each five hundred tribute under they care and this add to the emolument of the church render the total proceeds of a curacy generally equivalent to about from six to eight real for each entire tribute but from this allowance be to be deduct the expense of coadjutor subsistence servant horse and all the other charge arise out of the administration of such wearisome duty nor be the parishioner under any other obligation than to provide the church with assistant or sacristan and singer and the curate with provision at tariff price -lrb- need of more european clergy -rrb- finally as from what have be above state it would appear that as many as five hundred religious person be necessary for the spiritual administration of the interior town and district besides the number requisite to do the duty and fill the dignity of the respective order and convent in the capital independent of which there ought to be a proportionate surplus applicable to the progressive reduction of the infidel tribe inhabit the upland as well as the preaching of the gospel in china and cochinchina most assuredly it would be expedient to assemble and keep together a body of no less than seven hundred person if it be the wish of the government on a tolerable scale to provide for the want of these remote mission at the present moment the number do not exceed three hundred include superannuated exempt from service and lay-brother whilst the native clergyman in effective possession of curacy and include substitute coadjutor and weekly preacher exceed one thousand and as the latter in general unworthy of the priesthood be rather injurious than really serviceable to the state it should not be deem unjust if they be altogether deprive of the dignity of parish curate and only allow to exercise they function in necessary case or by attach they to the curacy in the quality of coadjutor by this plan at the same time that the town would be provide with suitable and adequate minister the native clergyman would be distribute in a proper manner and place near the religious person charge to officiate would acquire the necessary knowledge and decorum and in the course of time might obtain character and respect among they countryman to many a measure of this kind may in some respects appear harsh and arbitrary but person practically acquaint with the subject and country will deem it indispensable and the only means that can be resort to in order to stop the rapid decline remarkable in this interesting department of public administration fortunately no ground objection can be allege against it nor be there any danger of serious consequence result from the plan be carry into effect in vain would it be to argue that if the reform be to take place a large number of priest would be reduce to beggary owe to the want of occupation because as thing now stand many of the religious curate employ three or four coadjutor and no doubt they would then gladly undertake to make provision for the remainder of those who may be throw out of employment on the other hand with equal truth it may be observe that the inhabitant of the interior far from regret or take part on behalf of the native clergy would celebrate as a day of gladness and rejoice the removal of the latter in return for they beloved castilian father -lrb- restriction of native ordination recommend -rrb- in case the idea above suggest should be adopt in all they part it may be proper to add that a injunction ought to be lay on the reverend bishop in future to confer holy order with more scrupulosity and economy than unfortunately heretofore have be the case by represent to they that if at certain period the pope have be influence by powerful reason not to insist on ordination take place in europe as be formerly the case very weighty motive now equally urge the government to decline in the philippine island pay so much to religious vocation and to relax in the policy of raise the native to the dignity of the priesthood -lrb- moro depredation -rrb- long have the inhabitant of the philippine deplore and in vain remonstrate against the ravages commit on they coast and settlement by the barbarous native of the island of mindanao basilan and jolo as well as by the malano ilano and tirone moro and other and there be nothing that so much deserve the attention and interest the honor of the captain-general command in this quarter as a early and efficient attempt to check and punish these cruel enemy it be indeed true that in the year 1636 and 1638 general don sebastian hurtado de corcuera undertake in person and happily carry into effect the reduction of the sultan of mindanao and the conquest of the island of jolo place in the latter a governor and establish three military post there under the protection of the garrison of which christianity be considerably extend it be equally true that on the subsequent abandonment of this important acquisition owe to the government be compel to attend to other urgent matter the enemy acquire a greater degree of audacity and the captain-general in command afterwards send armament to check he inroad on one of these occasion we troops oblige a army of more than 5000 moro who have closely beset the fortress of zamboanga to raise the siege and also in the year 1731 and 1734 fresh detachment of we man be land on the island of jolo capul and basilan and they success be follow by the destruction and ruin of the fortify post vessel and settlement of those perfidious mahometan it be not however less certain that at the period above mention the war be carry on rather from motive of punishment and revenge and suggest by a sudden and pass zeal than in conformity to any progressive and well-combined system since then these laudable military enterprise have be entirely neglect as well on account of the indolence of some of the governor as the too great confidence place in the protestation of friendship and treaty of peace with which from time to time the sultan of jolo and mindanao have seek to lull they to sleep they want of sincerity be prove by the circumstance of the piracy of they respective subject not cease the chief sometimes feign they be carry on without they license or knowledge and at other excuse themselves on the plea of they inability to restrain the insolence of the tirone and other independent tribe nevertheless it be notorious that the above-mentioned sultan indirectly encourage the practice of privateering by afford every aid in they power to those who fit out vessel and purchase from the pirate all the christian they capture and bring to they -lrb- a missionary 's appeal -rrb- father juan angele superior of the mission establish in jolo at the request of sultan alimudin himself -lrb- or ferdinand i as he be afterwards unworthily call on be make a christian with no other view than the better to gain the confidence of the spaniard -rrb- in a report he send to the government from the above island under date of September 24 1748 describe the sultan 's singular artifice to amuse he and frustrate the object of he mission fully confirm all that have just be say and on close he report make use of the follow remarkable word : when be it we shall have have enough of treaty with these moro for have we not before we the experience of more than one hundred year during which period of time they have not keep a single article in any way burdensome to or bind on themselves they will never observe the condition of peace because they property consist in the possession of slave and with they they traffic the same as other nation do with money sooner will the hawk release he prey from he talon than they will put a end to they piracy the cause of they be still unfaithful to spain arise out of this matter have be take up by fit and start and not in the serious manner it ought to have be do to make war on they in a effectual manner fleet must not be employ but they must be attack on land and in they post in the interior for it be much more advisable at once to spend ten with advantage and in a strenuous manner to attain a important object than to lay out twenty by degree and without fruit -lrb- governmental lenience -rrb- it be a undeniable fact that the government lull and deceive by the frequent embassy and submissive and crouching letter which those fawn sultan have be in the habit of transmit to they instead of adopt the energetic measure urge by the above-mentioned missionary have constantly endeavor to renew and secure the friendship of those chief by means of treaty and commercial relation grant with this view ample licens to every one who venture to ship merchandise to jolo and wink at the traffic carry on by the governor of the fortress of zamboanga with the people of mindanao whilst the latter on they part sport with we foolish credulity have never cease wage a most destructive war against we by attack we town situate on the coast not even except those of the island of luzon they have sometimes carry they audacity so far as to show themselves in the neighborhood of the capital itself and at other take up they temporary residence in the district of mindoro and in place of the jurisdiction of samar and leyte and in short even dare to form a establishment or general deposit for they plunder in the island of buras where they quietly remain during the year 1797 1798 and 1799 to the great injury of we commerce and settlement -lrb- authority for war not lack -rrb- this want of exertion to remedy evil of so grievous a nature be the more to be deplore as the philippine governor have at all time be fully authorize to carry on war and promote the destruction of the moro under every sacrifice and especially by the royal order and decree of October 26 and November 1 1758 and July 31 1766 in all of which he majesty recommend in the most earnest manner the importance of punish the audacity of the barbarous infidel he majesty be desirous that in order to maintain he subject of the philippine free from the piracy and captivity they so frequently experience no expense or pain should be spare it be further declare that as this be a object deeply affect the conscience of he majesty he especially enjoin the aforesaid government to observe he order and finally with a view to provide for the exigency arise out of similar enterprise the viceroy of new spain be instruct to attend to the punctual remittance not only of the usual situado or annual allowance but also of the additional sum of $ 70000 in the first and succeed year etc in a word we monarch ferdinand vi and carlo iii omit nothing that could in any way promote so important a object whether it be that the governor have disregard such repeat order from the sovereign or mistaken the means by which they be to be carry into effect certain it be that the unhappy inhabitant of the philippine have continue to be witness and at the same time the victim of the culpable apathy of those who have successively hold the command of these island within the last fifty or sixty year -lrb- native effort for self-defence -rrb- abandon therefore to they own resource and from time to time relieve by the presence of a few gunboat which after scour the coast have never be able to come up with the light and fast sailing vessel of the enemy the inhabitant of we town and settlement have be under the necessity of intrenching and fortify themselves in the best way they be able by open ditch and plant a breastwork of stake and palisade crown with watch tower or a wooden or stone castle precaution which sometimes be not sufficient against the nocturnal irruption and robbery of the moro more especially when they come with any strength and fire-arm in general scarce among the native -lrb- moro piratical craft -rrb- the panco or prow use by the moro be light and simple vessel build with numerous thin plank and rib with a small draft of water and be man by dexterous rower they appear and disappear from the horizon with equal celerity fly or attack whenever they can do it with evident advantage some of those vessel be large and fit out with fifty a hundred and sometimes two hundred man the shot of they scanty and defective artillery be very uncertain because they generally carry they gun suspend in sling but they be to be dread and be extremely dexterous in the management of the campilan or sword of which they wear the blade long and well temper when they have any attack of importance in view they generally assemble to the number of two hundred galley or more and even in they ordinary cruise a considerable number navigate together as dread and the scarcity of inhabitant in the bisayan island cause great range of the coast to be leave unsettled it be very easy for the moro to find numerous lurking-place and stronghold whenever they be press and they constant practice in these case be to enter the river grind they vessel and hide they among the mangrove and thick foliage and fly with they arm to the mountain thus almost always laugh at the effort of they opponent who seldom venture to follow they into the thicket and morass where the musket be of no use and a single step can not be take with any security -lrb- outrage suffer -rrb- the fatal consequence and ravages of this system of cruise and warfare round the island be incalculable besides plunder and burn the town and settlement these bloody pirate put the old and helpless to the sword destroy the cattle and plantation and annually carry off to they own home as many as a thousand captive of both sex who if they be poor and without hope of be redeem be destine to drag out a miserable existence amidst the most fatiguing and painful labor sometimes accompany with torment such be the dread and apprehension of these sea that only those navigate and carry on trade in they who be able to arm and man they vessel in a way correspond to the great risk they have to run or other whom want compel to disregard the imminent danger which await they among the latter class the bisayan or paint -lrb- tattoo -rrb- native be distinguish a extremely warlike people of whom great use might be make rear from they infancy amidst danger and battle and greatly resemble the moro in they feature and darkness of skin they be equally alike in the agility with which they manage the long sword and lance and such be the courage and implacable odium with which they treat they enemy that if not take by surprise they sell they life very dear sacrifice themselves in a most heroic manner rather than to be lead away as captive in order however that a more correct idea may be form of the wicked policy and atrocious disposition of these moro and with a view to do away with the misconception of those who be of opinion that incentive to trade and other slow and indirect means ought to be employ for the purpose of overcome they it will suffice to quote the follow example among a number of other even more recent one which might equally be bring forward -lrb- instance of treachery -rrb- in 1796 the governor of zamboanga dispatch with regular passport and under a safe conduct obtain from the sultan of mindanao lieutenant don pantaleon arcilla with a sergeant eight man and a guide in order to bring into the fortress the cattle belong to the king 's farm which have stray away and get up in the land of the above-mentioned mahometan prince five day after they departure whilst the lieutenant be take he meal at the house of a datu or chief name oroncaya he be suddenly surround by seventy moro who seize upon he bind he to a tree and then flay he alive from the forehead to the ankle in this miserable and defenceless situation the barbarous datu wreak he vengeance on he body by pierce it all over with he kris or dagger and then order he skin to be hang up on the pole of one of he ferocious banner in the year 1798 whilst the schooner san josé lay at anchor at tabitabus near jolo the son-in-law and nephew of the sultan go out to meet she in two large prow exhibit at the same time every demonstration of peace and send forward a small vessel with refreshment they invite the captain to come on board of they the latter deceive by the apparent frankness and high rank of the moro with the greatest good faith accept the invitation and proceed on board accompany by two sailor with a view to make arrangement for barter scarcely have they get on board of the large prow when they be surround and seize and the captain who be a spaniard compel to sign a order to he mate to deliver up the schooner which he reluctantly do under the hope of save he own and he companion ' live the moro proceed on board the spanish vessel and in the meantime the two sailor be take back to the boat and there kill with dagger in the presence of all the schooner 's sail be next hoist and she be bring into jolo where the cargo and crew be sell in sight of and with the knowledge and consent of the sultan a atrocity for which he have always refuse to give any satisfaction to a nation thus openly and barbarously outrage by he own relative and in defiance of the exist treaty of peace such be the cruel character and such the execrable policy of the moro generally inhabit the island situate in the philippine sea -lrb- growth of moro power -rrb- the most lamentable circumstance be that these infidel race at all time to be dread owe to they number and savage ferocity after the lapse of a century of almost uninterrupted prosperity and encourage also by we inattention have at length gradually attain so formidable a degree of power that they reduction now must be consider a extremely arduous and expensive enterprise although a object urgently requisite and worthy of the greatness of a nation like ours in order however that the difficulty of so important a undertaking may be justly appreciate it may be proper to observe that the island of mindanao alone at the present moment contain a population equal if not larger than that of luzon and the margin of the immense lake situate in its center be cover with well-built town fill with convenience the fruit of they annual privateering and of the traffic they carry on with the inhabitant of the island of jolo true it be and it may be say equally fortunate that they be greatly divide into party subject to a variety of datus or independent chief in name only inferior to the one who style himself the sultan of the whole island as however the fortress and district of caraga misami and zamboanga occupy nearly three part of the circumference of the island these moro freely possess no more than the southern part commence at about twenty-five league from cape san augustin and end in the vicinity of zamboanga so that the largest number of they naval armament be fit out and issue to sea either by the great river of mindanao or from some of the many bay and inlet situate on the above extent of coast -lrb- jolo -rrb- the island of jolo although small compare with that of mindanao be nevertheless in itself the most important as well as the real hotbed of all the piracy commit its inhabitant accord to the unanimous report of captive and various merchant in skill and valor greatly exceed the other mahometan who infest these sea the sultan be absolute and he subject carry on trade with borneo celebe and the other malayan tribe scatter about this great archipelago in the port of jolo as already notice sale be make of christian capture by the other moro the chinese of amoy as well as the dutch and british carry they manufacture goods opium and arm receive in return black pepper bee ' wax balato edible nest tortoise-shell mother-of-pearl gold dust pearl etc and from manila also a vessel usually go once a year with goods but all act with the greatest precaution in this dangerous traffic guard as much as possible against the insidious act of that perfidious government the great number of renegade of all cast who have successively naturalized themselves there the abundance of arm and the prevail opulence have in every respect contribute to render this island a formidable and powerful state the capital be surround with fort and thick wall and the famous height stand near it in case of emergency afford a secure asylum where the woman can take refuge and the treasure of the sultan and public be deposit whilst in the plain below the contest may be maintain by more than 50000 combatant already very dexterous in the use of the musket and of a bold and courageous character the navy of these islander be also very respectable for besides a great number of smaller prow and war-boat they have some of a large size capable of carry heavy artillery on they deck mount on corresponding carriage and not suspend in sling as be the custom of the people of mindanao in a word jolo be a island govern by a system of administration extremely vigorous and decisive dread and superstition sustain the throne of the tyrant and the fame of he greatness frequently bring to he foot the ulema or missionary of the koran even as far as from the furthest margin of the red sea the prince and people unanimous in the implacable odium with which they view all christian can not be divide or keep on term of peace and if it be really wish to free these sea from the evil and great danger with which they be at all time threaten it be necessary at once to strike at the root by landing and attack the jolonese in they stronghold and break the charm by which they be hold together this at least be the constant and unshaken opinion of all experienced person and those verse in philippine affair and if by the substantial reason and exist circumstance i convince myself sufficiently to openly recommend war to be undertake against the moro and push with the utmost vigor and more particularly commence the work by a formal invasion of jolo still as i feel myself incompetent to trace a precise plan or to discuss the minute detail more immediately connect with the object i feel it necessary to confine myself to the point out in general term of the means i judge most conducive to the happy issue of so arduous but important a enterprise leave the rest to more able and experienced hand -lrb- council of war recommend -rrb- as a previous step i conceive that a council of war ought to be form in manila compose of the captain-general the commander of the navy artillery and engineer department as well as of the regular corps who in conformity to all the antecedent information lodge in the secretary 's office for the captain-generalship and the previous report of some one of the ex-governor of zamboanga and the best inform missionary may be enable to deliberate and proceed on to a mature examination of the whole affair take into they special consideration everything regard jolo its early reduction the number of vessel and man require for this purpose the most advantageous point of attack and the best season in which this can be carry into execution after all these matter have be determine upon the operation in question ought to be connect with the other partial and general arrangement of the government in order that a plan the best adapt to locality and exist circumstance may be choose and without its be necessary to wait for the king 's approbation of the means resolve upon owe to the distance of the court and the necessity of act with celerity if however on account of the deference in every respect due to the sovereign it should be think proper to reconcile he previous sanction with the necessity of act without loss of time the best mode would be to send from spain a officer of high rank fully authorize who as practice on other occasion might give he sanction in the name of the king to the resolution adopt by the council of war and take under he own immediate charge if it should be so deem expedient the command of the expedition against jolo receive the appointment of governor of the island as soon as the conquest should be carry into effect as a just reward for he zeal and valor -lrb- war popular in philippine -rrb- suppose a uniformity of opinion to prevail with regard to the expediency of attempt the subjugation of jolo and supposing also the existence of the necessary fund to meet the expense of a corresponding armament it may be positively rely upon that the project would be extremely popular and meet with the entire concurrence and support of the philippine island the military man aware of the great riches know to exist in the propose theater of operation would emulously come forward to offer they service under a hope of share the booty and the warlike native of the bisaya would be impel on by they hatred to the moro and they ardent wish to avenge the blood of they father and child on the other hand the abundance of regular and well disciplined officer and troops at present in the colony and the number of gun-boat find in the port a want of which on other occasion have always be experience will afford ample scope for the equipment of a force competent to the important enterprise in view in fact if the operation be arrange in a systematic manner and all the precaution and rule observe as be usual in case of attack premeditate against european and civilized establishment there be no reason to expect any other than a flattering and decisive result since in reality the whole would be direct against a enemy contemptible on account of he barbarism and he comparative ignorance of the art of war -lrb- native assistance -rrb- the preparation deem necessary be make in manila and the bisayan auxiliary assemble beforehand in zamboanga with they arm and respective chief the whole of the operation in question it may be safely say might be terminate within the period of three or four month suppose even 2000 regular troops be destine for this expedition with a corresponding train of field piece and at the moment there should not be find in the island a sufficient number of larger vessel to embargo or freight for they conveyance a competent quantity of coaster galley and small craft might be meet with at any time sufficiently capacious and secure to carry the man this substitute will be find the less inconvenient because as the navigation be to be perform among the island during the prevalence of the north wind usually a favorable and steady season of the year the voyage will consequently be safe and easy it will also be possible to arrive at the point agree upon as a general rendezvous in twenty or five-and-twenty day which place for many reason ought to be the fortress of zamboanga situate in front of jolo and at moderate distance from that island it be from this port that in former time the philippine governor usually send out they armament destine to make war against the basilanese and jolonese -lrb- mindanao also need attention -rrb- as soon as this important and memorable enterprise have be carry into effect and the punishment and total subjugation of these faithless mahometan complete and the new conquest place under a military authority in the mean time that the land be distribute and arrangement make to establish the civil administration on the same plan follow in the other province of the philippine government the armament ought to return to zamboanga with all possible speed but after stop by the way to reduce the small island of basilan and leave a fortress and garrison there immediately afterwards and before the various tribe of moro inhabit the island of mindanao have be able to concert among themselves and prepare for they defense it would be advisable to direct partial expedition towards both flank of zamboanga for the purpose of burn the settlement of the native and drive they from the shore into the interior fort ought then to be raise at the mouth of the inlet and river and a fourth district government form in the southern part of the island in such manner that by possession be take of the coast the government and district of zamboanga may be place in contact with the new one establish on the one side and on the other with the district of misami also the new district with that of caraga the western part of which territory be already unite to that of misami such at least be the opinion of lieutenant-colonel don mariano tobia a officer deservedly celebrate for he prudence and consummate skill in these matter and this he substantially express in a council of war hold on August 28 1778 for the purpose of deliberate on the most advisable means to check the moro as appear by a long and intelligent report draw upon this subject on April 26 1800 by the adjutant-general of this colony don rufino suarez in case it should be determine to adopt the means propose by colonel tobia for the purpose of hold the moro of mindanao in check and to which unfortunately due regard have not hitherto be pay notwithstanding the enterprise present very few difficulty owe to the little opposition to be expect from the infidel native the latter would then be leave completely surround and shut up in the heart of the island and they active system of privateer with which they have so many year infested these sea entirely destroy if through the want of garrison and population it should not however be possible to deprive they of all they outlet by which mean they would still be able occasionally to send some of they cruise vessel nevertheless there would be facility with which it would be possible to pursue and counteract the ravages of the few pirate who might furtively escape out of some river while now they be fit out and well manned and armed to the number of one and two hundred war-boat openly in they port -lrb- a plan for future police -rrb- after the emporium of slavery have be destroy by the conquest of jolo and the other general measure adopt as above point out the government would then be in a situation to turn its attention with much greater ease to the arrangement of all the other minor scheme of precaution and protection suit to the difference of circumstance and locality without the concurrence of which the work would be leave imperfect and in some degree the existence of those settle in the new establishment render precarious as however i be unprepared minutely to point out the nature of these measure or distinctly to lay down a ground-work for future civilization and improvement i shall merely observe that what would then remain to be do would neither require any great capital or present obstacle which might not easily be overcome the moro be then concentrate in the island of mindanao and this completely surround on all side by we fort and settlement in the manner above describe the only enemy let loose on these sea would be either the few who might from time to time elude the vigilance of we troops and district-commander or those who might have escape from jolo previous to its conquest and take up they abode in one or other of the bisaya island or in short such as be out cruise at the time we armament return to zamboanga and take possession of the southern coast of mindanao in which case they would be compel to resort to a roving life establish like the jolo fugitive temporary dwelling among the mangrove and thicket border on the shore the principal object then remain for the attention of government would be to guard and protect the town and settlement establish on the coast from the insult and inroad of bandit impel by necessity or despair and at the same time to promote the gradual overthrow or civilization of the dispersed remnant of moorish population leave in the island the cruise of the pirate be thus reduce to a space comprehend in a oblong circle form by a imaginary line draw from the southern extreme of the island of leyte to the south-west point of samar which next run along the north-west coast of mindoro on the outside of tacao and buria and come down to the west of panay negro and bohol close the oval at the little island form by the strait of panaon about forty gunboat might be advantageously station in the narrowest passage from land to land as for example in the strait of san juanico and other pass of a similar kind well know to the local pilot by this mean the limit would be gradually contract various small naval armament ought at the same time to keep cruise in the center of this circle pursue the moro by sea and land dislodge they from they stronghold and lurk place and send on those who might be capture to the depot point out by government -lrb- feasibility of plan -rrb- the first part of the plan would be the more easily realize as it be well-known that most of the district correspond to the bisayan tribe include those of camarine and albay situate at the extremity of the island of luzon have several gunboat of they own which might be use with great advantage by merely advance and station they in such channel as the moro must necessarily pass either in go out or return accord to the different monsoon they would easily be check without remove the gunboat to any great distance from they own coast as besides the great advantage result from this plan and every one do he duty be apparent no doubt number of native would volunteer they service more particularly if they be liberally reward and they maintenance provide from the fund of the respective community moreover the point which at first should not be consider as sufficiently guard might be strengthen by the king 's gunboat and indeed in all of they it would be advisable to station some of the latter command by a select officer to whose order the captain of the provincial gunboat ought to be make subservient with regard to the second part it will suffice to observe that the captain-generalship of the philippine island already possess as many as seventy gunboat besides a considerable number of gally and launch which altogether constitute a formidable squadron of light vessel and after deduct those deem necessary for the protection of jolo and the new province to be establish in mindanao a sufficient number would still be leave to carry into execution all the object propose at present although the moro navigate in numerous divion and with a confidence inspire by they undisturbed prosperity a 24-pounder shot from one of we launch be nevertheless sufficient to put they to flight what therefore may not be expect when they force shall be so greatly diminish and they apprehension increase of be defeat and capture nevertheless as it be not easy for we gunboat to come up with they when give chase it would be advisable to add to we cruiser a temporary establishment of prow and light vessel man by bisayan indian which by advance on with the gally might attack the enemy and give time for the gunboat to come up and decide the action besides as the bisayan indian be perfectly acquaint with the mode of make war on the moro the meaning of they signal and manoeuver and the kind of place on shore in which they take shelter when pursue at sea the employment of such auxiliary would be extremely useful -lrb- need of undivided leadership -rrb- the whole of these defensive and offensive arrangement would however be ineffectual or incomplete in they result if the most perfect union and concert be not establish in every part so that all should conspire to the same object although by distinct means in order therefore that the necessary harmony may be secure it would be expedient to remove the chief authority nearer to the theater of war by confide all the necessary instruction and power to the person who might be select for the direction and command of the enterprise after the general plan of operation have be regularly approve under this impression and with a view to the better execution of all the detail it would be advisable for the commanding officer name by the government to take up he headquarters in the island of panay which owe to its geographical situation the great number of town and inhabitant contain in the three province into which it be divide as well as other political reason be generally esteem preferable for the object in question to the island of zebu where in former time the commander of the province of the paint native reside as mention in the law of the indy the center of action be place in iloilo a communication with the other point would thus more easily be keep open aid and relief might be send more rapidly to the quarter where require and in a word all the movement of whatsoever kind they might be would be execute with greater precision and certainty of success it would be unnecessary to add that the provincial magistrate of camarine and albay ought to co-operate with they fourteen gunboat and other smaller vessel in the measure adopt by the commander of the bisayan establishment distribute they force accord to the order give by he and by undertake to guard the strait of san bernardino -lrb- paragua -rrb- the island of paragua at the head of which the provincial jurisdiction of calamiane be place be not include in the great circle or chain of station above trace out as well in consequence of its great distance from the other island for which reason it be not so much infested by the moro as because of its be at present nearly depopulate and uncultivated and for these reason the attention of government ought not to be withdraw from other more important point with regard to that of mindanao the necessity of keep up along the whole of its immense coast a line of castle and watch tower have already be fully point out more especially in the vicinity of the bay of panguil to the north and the mouth of the great river towards the south the two point in which the enemy ' most formidable armament be usually fit out consequently it would not be possible to expect the provincial commander station there would be able to disengage any part of they naval force in order to place it at the disposal of the officer command the bisayan vessel indeed it be obvious that it would be extremely important to afford the people of mindanao every possible additional aid in vessel troops and money in order the better to check the sailing of partial division of the enemy and thus prevent the immense number of pirate inhabit the interior of the island from break the fortify line and again cover these sea and with redoubled fury carry death and desolation along all the coast it would in fact be extremely desirable if through the concerted measure and constant vigilance of the four chief magistrate intrust with the command of the island the future attempt of the mindanayan could be entirely counteract and they cruiser altogether keep within the line for a certain period of year as by thus deprive they of the facility to continue they old habit of life these barbarous tribe would be eventually compel to adopt other pursuit either by ascend the mountainous part of the island and shut themselves up in the thick and impenetrable forest with a view to preserve they independence or throw down they arm and devote themselves to the peaceful cultivation of they land in the latter case they would gradually lose they present ferocious character they regard for the convenience and repose of social life would increase the contrast would be attend with most favorable consequence and in the course of time the whole of the aboriginal native of these island would come into we law and custom and become confound in the general mass of philippine subject owing allegiance to the king finally it must be equally acknowledge that the island of jolo basilan capul and some of the other inferior one of which as above point out a union ought to be form in the way of a additional government subordinate to the captain-general would be able to co-operate in the war on no other plan than the one trace out for the province hold in mindanao that be by they gunboat be confide to the protection of they own coast though with this difference that if in one instance the main object would be to prevent the evasion of the enemy in the other every effort must be employ to guard against and repel they incursion when they do appear however complete the success of the armament destine for the reduction of jolo it may nevertheless be presume that the mountain would still continue to give shelter to horde of fugitive who would take refuge in the fastness and avail themselves of every opportunity to concert plan or fly off to join they comrade in mindanao in order to return and through they aid satisfy they thirst for vengeance by surprising some fortress or settlement or establish themselves on some neglect and not well known point in consequence of this the governor command there would at first require the active co-operation of all he force for the purpose of consolidate the new conquest and cause he authority to be respect throughout the island -lrb- importance of peace for philippine progress -rrb- these in my opinion be the true and secure means by which the enemy of the peace and prosperity of the philippine may be humble they piracy prevent and a basis lay for the future civilization of the remain island in this important archipelago to this sketch a number of other detail and essential illustration no doubt be want and possibly i may be accuse of some inaccuracy in discuss a topic with which i candidly avow i can not be consider altogether familiar the plan and success of the enterprise must however greatly depend on military skill and talent but as i have attempt no more than fairly to trace the general outline of the plan and insist on the necessity of its adoption my remark it be to be hope will serve to awaken a serious disposition to review and investigate the whole subject a task that most assuredly ought to be confide to a competent and special council whatever defect i may involuntarily have fall into will then be correct at the same time it ought not to appear strange that inexperienced person should presume to speak on matter connect with the public good when we see they so much neglect by those whose more immediate duty it be to look after and promote they at all event dispassionate zeal have seldom do harm and i again repeat that my wish be not so much to see my own idea adopt as to urge the necessity of they be examine and digest i be desirous that other source of information on this subject should be explore that practical man should be call in and that those in power should be induce to apply themselves and devote they exertion to a object so highly deserving of they attention in short i be anxious that the pious injunction of we monarch should be fulfil and that the tear and blood of the inhabitant of these neglect island should cease to flow should the happy day ever arrive when the inhabitant of these province shall behold themselves free from the cruel scourge with which they have be desolate for so many year they will bless the nation that have redeem they from all they care they will tighten they relation with it and deliver themselves up to its direction without reserve the native will then come down from the strong fastness they at present inhabit they will clear fresh land and earnestly devote themselves to tillage and industry under the shadow of peace population and commerce will increase the bisayan vessel will then plough the ocean without the dread of other enemy than the element and the moro themselves of mindanao -lrb- i say it with confidence -rrb- straighten on all side and incessantly harass by the christian but on the other hand witness the advantage and mildness of we law will at length submit to the dominion of the monarch of spain who will thus secure the quiet possession of one of the most interesting portion of the habitable globe and be justly entitle to the gratitude of all nation connect with china and indium for have put a end to a series of the most terrific plunder and captivity that ever disgrace the

manila partake both of a spanish and a oriental character the sombre and heavy-looking church with they awkward tower the long line of battery mount with heavy cannon the massive house with range of balcony and the light and airy cottage elevate on post situate in the luxuriant grove of tropical tree -- all excite a desire to become better acquaint with the country -lrb- surroundings -rrb- manila be situate on a extensive plain gradually swell into distant hill beyond which again mountain rise in the back ground to the height of several thousand foot the latter be apparently clothe with vegetation to they summit the city be in strong contrast to this luxuriant scenery bearing evident mark of decay particularly in the church whose steeple and tile roof have a dilapidated look the site of the city do not appear to have be well choose it have apparently be select entirely for the convenience of commerce and the communication that the outlet of the lake afford for the batteaux that transport the produce from the shore of the laguna de bay to the city -lrb- canal -rrb- there be many arm or branch to this stream which have be convert into canal and almost any part of manila may now be reach in a banca in the afternoon in company with captain hudson i pay my first visit to manila the anchorage consider safest for large ship be nearly three mile from the shore but smaller vessel may lie much nearer and even enter the canal a facility of which a number of these take advantage to accomplish any repair they may have occasion to make -lrb- typhoon -rrb- the canal however be generally fill with coast vessel batteaux from the lake and lighter for the discharge of the vessel lie in the road the bay of manila be safe excepting during the change of the monsoon when it be subject to the typhoon of the china sea within whose range it lie these blow at time with much force and cause great damage foreign vessel have however keep this anchorage and ride out these storm in

be apparently far more numerous than the malay and the two race differ as much in character as in appearance : one be all activity while the other be dispose to avoid all exertion they preserve they distinctive character throughout mix but very little with each other and be remove as far as possible in they civility the former from they industry and perseverance have almost monopolize all the lucrative employment among the lower order except the selling of fish and betel-nut and article manufacture in the province on shore we be kindly receive by mr moore who at once make we feel at home the change of feeling that take place in a transfer from shipboard in a hot climate after a long cruise to spacious and airy apartment surround by every luxury that kind attention can give can be scarcely imagine by those who have not experience it as we need some repair and supplies to attend to these be my first occupation among the former we require a heavy piece of blacksmith-work to prepare which we be oblige to send we armourer on shore the only thing they could procure be a place for a forge but coal and every thing else we have to supply from the ship i mention these thing to show that those in want of repair must not calculate upon they be do at manila with dispatch if they can be accomplish at all -lrb- city of manila -rrb- the city government of manila be establish June

at the southern extremity of the american continent but which have no memorial in these island now that the glory which he gain by be the first to penetrate from the atlantic to the pacific have be in some measure obliterate by the disuse of those strait by navigator it would seem due to he memory that some spot among these island should be set apart to commemorate the name of he who make they know to europe this would be but common justice to the discoverer of a region which have be a source of so much honor and profit to the spanish nation who open the vast expanse of the pacific to the fleet of europe and who die fight to secure the benefit of he enterprise to he king and country magellan be kill at the island of mactan on April 26 1521 and duarte the second in command who succeed he

shortly after leave there he die also they come in sight of mindanao but contrary wind oblige they to go to the molucca when arrive at the portuguese settlement contention and jealousy arise and finally all the expedition be disperse and the fate of all but one of the vessel have become doubtful none but the small tender return which after encounter great difficulty reach new spain the third expedition be fit out by corte then viceroy of mexico and the command of it give to saavedra this sail from the port of silguattanjo on the 31st of October 1528 and stop at the ladrone island of which

not to visit the molucca this expedition sail in 1542 under the command of villalobo it reach the philippine island without accident and villalobo give they that name after philip ii then prince of asturia notwithstanding he positive instruction to the contrary he be oblige to visit the molucca and meet the same treatment from the portuguese that have be give to all whom they believe have any intention to interfere in they spice trade the squadron touch at amboina where villalobo die a event which cause the break up of the expedition and the few spaniard that remain embark in the portuguese vessel to return home the fifth and last expedition be order by philip ii to be send from mexico when under the government of don luis de velasco for the final conquest and settlement of the philippine with this expedition be send andre urdaneta a friar whose reputation stand very high as a cosmographer : he have belong to the ill-fated expedition of loaisa this be the largest that have yet be fit out for this purpose numbering five vessel and about four hundred man the command of it be intrust to -lrb- legaspus -rrb- legaspus under whom it sail from the port of natividad on November 21 1564 and upon whom be confer the title of governor and adelantado of the conquer land with the fullest power on the 13th of February 1565 he arrive at the island of tandaya one of the philippine : from thence he go to leyte there he obtain the son of a powerful chief as a guide through whom he establish peace with several of the native ruler who thereafter aid the expedition with all the means in they power at bohol they build the first church there he meet and make peace with a chief of luzon with whom he go to that island -lrb- fact here be confuse -- c -rrb- he now -lrb- April 1565 -rrb- take possession of all the island in the name of the crown of spain and become they first governor in this conquest motive different from those which govern they on the american continent seem to have influence the spaniard instead of carry on a cruel war against the native they here pursue the policy of encouraging and foster they industry whether they feel that this policy be necessary for the success of they undertaking or be influence by the religious father who be with they be uncertain but they measure seem to have be dictate by a desire to promote peace and secure the welfare of the inhabitant there may be another cause for this course of action namely the absence of the precious metal which hold out no inducement to those thirst for inordinate gain this may have have its weight in exempt the expedition in its outset from the presence of those avaricious spirit which have accompany other spanish expedition and be the means of mark they progress with excessive tyranny bloodshed and violence it be evident to one who visit the philippine that some other power besides the sword have be at work in they the native be amalgamate with the spaniard and all seem disposed to cultivate the land and foster civilization none of the feeling that grow out of conquest be to be observe in these island the two race be identify now in habit manners and religion and they interest be so closely ally that they feel they mutual dependence upon each other the establishment of the new constitution in spain in the year 1825 have have a wonderful effect upon these colony whose resource have within the last ten year be develop and improvement push forward with a rapid step greater knowledge and more liberal view in the ruler be alone want to cause a still more rapid advance in the career of prosperity as we visit be to luzon we naturally obtain more personal information respect it than the other island we learn that the northern peninsula -lrb- 268 -rrb- be compose of granite and recent volcanic rock together with secondary and tertiary deposit while the southern peninsula be almost wholly volcanic the northern contain many valuable mine of gold lead copper and iron besides coal a number of specimen of these and the rock which contain they be present to the expedition by señores ararium and roxa of manila so far as we information and observation go the whole of the philippine island be of similar geological formation in some of the island the volcanic rock prevail while in other coal and the metalliferous deposit predominate on some of they the coal-beds form part of the cliff along the shore on other copper be find in a chlorite and talcose slate the latter be more particularly the case with luzon and the same formation extend to mindoro much iron occur on the mountain thus among the -lrb- upland -rrb- native who be yet unsubdued by the spaniard and who inhabit these mountain it be find by they of so pure a quality that it be manufacture into sword and cleaver these be occasionally obtain by the spaniard in they excursion into the interior against these band -lrb- tufa -rrb- the country around manila be compose of tufa of a light gray color which be soft and easily work be employ as the common building material in the city it contain sometimes scoria and pumice in piece of various size besides occasionally impression of plant with petrified wood these be confine to recent species and include palm etc this tufa form one of the remarkable feature of the volcano of the philippine island show a strong contrast between they and those of the pacific isle which have eject little else than lava and scorium few portion of the globe seem to be so much the seat of internal fire or to exhibit the effect of volcanic action so strongly as the philippine during we visit it be not know that any of the volcano be in action but many of they be smoke particularly that in the district of albay call isaroc its latest eruption be in the year 1839 but this do little damage compare with that of 1814 which cover several village and the country for a great distance around with ash this mountain be situate to the south-east of manila one hundred and fifty mile and be say to be a perfect cone with a crater at its apex -lrb- resource -rrb- it do not appear that the island be much affect by earth-quakes although some have occasionally occur that have do damage to the church at manila the coal which we have speak of be deem of value it have a strong resemblance to the bituminous coal of we own country possess a bright lustre and appear very free from all woody texture when fracture it be find associate with sandstone which contain many fossil lead and copper be report as be very abundant gypsum and limestone occur in some district from this it will be see that these island have everything in the mineral way to constitute they desirable possession with such mineral resource and a soil capable of produce the most varied vegetation of the tropics a liberal policy be all that the country lack the product of the philippine island consist of sugar coffee hemp indigo rice tortoise-shell hide ebony saffron-wood sulphur cotton cordage silk pepper cocoa wax and many other article in they agricultural operation the people be industrious although much labor be lose by the use of defective implement the plough of very simple construction have be adopt from the chinese it have no coulter the share be flat and be turn partly to one side answer in a certain degree the purpose of a mould-board this rude implement be sufficient for the rich soil where the tillage depend chiefly upon the harrow in construct which a thorny species of bamboo be use the harrow be form of five or six piece of this material on which the thorn be leave firmly fasten together it answer its purpose well and be seldom out of order a wrought-iron harrow that be introduce by the jesuit be use for clear the ground more effectually and more particularly for the purpose of extirpate a troublesome grass that be know by the name of cogon -lrb- a species of andropogon -rrb- of which it be very difficult to rid the field the bolo or long-knife a basket and hoe complete the list of implement and answer all the purpose of we spade etc -lrb- draft animal -rrb- the buffalo be use until within a few year exclusively in they agricultural operation and they have lately take to the use of the ox but horse be never use the buffalo from the slowness of he motion and he exceed restlessness under the heat of the climate be ill adapt to agricultural labor but the native be very partial to they notwithstanding they occasion they much labor and trouble in bathing they during the great heat this be absolutely necessary or the animal become so fretful as to be unfit for use if it be not for this the buffalo would notwithstanding he slow pace be most effective in agricultural operation he require little food and that of the coarsest kind he strength surpass that of the stoutest ox and he be admirably adapt for the rice or paddy field they be very docile when use by the native and even child can manage they but it be say they have a great antipathy to the whites and all stranger the usual mode of guide they be by a small cord attach to the cartilage of the nose the yoke rest on the neck before the shoulder and be of simple construction to this be attach whatever it may be necessary to draw either by trace shaft or other fastening frequently this animal may be see with large bundle of bamboo lash to they on each side buffalo be to be meet with on the lake with no more than they nose and eye out of the water and be not visible until they be approach within a few foot when they cause alarm to the passenger by raise they large form close to the boat it be say that they resort to the lake to feed on a favorite grass that grow on its bottom in shallow water and which they dive for they flesh be not eat except that of the young one for it be tough and tasteless the milk be nutritious and of a character between that of the goat and cow the general appearance of the buffalo be that of a hybrid of the bull and rhinoceros its horn do not rise upward be very close at the root bent backwards and of a triangular form with a flat side above one of the peculiarity of the buffalo be its voice which be quite low and in the minor key resemble that of a young colt it be as fond of mire as swine and show the consequence of recent wallow in be crust over with mud the skin be visible be but thinly cover with hair its color be usually that of a mouse in some individual darker -lrb- rice -rrb- rice be perhaps of they agricultural product the article upon which the inhabitant of the philippine island most depend for food and profit of this they have several different variety which the native distinguish by they size and the shape of the grain : the birnambang lamuyo malagequit bontot-cabayo dumali quinanda bolohan and tangus the three first be aquatic the five latter upland variety they each have they peculiar use the dumalus be the early variety it ripen in three month from plant from which circumstance it derive its name : it be raise exclusively on the upland although much esteem it be not extensively cultivate as the bird and insect destroy a large part of the crop the malagequit be very much prize and use for make sweet and fancy dish it become exceedingly glutinous for which reason it be use in make whitewash which it be say to cause to become of a brilliant white and to withstand the weather this variety be not however believe to be wholesome there be also a variety of this last species which be use as food for horse and suppose to be a remedy and preventive against worm the rice grounds or field be lay out in square and surround by embankment to retain the water of the rain or stream after the rain have fall in sufficient quantity to saturate the ground a seed-bed be generally plant in one corner of the field in which the rice be sown broadcast about the month of June the heavy rain take place in August when the field be plough and be soon fill with water the young plant be about this time take from the seed-bed they top and root trim and then plant in the field by make hole in the ground with the finger and place four or five sprout in each of they in this tedious labor the poor woman be employ whilst the male be lounge in they house or in the shade of the tree the harvest for the aquatic rice begin in December it be reap with small sickle peculiar to the country call yatap to the back of these a small stick be fasten by which they be hold and the stalk be force upon it and cut the spike of rice be cut with this implement one by one in this operation man woman and child all take part the upland rice require much more care and labor in its cultivation the land must be plough three or four time and all the turf and lump well break up by the harrow during its growth it require to be weed two or three time to keep the weed from choke the crop the seed be sown broadcast in may this kind of rice be harvest in November and to collect the crop be still more tedious than in the other case for it be always gather earlier and never reap in consequence of the grain not adhering to the ear if it be gather in any other way the loss by transportation on the back of buffalo and horse without any cover to the sheaf would be so great as to dissipate a great portion of the crop it appear almost incredible that any people can remain in ignorance of a way of prevent so extravagant and wasteful a mode of harvest the government have be request to prohibit it on account of the great expense it give rise to but whether any step have ever be take in the matter i do not learn it be say that not unfrequently a third part of the crop be lose in consequence of the scarcity of laborer while those who be disengage will refuse to work unless they receive one-third and even one-half of the crop to be deliver free of expense at they house this the planter be often oblige to give or lose the whole crop nay unless the harvest be a good one reaper be very unwilling to engage to take it even on these term and the entire crop be lose the laborer during the time of harvest be support by the planter who be during that time expose to great vexation if not loss the reaper be for the most part compose of the idle and vicious part of the population who go abroad over the country to engage themselves in this employment which afford a livelihood to the poorer class for the different period at which the variety of rice be plant and harvest give they work during a large portion of the year after the rice be harvest there be different mode of treat it some of the proprietor take it home where it be throw into heap and leave until it be desirable to separate it from the straw when it be trodden out by man and woman with they bare foot for this operation they usually receive another fifth of the rice other stack it in a wet and green state which subject it to heat from which cause the grain contract a dark color and a unpleasant taste and smell the native however impute these defect to the wetness of the season the crop of both the low and upland rice be usually from thirty to fifty for one : this be on old land but on that which be newly clear or which have never be cultivate the yield be far beyond this in some soil of the latter description it be say that for a chupa -lrb- seven cubic inch -rrb- plant the yield have be a caban the former be the two-hundred-and-eighth part of the latter this be not the only advantage gain in plant rich land but the saving of labor be equally great for all that be require be to make a hole with the finger and place three or four grain in it the upland rice require but little water and be never irrigate the cultivator in the philippine island be always enable to secure plenty of manure for vegetation be so luxuriant that by pull the weed and lay they with earth a good stock be quickly obtain with which to cover he field thus although the growth be so rank as to cause he labor yet in this hot climate its decay be equally rapid which tend to make he labor more successful the rice-stacks form a picturesque object on the field they be generally place around or near a growth of bamboo whose tall graceful and feathery outline be of itself a beautiful object but connect as it be often see with the return of the harvest it furnish a additional source of gratification the different kind of rice and especially the upland would no doubt be a acquisition to we country at the time we be at manila it be not think feasible to pack it for it have just be reap and be so green that it would not have keep -lrb- 269 -rrb- although rice be a very prolific crop yet it be subject to many casualty from the locust and other insect that devour it the drought at other time affect it particularly the aquatic variety there be a use to which the rice be apply here which be new to we namely as a substitute for razor by use two grain of it between the finger they nip the beard or extract it from the chin and face -lrb- manila hemp -rrb- among the important production of these island i have mention hemp although the article call manila hemp must not be understand to be derive from the plant which produce the common hemp -lrb- cannabis -rrb- be obtain from a species of plantain -lrb- musa textili -rrb- call in the philippine abacá this be a native of these island and be formerly believe to be find only on mindanao but this be not the case for it be cultivate on the south part of luzon and all the island south of it it grow on high ground in rich soil and be propagate by seed it resemble the other plant of the tribe of plantain but its fruit be much smaller although edible the fiber be derive from the stem and the plant attain the height of fifteen or twenty foot the usual mode of prepare the hemp be to cut off the stem near the ground before the time or just when the fruit be ripe the stem be then eight or ten foot long below the leaf where it be again cut the outer coating of the herbaceous stem be then strip off until the fiber or cellular part be see when it undergo the process of rot and after be well dry in house and shed be prepare for market by assort it a task which be perform by the woman and child that which be intend for cloth be soak for a hour or two in weak lime-water prepare from sea-shell again dry and put up in bundle from all the district in which it grow it be send to manila which be the only port whence it can legally be export it arrive in large bundle and be pack there by means of a screw-press in compact bale for shipping secure by rattan each weigh two picul the best manila hemp ought to be white dry and of a long and fine fiber this be know at manila by the name of lupi the second quality they call bandalum the exportation have much increase within the last few year in consequence of the demand for it in the united state and the whole crop be now monopolize by the two american house of sturge & co and t n peale & co of manila who buy all of good quality that come to market this be divide between the two house and the price they pay be from four to five dollar the picul the entire quantity raise in 1840 be eighty-three thousand seven hundred and ninety picul in 1841 eighty-seven thousand the quantity export to the united state in 1840 be sixty-eight thousand two hundred and eighty picul and in 1841 only sixty-two thousand seven hundred picul its value in manila be about three hundred thousand dollar twenty thousand picul go to europe there be no duty on its exportation that which be bring to the united state be principally manufacture in or near boston and be the cordage know as white rope the cordage manufacture at manila be however very superior to the rope make with we although the hemp be of the inferior kind a large quantity be also manufacture into mat in the opinion of we botanist it be not probable that the plant could be introduce with success into we country for in the philippine it be not find north of latitude 14 ° n -lrb- coffee -rrb- the coffee-plant be well adapt to these island a few plant be introduce into the garden of manila about fifty year ago since which time it have be spread all over the island as be suppose by the civet-cat which after swallow the seed carry they to a distance before they be void the coffee of commerce be obtain here from the wild plant and be of a excellent quality upward of three thousand five hundred picul be now export of which one-sixth go to the united state -lrb- sugar -rrb- the sugar-cane thrive well here it be plant after the french fashion by stick the piece diagonally into the ground some find the cane have suffer in time of drought have adopt other mode it come to perfection in a year and they seldom have two crop from the same piece of land unless the season be very favorable there be many kind of cane cultivate but that grow in the valley of pampanga be think to be the best it be a small red variety from four to five foot high and not thicker than the thumb the manufacture of the sugar be rudely conduct and the whole business i be tell be in the hand of a few capitalist who by make advance secure the whole crop from those who be employ to bring it to market it be generally bring in mould of the usual conical shape call pilone which be deliver to the purchaser from November to June and contain each about one hundred and fifty pound on they receipt they be place in large storehouse where the familiar operation of claying be perform the estimate for the quantity of sugar from these pilone after this process be about one hundred pound it depend upon the care take in the process -lrb- cotton -rrb- of cotton they raise a considerable quantity which be of a fine quality and principally of the yellow nankeen in the province of iloco it be cultivate most extensively the mode of clean it of its seed be very rude by means of a hand-mill and the expense of clean a picul -lrb- one hundred and forty pound -rrb- be from five to seven dollar there have as far as i have understand be no endeavor to introduce any cotton-gin from we country -lrb- wages -rrb- it will be merely necessary to give the price at which laborer be pay to show how low the compensation be in comparison with those in we own country in the vicinity of manila twelve and a half cent per day be the usual wages this in the province fall to six and nine cent a man with two buffalo be pay about thirty cent the amount of labor perform by the latter in a day would be the ploughing of a soane about two-tenth of a acre the most profitable way of employ laborer be by the task when it be say the native work well and be industrious the manner in which the sugar and other produce be bring to market at manila be peculiar and deserve to be mention in some of the village the chief man unite to build a vessel generally a pirogue in which they embark they produce under the conduct of a few person who go to navigate it and dispose of the cargo in due time they make they voyage and when the account be settle the return be distribute to each accord to he share festivity be then hold the saint thank for they kindness and blessing invoke for another year after this be over the vessel be take carefully to piece and distribute among the owner to be preserve for the next season the profit in the crop accord to estimate vary from sixty to one hundred per cent but it be think as a general average that this be notwithstanding the great productiveness of the soil far beyond the usual profit accrue from agricultural operation in some province this estimate would hold good and probably be exceed -lrb- indigo -rrb- indigo would probably be a lucrative crop for that raise here be say to be of quality equal to the best and the crop be not subject to so many uncertainty as in indium : the capital and attention require in vat etc prevent it from be raise in any quantity among the production the bamboo and rattan ought to claim a particular notice from they great utility they enter into almost every thing of the former they house be build include frame floor side and roof fence be make of the same material as well as every article of general household use include basket for oil and water the rattan be a general substitute for rope of all description and the two combine be use in construct raft for cross ferry i have thus give a general outline of the capability of this country for agricultural operation in some of the most important article of commerce by which it will be see that the philippine island be one of the most favored part of the globe -lrb- locust -rrb- the crop frequently suffer from the ravages of the locust which sweep all before they fortunately for the poorer class they attack take place after the rice have be harvest but the cane be sometimes entirely cut off the authority of manila in the vain hope of stop they devastation employ person to gather they and throw they into the sea i understand on one occasion they have spend eighty thousand dollar in this way but all to little purpose it be say that the crop rarely suffer from drought but on the contrary the rain be think to fall too often and to flood the rice field these however yield a novel crop and be very advantageous to the poor viz : a great quantity of fish which be call dalag and be a species of blunnius they be so plentiful that they be catch with basket : these fish weigh from a half to two pound and some be say to be eighteen inch long but this be not all they be say after a deep inundation to be find even in the vault of church the philippine be divide into thirty-one province sixteen of which be on the island of luzon and the remainder comprise the other island of the group and the ladrone -lrb- population -rrb- the population of the whole group be above three million include all tribe of native mestizo and whites the latter-named class be but few in number not exceed three thousand the mestizo be suppose to be about fifteen or twenty thousand they be distinguish as spanish and indian mestizo the chinese have of late year increase to a large number and it be say that there be forty thousand of they in and around manila alone one-half of the whole population belong to luzon the island next to it in the number of inhabitant be panay which contain about three hundred and thirty thousand then come cebu mindanao leyte samar and negro vary from the above number down to fifty thousand the population be increase and it be think that it double itself in seventy year this rate of increase appear probable from a comparison of the present population with the estimate make at the beginning of the present century which show a growth in the forty year of about one million four hundred thousand the native population be compose of a number of distinct tribe the principal of which in luzon be pangasinan iloco cagayan tagalog and pampangan the igorot who dwell in the mountain be the only native who have not be subject by the spaniard the other tribe have become identify with they ruler in religion and it be think that by this circumstance alone have spain be able to maintain the ascendency with so small a number over such a numerous intelligent and energetic race as they be represent to be this be however more easily account for from the spaniard foster and keep alive the jealousy and hatred that exist at the time of the discovery between the different tribe it seem almost incredible that spain should have so long persist in the policy of allow no more than one galleon to pass annually between she colony and equally so that the nation of europe should have be so long deceive in regard to the riches and wealth that spain be monopolize in the philippine the capture of manila in 1762 by the english first give a clear idea of the value of this remote and little-known appendage of the empire the philippine consider in they capacity for commerce be certainly among the most favored portion of the globe and there be but one circumstance that tend in the least degree to lessen they apparent advantage this be the prevalence of typhoon in the china sea which be occasionally feel with force to the north of latitude 10 ° n south of that parallel they have never be know to prevail and seldom so far but from they unfailing occurrence yearly in some part of the china sea they be look for with more or less dread and cause each season a temporary interruption in all the trade that pass along the coast of these island the army be now compose entirely of native troops who number about six thousand man and the regiment be never suffer to serve in the province in which they be recruit but those from the north be send to the south and vice versa there they be employ to keep up a continual watch on each other and speak different dialect they never become identify they be indeed never allow to remain long enough in one region to imbibe any feeling in unison with those of its inhabitant the hostility be so great among the regiment that mutiny have occur and contest arise which have produce even bloodsh which it be entirely out of the power of the officer to prevent in case of this kind summary punishment be resort to -lrb- condition not peaceful -rrb- although the spaniard as far as be known abroad live in peace and quiet this be far from be the case for rebellion and revolt among the troops and tribe be not unfrequent in the province during the time of we visit one of these take place but it be impossible to learn anything concern it that could be rely upon for all conversation respect such occurrence be interdict by the government the difficulty to which i refer be say to have originate from the preaching of a fanatic priest who inflamed they to such a degree that they overthrow the troops and become temporarily master of the country prompt measure be immediately take and order issue to give the rebel no quarter the regiment most hostile to those engage in the revolt be order to the spot they spare no one the priest and he companion be take put to death and accord to report in a manner so cruel as to be a disgrace to the record of the nineteenth century although i should hope the account i hear of these transaction be incorrect yet the detestation these act be hold in would give some color to the statement the few gazette that be publish at manila be entirely under the control of the government and a resident of that city must make up he mind to remain in ignorance of the thing that be pass around he or believe just what the authority will allow to be tell whether truth or falsehood the government of the philippine be emphatically a iron rule : how long it can continue so be doubtful -lrb- the governor-general -rrb- one of my first duty be to make a official call upon he excellency don marcelino oroa who be the sixty-first governor of the philippine island accord to the established etiquette mr moore the vice-consul announce we desire to do so and request to be inform of the time when we would be receive this be accordingly name and at the appoint hour we proceed to the palace in the city proper on we arrival we be announce and lead up a flight of step ample and spacious but by no means of such splendor as would indicate the residence of vice-royalty the suite of room into which we be usher be so dark that it be difficult to see i make out however that they be panel and by no means richly furnish he excellency enter from a side-door and lead we through two or three apartment into he private audience-room a apartment not quite so dark as those we have come from : we be conduct to this i be tell afterwards be to be consider a especial mark of respect to my country he reception of we be friendly the governor have much more the appearance of a irishman than of a spaniard be tall portly of a florid complexion he be apparently more than sixty year of age he be dress in a full suit of black with a star on he breast mr moore act as interpreter and the governor readily accede to my request to be allow to send a party into the interior for a few day a permission which i almost despaired of receive for i know that he have refuse a like application some few month before the refusal however i think be in part owe to the character of the applicant and the doubtful object they have in view i impute the permission we receive to the influence of we consul together with mr sturge whose agreeable manners conciliatory tone and high standing with the authority will i be satisfied insure we at all time every reasonable advantage or facility the term of the governor in office be three year and the present incumbent be install in 1841 this length of time be think to be sufficient for any one of they to make a fortune the office be hold by the appointment of the ministry in spain and with it be connect perquisite that be share it be say by those who confer they after have pay we respects to he excellency we drive to visit several other officer of the government who receive we without ceremony we generally find they in loose morning-gown smoking and cigar be invariably offer we for this habit appear in manila to extend to all rank even in the public office of the custom-house it be the fashion and cigar with a machero for strike a light or a joss-stick keep burning be usually see in every apartment -lrb- courteous spanish official -rrb- to the captain of the port don juan salomon i feel under many obligation for he attention i be desirous of obtain information relative to the sulu sea and to learn how far the spanish survey have be carry he give I little hope of obtain any but refer I to captain halcon of the spanish navy who have be employ survey some part of the coast of the island to the north the latter whom i visit on my make the inquiry of he and state the course i intend to pursue frankly tell I that all the exist chart be erroneous he only know enough of the ground to be certain that they be so and consequently useless he advise my take one of the native pilot who be generally well acquaint with the sea that lay more immediately in my route the captain of the port be afterwards kind enough to offer to procure I one the intercourse i have with these gentleman be a source of much gratification and it give I great pleasure to make this public expression of it to both my sincere acknowledgment be due for information in relation to the various reef and shoal that have be recently discover and which will be find place in they true position on we chart during we stay at manila we time be occupy in see sight shop ride and amusing ourselves with gaze on the throng incessantly pass through the escolta of the binondo suburb or more properly the commercial town of manila -lrb- cigar factory -rrb- among the lion of the place the great royal cigar manufactory claim especial notice from they extent and the many person employ there be two of these establishment one situate in the binondo quarter and the other on the great square or prado in the former which be visit by we there be two building of two story high besides several storehouse enclose by a wall with two large gateway at which sentinel be always post the principal workshop be in the second story which be divide into six apartment in which eight thousand female be employ throughout the whole extent table be arrange about sixteen inch high ten foot long and three foot wide at each of which fifteen woman be seat have small pile of tobacco before they the table be set crosswise from the wall leave a space in the middle of the room free the labor of a female produce about two hundred cigar a day and the work hour be from 6 be till 6 pm with a recess of two hour from eleven till one o'clock the whole establishment be keep very neat and clean and every thing appear to be carry on in the most systematic and workmanlike manner among such number it have be find necessary to institute a search on they leave the establishment to prevent embezzlement and this be regularly make twice a day without distinction of sex it be a strange sight to witness the ingress and egress of these horde of female and probably the world can not elsewhere exhibit so large a number of ugly woman they age vary from fifteen to forty-five the sum pay they for wages be very trifling the whole number of person employ in the manufactory be about fifteen thousand this include the officer clerk overseer etc as nearly as i could ascertain the revenue derive from these establishment be half a million of dollar the native of the philippine be industrious they manufacture a amount of goods sufficient to supply they own want particularly from panay and iloco these for the most part consist of cotton and silk and a peculiar article call piña the latter be manufacture from a species of bromelium -lrb- pineapple -rrb- and come principally from the island of panay the finest kind of piña be exceedingly beautiful and surpass any other material in its evenness and beauty of texture its color be yellowish and the embroidery be fully equal to the material it be much seek after by all stranger and consider as one of the curiosity of this group various report have be state of the mode of its manufacture and among other that it be weave under water which i find upon inquiry to be quite erroneous the web of the piña be so fine that they be oblige to prevent all current of air from pass through the room where it be manufacture for which purpose there be gauze screen in the window after the article be bring to manila it be then embroider by girl this last operation add greatly to its value we visit one of the house where this be in progress and where the most skilful workwoman be employ on mount the stair of bamboo every step we take produce its creak but although the whole seem but a crazy affair yet it do not want for strength be well and firmly bind together there be two apartment each about thirteen by twenty-five foot which could be divide by screen if require at the end of it be see about forty female all busily ply they needle and so closely seat as apparently to incommode each other the mistress of the manufactory who be quite young give we a friendly reception and show we the whole process of draw the thread and work the pattern which in many case be elegant a great variety of dress scarf cap collar cuff and pocket-handkerchief be show we these be mostly in the rough state and do not strike we with that degree of admiration which be expect they however have be in hand for six month and be soil by much handling but when other be show we in the finished state wash and put up they be such as to claim we admiration i be soon attract by a very different sight at the other end of the apartment this be a dancing-master and he scholar of six year old the

use they foot and arm and to assume the expression of countenance that will enable they to play a part in the afterscene of life this manufactory have work engage for nine month or a year in advance the fabric be extremely expensive and none but the wealthy can afford it it be also much seek after by foreigner even order for queen victorium and many of the english nobility be then in hand at least i so hear at manila those who be actually present have notwithstanding the privilege of select what they wish to purchase for with the inhabitant here as elsewhere ready money have too much attraction for they to forego the temptation time in manila seem to hang heavily on the hand of some of its inhabitant they amusement be few and the climate ill adapt to exertion the gentleman of the higher class pass they morning in the transaction of a little public business lounge about smoking etc in the afternoon they sleep and ride on the prado and in the evening visit they friend or attend a tertulium the lady be to be pity for they pass three-fourth of they time in déshabillé with they maid around they sleep dress lolling and comb they hair in this way the whole morning be lounge away

among the lower order it be no uncommon thing for the party to be live without the ceremony of marriage until they have a family and no odium whatever be attach to such a connexion they be look upon as man and wife though they do not live together and they rarely fail to solemnize they union when they have accumulate sufficient property to procure the requisite article for housekeeping -lrb- the luneta -rrb- three night in each week they have music in the plaza in front of the governor 's palace by the band of four different regiment who collect there after the evening parade most of the better class resort here for the pleasure of enjoy it we go thither to see the people as well as to hear the music this be the great resort of the haut ton who usually have they carriage in wait and promenade in group backwards and forwards during the time the music be play this be by far the best opportunity that one can have for view the society of manila which seem as easy and unrestrained as the peculiar gravity and ceremonious mode of intercourse among the old spaniard can admit before the present governor take office it have be the custom to allow the band to play on the prado every fine evening when all the inhabitant could enjoy it until a late hour but he have interdict this practice and of course give much dissatisfaction he be say to have do this in a fit of ill temper and although importune to restore this amusement to the common people he pertinaciously refuse the band of the regiment be under the direction of frenchman and spaniard : the musician be all native and play with a correct ear we afternoon be spend in drive on the prado where all the fashion and rank of manila be to be meet and where it be exceedingly agreeable to partake of the fresh and pure air after a heated day in the city the extreme end of the prado lie along the shore of the bay of manila have the roadstead and ship on one side and the city proper with its fortification and moat on the other this drive usually last for a hour and all sort of vehicle be show off from the governor 's coach and six surround by he lancer to the sorry chaise and limp nag the carriage most use be a four-wheeled biloche with a gig top quite low and draw by two horse on one of which be a postilion these vehicle be exceedingly comfortable for two person the horse be small but spirited and be say to be able to undergo great fatigue although they appearance do not promise it this drive be enliven by the music of the different regiment who be at this time to be see manoeuver on the prado the soldier have a very neat and clean appearance great attention be pay to they and the whole be well appoint the force station in manila be six thousand and the army in the philippine amount to twenty thousand man the officer be all spaniard generally the relation and friend of those in the administration of the government the pay of the soldier be four dollar a month and a ration which be equal to six cent a day as troops i be tell they acquit themselves well the prado be lay out in many avenue lead in various direction to the suburb and these be plant with wild almond tree which afford a pleasant shade it be well keep and creditable to the city in pass the crowd of carriage very little display of female beauty be observe and although well-dressed above one can not but revert to they wear no stocking beneath on the prado be a small theater but so inferior that the building scarce deserve the name : the acting be equally bad this amusement meet with little encouragement in manila and i be tell be discountenance by the governor -lrb- a tertulium -rrb- i have the pleasure during we stay of attend a tertulium in the city the company be not a large one comprise some thirty or forty lady and about sixty gentleman it resemble those of the mother country dancing be introduce at a early hour and continue till a few minute before eleven o'clock at which time the gate of the city be always shut it be amusing to see the sudden break up of the party most of the guest reside out of the city the call for carriage shawl hat etc produce for a few minute great confusion every one be desirous of get off at the earliest moment possible for fear of be too late this regulation by which the gate be close at so early a hour do not appear necessary and only serve to interrupt the communication between the foreign and spanish society as the former be oblige as before observe to live outside of the city proper this want of free intercourse be to be regret as it prevent that kind of friendship by which many of they jealousy and prejudice might be remove the society at this tertulium be easy and so far as the enjoyment of dancing go pleasant but there be no conversation the refreshment consist of a few dulce lemonade and strong drink in a anteroom the house appear very spacious and well adapt for entertainment but only one of the room be well light from the novelty of the scene and the attention of the gentleman of the house we pass a pleasant evening the native and mestizo attract much of my attention at manila they dress be peculiar : over a pair of striped trousers of various color the man usually wear a fine grass-cloth shirt a large straw hat and around the head or neck a many color silk handkerchief they often wear slipper as well as shoe the chinese dress as they have do for century in loose white shirt and trousers one peculiarity of the common man be they passion for cock-fighting and they carry these fowl wherever they go after a peculiar fashion under they arm -lrb- cock-figghting -rrb- cock-fighting be license by the government and great care be take in the breeding of game fowl which be very large and heavy bird they be arm with a curved double-edged gaff the exhibition be usually crowd with half-breed or mestizo who be generally more addict to gamble than either the higher or lower class of spaniard it would not be a unapt designation to call the middling class cock-fighter for they whole life seem to be take up with the breeding and fighting of these bird on the exit from a cockpit i be much amuse with the mode of give the return check which be do by a stamp on the naked arm and preclude the possibility of its transfer to another person the dress of the lower order of female be somewhat civilized yet it bear so strong a resemblance to that of the polynesian as to recall the latter to we recollection a long piece of color cotton be wind round the body like the pareu and tuck in at the side : this cover the nether limb and a jacket fitting close to the body be wear without a shirt in some this jacket be ornament with work around the neck it have no collar and in many case no sleeve and over this a richly embroidered cape the foot be cover with slipper with wooden sole which be keep on by the little toe only four toe enter the slipper and the little one be on the outside the effect of both costume be picturesque -lrb- duck -rrb- the market be a never fail place of amusement to a foreigner for there a crowd of the common people be always to be see and they mode of conduct business may be observe the canal here afford great facility for bring vegetable and produce to market in a fresh state the vegetable be chiefly bring from the shore of the laguna de bay through the river pasig the meat appear inferior and as in all spanish place the art of butchering be not understand the poultry however surpass that of any other place i have see particularly in duck the breeding of which be pursue to a great extent establishment for breed these bird be here carry on in a systematic manner and be a great curiosity they consist of many small enclosure each about twenty foot by forty or fifty make of bamboo which be place on the bank of the river and partly cover with water in one corner of the enclosure be a small house where the egg be hatch by artificial heat produce by rice-chaff in a state of of fermentation it be not uncommon to see six or eight hundred duckling all of the same age there be several hundred of these enclosure and the number of duck of all age may be compute at million the manner in which they be school to take exercise and to go in and out of the water and to return to they house almost exceed belief the keeper or tender be of the tagalog tribe who live near the enclosure and have they at all time under they eye the old bird be not suffer to approach the young and all of one age be keep together they be feed upon rice and a small species of shell-fish that be find in the river and be peculiar to it from the extent of these establishment we infer that duck be the favorite article of food at manila and the consumption of they must be immense the market be well supply with chicken pigeon young partridge which be bring in alive and turkey among strange article that we see for sale be cake of coagulate blood the market be well stock with a variety of fish take both in the laguna and bay of manila afford a supply of both the fresh and salt water species and many smaller kind that be dry and smoke vegetable be in great plenty and consist of pumpkin lettuce onion radish very long squash etc of fruit they have melon chico durian marbola and orange -lrb- fish -rrb- fish be catch in weir by the hook or in seine the former be construct of bamboo stake in the shallow water of the lake at the point where it flow through the pasig river in the bay and at the mouth of the river the fish be take in net suspend by the four corner from hoop attach to a crane by which they be lower into the water the fishing-boat be little better than raft and be call sarabao the usual passage-boat be term banca and be make of a single trunk these be very much use by the inhabitant they have a sort of awning to protect the passenger from the ray of the sun and be light be easily row about although they be exceedingly uncomfortable to sit in from the lowness of the seat and liable to overset if the weight be not place near the bottom the outrigger be very often dispense with owe to the impediment it offer to the navigation of they canal these canal offer great facility for the transportation of burden the bank of almost all of they be face with granite where the street cross they there be substantial stone bridge which be generally of no more than one arch so as not to impede the navigation the barge use for the transportation of produce resemble we canal-boat and have slide roof to protect they from the rain water for the supply of vessel be bring off in large earthen jar it be obtain from the river and if care be not take the water will be impure it ought to be fill beyond the city we supply be obtain five or six mile up the river by a lighter in which be place a number of water-cask it prove excellent the trade of manila extend to all part of the world there be many facility for the transaction of business as far as the shipment of article be concerned but great difficulty attend the settling of dispute account collect debt etc in the way of which the law pass in 1834 have throw many obstacle all commercial business of this kind go before first the junta de comercio and then a appeal to the tribunal de comercio this appeal however be merely nominal for the same judge preside in each and they be say to be susceptible of influence that render a appeal to they by honest man at all time hazardous the opinion of those who have have the misfortune to be oblige to recur to these tribunal be that it be better to suffer wrong than encounter both the expense and vexation of a resort to they for justice in the first of these court the decision be long delay fee exact and other expense incur and when judgment be at length give it excite one party or the other to appeal : other expense accrue in consequence and the advocate and judge grow rich while both the litigant suffer i understand that these tribunal be intend to simplify business lessen the time of suit and promote justice but these result have not be obtain and many believe that they have have the contrary effect and have open the road to further abuse -lrb- environs -rrb- the country around manila though no more than a extended plain for some mile be one of great interest and beauty and afford many agreeable ride on the road to santa ana and mariquina most of the country-seat be situate on the pasig river they may indeed be call palace from they extent and appearance they be build upon a grand scale and after the italian style with terrace support by strong abutment deck with vase of plant the grounds be ornament with the luxuriant lofty and graceful tree of the tropics these be tolerably well keep here and there fine large stone church with they tower and steeple be to be see the whole give the impression of a wealthy nobility and a happy and flourishing peasantry -lrb- the cemetery -rrb- in one of we ride we make a visit to the campo santo or cemetery about four mile from manila it be small but have many handsome tree about it among they be a agati full of large white flower show most conspicuously the whole place be as unlike a depository of the dead as it well can be its form be circular have a small chapel in the form of a rotunda directly opposite the gate or entrance the wall be about twenty foot high with three tier of niche in which the body be enclose with quicklime here they be allow to remain for three year or until such time as the niche may be require for further use niche may be purchase however and permanently close up but in the whole cemetery there be but five thus secure this would seem to indicate a indifference on the part of the living for they depart relative or friend at least such be my impression at the time the center of the enclosure be lay out as a flower-garden and shrubbery and all the building be wash a deep buff-color with white cornice these color when contrast with the green foliage give a effect that be not unpleasing in the chapel be two tomb the one for the bishop and the other for the governor the former i believe be occupy and will continue to be so until another shall follow he but the latter be empty for since the erection of the cemetery none of the governor have die in the rear of the chapel be another small cemetery call lo angele and further behind the osero the former be similar to the one in front but smaller and appropriate exclusively to child the latter be a open space where the bone of all those who have be remove from the niche after three year be east out and now lie in a confused heap with portion of flesh and hair adhering to they no person be allow to be receive here for interment until the fee be first pay to the priest however respectable the party may be and all those who pay the fee and be of the true faith can be inter i be tell of a corpse of a very respectable person be refuse admittance for the want of the priest 's pass to show that the claim have be satisfied and the coffin stop in the road until it be obtain we ourselves witness a similar refusal a servant enter with a dead child bear on a tray which he present to the sacristan to have inter the latter ask he for the pass which not be produce he be dismiss nor be he suffer to leave he burden until this requisite could be procure from the priest who live opposite the price of interment be three dollar but whether this include the purchase of the niche or its rent for the three year only i do not learn the church of manila can boast of several fine-toned bell which be place in large belfry or tower there be one of these tower near the messr sturge ' where we stay and the manner in which the bell be use when swing around by the force of two or three man attract we attention for the ringer occasionally practice feat of agility by pass over with the bell and landing on the coping on the opposite side the tower be open we could see the manoeuver from the window and as stranger go there to look on one day whilst at dinner they begin to ring and as many of the officer have not witness the fact they seek the window this excite the vanity of those in the belfry who redouble they exertion and perform the feat successfully many time although in some instance they narrowly escape accident by landing just within the outside coping this bring we all to the window and the next turn more force have be give to the bell the individual who attempt the feat be throw headlong beyond the tower and dash to piece on the pavement beneath although shock at the accident i feel still more so when after a few minute the bell be again hear make its usual sound as if nothing have occur to interrupt the course of its hourly peal -lrb- monastery -rrb- in company with dr tolben i visit one of the convent where he attend on some of the monk who be sick he seem well acquaint with they all i be much strike with the extent of the building which be four story high with spacious corridor and gallery the wall of which be furnish with picture represent the martyrdom of the dominican friar in japan these be about seventy in number in the chinese style of art and evidently paint by some one of that nation call himself a artist from appearance however i should think they be compose by the priest who have not a little tax they invention to find out the different mode in which a man can be put to death many evidently if not all have be invent for the picture so perplexed have they apparently be that in one of the last it be observe that the executioner hold he victim at arm ' length by the heel and be about to let he drop headforemost into a well from the gallery we pass into the library and thence into many of the room and finally we mount to the top of the monastery which afford a beautiful view of the bay city and suburb there i be present to three of the friar who be pleasant and jolly-looking man upon the roof be a kind of observatory or look-out simply furnish with billiard-table and shuffleboard while the implement for various other game lay about on small table with telescope on stand and comfortable arm-chair it be a place where the friar put aside they religious and austere character or appearance and seek amusement it be a delightful spot so far as coolness and the freshness of the sea air be concerned and its aspect give I a insight behind the curtain of these establishment that very soon disclose many thing i be ignorant of before all the friar be of a rotund form and many of they bear the mark of good living in they full red and bloated face it seem to be generally understand at manila that they live upon the fat of the land we visit several of the room and be warmly greet by the padre one of whom present I with a meteorological table for the previous year the revenue of all these religious establishment be considerable the one i visit belong to the dominican and be very rich they revenue be principally derive from land own by they and the tithe from the different district which they have under they charge to which be add many alms and gift on inquiry i find they general character be by no means think well of and they have of late year lose much of the influence that they possess before the revolution in the mother country among the inhabitant we see here be a native boy of the igorot or mountain tribe he be say to be a true negrito -lrb- another confusion of fact -- c -rrb- -lrb- mountaineer -rrb- the spaniard as have be state have never be able to subdue this tribe who be say to be still as wild as on they first landing they be confine almost altogether to the plain within or near the mountain and from time to time make inroad in great force on the outer settlement carry off as much plunder as possible the burden of this often cause they to be overtake by the troops when overtaken they fight desperately and be it not for the fire-arm of they adversary would give they much trouble few be capture on such occasion and it be exceedingly difficult to take they alive unless when very young these mountain furnish they with a iron ore almost pure in manufacture which they show much ingenuity some of they weapon be present to the expedition by josiah moore esq these be probably imitation of the early spanish weapon use against they from all account the native be of malay origin and ally to those of the other island of the extensive archipelago of the eastern sea but the population of the town and city of the island be so mixed from the constant intercourse with chinese european and other that there be no pure blood among they when at manila we obtain a grammar of the tagalog language which be say to be now rarely hear and to have become nearly obsolete this grammar be believe to be the only one extant and be procure from a padre who present it to the expedition -lrb- tagalog be here mistake for a mountaineer 's dialect -- c -rrb- the pampangan be consider the finest tribe of native they be excessively fond of horse-racing and bet very considerable sum upon it they have the reputation of be a industrious and energetic set of man -lrb- revenue -rrb- the mode of raise revenue by a poll-tax cause great discontent among all class for although light it be as it always have be elsewhere unpopular all the chinese pay a capitation tax of four dollar the revenue from various source be say to amount to one million six hundred thousand dollar of which the poll-tax amount to more than one-half the rest be derive from the custom tobacco etc there be no tax upon land it be think at manila that a revenue might be derive by indirect taxation far exceed this sum without be sensibly feel by the inhabitant this mode be employ in the eastern island under the english and dutch rule and it be surprising that the spaniard also do not adopt it or some other method to increase resource that be so much need whenever the ministry in spain have to meet a claim they be a few year ago in the habit of issue draft on this colonial government in payment these come at last in such number that latterly they have be compel to suspend the payment of they the revenue of the colonial government be very little more than will meet the expense and it be believe that notwithstanding these unaccepted claim it receive order to remit the surplus if any to spain regardless of honor or good faith -lrb- government -rrb- the government of the philippine be in the hand of a governor-general who have the title of viceroy commander-in-chief sub-delegate judge of the revenue from the post-office commander of the troops captain-general and commander of the naval force he duty embrace every thing that relate to the security and defense of the country as adviser he have a council call the audiencium the island be divide into province each of which have a military officer with the title of governor appoint by the governor-general they act as chief magistrate have jurisdiction over all dispute of minor importance have the command of the troops in time of war and be collector of the royal revenue for the security of which they give bond which must be approve of by the comptroller-general of the treasury the province of cavite be alone exempt from this rule and the collection of tribute be there confide to a police magistrate each province be again sub-divide into pueblo contain a greater or less number of inhabitant each of which have again its ruler call a gobernadorcillo who have in like manner other officer under he to act as police magistrate the number of the latter be very great each of they have he appropriate duty these consist in the supervision of the grain field coconut grove betel-nut plantation and in the preservation of the general order and peace of the town so numerous be these petty officer that there be scarcely a family of any consequence that have not a member who hold some kind of office under government this policy in case of disturbance at once unite a large and influential body on the side of the government that be maintain at little expense the gobernadorcillo exercise the municipal authority and be especially charge to aid the parish priest in every thing appertain to religious observance etc in the town where the descendant of the chinese be sufficiently numerous they can by permission of the governor elect they own petty governor and officer from among themselves in each town there be also a headman -lrb- cabeza de barangay -rrb- who have the charge of fifty tributary in each of which be include as many family this division be call a barangay this office form by far the most important part of the machinery of government in the philippine island for these headman be the attorney of these small district and become the elector of the gobernadorcillo and other civil officer only twelve however of they or they substitute be allow to vote in each town the office of head-man exist before the conquest of the island and the spaniard show they wisdom in continue and adapt it to they system of police the office among the native be hereditary but they conqueror make it also elective and when a vacancy now occur through want of heir or resignation it be fill up by the superintendent of the province on the recommendation of the gobernadorcillo and the headman this be also the case when any new office be create the privilege of the headman be great themselves they wife and they first-born child be exempt from pay tribute to the crown a exoneration which be owe to they be collector of the royal revenue they duty consist in maintain good order and harmony in divide the labor require for the public benefit equally adjust difference and receive the tax the gobernadorcillo take cognizance of all civil case not exceed two tael of gold or forty-four dollar in silver all criminal case must be send to the chief of the province the headman formerly serve for no more than three year and if this be do faithfully they become and be designate as principal in virtue of which rank they receive the title of don the election take place at the court-house of the town the elector be the gobernadorcillo whose office be about to expire and twelve of the oldest headman cabezas de barangay collector of tribute for the gobernadorcillo they must select by a plurality of vote three individual who must be able to speak read and write the spanish language the voting be do by ballot in the presence of the notary -lrb- escribano -rrb- and the chief of the province who preside the curate may be present to look after the interest of the church but for no other purpose after the vote be take they be seal and transmit to the governor-general who select one of the three candidate and issue a commission in the more distant province the chief of the district have the authority to select the gobernadorcillo and fill up the commission a blank form of which sign by the governor-general be leave with he for that purpose the headman may be elect petty governor and still retain they office and collect the tribute or tax for it be not consider just that the important office of chief of barangay should deprive the holder of the honor of be elect gobernadorcillo the greater part of the chinese reside in the province of tondo but the tribute be there collect by the alcalde mayor with a assistant take from among the officer of the royal treasury the poll-tax on the chinese amount to four dollar a head it be formerly one-half more tax-list of the chinese be keep in which they be register and classify and opposite the name be the amount at which the individual be assess the spanish government seem particularly desirous of give consequence even to its lowest office and in order to secure it to they it be direct that the chief of province shall treat the gobernadorcillo with respect offer they seat when they enter they house or other place and not allow they to remain standing furthermore the parish curate be require to treat they with equal respect so far as concern the province the government may be call notwithstanding the officer court etc monastic the priest rule and frequently administer punishment with they own hand to either sex of which a instance will be cite hereafter -lrb- a country excursion -rrb- as soon as we could procure the necessary passport which be obligingly furnish by the governor to don russel sturge y quatro anglo americano we party leave manila for a short jaunt to the mountain it be consider as a mark of great favor on the part of he excellency to grant this indulgence particularly as he have a few month prior deny it to a party of french officer i be tell that he prefer to make it a domestic concern by issue the passport in the name of a resident in order that compliance in this case might not give umbrage to the french it be generally believe that the cause of the refusal in the former instance be the imprudent manner in which the french officer go about take plan and sketch at the corner of street etc which in the mind of a unenlightened and ignorant colonial government of course excited suspicion nothing can be so ridiculous as this system of passport for if one be so dispose a plan and the most minute information of every thing that concern the defence of place can always be obtain at little cost now-a-day for such be the skill of engineer that a plan be easily make of place merely by a sight of they we be not however dispose to question the propriety of the governor 's conduct in the former case and i leave abundantly oblige to he for a permission that would add to we stock of information it be deem at first impossible for the party to divide as they have but one passport and some difficulty be anticipate from the number be double that state in the passport the party consist of messr sturge pickering eld rich dana and brackenridge mr sturge however see no difficulty in divide the party after they have pass beyond the precinct of the city take the precaution at the same time not to appear together beyond the number designate on the paper on the 14th they leave manila and proceed in carriage to santa ana on the pasig in order to avoid the delay that would ensue if they follow the winding of the river in a banca and against the current at santa ana they find they banca wait for they and embark here the scene be render animated by numerous boat of all description from the parao to the small canoe of a single log there be a large population that live wholly on the water : for the padrone of the parao have usually they family with they which from the great variety of age and sex give a very different and much more bustling appearance to the crowd of boat than would be the case if they only contain those who be employ to navigate they at time the parao and banca of all size together with the saraboa and pativa -lrb- duck establishment -rrb- become jumble together and create a confusion and noise such as be seldom meet with in any other country -lrb- duck farm -rrb- the pativa be under the care of the original inhabitant to whom exclusively the superintendence of the duckling seem to be commit the pen be make of bamboo and be not over a foot high the bird be all in admirable order and make no attempt to escape over the low barrier although so light that it be think by some of we gentleman it would not have suffice to confine american duck although they wing might have be cut the mode of give they exercise be by cause they to run round in a ring the good understanding exist between the keeper and they charge be striking particularly when the former be engage in cleanse the pen and assist the current to carry off the impurity in the course of they sail it be estimate that hundred of thousand of duck of all age be see the woman who be see be usually engage in fishing with a hook and line and be generally stand in the water or in canoe the saraboa be here also in use the run of the fish be generally concentrate by a chevaux-de-frise to guide they towards the net and locality where the fisherman place themselves at five o'clock they reach the laguna de bay where they take in a new crew with mast and sail this be call twenty-five mile from manila by the river the distance in a bird 's flight be not over twelve the whole distance be densely people and well cultivate the crop consist of indigo rice etc with grove of the betel palm coconut and quantity of fruit tree the shore of the lake be shelve and afford good situation for place fish-weir which be here establish on a extensive scale these weir be form of slip of bamboo and be to be see run in every direction to the distance of two or three mile they may be say to invest entirely the shore of the lake for several mile from its outlet and without a pilot it would be difficult to find the way through they at night when heron and tern be see roost on the top of each slat these weir present rather a curious spectacle the laguna de bay be say to be about ten league in length by three in width and trend in a north-northwest and south-southeast direction after dark the banca separated mr sturge with dr pickering and mr eld proceed to visit the mountain of maijaijaus while messr rich dana and brackenridge go towards the taal volcano the latter party take the passport while the former rely upon certain letter of introduction for protection in case of difficulty mr sturge with he party direct he course to the east side of the lake towards a point call jalajalum which they reach about three o'clock in the morning and stop for the crew to cook some rice etc at 8 o'clock be they reach santa cruz situate about half a mile up a small streamlet call paxanau at this place they find don escudero to whom they have a letter of introduction and who hold a civil appointment they be kindly receive by this gentleman and he brown lady with they interesting family he at once order horse for they to proceed to the mission of maijaijaus and entertain they with a sumptuous breakfast they be not prepare to set out before noon until which time they stroll about the town of santa cruz the inhabitant of which be tagalog there be only two old spaniard in the place the province in which santa cruz be situate contain about five thousand inhabitant of whom eighteen hundred pay tribute the people have the character of be orderly and govern themselves without the aid of the military the principal article of culture be the coconut tree which be see in large grove the trunk of these be notch as be suppose for the purpose of climb they from the spathe a kind of spirit be manufacture which be fully as strong as we whiskey about noon they leave don escudero 's and take a road lead to the southward and eastward through a luxuriant and beautiful country well cultivate and ornament with lofty coconut tree betel palm and banana grove several beautiful valley be pass with streamlet rush through they maijaijai be situate about one thousand foot above the laguna de bay but the rise be so gradual that it be almost imperceptible the country have everywhere the appearance of be densely peopled but no more than one village be pass between santa cruz and the mission they have letter to f antonio romana y aranda padre of the mission who receive they kindly and entertain they most hospitably -lrb- climb banajao -rrb- when he be tell of they intention to visit the mountain he say it be impossible with such weather point to the black cloud that then envelop its summit and he endeavor to persuade the gentleman to desist from what appear to he a mad attempt but find they resolve to make the trial he aid in make all the necessary preparation though he have no belief in they success on the morning of the 27th after mass mr eld and dr pickering set out but mr sturge prefer to keep the good padre company until they return the padre have provide they with guide horse twenty native and provision for three day he have be himself on the same laborious journey some six month before and know its fatigue although it turn out afterwards that he expedition be perform in fine weather and that he have be bear on a litter by native the whole way the first part of the road be wet and miry and discourage enough the soil be exceedingly rich produce tropical plant in great profusion in the midst of which be see the neat bamboo cottage with they industrious and cleanly-looking inhabitant when they reach the foot of the mountain they find it be impossible to ride farther and be oblige to take to walk which be however less of a hardship than ride the little rat of horse cover with mud and dirt which be at first deem useless but the manner in which they ascend and maintain themselves on the slippery bank surpass anything they have before witness in horseflesh the first part of the ascent of the mountain be gradual but over a miry path which be extremely slippery and have it not be for the stick stick down by the party of the padre in they former ascent they would have find it extremely difficult to overcome to make it more disagreeable it rain all the time it take about two hour to reach the steep ascent the last portion of they route have be through a uninhabited region with some opening in the wood afford pasture-grounds to a few small herd of buffalo in three hour they reach the half-way house by a very steep and regular ascent here the native insist upon stop to cook they breakfast as they have not yet partake of anything through the day the native now endeavor to persuade they it be impracticable to go any farther or at least to reach the top of the mountain and return before night we gentleman lose they patience at the delay and after a hour 's endurance of it resolve to set out alone six of the native follow they and by half-past three they reach the summit where they find it cold and uncomfortable the ascent have be difficult and be principally accomplish by catch hold of shrub and the root of tree the summit be comparatively bare and not more than fifty foot in width the side opposite to that by which they mount be perpendicular but owe to the thick fog they could not see the depth to which the precipice descend the observation with the barometer be speedily take which give the height of banajao as six thousand five hundred foot the tree on the summit be twenty or thirty foot high and a species of fir be very common gaultherium attach to the trunk of tree rhododendron and polygonum also abound the rock be so cover with soil that it be difficult to ascertain they character dr pickering be of opinion however that they be not volcanic the house on the summit afford they little or no shelter be a mere shed open on all side they find it untenantable and determine to return as soon as they observation be finish to the half-way house which they reach before dark the night be pass uncomfortably and in the morning they make a early start down the mountain to reach the native village at its foot where they be refresh with a cup of chocolate cake and some dulce accord to the custom of the country at ten o'clock they reach the mission where they be receive by the padre and mr sturge the former be greatly astonish to hear that they have really be to the summit and have accomplish in twenty-four hour what he have deem a labor of three day he quickly attend to they want the first among which be dry clothing and as they baggage have unfortunately be leave at santa cruz the wardrobe of the rotund padre be place at they disposal although the fit be rather uncouth on the spare form of we gentleman yet he clothes serve the purpose tolerably well and be thankfully make use of during they absence mr sturge have be much amuse with the discipline he have witness at the hand of the church which here seem to be the only visible ruling power two young native have make complaint to the padre that a certain damsel have enter into vow or engagement to marry both she be accordingly bring up before the padre mr sturge be present the padre first lecture she most seriously upon the enormity of she crime then inflict several blow on the palm of she outstretched hand again renew the lecture and finally conclude with another whipping the girl be pretty and excite the interest of we friend who look on with much desire to interfere and save the damsel from the corporal punishment render more aggravate by the dispassionate and cool manner in which it and the lecture be administer in the conversation which ensue the padre say he have more case of the violation of the marriage vow and of infidelity than any other class of crime after a hearty breakfast or rather dinner and express they thanks to the padre they ride back to santa cruz where they arrive at a early hour and at nine o'clock in the evening they embark in they banca for manila -lrb- lo baños -rrb- in the morning they find themselves after a comfortable night at lo baños here they take chocolate with the padre to whom mr sturge have a letter who inform they that the other party have leave the place the evening before for manila this party have proceed to the town of baium where they arrive at daylight on the 15th baium be quite a pretty place and well situate the house be clean and comfortable and it possess a venerable stone church with tower and bell on inquire for the padre they find that he be absent and it be in consequence impossible for they to procure horse to proceed to the volcano of taal they therefore conclude to walk to the hot spring at lo baños about five mile distant along the road they collect a number of curious plant rice be much cultivate and field of it extend to some distance on each side of the road buffalo be see feeding and wallow in the ditch at lo baños the hot spring be numerous the water issue from the rock over a considerable surface the quantity of water discharge by they be large and the whole be collect and conduct to the bathing-house the temperature of the water at the mouth of the culvert be 180 ° the old bath-house be a singular-looking place be build on the hill-side in the old spanish style with large balcony that be enclose in the manner already describe in speaking of the house in manila it be beautifully situate and overlook the bath and lake the bath be of stone and consist of two large room in each of which be a niche through which the hot water pass this building be now in ruin the roof and floor have fall in lo baños be a small village but contain a respectable-looking stone church and two or three house of the same material here the party find a difficulty in get on for the alcalde could not speak spanish and they be oblige to use a interpreter in order to communicate with he notwithstanding this he be a magistrate whose duty it be to administer law write in that language find they could not succeed even here in procure guide or horse they determine to remain and explore mount maquile the height of which be three thousand four hundred and fifty foot and in the meantime to send for they banca the next day they set out on they journey to that mountain and the first part of they path lay over a gentle ascent through cultivate grounds next succeed a almost perpendicular hill bare of tree and overgrown with a tall grass which it be difficult to pass through such have be the time take up that the party find it impossible to reach the summit and return before dark they therefore begin to collect specimen and after have obtain a full load they return late in the afternoon to lo baños the mountain be compose of trachytic rock and tufa which be occasionally see to break through the rich and deep soil show themselves here and there in the deep valley which former volcanic action have create and which have destroy the regular outline of the cone-shaped mountain the tufa be generally find to form the gently-sloping plain that surround these mountain and have in all probability be eject from they small crater of some two hundred foot in height be scatter over the plain the tufa be likewise expose to view on the shore of the lake but elsewhere except on a few bare hill it be entirely cover with the dense and luxuriant foliage the tufa be generally of a soft character crumble in the finger and in it be find coarse and fine fragment of scorium pumice etc the layer be from a few inch to five foot in thickness in the country around lo baños there be several volcanic hill and on the side of mount maquiling be appearance of parasitic cone similar to those observe at the hawaiian island but time and the foliage have so disguise they that it be difficult to determine exactly they true character i regret exceedingly that the party that set out for the lake of taal be not able to reach it as from the account i have it must be one of the most interesting portion of the country it lie nearly south-west from manila and occupy a area of about one hundred and twenty square mile the volcano of taal be situate on a island near the center of it and be now in action the cone which rise from its center be remarkably regular and consist for the most part of cinder and scoria it have be find to be nine hundred foot in elevation above the lake the crater have a diameter of two mile and its depth be equal to the elevation the wall of the crater be nearly perpendicular so much so that the descent can not be make without the assistance of rope at the bottom there be two small cone much steam issue from the many fissure accompany by sulphurous acid gas the water of the lake be impregnate with sulphur and there be say to be also large bed of sulphur in the opinion of those who have visit this spot the whole lake once form a immense crater and this do not appear very improbable if we be to credit the account we receive of the many crater on this island that be now fill with water for instance in the neighborhood of san pablo there be say to be eight or nine -lrb- the hot spring -rrb- the hot spring of lo baños be numerous and in they vicinity large quantity of steam be see to issue from the shore of the lake there be about a dozen which give out a copious supply of water the principal one have be enclose and make to flow through a stone aqueduct which discharge a considerable stream the temperature of the water as it leave the aqueduct be 178 ° the villager use it for cooking and wash the sign of the former employment be evident enough from the quantity of feather from the poultry that have be scald and pluck preparatory to cook the bath be form by a small circular building six foot in diameter erect over the point of discharge for the purpose of secure a steam-bath the temperature of these be 160 ° and 140 ° a change of temperature be say to have occur in the latter the rock in the vicinity be all tufa and some of the spring break out close to the cold water of the lake near the aqueduct a stone wall surround one of the principal outlet two-third of the area thus enclose be occupy by a pond of warm water and the other third be divide into two stone reservoir build for bath these bath have at one time a high reputation and be a very fashionable resort for the society of manila but they celebrity gradually diminish and the whole premise have go out of repair and be fast fall to ruin the water of the spring have no perceptible taste and only a very faint smell of sulphur be perceive no gas escape from it but a white incrustation cover the stone over which the water flow some of these water be obtain and since we return be put into the hand of dr c t jackson of boston who give the following analysis : specific gravity 10043 thermometer 60 ° barometer 3005 in a quantity of the water equal in bulk to three thousand grain of distilled water on evaporation give -- dry salt 595 grain a quantity of the water equal in bulk to one thousand grain of distilled water be operate on for each of the follow ingredient : chlorine 066 carbonic acid 016 sulphuric acid 003 soda and sodium 097 magnesia 009 lime 007 potash trace organic matter manganese -- 198 -lrb- mount maquiling -rrb- on mount maquile wild buffalo hog a small species of deer and monkey be find bird be also very numerous and among they be the horn-bill the noise make by this bird resemble a loud bark report speak of they as a excellent bird for the table we gentleman reach they lodging-place as the night close in and the next day again embark for manila regret that time would not permit they to make another visit to so interesting a field of research they find the lake so rough that they be compel to return and remain until eight o'clock this however give we botanist another opportunity of make collection among which be beautiful specimen of volkamerium splenden with elegant scarlet flower and a brugmansium which expand its beautiful silvery flower after sunset on the shore a number of bird be feed include pelican with they huge bill the diver with its long arched neck heron gull eagle and snow-white crane with duck and other small aquatic flock towards night these be join by large bat that be see wing they way towards the plantation of fruit these with quantity of insect give a vivid idea of the wonderful myriad of animated thing that be constantly bring into be in these tropical and luxuriant climate sail all night in a rough sea they be much incommode by the water which be ship into the banca and keep they constantly bale out : they reach the pasig river at daylight and again pass the duck establishment and the numerous boat and banca on they way to the market of manila both the party reach the consul 's the same day highly please with they respective jaunt to the kindness of messr sturge and moore we be mainly indebted for the advantage and pleasure derive from the excursion the instrument be now embark and preparation make for go to sea we stay at manila have add much to we collection we obtain many new specimen and the officer and naturalist have be constantly and profitably occupy in they various duty we go on board on January 20 and be accompany to the vessel by messr sturge and moore with several other resident of manila we have through the kindness of captain salomon procure a native pilot for the sulu sea who be to act as interpreter on the morning of the 21st we take leave of we friend and get under way the same day and before we have clear the bay we speak the american ship angier which have perform the voyage from the united state in one hundred and twenty-four day and furnish we with late and interesting news we then with a strong northerly wind make all sail to the south for the strait of mindoro sulu in 1842 on the evening of January 21 the vincenne with the tender in company leave manila bay i then send for mr knox who command the latter and give he direction to keep closely in company with the vincenne and at the same time point out to he place of rendezvous where the vessel might again meet in case any unavoidable circumstance cause they separation i be more particular in give he instruction to avoid lose sight of the vincenne as i be aware that my propose survey might be impede or frustrate altogether be i deprive of the assistance of the vessel under he command -lrb- mindoro -rrb- on the 22nd we pass the entrance of the strait of san bernardino it would have be my most direct route to follow these strait until i have pass mindoro and it be i be satisfy the safest course unless the wind be fair for the direct passage my object however be to examine the ground for the benefit of other and the apo shoal which lie about mid-channel between palawan and mindoro claim my first attention the tender be despatch to survey it while i proceed in the vincenne to examine the more immediate entrance to the sulu sea off the southwest end of mindoro calavite peak be the north point of mindoro and we observation make it two thousand foot high this peak be of the shape of a dome and appear remarkably regular when see from its western side on approach mindoro we as be usual under high island lose the steady breeze and the wind become light for the rest of the day mindoro be a beautiful island and be evidently volcanic it appear as if throw up in confused mass it be not much settle as the more southern island be prefer to it as a residence on the 23rd we ascertain the elevation of the highest peak of the island by triangulation to be three thousand one hundred and twenty-six fet the easternmost island of the palawan group busuanga be at the time just in sight from the deck to the southwest it have be my intention to anchor at ambolou island but the wind die away before we reach it and i determine to stand off and on all night on the 24th i begin to experience the truth of what captain halcon have assert namely that the exist chart be entirely worthless and i also find that my native pilot be of no more value than they be he have evidently pass the place before but whether the size of the vessel so much greater than any he have sail in confused he or whether it be from he inability to understand and to make himself understand by we he be of no use whatever and we have the misfortune of run into shoal water barely escape the bottom these danger be usually quickly pass and we soon find ourselves again float in thirty or forty fathom water we continue beat to windward in hope of be join by the flying-fish and i resolve to finish the survey towards the island of semarara we find every thing in a different position from that assign it by any of the chart with which we be furnish on this subject however i shall not dwell but refer those who desire particular information to the chart and hydrographical memoir towards evening i again run down to the southwest point of the island of mindoro and send a letter on shore to the pueblo with direction to have it put on board the tender when she should arrive we then begin to beat round semarara in order to pass over towards panay the southern part of mindoro be much higher than the northern but appear to be equally rough it be however susceptible of cultivation and there be many village along its shore semarara be moderately high and about fifteen mile in circumference it be inhabit and like mindoro much wooded accord to the native pilot its shore be free from shoal it be not until the next day that we succeed in reach panay i determine to pass the night off point potol the north end of panay as i believe the sea in its neighborhood to be free of shoal and wish to resume we run survey early in the morning -lrb- panay -rrb- at daylight on the 27th we continue the survey down the coast of panay and succeed in correct many error in the exist chart -lrb- both english and spanish -rrb- the channel along this side be from twelve to twenty mile wide and suitable for beat in little current be believe to exist and the tide as far as we observation go seem to be regular and of little strength the island of panay be high and broken particularly on the south end its shore be thickly settle and well cultivate indigo and sugar-cane claim much of the attention of the inhabitant the native be the principal cultivator they pay to government a capitation tax of seven real its population be estimate at three hundred thousand which i think be rather short of the actual number on all the hill there be telegraph of rude construction to give information of the approach of piratical prahus from sulu which formerly be in the habit of make attack upon the defenceless inhabitant and carry they off into slavery of late year they have cease these depredation for the spaniard have resort to a new mode of warfare instead of pursue and punish the offender they now intercept all they supplies both of necessaries and luxury and the fear of this have have the effect to deter pirate from they usual attack we remain off san pedro for the night in hope of fall in with the flying-fish in the morning on the morning of the 28th the flying-fish be discover plainly in sight i immediately stand for she fire a gun and make signal at seven o'clock another gun be fire but the vessel still stand off and be see to make sail to the westward without pay any regard whatever to either and be favor by a breeze while the vincenne be becalm she steal off and be soon out of sight -lrb- 270 -rrb- after breakfast we open the bay of antique on which be situate the town of san josé as this bay apparently offer anchorage for vessel bind up this coast i determine to survey it and for this purpose the boat be hoist out and prepare for survey lieutenant budd be despatch to visit the pueblo call san josé on reach the bay the boat be send to different point of it and when they be in station the ship fire gun to furnish basis by the sound and angle be simultaneously measure the boat make sounding on they return to the ship and thus complete this duty so that in a hour or two afterwards the bay be correctly represent on paper it offer no more than a temporary anchorage for vessel and unless the shore be closely approach the water be almost too deep for the purpose -lrb- san josé -rrb- at san josé a spanish governor reside who preside over the two pueblo of san pedro and san josé and do the duty also of alcalde lieutenant budd do not see he as he be absent but he lady do the honor lieutenant budd represent the pueblo as cleanly and orderly about fifteen soldier be see who compose the governor 's guard and more be say to be station at san pedro a small fort of eight gun command the roadstead the beach be find to be of fine volcanic sand compose chiefly of oxide of iron and comminuted shell there be here also a narrow shore reef of coral the plain border the sea be cover with a dense growth of coconut tree in the fine season the bay be secure but we be inform that in westerly and southwesterly gale heavy sea set in and vessel be not able to lie at anchor several small vessel be lie in a small river about one and a half mile to the southward of the point on which the fort be situate the entrance to this river be very narrow and tortuous panay be one of the largest island of the group we have a opportunity of measure the height of some of its western peak or highland none of which exceed three thousand foot the interior and eastern side have many lofty summit which be say to reach a altitude of seven thousand five hundred foot but these as we pass be envelop in cloud or shut out from view by the nearer highland the general feature of the island be like those of luzon and mindoro the few specimen we obtain of its rock consist of the different variety of talcose formation with quartz and jasper the specimen be of no great value as they be much worn by lie on the beach the higher land be bare of tree and have it not be for the numerous fertile valley lie between the sharp and rugged spur it would have have a sterile appearance the bay of antique be in latitude 10 ° 40 ' n longitude 121 ° 59 ' 30 '' e it be my intention to remain for two or three day at a convenient anchorage to enable we to make short excursion into the interior but the vexatious mismanagement of the tender now make it incumbent that i should make every possible use of the time to complete the operation connect with the hydrography of this sea for i perceive that the duty which i intend should be perform by she would now devolve upon the boat and necessarily expose both officer and man to the hazard of contracting disease i regret give up this design not only on my own account and that of the expedition but because of the gratification it would have afford personally to the naturalist the town of san josé have about thirty bamboo house some of which be fill in with clay or mortar and plaster over both inside and out few of they be more than a single story in height that of the governor be of the same material and overtop the rest it be whitewashed and have a neat and cleanly appearance in the vicinity of the town be several beautiful valley which run into the mountain from the plain that border the bay the landing be on a bamboo bridge which have be erect over a extensive mud-flat that be expose at low water and prevent any nearer approach of boat this bridge be about seven hundred foot in length and a novel plan have be adopt to preserve it from be carry away the stem of bamboo not be sufficiently large and heavy to maintain the superstructure in the soft mud a scaffold be construct just under the top which be load with block of large stone and the outer pile be secure to anchor or rock with grass rope the roadway or top be ten foot wide cover with split bamboo weave together and have rail on each side to assist the passenger this be absolutely necessary for safety and even with this aid one unaccustomed to it must be possess of no little bodily strength to pass over this smooth slippery and springy bridge without accident two pirogue be at anchor in the bay and on the shore be the frame of a vessel which have evidently be a long while on the stock for the weed and bush near the keel be six or eight foot high and a portion of the timber be decay cart and sled draw by buffalo be in use and everything give it the appearance of a thrive village although i have mention the presence of soldier it be observe on landing that no guard be station about or even at the fort but shortly afterwards a soldier be see hurry towards the latter in the act of dress himself in he regimental and another run by he side with he cartridge-box and musket in a little while one be pass up and down on he post as though he be as permanent there as the fort itself after complete these duty the light air detain we the remainder of the day under panay in sight of the bay on the 29th at noon we have be waft by it far enough in the offing to obtain the easterly breeze which soon become strong with a overcast sky and carry we rapidly on we course my time would not permit my heaving-to we keep on we course for mindanao during the whole night and be constantly engage in sound with we patent lead with from thirty to forty fathom cast to prevent we pass over this part of the sea entirely unexamined -lrb- mindanao -rrb- at daylight on the 31st we have the island of mindanao before we but do not reach its western cape until 5 pm this island be high and break like those to the north of it but unlike they its mountain be cover with forest to they very top and there be no distinct cone of minor dimension as we have observe on the other if they do exist they be hide by the dense forest i have determine to anchor at caldera a small port on the south-west side of mindanao about ten mile distant from zamboanga where the governor reside the latter be a considerable place but the anchorage in its roadstead be say to be bad and the current that run through the strait of basilan be represent to be strong caldera on the other hand have a good though small anchorage which be free from the current of the strait it be therefore a excellent stopping-place in case of the tide prove unfavorable on one of its point stand a small fort which on we arrival hoist spanish color at six o'clock we come to anchor at caldera in seven fathom water there be few indication of inhabitant except at and near the fort a officer be despatch to the fort to report the ship it be find to be occupy by a few soldier under the command of a lieutenant -lrb- caldera fort -rrb- the fort be about seventy foot square and be build of large block of red coral which evidently have not be take from the vicinity of the place as be state by the officer of the fort for although we party wander along the alluvial beach for two or three mile in each direction no sign of coral be observe many fragment of red gray and purple basalt and porphyry be meet with along the beach talcose rock and slate syenite hornblend quartz both compact and slaty with chalcedony be find in piece and large pebble those who be engage in dredge report the bottom as be of coral in from four to six or eight fathom but this be of a different kind from that of which the fort be construct the fort be build in the year 1784 principally for protection against the sulu pirate who be in the habit of visit the settlement and carry off the inhabitant as slave to obtain ransom for they this and other of the same description be therefore construct as place of refuge for the inhabitant as well as to afford protection to vessel depredation be still commit which render it necessary to keep up a small force one or two hut which be see in the neighborhood of the bay be build on post twenty foot from the ground and into they they ascend by ladder which be haul up after the occupant have enter these it be say be the sleeping-hut and be so build for the purpose of prevent surprise at night before we arrival we have hear that the village be all so construct but a visit to one soon show that this be untrue the native see at the village be think to be of a decidedly lighter color and a somewhat different expression from the malay they be find to be very civil and more polish in manners than we gentleman expect on ask for a drink of water it be bring in a glass tumbler on a china plate a old woman to whom they have present some trifle take the trouble to meet they in another path on they return and insist on they accept a basket of potato some of the house contain several family and many of they have no other means of entrance than a notch post stick up to the door the forest of mindanao contain a great variety of tree some of which be of large size rise to the height of one hundred and and one hundred and fifty foot some of they trunk be shape like buttress similar to those before speak of at manila from which they obtain broad slab for the top of table the trunk be observe to shoot up remarkably straight we botanical gentleman though pleased with the excursion be disappoint at not be able to procure specimen from the lofty tree and the day be less productive in this respect than they have anticipate large woody vine be common which envelop the trunk of tree in they fold and ascend to they top prevent the collection of the most desirable specimen the path lead to the interior be narrow and much obstruct one fine stream be cross many buffalo be observe wallow in the mire and the wood swarm with monkey and number of bird among they the horn-bill these keep up a continue chatter and make a variety of loud noise the forest here be entirely different from any we have see elsewhere and the story of they be the abode of large boa and poisonous snake make the effect still greater on those who visit they for the first time we party however see nothing of these reptile nor anything to warrant a belief that such exist yet the officer at the fort related to I many snake story that seem to have some foundation and by inquiry make elsewhere i learn that they be at least warrant by some fact though probably not to the extent that he represent trace of deer and wild hog be see and many bird be obtain as well as land and sea shell among the latter be the malleus vulgari which be use as food by the native the soil on this part of the island be a stiff clay and the plant it produce be mostly woody those of a herbaceous character be scarce and only a few orchideous epiphyte and fern be see around the dwelling in the village be a variety of vegetable and fruit consist of sugar-cane sweet-potato gourd pumpkin pepper rice water and musk melon all fine and of large size the officer at the fort be a lieutenant of infantry one of that rank be station here for a month after which he with the garrison consist of three soldier be relieve from zamboanga where the spaniard have three company -lrb- zamboanga -rrb- zamboanga be a convict settlement to which the native rogue principally thief be send the spanish criminal as i have before state in speaking of manila be send to spain the inhabitant of the island of mindanao who be under the subjection of spain be about ten thousand in number of whom five or six thousand be at or in the neighborhood of zamboanga the original inhabitant who dwell in the mountain and on the east coast be say to be quite black and be represent to be a very cruel and bad set they have hitherto bid defiance to all attempt to subjugate they when the spaniard make excursion into the interior which be seldom they always go in large party on account of the wild beast serpent and hostile native nevertheless the latter frequently attack and drive they back the little fort be consider as a sufficient protection for the fisherman and small vessel against the pirate who inhabit the island of basilan which be in sight from mindanao and form the southern side of the strait of the same name it be say that about seven hundred inhabit it the name of moro be give by the spaniard to all those who profess the mohammedan religion and by such all the island to the west of mindanao and know under the name of the sulu archipelago be inhabit the day we spend at caldera be employ in survey the bay and in obtain observation for its geographical position and for magnetism the flood tide set to the northward and westward through the strait and the ebb to the eastward in the bay we find it to run two mile a hour by the log but it must be much more rapid in the strait at daylight on February 1st we get under way to stand over for the sangboy a small island with two sharp hill on it one and a half mile from the bay we pass over a bank the least water on which be ten fathom on a sandy bottom and on which a vessel might anchor the wind shortly after fail we and we drift with the tide for some hour in full view of the island of mindanao which be bold and picturesque we have thus a good opportunity of measure some of its mountain range which we make about three thousand foot high in the afternoon a light breeze come from the southwest and before sunset i find that we be again on sounding as soon as we have a cast of twenty fathom i anchor for the night judge it much better than to be drift about without any knowledge of the locality and current to which we be subject on the morning of the 2nd we get under way to proceed to the westward as the bottom be unequal i determine to pass through the broadest channel although it have the appearance of be the shoalest and send two boat ahead to sound in this way we pass through continue we survey operation and at the same time make a attempt to dredge but the ground be too uneven for the latter purpose and little of value be obtain -lrb- sulu -rrb- shortly after pass the sangboy we have the island of sulu in sight for which i now steer direct at sunset we find ourselves within five or six mile of soung harbor but there be not sufficient light to risk the danger that might be in we course nor wind enough to command the ship and have no bottom where we be i determine again to run out to sea and anchor on the first bank i should meet at half-past eight o'clock we strike sound in twenty-six fathom and anchor at daylight we determine we position by angle and find it to correspond with part of the route we have pass over the day before and that we be about fifteen mile from the large island of sulu weigh anchor we be shortly waft by the westerly tide and a light air towards that beautiful island which lay in the midst of its little archipelago and as we be bring nearer and nearer we come to the conclusion that in we many wanderings we have see nothing to be compare to this enchanting spot it appear to be well cultivate with gentle slope rise here and there into eminence from one to two thousand foot high one or two of these might be dignified with the name of mountain and be sufficiently high to arrest the pass cloud on the afternoon of we arrival we have a singular example in the dissipation of a thunderstorm although much of the island be under cultivation yet it have all the freshness of a forest region the many smoke on the hill building of large size cottage and cultivate spot together with the move crowd on the land the prahus canoe and fishing-boat on the water give the whole a civilized appearance we own vessel lay almost without a ripple at she side on the glassy surface of the sea carry onward to we destine anchorage by the flow tide and scarce a sound be hear except the splashing of the lead as it seek the bottom the effect of this be destroy in part by the knowledge that this beautiful archipelago be the abode of a cruel and barbarous race of pirate towards sunset we have nearly reach the bay of soung when we be meet by the oppose tide which frustrate all we endeavor to reach it and i be compel to anchor lest we should again be sweep to sea as soon as the night set in fisherman 's light be see move along the beach in all direction and glide about in canoe while the sea be fill with myriad of phosphorescent animalculum after watch this scene for two or three hour in the calm and still night a storm that have be gather reach we but it last only for a short time and clear off after a shower which give the air a freshness that be delightful after the sultry heat we have experience during the day the canoe of this archipelago be find to be different from any that we have heretofore see not only in shape but in make use of a double outrigger which consequently must give they additional security the paddle also be of a different shape and have a blade at each end which be use alternately thus enable a single person to manage they with ease these canoe be make of a single log though some be build upon they seldom carry more than two person the figure on the opposite page will give a correct idea of one of they we see the fisherman engage in trolling and use the line but the manner of take fish which have be heretofore describe be chiefly practice in fishing as well as in all they other employment the kris and spear be invariably by they side -lrb- sulu harbor -rrb- the next morning at eight o'clock we get under way and be tow by we boat into the bay of soung where we anchor off the town in nine fathom water while in the act of do so and after we intention have become too evident to admit of a doubt the sultan graciously send off a message give we permission to enter he port lieutenant budd be immediately despatch with the interpreter to call upon the datu mulu or governor and to learn at what hour we could see the sultan when the officer reach the town all be find asleep and after remain four hour wait the only answer he could get out of the datu mulu be that he suppose that the sultan would be awake at three o'clock when he think i could see he during this time the boat have be prepare for survey and after land the naturalist they begin the work at the appoint time captain hudson and myself go on shore to wait upon the sultan on we approach to the town we find that a great proportion of it be build over the water on pile and only connect with the shore by narrow bridge of bamboo the style of building in sulu do not differ materially from that of the malay the house be rather larger and they surpass the other in filth -lrb- pirate craft -rrb- we pass for some distance between the bridge to the landing and on we way see several piratical prahus apparently lay up twenty of these be count of about thirty ton burden evidently build for sea-vessel and capable of mount one or two long gun we land at a small streamlet and walk a short distance to the datu 's house which be of large dimension and rudely build on pile which raise it about six foot above the ground and into which we be invite the house of the datu contain one room part of which be screen off to form the apartment of he wife nearly in the center be a raise dais eight or ten foot square under which be stow all he valuable pack in chest and chinese trunk upon this dais be place mat for sleep with cushion pillow etc and over it be a sort of canopy hang around with fine chintz or muslin the dais be occupy by the datu who be next to the sultan the greatest man of this island he at once come from it to receive we and have chair provide for we near he sanctum after we be seat he again retire to he lounge the datu be small in person and emaciate in form but have a quick eye and a intelligent countenance he live as he tell I with all he goods around he and they form a collection such as i could scarcely imagine it possible to bring together in such a place the interior put I in mind of a barn inhabit by a company of stroll player on one side be hang up a collection of various kind of gay dress here drum and gong there sword lantern spear musket and small cannon on another side be shield buckler mask saw and wheel with belt band and long robe the whole be a strange mixture of tragedy and farce and the group of native be not far remove in appearance from the supernumerary that a turkish tragedy might have bring together in the green-room of a theater a set of more cowardly-looking miscreant i never see they appear ready either to trade with we pick we pocket or cut we throat as a opportunity might offer the wife 's apartment be not remarkable for its comfort although the datu speak of it with much consideration and evidently hold he better half in high estimation he be also proud of he six child the youngest of whom he bring out in its nurse 's arm and exhibit with much pride and satisfaction he particularly draw my attention to its little highly-wrought and splendidly-mounted kris which be stick through its girdle as a emblem of he rank he be in reality a fine-looking child the kitchen be behind the house and occupied but a small space for they have little in the way of food that require much preparation the house of the datu might justly be term nasty we now learn the reason why the sultan could not be see it be Friday the mahomedan sabbath and he have be at the mosque from a early hour lieutenant budd have be detain because it be not know when he would finish he prayer and the ceremony of the day be more important than usual on account of its peculiar sanctity in they calendar -lrb- visit the sultan -rrb- word have be send off to the ship that the sultan be ready to receive I but the messenger pass we while on we way to shore after we have be seat for a while the datu ask if we be ready to accompany he to see the sultan but intimate that no one but captain hudson and myself could be permit to lay eye on he be inform that we be he at once and in we presence slip on he silken trousers and a new jacket cover with bell-button put on he slipper strap himself round with a long silken net sash into which he stick he kris and with umbrella in hand say he be ready he now lead the way out of he house leave the motley group behind and we take the path to the interior of the town towards the sultan 's the datu and i walk hand in hand on a roadway about ten foot wide with a small stream run on each side captain hudson and the interpreter come next and a guard of six trusty slave bring up the rear when we reach the outskirts of the town about half a mile from the datu 's we come to the sultan 's residence where he be prepare to receive we in state he house be construct in the same manner as that of the datu but be of larger dimension and the pile be rather higher instead of step we find a ladder rudely construct of bamboo and very crazy this be so steep that it be necessary to use the hand in mount it i understand that the ladder be always remove in the night for the sake of security we enter at once into the presence-chamber where the whole divan if such it may be call sit in arm-chairs occupy the half of a large round table cover with a white cotton cloth on the opposite side of the table seat be place for we on we approach the sultan and all he council rise and motion we to we seat when we have take they the part of the room behind we be literally cram with well-armed man a few minute be pass in silence during which time we have a opportunity of look at each other and around the hall in which we be seat the latter be of very common workmanship and exhibit no sign of oriental magnificence overhead hang a print cotton cloth form a kind of tester which cover about half of the apartment in other place the roof and rafter be visible a part of the house be roughly partition off to the height of nine or ten foot enclose as i be afterwards tell the sultan 's sleep apartment and that appropriate to he wife and she attendant the sultan be of middle height spare and thin he be dress in a white cotton shirt loose trousers of the same material and slipper he have no stocking the bottom of he trousers be work in scollop with blue silk and this be the only ornament i see about he on he head he wear a small color cotton handkerchief wound into a turban that just cover the top of he head he eye be bloodshot and have a uneasy wild look show that he be under the effect of opium of which they all smoke large quantity he tooth be as black as ebony which with he bright cherry-colored lip -lrb- 271 -rrb- contrast with he swarthy skin give he anything but a pleasant look on the left hand of the sultan sit he two son while he right be occupy by he councillor just behind he sit the carrier of he betel-nut casket the casket be of filigree silver about the size of a small tea-caddy of oblong shape and round at the top it have three division one for the leaf another for the nut and a third for the lime next to this official be the pipe-bearer who do not appear to be hold in such estimation as the former -lrb- treaty with united state -rrb- i open the conversation by desire that the datu would explain the nature of we visit and tell the sultan that i have come to make the treaty which he have some time before desire to form with the united state -lrb- 272 -rrb- the sultan reply that such be still he desire upon which i tell he i would draw one up for he that same day while i be explain to he the term a brass candlestick be bring in with a light tallow candle of a very dark color and rude shape that show but little art in the manufacture this be place in the center of the table with a plate of manila cigar none of they however be offer to we nor any kind of refreshment we visit last nearly a hour when we arise to take we leave the sultan and he divan do the same and we make we exit with low bow on each side i look upon it as a matter of daily occurrence for all those who come to the island to visit the sultan but the datu mulu take great pain to make I believe that a great favor have be grant in allow we a sight of he ruler on the other hand i dwelt upon the condescension it be on my part to visit he and i refuse to admit that i be under any gratitude or obligation for the sight of he majesty the sultan mohammed damaliel kisand but say that he might feel grateful to I if he sign the treaty i would prepare for he on we return from the sultan 's to the datu mulu 's house we find even a greater crowd than before the datu however contrived to get we seat the attraction which draw it together be to look at mr agate who be take a sketch of mohammed polalu the sultan 's son and next heir to the throne i have hope to procure one of the sultan but this be declare to be impossible the son however have all the characteristic of the sulu and the likeness be think a excellent one mohammed polalu be about twenty-three year of age of a tall slender figure with a long face heavy and dull eye as though he be constantly under the influence of opium so much indeed be he addict to the use of this drug even accord to the datu mulu 's account that he strength and constitution be very much impaired as he be keep particularly under the guardianship of the datu the latter have a strong interest in preserve this influence over he and seem on this account to afford he every opportunity of indulge in this deplorable habit during we visit the effect of a pipe of this drug be see upon he for but a short time after he have recline himself on the datu 's couch and cushion and take a few whiff he be entirely overcome stupid and listless i have never see any one so young bear such evident mark of the effect of this deleterious drug when but partially recover from its effect he call for he betelnut to revive he by its exciting effect this be carefully chew by he attendant to a proper consistency mould in a ball about the size of a walnut and then slip into the mouth of the heir apparent -lrb- interior travel prohibit -rrb- one of the request i have make of the sultan be that the officer might have guide to pass over the island this be at once say to be too dangerous to be attempt as the datus of the interior and southern town would in all probability attack the party i understand what this mean and reply that i be quite willing to take the responsibility and that the party should be well arm to this the sultan reply that he would not risk he own man this i saw be a mere evasion but it be difficult and would be dangerous for we gentleman to proceed alone and i therefore say no more on we return to the datu 's i give they permission to get as far from the beach as they could but i be afterwards inform by they that in endeavor to penetrate into the wood they be always stop by armed man this be also the case when they approach particular part of the town but they be not molest as long as they ramble be confine to the beach at the datu 's we be treat to chocolate and negus in gilt-edged tumbler with small stale cake which have be bring from manila after we have sit some time i be inform that mr dana miss he bowie-knife pistol which he have for a moment lay down on a chest i at once come to the conclusion that it have be steal and as the theft have occur in the datu 's house i determine to hold he responsible for it and give he at once to understand that i should do so inform he that the pistol must be return before the next morning or he must take the consequence this throw he into some consternation and by my manner he feel that i be serious captain hudson and myself previous to we return on board visit the principal part of the town the chinese quarter be separate by a body of water and have a gateway that lead to a bridge the bridge be cover by a roof and on each side of it be small shop which be open in front and thus expose the goods they contain in the rear of the shop be the dwelling of the dealer this sort of bazaar contain but a very scanty assortment and the goods be of inferior quality we visit some blacksmith-shop where they be manufacture krise and spear these shop be open shed the fire be make upon the ground and two wooden cylinder whose valve be in the bottom serve for bellows when use they have movable piston which be work by a man on a elevated seat and answer the purpose better than could have be expect the kris be a weapon in which this people take great pride it be of various shape and size and be invariably worn from infancy to old age they be generally wavy in they blade and be wear in wooden scabbard which be neatly make and highly polish the market be well stock with fruit and fish among the former the durian seem to predominate this be the first time we have see it it have a very disagreeable odour as if decay and appear to emit a sulphuretted hydrogen gas which i observe blacken silver some have describe this fruit as delicious but if the smell be not enough the taste in my opinion will convince any one of the contrary mr brackenridge make the follow list of they fruit : durian artocarpus integrifolium melon water and musk orange mandarin and bitter pineapple carica papaya mangosteen bread-fruit coco and betelnut the vegetable be capsicum cucumber yam sweet-potato garlic onion edible fern-root and radish of the salmon variety but thicker and more acrid in flavor -lrb- a steal granite monument -rrb- in walk about the part of the town we be permit to enter large slab of cut granite be see which be presume to be from china where the wall of canal or streamlet be line with it but dr pickering in he ramble discover piece that have be cut as if to form a monument and remark a difference between it and the chinese kind on one or two piece he see the mark no 1 in black paint the material resemble the chelmsford granite and it occur to he that the stone have be cut in boston i do not hear of this circumstance until after we have leave sulu and have little doubt now that the interdiction against we gentleman visit some part of the town be owe to the fear they have of the discovery of this plunder this may have be the reason why they so readily comply with my demand in order to get rid of we as soon as possible feeling themselves guilty and be unprepared for defense for of the numerous gun mount few if any be serviceable the theft of the pistol be so barefaced a affair that i make up my mind to insist on its restoration at the setting of the watch in the evening it have be we practice on board the vincenne to fire a small brass howitzer this frequently in the calm evening produce a great reverberation and roll along the water to the surround island with considerable noise instead of it on this evening i order one of the long gun to be fire believe that the sound and reverberation alone would suffice to intimidate such robber one be accordingly fire in the direction of the town which fairly shake the island as they say and it be not long before we see that the rogue be fully arouse for the clatter of gong and voice that come over the water and the motion of light convince I that the pistol would be forthcoming in the morning in this i be not mistake for at early daylight i be awaken by a special messenger from the datu to tell I that the pistol be find and would be bring off without delay that he have be search for it all night and have at last succeed in find it as well as the thief on whom he intend to inflict the bastinado accordingly in a short time the pistol be deliver on board and every expression of friendship and good-will give with the strongest assurance that nothing of the kind should happen again -lrb- maronga island -rrb- as we naturalist could have no opportunity of ramble over the island of sooloo it be think that one of the neighbouring island -lrb- although not so good a field -rrb- would afford they many of the same result and that they could examine it unmolested accordingly at a early hour they be despatch in boat for that purpose with a sufficient guard to attend they in case of necessity the island on which they land maronga have two hill of volcanic conglomerate and vesicular lava contain angular fragment embed the bottom be cover with live coral of every variety and of different color but there be nothing like a regular coral shelf and the beach be compose of bit of coral intermix with dead shell both entire and comminute the center of the island be cover with mangrove-bush the hill be cone but have no crater on they the mangrove have grow in cluster give the appearance of a number of small islet this with the neighbor island be think to be compose in a great part of coral but it be impossible for we gentleman to determine the fact the day be exceedingly hot and the island be suffer to such a degree from drought that the leaf in many case be curl and appear dry on the face of the rocky cliff they see many swallow -lrb- hirundo esculenta -rrb- fly in and out of the cavern face the sea but they be not fortunate enough to find any of the edible nest so much esteem by chinese epicure at another part of the island they hear the crowing of a cock and discover a small village almost hide by the mangrove and build over the water in the neighborhood be several fish-baskets set out to dry as well as a quantity of fencing for weir all make of rattan they shape be somewhat peculiar after a little while the native fisherman be see approach who evidently have a knowledge of they visit from the first they come near with great caution in they canoe but after the first have speak and reconnoiter several other land exhibit no sign of embarrassment and soon motion we party off to indicate that force would be resort to in case of refusal at the same time they point to they arm and draw they krise we gentleman take this all in good part and after dispense a few trifling present among they begin they retreat with a convenient speed without however compromise they dignity the excursion have be profitable in the way of collection have yield a number of specimen of shrub and tree both in flower and fruit but owe to the drought the herbaceous plant be for the most part dry up among the latter however they see a large and fine terrestrial species of epidendrum whose stem grow to the height of several foot and when surmount by its flower reach twelve or fifteen foot high many of the salt-marsh plant see in the fiji be also observe here besides the plant some shell and a beautiful cream-colored pigeon be obtain during the day we be busily engage in the survey of the harbor and in make astronomical and magnetical observation on the beach while some of the officer be employ purchase curiosity on shore at the town and alongside the ship these consist of krise spear shield and shell and the sulus be not slow in comprehend the kind of article we be in search of few if any of the sulus can write or read though many talk spanish they account be all keep by the slave those who can read and write be in consequence highly prize all the account of the datu of soung be keep in dutch by a young malay from tarnate who write a good hand and speak english and whom we find exceedingly useful to we he be the slave of the datu who employ he for this purpose only he tell we he be capture in a brig by the pirate of basilan and sell here as a slave where he be likely to remain for life although he say the datu have promise to give he he freedom after ten year horse cow and buffalo be the beast of burden and a sulu may usually be see ride either one or the other armed cap-a-pie with kris spear and target or shield they use saddle cut out of solid wood and many ride with they stirrup so short that they bring the knee very high and the rider look more like well-grown monkey than mount man the cow and buffalo be guide by a piece of thong through the cartilage of the nose by law no swine be allow to be keep on the island and if they be buy they be immediately kill the chinese be oblige to raise and kill they pig very secretly when they desire that species of food for notwithstanding the law and the prejudice of the inhabitant the former continue to keep swine -lrb- native -rrb- the inhabitant of sulu be a tall thin and effeminate-looking race : i do not recollect to have see one corpulent person among they they face be peculiar for length particularly in the lower jaw and chin with high cheek-bone sunken lack-lustre eye and narrow forehead they head be thinly cover with hair which appear to be keep closely crop i be tell that they pluck out they beard and dye they tooth black with antimony and some file they they eyebrow appear to be shaven form a very regular and high arch which they esteem a great beauty the dress of the common people be very like that of the chinese with loose and full sleeve without button the material of which it be make be grass-cloths silk satin or white cotton from china i should judge from the appearance of they person that they ought to be term so far as ablutions go a cleanly people there be no outward respect or obeisance show by the slave to he master nor be the presence of the datu or even of the sultan himself hold in any awe all appear upon a equality and there do not seem to be any control power yet it may be at once perceive that they be suspicious and jealous of stranger the sulus although they be ready to do any thing for the sake of plunder even to the taking of life yet be not dispose to hoard they ill-gotten wealth and with all they fault can not be term avaricious they have but few quality to redeem they treachery cruelty and revengeful disposition and one of the principal cause of they be so predominant or even of they existence be they inordinate lust for power when they possess this it be accompany by a haughty consequential and ostentatious bravery no greater affront can be offer to a sulu than to underrate he dignity and official consequence such a insult be seldom forgive and never forget from one who have make numerous voyage to these island i have obtain many of the above fact and my own observation assure I that this view of they character be a correct one i would however add another trait which be common among they and that be cowardice which be obvious in spite of they boast prowess and daring this trait of character be universally ascribe to they among the spaniard in the philippine who ought to be well acquaint with they the dress of the woman be not unlike that of the man in appearance they wear close jacket of various color when they go abroad and the same loose breeches as the man but over they they usually have a large wrapper -lrb- sarong -rrb- not unlike the pareu of the polynesian islander which be put round they like a petticoat or throw over the shoulder they hair be draw to the back of the head and around the forehead it be shave in the form of a regular arch to correspond with the eyebrow those that i see at the sultan 's be like the malay and have light complexion with very black tooth the datu think they very handsome and on we return he ask I if i have see the sultan 's beauty the female of sulu have the reputation of rule they lord and possess much weight in the government by the influence they exert over they husband -lrb- superiority of woman -rrb- it may be owe to this that there be little jealousy of they wife who be say to hold they virtue in no very great estimation in they house they be but scantily clothe though woman of rank have always a large number of ring on they finger some of which be of great value as well as earring of fine gold they wear no stocking but have on chinese slipper or spanish shoe they be as capable of govern as they husband and in many case more so as they associate with the slave from whom they obtain some knowledge of christendom and of the habit and custom of other nation which they study to imitate in every way the mode in which the sulus employ they time may be exemplify by give that of the datu for all whether free or slave endeavor to imitate the higher rank as far as be in they power the datus seldom rise before eleven o'clock unless they have some particular business and the datu mulu complain of be sleepy in consequence of the early hour at which we have disturb he on rise they have chocolate serve in gilt glassware with some light biscuit and sweetmeat import from china or manila of which they inform I they lay in large supplies they then lounge about they house transact a little business and playing at various game or in the trading season go to the meeting of the ruma bechara at sunset they take they principal meal consist of stew of fish poultry beef egg and rice prepared somewhat after the chinese and spanish mode mix up with that of the malay although moslem they do not forego the use of wine and some be say to indulge in it to a great extent after sunset when the air have become somewhat cool by the refreshing breeze they sally forth attend by they retainer to take a walk or proceed to the bazaar to purchase goods or to sell or to barter away they article of produce they then pay visit to they friend when they be in the habit of have frequent convivial party talk over they bargain smoking cigar drink wine and liquor tea coffee and chocolate and indulge in they favorite pipe of opium at time they be entertain with music both vocal and instrumental by they dependant of this art they appear to be very fond and there be many musical instrument among they a datu indeed would be look upon as uneducated if he could not play on some instrument it be consider polite that when refreshment be hand they should be partake of those offer we by the datu be such as be usual but every thing be stale of fruit they be say to be very fond and can afford to indulge themselves in any kind with all these article to cloy the appetite only one set meal a day be take though the poorer class fisherman and laborer partake of two -lrb- government -rrb- the government of the sulu archipelago be a kind of oligarchy and the supreme authority be vest in the sultan and the ruma bechara or trading council this consist of about twenty chief either datus or they next in rank call orang who be governor of town or detach province the influence of the individual chief depend chiefly upon the number of they retainer or slave and the force they can bring into they service when they require it these be purchase from the pirate who bring they to sulu and its dependency for sale the slave be employ in a variety of way as in trading prahus in the pearl and bêche de meet fishery and in the search after the edible bird ' nest a few be engage in agriculture and those who be at all educate be employ as clerk these slave be not deny the right of hold property which they enjoy during they life but at they death it revert to the master some of they be quite rich and what may appear strange the slave of sulu be invariably better off than the untitled freeman who be at all time the prey of the hereditary datus even of those who hold no official station by all account these constitute a large proportion of the population and it be treason for any low-born freeman to injure or maltreat a datu the latter who be of a haughty overbearing and tyrannical disposition seldom keep themselves within bound in they treatment of they inferior the consequence be the lower class of freeman be oblige to put themselves under the protection of some particular datu which guard they from the encroachment of other the chief to whom they thus attach themselves be induce to treat they well in order to retain they service and attach they to he person that he may in case of need be enable to defend himself from depredation and the violence of he neighbor such be the absence of legal restraint that all find it necessary to go abroad arm and accompany by a trusty set of follower who be also arm this be the case both by day and night and accord to the datu 's account frequent affray take place in the open street which not unfrequently end in bloodshed caution be never lay aside the only law that exist be that of force but the weak contrive to balance the power of the strong by unite they have not only contention and strife among themselves but it be state at manila that the mountaineer of sulu who be say to be christian occasionally make inroad upon they at sulu however it do not appear that they be under much apprehension of these attack the only fear i hear express be by the sultan in my interview with he and the cause of this as i have already state be probably a desire to find a excuse for not afford we facility to go into the interior within twenty year however the reign sultan have be oblige to retire within he fort in the town of sulu which i have before advert to these people be hostile to the sulus of the coast and town who take every opportunity to rob they of they cattle and property for which the mountaineer seek retaliation when they have a opportunity from the manner in which the datu speak of they they be not much regard through another source i learn that the mountaineer be papuan and the original inhabitant of the island who pay tribute to the sultan and have acknowledge he authority ever since they be convert to islamism before that time they be consider extremely ferocious and whenever it be practicable they be destroy other speak of a original race of dyack in the interior but there be one circumstance to satisfy I that there be no confidence to be place in this account namely that the island be not of sufficient extent to accommodate so numerous a population as some ascribe to it the fort consist of a double row of pile fill in with coral block that situate on the east side of the small stream may be say to mount a few gun but these be altogether inefficient and in another on the west side which be rather a rude embankment than a fort there be some twelve or fifteen piece of large calibre but i doubt very much if they have be fire off for year and many of the house build upon the water would require to be pull down before these gun could be bring to bear upon any thing on the side of the bay suppose they to be in a good condition a little farther to the east of the town i be inform they have a kind of stockade but none of we be permit to see it -lrb- population -rrb- accord to we estimate and the information we receive while at sulu the island itself do not contain more than thirty thousand inhabitant of which the town of soung may have six or seven thousand the whole group may number about one hundred and thirty thousand i be aware however that it be difficult to estimate the population of a half-civilized people who invariably exaggerate they own strength and visitor be likewise prone to do the same thing the chinese comprise about a eighth of the population of the town and be generally of the lower class they be constantly busy at they trade and intent upon make money at soung business seem active and all slave as well as master seem to engage in it the absence of a strong government leave all at liberty to act for themselves and the ruma bechara give unlimited freedom to trade these circumstance promote the industry of the community and even that of the slave for he too as before observe have a life interest in what he earn soung be the residence of the sultan as well as the grand depot for all piratical goods be probably more of a mart than any of the surround town in the month of march and April it be visit by several chinese junk who remain trading until the beginning of the month of August if delay after that time they can scarcely return in safety be unable to contend with the boisterous weather and head wind that then prevail in the chinese sea these junk be say to come chiefly from amoy where the cotton etc best suit for the sulus be make they cargo consist of a variety of article of chinese manufacture and produce such as silk satin goods cotton red and check grass-cloth clothing handkerchief cutlery gun ammunition opium lumber china and glass-ware rice sugar oil lard and butter in return for this merchandise they obtain camphor bird ' nest rattan bêche de mer pearl and pearl-shell coco tortoise-shell and wax but there be no great quantity of these article to be obtain perhaps not more than two or three cargo during the season the trade require great knowledge of the article purchase for the chinese and sulus be both such adept in fraud that great caution and circumspection be necessary -lrb- custom due -rrb- the duty on importation be not fix but be change and alter from time to time by the ruma bechara the following be state to I as the necessary payment before trade could be carry on : a large ship with chinese on board pay $ 2000 a large ship without chinese on board pay 1800 small ship 1500 large brig 1000 small brig 500 schooner from 150 to 400 this suppose they all to have full cargo that a difference should be make in a vessel with or without chinaman seem singular but this i be tell arise from the circumstance that english vessel take they on board in order to detect and prevent the imposition of the sulus vessel intend to trade at soung should arrive before the chinese junk and remain as long as they stay or even a few day later in trading with the native all operation ought to be carry on for cash or if by barter no delivery should be make until the article to be take in exchange be receive in short it be necessary to deal with they as though they be undoubted rogue and this please they much more than to appear unsuspicious vessel that trade engage a bazaar which they hire of the ruma bechara and it be advisable to secure the good-will of the lead datus in that council by present and pay they more for they goods than other there be various other precaution necessary in deal with this people for they will if possible so act as to give rise to dispute in which case a appeal be make to they fellow who be sure to decide against the stranger those who have be engage in this trade advise that the price of the goods should be fix upon before the sultan and the scale of the datu of soung employ for although these be quite faulty the error be compensate by the article receive be weigh in the same this also secure the datu 's good-will by the fee -lrb- some fifty dollar -rrb- which he receive for the use of they thus it will be perceive that those who desire to trade with sulu must make up they mind to encounter many imposition and to be continually watchful of they own interest every possible precaution ought to be take and it will be find the treatment will depend upon or be accord to the force or resolution that be display in justice to this people it must be state there have be time when trader receive every kindness and attention at the island of sulu and i hear it even say that many vessel have go there to refit but during the last thirty or forty year the reign sultan and they subject have become hostile to european of whom they plunder and destroy as many as they can and this they have hitherto be allow to do with impunity although i have describe the trade with sulu as limited yet it be capable of greater extension and have it not be for the piratical habit of the people the evil report of which have be so widely spread sulu would now have be one of the principal mart of the east the most fertile part of borneo be subject to its authority there all the richest production of these eastern sea grow in immense quantity but be now leave ungarnered in consequence of there be no buyer the cost of they cultivation would be exceedingly low and i be dispose to believe that these article could be produce here at a lower cost than anywhere else besides the trade with china there be a very considerable one with manila in small article and i find one of we countryman engage in this traffic under the spanish flag to he i be indebted for much information that he opportunity of observation have give he the material for the history of sulu be meager and great doubt seem to exist in some period of it that which i have be able to gather be as follow : -lrb- history -rrb- the island of sulu be generally believe to have be originally inhabit by papuan some of whom as i have already state be still suppose to inhabit the mountainous part the first intercourse have with they be by the chinese who go there in search of pearl the orang dampuwan be the first of the malay to form settlement on the island but after build town and make other improvement they abandon the island in consequence it be say of the inhabitant be a perfidious race have previously to they departure destroy as many of the native as they could the fame of the submarine riches of this archipelago reach banjar or borneo the people of which be induce to resort there and find it to equal they expectation they send a large colony and make endeavor to win over the inhabitant and obtain thereby the possession of they rich isle in order to confirm the alliance a female of banjarmassing of great beauty be send and marry to the principal chief and from this alliance the sovereign of sulu claim they descent the treaty of marriage make sulu tributary to the banjarmassing empire after the banjar have thus obtain possession of the archipelago the trade in its product attract settler from the surround island who soon contrived to displace the aborigine and drive they to the inaccessible mountain for protection when the chinese take possession of the northern part of borneo under the emperor songtip about the year 1375 the daughter of that prince be marry to a celebrated arabian chief name sheriff allus who visit the shore of borneo in quest of commerce the descendant of this marriage extend they conquest not only over the sulu archipelago but over the whole of the philippine and render the former tributary to borneo in three reign after this event the sultan of borneo proper marry the daughter of a sulu chief and from this union come mirhome bongsu who succeed to the throne while yet a minor he uncle act as regent sulu now wish to throw off the yoke of borneo and through the intrigue of the regent succeed in do so as well as in retain possession of the eastern side of borneo from maludu bay on the north to tulusyan on the south which have ever since be a part of the sulu territory this event take place before islamism become the prevail religion but which form of idolatry the sulus pretend be not now know it be however believe the people on the coast be buddhist while those of the interior be pagan the first sultan of sulu be kamaludin and during he reign one sayed allus a merchant arrive at sulu from mecca he be a sherif and soon convert one-half of the islander to he own faith he be elect sultan on the death of kamaludin and reign seven year in the course of which he become celebrated throughout the archipelago die at sulu a tomb be erect to he there and the island come to be look upon by the faithful as the mecca of the east and continue to be resort to as a pilgrimage until the arrival of the spaniard -lrb- tawus tawus -rrb- say allus leave a son call batua who succeed he the latter have two son name sabudin and nasarudin who on the death of they father make war upon each other nasarudin the youngest be defeat seek refuge on tawus tawus where he establish himself and build a fort for he protection the difficulty be finally compromise and they agree to reign together over sulu nasarudin have two son call amir and bantilan of whom the former be name as successor to the two brother and on they death ascend the throne during he reign another sherif arrive from mecca who succeed in convert the remainder of the population to islamism bantilan and he brother amir finally quarrel and the latter be drive from sulu to seek refuge in the island of basilan where he become sultan on the arrival of the spaniard in 1566 a kind of desultory war be wage by they upon the various island in the hope of conquer they and extend they religion in these war they succeed in gain temporary possession of a part of sulu and destroy the tomb of sayed allus the spaniard always look upon the conversion of the moslem to the true catholic faith with great interest but in the year 1646 the sultan of magindanao succeed in make peace by the term of which the spaniard withdraw from sulu and be to receive from the sultan three cargo of rice annually as a tribute in 1608 the small-pox make fearful ravages and most of the inhabitant flee from the scourge among these be the heir apparent during whose absence the throne become vacant and another be elect in he stead this produce contention for a short time which end in the elect maintain he place this tribute continue to be pay until the flight of amir to basilan about the year 1752 where he enter into a secret correspondence with the authority at zamboanga and after two year a vessel be send from manila which carry he to that capital where he be treat as a prisoner of state -lrb- the english treaty -rrb- in June 1759 a english ship on board of which be dalrymple then in the service of the east indium company arrive at sulu on a trading voyage dalrymple remain at sulu for three month engage in make sale and purchase the sultan bantilan treat he with great kindness and seek the interest of dalrymple to obtain the liberation of he brother who be now hold prisoner by the spaniard at manila by tell he of the distress of he brother 's wife who have be leave behind when amir quit the island and have be deliver of twin after he have be kidnap by the spaniard dalrymple enter into a pledge to restore amir and at the same time effect a commercial treaty between the east indium company and the sulu chief by this it be stipulate that a annual cargo should be send to sulu and sell at one hundred per cent profit for which a return cargo should be provide for the china market which should realize a equal profit there after deduct all expense the overplus if any be to be carry to the credit of the sulus this appear to have be the first attempt make by the english to secure a regular commercial intercourse with this archipelago in the year 1760 a large fleet of spanish vessel sail from manila with about two thousand man have the sultan amir on board to carry on a war against sulu on they arrival they begin active operation they be repel on all side and after seven day ' ineffectual attempt they give up they design they return to manila it be say with a loss of half they number and without have do any injury to the sulus not discourage with this failure the spaniard about two year after organize a still larger force which be estimate by some account as high as ten thousand man although this fail in its attempt on the fort at soung the spaniard obtain possession of tanjong matonda one of the small port on the island where they erect a church and fort here they establish a colony and appoint a governor the inhabitant upon this desert they habitation in the neighborhood and flee to the mountain which it be say excite the mountaineer a host of whom with they chief whose name be sri kalum determine to rush upon the spaniard and annihilate they have to contend against discipline troops it be not a easy task to succeed but sri kalum have a follower name sigalo who offer to lead the host to battle against the spaniard and to exterminate they or die in the attempt the chief accept he offer and sigalo with a choose few march towards the fort leave the rest of the mountaineer in readiness to join they at a appoint signal and rush into the fort en masse -lrb- victory over spaniard -rrb- sri kalum and sigalo in order to lull the watchfulness of the spaniard take with they a young woman of exquisite beauty name purmassurus the lustful spaniard be thus throw off they guard the signal be give and the host rush forward enter the fort every spaniard within which be slay a few only who be on the outside escape to the vessel which set sail and after encounter various mishap return to manila some time after this the sultan bantilan die and he son alim-ud-deen be proclaimed sultan dalrymple do not return until 1762 with a part of the appoint cargo but the vessel in which the larger part have be ship fail to arrive from not be able to find sulu and go to china thence she proceed to manila and afterwards to sulu the captain of the latter vessel give a new credit to the sulus before they have pay for they first cargo and on the arrival of dalrymple the next time he find that the small-pox have carry off a large number of the inhabitant from which circumstance all he hope of profit be frustrated he then obtain for the use of the east indium company a grant of the island of balambangan which lie off the north end of borneo form one side of the strait of balabac the western entrance to the sulu sea here he propose to establish a trading post and after have visit madras he take possession of this island in 1763 in October 1762 the english take manila where the sultan amir be find by dalrymple who engage to reinstate he on he throne if he would cede to the english the north end of borneo as well as the south end of palawan this he readily promise and he be in consequence carry back to sulu and reinstate he nephew alim-ud-deen readily give place to he and confirm the grant to the east indium company in which the ruma bechara join after various arrangement the east indium company take possession of balambangan in the year 1773 and form a settlement there with a view of make it a emporium of trade for eastern commodity troops and store be send from indium and the population begin to increase by settler both chinese and malay who arrive in number in the year 1775 the fort notwithstanding all the treaty and engagement between dalrymple and the sultan be surprise by the sulus and many of the garrison put to death -lrb- victory over english -rrb- this virtually put a end to the plan of the english although another attempt be make to re-establish the settlement by colonel farquhar in 1803 but it be think to be too expensive a post and be accordingly abandon in the next year this act of the sulus fairly establish they character for perfidy and ever since that transaction they have be look upon as treacherous in the highest degree and what be singular have be allow to carry on they piracy quite unmolest the taking of balambangan have be generally imputed to the treacherous disposition and innate love of plunder among the sulus as well as to they fear that it would destroy the trade of sulu by injure all that of the archipelago but there be strong reason for believe that this dark deed owe its origin in part to the influence of the spaniard and dutch who look with much distrust upon the growth of the rival establishment such be the jealousy of the spaniard that the governor of the philippine peremptorily require that balambangan should be evacuate the sulus boast of the deed and admit that they receive assistance from both zamboanga and ternate the two nearest spanish and dutch port these nation have great reason to fear the establishment of a power like that of the east indium company in a spot so favorably situate to secure the trade of the surround island possess fine harbor and in every way adapt to become a great commercial depot have it be hold by the east indium company but for a few year it must have become what singapore be now the original planner of this settlement be say to have be lord pigot but the merit of carry it forward be undoubtedly due to dalrymple whose enterprising mind see the advantage of the situation and whose energy be capable of carry the project successfully forward since the capture of balambangan there have be no event in the history of sulu that have make any of the reign of the sultan memorable although fifteen have since ascend the throne sulu have from all the account very much change in its character as well as population since the arrival of the spaniard and the establishment of they authority in the philippine before that event some account state that the trade with the chinese be of great extent and that from four to five hundred junk arrive annually from cambojium with which sulu principally trade at that time the population be say to have equal in density that of the thickly-settled part of china the government have also undergo a change for the sultan who among other malay race be usually despotic be here a mere cipher and the government have become a oligarchy this change have probably be bring about by the increase of the privileged class of datus all of whom be entitle to a seat in the ruma bechara until about the year 1810 when the great inconvenience of so large a council be feel and it become impossible to control it without great difficulty and trouble on the part of the sultan the ruma bechara be then reduce until it contain but six of the principal datus who assume the power of control the state the ruma bechara however in consequence of the complaint of many powerful datus be enlarged but the more powerful and those who have the largest numerical force of slave still rule over its deliberation the whole power within the last thirty year have be usurp by one or two datus who now have monopolize the little foreign trade that come to these island the sultan have the right to appoint he successor and generally name he while live in default of this the choice devolve upon the ruma bechara who elect by a majority -lrb- piracy -rrb- from a more frequent intercourse with european and the discovery of new route through these sea the opportunity of commit depredation have become less frequent and the fear of detection greater by this latter motive they be more sway than by any thing else and if the sulus have ever be bold and daring robber on the high sea they have very much change many statement have be make and publish relative to the piracy commit in these sea which in some case exceed and in other fall short of the reality most of the piratical establishment be under the rule or sail under the auspices of the sultan and ruma bechara of sulu who be more or less intimately connect with they the share of the booty that belong to the sultan and ruma bechara be twenty-five per cent on all capture whilst the datus receive a high price for the advance they make of gun and powder and for the service of they slave the following be the piratical establishment of sulu obtain from the most authentic source publish as well as verbal the first among these be the port of soung at which we anchor in the island of sulu not so much from the number of man available here for this pursuit as the facility of dispose of the goods by the spaniard they be denominate illanun or lanun pirate -lrb- 273 -rrb- there be other rendezvous on pulo toolyan at bohol tonho pila tawus tawus sumlout pantutaran parodasan palawan and basilan and tantolus on celebe these be the most note but there be many minor place where half a dozen prahus be fit out those of sulu and those who go under the name of the lanun have prahus of larger size and better fit they be from twenty to thirty ton burden and be propel by both sail and oar they draw but little water be fast sailer and well adapt for navigate through these dangerous sea these pirate be suppose to possess in the whole about two hundred prahus which usually be man with from forty to fifty pirate the number therefore engage in this business may be estimate at ten thousand they be arm with musket blunderbuss krise hatchet and spear and at time the vessel have one or two large gun mount they infest the macassar strait the celebe sea and the sulu sea soung be the only place where they can dispose of they plunder to advantage and obtain the necessary outfit it may be call the principal resort of these pirate where well-directed measure would result in effectually suppress the crime besides the pirate of sulu the commerce of the eastern island be vex with other piratical establishment in the neighbor sea there be the malay pirate who have of late year become exceedingly troublesome they prahus be of much smaller size than those of sulu be from ten to twelve ton burden but in proportion they be much better man and thus be enable to ply with more efficiency they oar or paddle these prahus frequent the shore of malacca strait cape roumanium the carimon isle and the neighbor strait and at time they visit the rhio strait some of the most note i be inform be fit out from johore in the very neighborhood of the english authority at singapore they generally have they haunt on the small island on the coast from which they make short cruise they be note for they arrangement for prevent themselves from receive injury in the desperate defence that be sometimes make against they these small prahus have usually swivel mount which although not of great calibre be capable of throw a shot beyond the range of small-arm it be say that they seldom attempt a attack unless the sea be calm which enable they to approach they victim with more assurance of success on account of the facility with which they be enable to manage they boat the frequent calm which occur in these sea between the land and sea breeze afford they many opportunity of put they villanous plan in operation and the many inlet and islet with which they be well acquaint afford place of refuge and ambush and for conceal they booty they be generally find in small flotilla of from six to twenty prahus and when they have succeed in disable a vessel at long shot the sound of the gong be the signal for board which if successful result in a massacre more or less bloody accord to the obstinacy of the resistance they have meet with in the winter month the malacca strait be most infested with they and during the summer the neighborhood of singapore point rumanium and the channel in the vicinity in the spring from February to may they be engage in procure they supplies in fishing and refit they prahus for the coming year -lrb- suppression of pirate -rrb- i have frequently hear plan propose for the suppression of these pirate particularly of those in the neighborhood of the settlement under british rule the european authority be much to blame for the quiescent manner in which they have so long bear these depredation and many complaint be make that englishman on be transplant to india lose that feeling of horror for deed of blood such as be constantly occur at they very door which they would experience in england there be however many difficulty to overcome before operation against the pirate can be effective the greatest of these be the desire of the english to secure the good-will of the chief of the tribe by whom they be surround they thus wink at they piracy on the vessel of other nation or take no step to alleviate the evil of slavery indeed the language that one hear from many intelligent man who have long reside in that part of the world be that in no country where civilization exist do slavery exhibit so debase a form as in she indian possession another difficulty consist in the want of minute knowledge of the coast inlet and hiding-place of the pirate and this must continue to exist until proper survey be make this do it would be necessary to employ vessel that could pursue the pirate everywhere for which purpose steamer naturally suggest themselves what will appear most extraordinary be that the very prince who be enjoy the stipend for the purchase of the site whereon the english authority be establish be believe to be the most active in equip the prahus for these piratical expedition yet no notice be take of they although it would be so easy to control they by withhold payment until they have clear themselves from suspicion or by establish resident in they chief town -lrb- the bajow -rrb- another and a very different race of native who frequent the sulu archipelago must not be pass by without notice these be the bajow diver or fisherman to whom sulu be indebted for procure the submarine treasure with which she sea be store they be also very frequently employ in the bêche de mer or trepang fishery among the island to the south the bajow generally look upon macassar as they principal place of resort they be at one time believe to be derive from johore on the malayan peninsula at another to be buguese but they speak the sulu dialect and be certainly derive from some of the neighbor island the name of bajow in they tongue mean fisherman from all account they be allow to pursue they avocation in peace and be not unfrequently employ by the piratical datus and make to labor for they they resort to they fishing-grounds in fleet of between one and two hundred sail have they wife and child with they and in consequence of the tyranny of the sulus endeavor to place themselves under the protection of the flag of holland by which nation this useful class of people be encourage the sulu sea be comparatively little frequented by they as they be unable to dispose of the produce of they fishery for want of a market and fear the exaction of the datus they prahus be about five ton each the bajow at some island be stationary but be for the most part constantly change they ground the spanish authority in the philippine encourage they it be say to frequent they island as without they they would derive little benefit from the bank in the neighbor sea where quantity of pearl-oyster be know to exist which produce pearl of the finest kind the bajow be inoffensive and very industrious and in faith mahomedan the climate of sulu during we short stay though warm be agreeable the time of we visit be in the dry season which last from October till April and alternate with the wet one from may till September June and July be the windy month when strong breeze blow from the westward in the latter part of August and September strong gale be feel from the south while in December and January the wind be find to come from the northward but light wind usually prevail from the southwest during the wet season and from the opposite quarter the dry follow closely the order of the monsoon in the china sea as to the temperature the climate be very equable the thermometer seldom rise above 90 ° or fall below 70 ° disease be few and those that prevail arise from the manner in which the native live they be from that cause a unhealthy-looking race the small-pox have at various time rage with great violence throughout the group and they speak of it with great dread few of the native appear to be mark with it which may have be owe perhaps to they escape this disorder for some year vaccination have not yet be introduce among they nor have they practice inoculation notwithstanding soung be once the mecca of the east its people have but little zeal for the mahomedan faith it be think at once time that they have almost forget its tenet in consequence of the neglect of all they religious abservance the precept which they seem to regard most be that of abstain from swine 's flesh and that of be circumcise although polygamy be not interdict few even of the datus have more than one wife soung road offer good anchorage and supplies of all kind may be have in abundance beef be cheap and vegetable and fruit at all season plenty we observation place the town in latitude 6 ° 01 ' n longitude 120 ° 55 ' 51 '' e have conclude the treaty and other business that have take I to sulu we take we departure for the strait of balabac the western entrance into this sea with a fine breeze to the eastward by noon we have reach the group of pangootaaraang consist of five small island all of these be low cover with tree and without lagoon they present a great contrast to sulu which be see behind we in the distance the absence of the swell of the ocean in sailing through this sea be striking and give the idea of navigate a extensive bay on whose luxuriant island no surf break there be however source of danger that incite the navigator to watchfulness and constant anxiety the hidden shoal and reef and the sweep of the tide which leave he no control over he vessel -lrb- cagayan sulu -rrb- through the night which be exceedingly dark we sound every twenty minute but find no bottom and at daylight on the 7th we make the island of cagayan sulu in latitude 7 ° 03 ' 30 '' n longitude 118 ° 37 ' e the tide or current be pass the island to the west-southwest three quarter of a mile per hour we have sounding of seventy-five fathom cagayan sulu have a pleasant appearance from the sea and may be term a high island it be less cover with undergrowth and mangrove-bush than the neighbor island and the reef be comparatively small it have fall off in importance and by compare former account with those i receive and from its present aspect it would seem that it have decrease both in population and product its cave formerly supply a large quantity of edible bird ' nest large number of cattle be to be find upon it and its cultivation be carry on to some extent these article of commerce be not so much attend to at the present time and the bêche de mer and tortoise-shell formerly bring hither be now carry to other place there be a small anchorage on the west side but we do not visit it there be no danger near these small island that may not be guard against we survey extend only to they size and situation as i deem it my duty to devote all the remainder of the time i have to spare to the balabac strait -lrb- balabac strait -rrb- after the night set in we continue sound every ten minute and occasionally get bottom in from thirty to seventy fathom at midnight the water shoal to twenty fathom when i drop the anchor until daylight we shortly afterwards have a change of wind and a heavy squall pass over we in the morning we have no shoal ground near we and the bank on which we have anchor be find to be of small size it be probable that we have drop the anchor on the shoalest place vessel have nothing to fear in this respect at 9:00 be of the 8th we make the mangsee island ahead of we and likewise balabac to the north and balambagan to the south several sand-bank and extensive reef be also see between they on see the ground on which we have to operate of which the publish chart give no idea whatever i determine to proceed and take a central position with the ship under the mangsee island but in order not to lose time i hoist out and drop two boat under lieutenant perry to survey the first sand-bank we come to which lie a few mile to the eastward of these island with order to effect this duty and join I at the anchorage or find a shelter under the lee of the island at half-past two pm we anchor near the reef in thirty-six fathom water i think myself fortunate in get bottom as the reef on close with they seem to indicate but little appearance of it the rest of the day be spend in prepare the boat for we operation i now feel the want of the tender although in the absence of this vessel great exposure be necessary to effect this survey i find both officer and man cheerful and willing the party be organize -- the first to proceed to the north towards balabac island to survey the intermediate shoal and reef under lieutenant emmon and mr totten the second to the south under lieutenant perry and budd and mr hammersly for the survey of the shoal of balambangan and banguey and they reef the examination of the mangsee island and the reef adjacent with the astronomical and magnetic observation etc devolve on myself and those who remain on board the ship the weather be watch with anxiety and turn out disagreeable heavy shower and strong wind prevail notwithstanding the boat be despatch after be as well protect against it as possible we flatter ourselves that these extensive reef would produce a fine harvest of shell but although every exertion be make in the search we do not add as many to we collection as we anticipate some land-shell however be find that we little expect to meet with for many of the tree be cover with they and on cut they down large quantity be easily obtain mr peale shoot several bird among which be a nicobar pigeon some interesting plant and coral be also add on the island a large quantity of drift-wood be find which with that which be grow afford ample supplies of fuel for ship no fresh water be to be have except by digging the island be but a few foot above high-water mark although the time be somewhat unfavorable lieutenant emmon and party execute they order within the time designate and meet with no other obstruction than the inclemency of the weather this be not however the case with lieutenant perry who near a small beach on the island of balambangan encounter some sulus who be dispose to attack he the native no doubt be under the impression that the boat be from some shipwrecked vessel they be all well armed and apparently prepare to take advantage of the party if possible but by the prudence and forbearance of this officer collision be avoid and he party save from a attack -lrb- balambangan -rrb- the island of balambangan be through the instrumentality of mr dalrymple as heretofore state obtain from the sulus for a settlement and place of deposit by the east indium company who take possession of it in 1773 its situation off the northern end of borneo near the fertile district of that island its central position and its two fine port offer great advantage for commerce and for its become a great entrepot for the riches of this archipelago troops and store of all kind be send from indium number of chinese and malay be induce to settle and mr herbert one of the council of bencoolen be appoint governor it have be suppose to be a healthy place as the island be elevated and therefore probably free from malaria but in 1775 the native troops from indium become much reduce from sickness and the post consequently much weaken this with the absence of the cruiser from the harbor afford a favorable opportunity for its capture and the wealth that it be suppose to contain create a inducement that prove too great for the horde of maraud pirate to resist choose they time they rush upon the sentry put they to death take possession of the gun and turn they against the garrison only a few of whom make they escape on board of a small vessel the booty in goods and valuable be say to have be very large amount to nearly four hundred thousand pound sterling although borneo offer many inducement to commercial enterprise the policy of the dutch company have shut themselves out as well as other by interdict communication in consequence except through indirect channel there have be no information obtain of the singular and unknown inhabitant of its interior this however be not long destine to be the case mr brooke a english gentleman of fortune have since we passage through these sea from philanthropic motive make a agreement with the rajah of sarawack on the northern and western side of borneo to cede to he the administration of that portion of the island this arrangement it be believe the british government will confirm in which event sarawack will at once obtain a importance among the foreign colony in the eastern sea second only to that of singapore the principal inducement that have influence mr brooke in this undertaking be the interest he feel in the benighted people of the interior who be know under the name of dyack and of whom some extraordinary account have be give a few of these which i have procure from reputable source i will now relate in order that it may be see among what kind of people this gentleman have undertake to introduce the art of civilization -lrb- the dyack -rrb- the dyack be by all account a fine race and much the most numerous of any inhabit borneo they be almost exclusively confine to the interior where they enjoy a fine climate and all the spontaneous production of the tropics they be believe to be the aborigine of the island the name of dyack seem to be more particularly apply to those who live in the southern section of borneo to the north they be call idaan or tirun and those so term be best know to the sulus or the inhabitant of that part of the coast of borneo over which the sulus rule in personal appearance the dyack be slender have higher forehead than the malay and be a finer and much better-looking people they hair be long straight and coarse though it be generally crop short round the head the female be speak of as be fair and handsome and many of those who have be make slave be to be see among the malay in manners the dyack be describe as simple and mild yet they be characterize by some of the most uncommon and revolting custom of barbarian they government be very simple the elder in each village for the most part rule but they be say to have chief that do not differ from the malay raja they wear no clothing except the maro and many of they be tattoo with a variety of figure over they body they live in house build of wood that be generally of large size and frequently contain as many as one hundred person these house be usually build on pile divide into compartment and have a kind of veranda in front which serve as a communication between the several family the patriarch or elder reside in the middle the house be enter by ladder and have door but no window the village be protect by a sort of breastwork although this people be to be find throughout all borneo and even within a few mile of the coast yet they do not occupy any part of its shore which be hold by malay or chinese settler there be no country more likely to interest the world than borneo all account speak of vast ruin of temple and palace throughout the whole extent of its interior which the ancestor of the present inhabitant could not have construct the great resemblance these bear to those of china and cambojium have lead to the belief that borneo be formerly people by those nation but all tradition of the origin of these edifice have be lose and so little be now know of the northern side of borneo that it would be presumption to indulge in any surmise of what may have be its state during these dark age even the bugi priest who be the best-informed person in the country have no writings or tradition that bear upon the subject and the few scattered legend of eastern origin can afford no proof of the occurrence of the event they commemorate in any particular locality the account of the habit of the dyack be discrepant some give they credit for be very industrious while other again speak of they as indolent they be certainly cultivator of the soil and in order to obtain the article they need will work assiduously many of they be employ in collect gold-dust and some in the diamond mine and they will at time be find procure gum rattan etc from they native forest for barter they be a people of great energy of character and perseverance in the attainment of they object particularly when on war-party or engage in hunting they food consist of rice hog rat snake monkey and many kind of vermin with which this country abound they chief weapon be the parang or heavy knife somewhat like the kris it be manufacture of native iron and steel with which the coast of the country be say to abound they have a method of work it which render it unnecessary for they to look to a foreign supply the only article of foreign hardware that they be say to desire be razor out of which to make they cockspur one thing seem strange : although assert upon good authority that the iron and steel of the coast be think to be superior by foreigner they be not to be compare with that which be find in the interior and manufacture by the dyack all the best krise use by the malay raja and chief be obtain from the interior some of these be exquisitely manufacture and so hard that without turn the edge they cut ordinary work iron and steel among they other weapon be the sumpit a hollow tube through which they blow poison arrow the latter are of various kind and those use in war be dip in the sap of what the native term the upo the effect of this poison be almost instantaneous and destroy life in four or five minute those who have see a wound give accidentally describe the change that the poison occasion as plainly perceptible in its progress before use the arrow its poison point be dip in lime-juice to quicken it the range of the sumpit be from fifty to sixty yard although the arrow be poison yet it be say they sometimes eat the game they kill with they parboil it before it be roasted which be think to extract the poison firearm respect which they have much fear have not yet be introduce among they indeed it be say that so easily be they intimidate by such weapon that on hear a report of a gun they invariably run away each individual in a host would be impress with the belief that he be the one that be to be shoot -lrb- the diwata -rrb- they address they prayer to the maker of the world whom they call dewatta and this be all the religion they have there be many animal and bird hold by they in high veneration and they be close observer of the flight of bird from which they draw prognostic there be in particular a white-headed eagle or kite upon whose flight and cry they put great reliance and consult they in war or on any particular expedition for this purpose they draw number of they together and feed they by scatter rice about it be say they priest consult they entrails also on particular occasion to endeavor to look into future event in the performance of they engagement and oath they be most scrupulous they seem to have some idea of a future life and that on the road to they elysium they have to pass over a long tree which require the assistance of all those they have slay in this world the abode of happy spirit be suppose to be on the top of kinus balu one of they loftiest mountain and the portal be guard by a fiery serpent who do not suffer any virgin to pass into the celestial paradise polygamy do not exist among they but they have as concubine slave who be capture in they war or rather predatory expedition if a wife prove unfaithful to she husband he kill several of he slave or inflict upon she many blow and a divorce may be effect by the husband pay she a certain price and give up she clothes and ornament after which he be at liberty to marry another the woman however exercise a extraordinary influence over the man -lrb- headhunting -rrb- but of all they peculiar trait there be none more strange than the passion they seem to indulge for collect human head these be necessary accompaniment in many transaction of

borneo they be confine to the interior i have already mention that they be suppose to have be the original inhabitant of the sulu archipelago the sulus speak of the country of the dyack as be exceedingly fertile and capable of produce every thing the north end of borneo be particularly valuable as its produce be easily transport from the interior where much of the land be cultivate i have obtain much more information in relation to this people in a variety of way from individual as well as from the publish account which be to be find at time in the eastern print but as this digression have already extend to a great length i trust that enough have be say to enable the reader to contrast it with the native who inhabit the island that dot the vast pacific ocean and to make he look forward with interest to the development that the philanthropic exertion of mr brooke may bring to light have complete we duty here the boat be hoist in after despatch one to leave order for mr knox of the flying-fish in a bottle tie to a flagstaff on the afternoon of the 12th we get under way to proceed direct to singapore and pass through the channel between the reef off the mangsee island and those of balambangan and banguey we find this channel clear and all the danger well define as the principal object of my visit be to ascertain the disposition and resource of the sulus for trade and to examine the strait lead into the sulu sea in order to facilitate the communication with china by avoid on the one hand the eastern route and on the other the danger of the palawan passage it may be as well to give the result of the latter inquiry refer those who may be more particularly interested to the hydrographical atla and memoir the difficulty in the palawan passage arise from heavy sea and fresh gale do not exist in the sulu sea nor be the shoal so numerous or so dangerous in the place of storm and rough water smooth sea be find and for most of the time moderate breeze which do not subject a vessel to the wear and tear experience in beat up against a monsoon the balabac strait may be easily reach either from singapore or by beat up along the western shore of borneo when the strait be reach a vessel by choose she time may easily pass through they by daylight even by beat when the wind be ahead once through the way be clear with the exception of a few coral lump the occasional occurrence of the north wind will enable a vessel to pass directly to the shore of the island of panay a fair wind will ordinarily prevail along the island and as i have already mention it may be approach closely the passage through to the eastward of mindoro island may be take in preference to that on the west side through the mindoro strait and thus all the reef and shoal will be avoid thence the western coast of luzon will be follow to the north as in the old route i do not think it necessary to point out any particular route through the sulu sea as vessel must be guide chiefly as the wind blow but i would generally avoid approach the sulu island as the current be more rapid and set rather to the southward wherever there be anchorage it would be advisable to anchor at night as much time might thus be save and a knowledge of the current or set of the tide obtain perhaps it would be as well to caution those who be venturesome that it be necessary to keep a good look-out and those who be timid that there do not appear to be much danger from the piratical prahus unless a vessel get on shore in that case it will not be long before they will be see collect in the horizon in large number -lrb- advantage of sulu treaty -rrb- the treaty that i make with the sultan if strictly enforce on the first infraction will soon put a end to all the danger to be apprehend from they to conclude i be satisfied that under ordinary circumstance to pass through the sulu sea will shorten by several day the passage to manila or canton and be a great saving of expense in the wear and tear of a ship and she canvass on the 13th we pass near the location of the viper shoal but see nothing of it it be therefore marked doubtful on the chart as i have but little time to spare the look-out be double and we pursue we course throughout the night sound as we go every fifteen minute but nothing meet we view on the 14th although we have the northeast monsoon blow fresh we experience a current of twenty-two mile set to the north this be a unexpected result as the current be usually suppose to prevail in the direction of the monsoon on the 15th we still experience it though not over fifteen mile on the 16th we find it set west and as we approach the malayan peninsula it be find to be run southwest on the 18th we make pulo aor and pulo pedang and arrive off the singapore strait i hove-to to await daylight in the morning at dawn we find ourselves in close company with a chinese junk the 19th until late in the afternoon we be in the singapore strait make but slow progress towards this emporium of the east the number of native as well as foreign vessel which we pass prove that we be approach some great mart and at 5:00 pm we drop we anchor in singapore road here we find the porpoise oregon and flying-fish all well : the two former have arrive on January 22nd nearly a month before and the latter three day previously before conclude this chapter i shall revert to they proceedings since we separation off the sandwich island the instruction to the brig have be heretofore give but it may not be amiss to repeat here that the object in detach they be that they might explore the line of reef and island know to exist to the northward and westward of the hawaiian group and thence continue they course towards the coast of japan have they effect the latter object it would have give important result in relation to the force of the current and the temperature of the water it be desirable if possible to ascertain with certainty the existence on the coast of japan of a current similar to the gulf stream to which my attention have be particularly draw the first land they make be on December 1 1841 and be necker island bird especially the white tern have be see in number prior to its announcement necker island be apparently a mass of volcanic rock about three hundred foot high and be destitute of any kind of vegetation

the 11th lieutenant-commandant ringgold determine on account of the condition of the brig and the continuance of bad weather it be impossible to keep they course to the northward and westward towards the coast of japan he therefore haul to the southward which be much to be regret and follow so very nearly in the same track as that pursue by the vincenne towards the china sea that nothing new be

be constantly approach the surface of the sea as have be ascertain by survey make at different period by order of government which circumstance seem to indicate the presence of zoophyte that compound of animal and vegetable life whose incessant and rapid labor and as we be tell by naturalist whose polypus-like power of receive perfect form and vitality into numberless dismembered portion of they body have long excited much curiosity and admiration these small compound animal commence they operation at the bottom of the sea and proceed upward towards the surface spread themselves in various

and so on ad infinitum till they reach the surface of the ocean these coral reef and shoal be find in most part of the world within the tropics but the water of the eastern hemisphere seem to be peculiarly congenial to they production and indeed there appear to be certain space or region in these sea which be they favorite haunt among many other may be mention the mozambique channel and that tract of ocean from the eastern coast of africa quite across to the coast of malabar include the mahé chaga maldive and laccadive archipelago the southeastern part of the china sea the red sea the eastern part of java the coast of all the sunda island and various place in the pacific ocean these shoal when they begin to emerge from the sea be frequent by aquatic fowl whose feather and other

application of coconut oil as be the custom in all indium and draw together and knot on top in the manner of the malay the woman display great taste in the arrangement and decoration of they hair

mestizo could not easily be mistake for a native this class of the inhabitant be hold in nearly the same estimation as the whites they be very cleanly in they person and neat in they dress which among the male consist generally of a pair of cotton trousers of various color as fancy dictate and shoe in the european manner a frock or tunic of striped grass manufacture wear outside the trousers in the

writer broker agent and overseer many of they hold lucrative office under government and they not unfrequently arrive at wealth and consideration the woman be also industrious and capable of great intellectual improvement they have a natural grace and ease in they manner and make excellent wife and mother this character must not however be take in a unlimited sense for we can not expect this rule to be without its exception and it be true that some of these female do degenerate and copy after the manners of the creole or white native but this be only the case when by they intercourse with the whites they indian blood be merge and lose in the european that part of the population in which be blended the blood of the chinese and tagalog be name the chinese mestizo the native be not unapt

latter and as pertinaciously excuse by the spaniard who complain that the british plunder the city and commit many other excess contrary to the express condition of they engagement by which they be virtually render nugatory -lrb- galleon trade -rrb- the inhabitant of manila have long enjoy the privilege of send two annual ship to acapulco call galleon navio or register-ship with the produce of the philippine of china and other part of asia in return for which they receive various article of the production of south america the principal of which be cochineal merchandise of different description of european origin and silver in spanish dollar and ingot which compose the principal part of the value of they return cargo amount annually to about three million five hundred thousand spanish dollar a large proportion of this property belong to the convent in manila whose great revenue not only enable they to engage in extensive mercantile operation but to lend considerable sum to the merchant on bottomry for the indulgence in this trade the proprietor pay a large sum of money to the crown these ship be of the burden of from twelve to fifteen hundred ton and be numerously man and well appoint for defense but of late year since the revolt of the spanish colony which have render the navigation of the intermediate sea dangerous to these enterprise the trade have be greatly interrupted and instead of risk it in large body private ship of smaller burden have be hire for the purpose of divide the risk some of these have be put under foreign color though formerly the galleon wear by instruction the royal flag they officer be commission and uniformed like the officer of the navy and the ship be under the same regulation and discipline the object however of the trade in smaller ship have not be obtain for so great be the fear of the owner and agent of they be capture and so many restriction lay upon the commander that they lie in port the principal part of the time so that in September 1819 the ship of the preceding year have not arrive at manila neither have any be dispatch from the latter place for acapulco during that time these interruption and in fact the virtual suspension of this commerce will undoubtedly if a liberal and enlighten policy be pursued result greatly to the advantage of these island and the mother country already since the establishment of the corte permit foreigner to settle permanently at manila great improvement have be make in the production of the island and important addition to the revenue the failure of the annual remittance of dollar from south america to defray the expense of the colonial government of which they revenue from the island be not adequate to meet one half have be severely feel and have stimulate they to make some very unusual exertion foreign commerce have be more countenance in consequence of this state of thing and greater encouragement have be give to the grower and manufacturer of they staple export and if the affair of these island should in future be properly conduct the revenue arise from the impost on the single article of coffee will in a few year be amply sufficient to support the government and leave a net income of the revenue arise from the impost on all other article besides what would accrue from the tax and numerous other resource a free commerce with other nation would create a competition and a consequent reduction in the price of import and they article of export would increase in proportion to the demand for they in short nothing be want in these beautiful island but ability to direct and energy to execute the most extensive plan of agriculture and commerce which the bounty of the soil and its excellent climate and situation would most

most inconsiderable islet of this archipelago -lrb- opportunity for a republic -rrb- perhaps no part of the world offer a more eligible site for a independent republic than these island they insular posture and distance from any rival power combine with the intrinsic strength of a free representative government would guarantee they safety and glory they intermediate situation between asia and the american continent they proximity to china japan borneo the molucca and sunda island the malay peninsula cochin china tonquin siam and the european possession in the east would insure they a unbounded commerce consequently great wealth and power and they happiness would be secure by religious toleration and liberal view of civil liberty in the government it must be confess however that the national character of the spaniard be not suitable to produce and enjoy in perfection this most desirable state of affair it be to be fear that they bigotry would preclude religious toleration they indolence continue the present system of slavery so degrading in a particular manner to a republic they want of energy paralyze the operation of enterprising foreigner among they no change however can be for the worse and if all the advantage can not be reap by they which the citizen of we republic would secure it will be better for they to seize and enjoy such as they genius and talent will enable they

smithsonian institution 1899 report -rrb- since the day when the first european navigator enter the south sea the dispute over the source and ethnic affiliation of the inhabitant of that extend and scatter island world have be unsettle the most superficial glance point out a contrariety in external appearance which leave little doubt that here people of entirely different blood live near and among one another -lrb- negrito and indio -rrb- and this be so apparent that the pathfinder in this region magellan give expression to the contrariety in he name for tribe and island since dark complexion be observe on individual in certain tribe and in define area and light complexion on other here abundantly there quite exceptional writer apply old world name to the new phenomenon without further think the philippine set the decisive example in this fernando magellan first discover the island of this great archipelago in 1521 march 16 after he death the spaniard complete the circle of he discovery at this time the name of negro be fix which even now be call islas de los pintados for year the spaniard call the entire archipelago islas de poniente gradually after the expedition of don fray garcium jofre de loaisa -lrb- 1526 -rrb- the new title of the philippine prevail through salazar the people be divide into two group the little negro or negrito and the indio it be quite conceivable that involuntarily the opinion prevail that the negrito have close relationship with the african black and the indio with the lighter-complexioned inhabitant of indium or at least of indonesium however it must be say here that the theory of a truly african origin of the negrito have be advance but seldom and then in a very hesitating manner the idea that with the present configuration of the eastern island world especially with they great distance apart a variety of mankind that have never manifest any aptitude for maritime enterprise should have spread themselves over this vast ocean area in order to settle down on this island and on that be so unreasonable that it have find scarcely a defender worth name more and more the black be come to be consider the original people the indio to be the intruder for this there be a quite reasonable ground in that on many island the black dwell in the interior difficult of access especially in the dense and unwholesome mountain forest while the lighter complexioned tribe have settle the coast to this be add linguistic proof which place the lighter race of homogeneous speech in linguistic relation with the higher race especially the malay dogmatically it have be say that originally these island have be occupy entirely by the primitive black population but afterwards through intrusion from the sea these black be gradually press away from the coast and shove back into the interior -lrb- complicated pacific problem -rrb- the problem though it appear simple enough have become complicate more and more through the progress of discovery especially since cook enlarged we knowledge of the oriental island world a new and still more pregnant contrast then thrust itself to the front in the fact that the black and the lighter-colored people be each separate into widely differ group while the former hold especially the immense almost continental region of australium -lrb- new holland -rrb- and new guinea and also the larger archipelago such as new hebride solomon island fijus -lrb- vitus -rrb- archipelago -- that be the western area -- the north and east micronesium and polynesium be occupy by lighter-colored people so the first division into melanesium and polynesium have in latest time come to be of value and the dogma once fix have remain for the polynesian be by many ally to the malay while the black be put together as a special ethnological race for practical ethnology this division may suffice but the scientific man will seek also for the black a genetic explanation the answer have be furnish by one of the greatest ethnologist theodor waitz who after he have expose the insufficiency of the accept formula come to the conclusion that the differentiation of the black from the lighter people might be a error he deny that there have be a primitive black race in micronesium and polynesium in he opinion we have here to do with a single race the color of the polynesian may be out and out from natural cause different they entire physical appearance indicate the greatest variability herein the whole question of the domain of variation be spring with imperfect satisfaction on the part of those traveler who give they attention more to transition than to type among these be not a few who have return from the south sea with the conviction that all criterion for the diagnosis of man and of race be valueless analytical anthropology have lead to other and often unexpected result it have prove that just that portion of south sea population which can apparently lay the strongest claim to be consider a homogeneous race must be separate into a collection of subvariety nothing appear more likely than that the negrito of the philippine be the nearest relative to the melanesian the australian the papuan and yet it have be prove that all these be separated one from another by well-marked character whether these character place the people under the head of variety or whether indeed the black tribe of the south sea spite of all difference be to be trace back to one single primitive stock that be a question of prehistory for whose answer the material be lack be it possible to furnish the proof that the black population of the south sea be already settle in they present home when land bridge exist between they territory and africa or when the much-sought lemurium still exist it would not be worth the trouble to hunt for the miss material in we present knowledge we can not fill the gap so we must yet hold the black of the orient to be separate race -lrb- hair as a race index -rrb- the hair furnish the strongest character for diagnosis in which not alone that of the head be under consideration the hair therefore occupy the foreground of interest its color be of the least importance since all people of the south sea have black hair it be more the structure and appearance which furnish the observer convenient start point for the primary classification generally a two-fold division satisfy the black it be say have crisp hair the polynesian and light-colored people have smooth hair but this declaration be erroneous in its generality it be in no way easy to declare absolutely what hair be to be call crisp and it be still more difficult to define in what respect the so-called crisp variety differ one from another for a long time the australian hair be denominate crisp until it be evident that it could be class neither with that of the african nor with that of the philippine black semper one of the first traveler to furnish a somewhat complete description of the physical character of the negrito describe it as a extremely thick brown-black lack-luster and crisp-woolly crown of hair among these peculiarity the lack-luster be unimportant since it be due to want of care and uncleanliness on the contrary the other datum furnish true character of the hair and among they the crisp-woolly peculiarity be most valuable on the term wool and woolly severe controversy which have not yet close have take place among ethnologist during the last ten year also the lack of care especially the absence of the comb have here act as a disturbing cause in the decision but there be yet a set of people which be formerly include that be now be gradually disassociate especially the australian and the veddah whose hair by means of special care appear quite wavy if not entirely sleek and smooth generally it be frowzy and mat so that its natural form be difficult to recognize to it be want the chief peculiarity which obtrude itself in the african black so characteristically that the compact spiral form which it assume from its root the so-called pepper-corn be select as the preferable mark of the race the peculiar nappy head have it origin in the spiral rollchen as to the asiatic black this have be for a long time know among the andamanese it have lately be notice upon the sakaus of malacca and it be to be find also among the negrito of the philippine as i can show by specimen therefore if we seek ethnic relationship for the negrito of the philippine or as they be name the aeta -lrb- eta ita -rrb- such connection obtrude themselves with the stock name and the more strongly since they all have brachycephalic relatively small -lrb- nannocephalic -rrb- head and through they small size attach themselves to the peculiar dwarf tribe i might here comment on the singular fact that the andaman island be situate near the nicobar in the indian ocean but that the population on both side of they be entirely different in my own detailed description which treat of the skull and the hair specially it be affirm that the typical skull shape of the nicobarese be dolichocephalic and that they hair stand between the straight hair of the mongoloid and the sleek though slightly curved or wavy hair of the malayan and indian people they skin color be relatively dark but only so much so as be peculiar to the tribe of indium with the little black of the andaman there be not the slightest agreement in this we have one of the best evidence against the theory of waitz-gerland that the difference in physical appearance be to be attribute to variation merely i will however so as not to be misunderstand expressly emphasize that i be not willing to declare that the two people have be at all time so constitute i be now speak of actual condition in the same sense i wish also my remark concern the negrito to be take not one fact be in evidence from which we may conclude that a single neighboring people know to we have be negritize we be therefore justified when we see in the negrito a truly primitive people as they be now they be more than three hundred and fifty year ago when the first european navigator visit these island about older relationship nothing be know all the grave from which the bone of negrito now in possession be take belong to recent time and also the oldest description which have be receive so far as phylogeny be concern must be characterize as modern -lrb- negrito a primitive people -rrb- the little change in the mode of life make know through these description in connection with the low grade of culture on which these impoverished tribe live amply testify that we have before we here a primitive race \* \* \* \* \* -lrb- the question whether we have to do with older independent race in the malay archipelago or with mixture be everywhere a open one -- translator -rrb- whoever would picture the present ethnic affiliation of the light-colored people of the philippine will soon land in confusion on account of the great number of tribe one of the ablest observer ferd blumentritt mention besides the negrito the chinese and the whites not less than 51 such tribe he classify they in one group as malay accord to the plan now customary the division rest primarily on a linguistic foundation but when it be note that the identity of language among all the tribe be not establish and among many not at all prove it be sufficiently show that speech be a character of little constancy and that a language may be impose upon a people to the annihilation of they own by those who belong to a different linguistic stock the malay sea be fill with island on which tarry the remnant of people not malay for a long time especially since the dutch occupation these old population have receive the special name of alfuro but this ambiguous term have be use in such a arbitrary and promiscuous fashion that latterly it have be well-nigh banish from ethnological literature it be not long ago that the negrito be so call but if the black people be eliminate there remain on many island at least a element to be differentiate from the malay chiefly through the darker skin color greater orthocephaly and more wavy quite crimped hair i have for the different island furnish proof and will here only refer to the assertion that a broad belt of wavy and curly hair have press itself in between the papuan and the malay a belt which in the north seem to terminate with the veddah in the south with the australian one can not read the account of traveler without the increase conviction of the existence of several different if not perhaps related variety of people thrust on the same island -lrb- theory of negrito and three malay invasion -rrb- from this result the natural and entirely unprejudiced conclusion which have repeatedly be state that either a primitive people by later intrusion have be press back into the interior or that in course of time several immigration have follow one another at the same time it be not unreasonable to think that both process go on at the same time and indeed this conception be strongly bring forward so blumentritt assume that there be there a primitive black people and that three separate malay invasion have take place the oldest whose branch have many trait in accord with the dayak of borneo especially the practice of head-hunting a second which also take place before the arrival of the spaniard to which the tagal bisaya bicol ilocano and other tribe belong the third islamitic which emigrate from borneo and might have be interrupt by the arrival of the spaniard and with which a contemporaneous immigration from the molucca go on it must be say however that blumentritt admit two period for the first invasion in the earliest he place the immigration of the igorot apayo zambale -- in short all the tribe that dwell in the interior of the country later and be press away from the coast therefore actually the mountain tribe to the second half he assign the tinguiane catalangane and iraya who be not head-hunter but semper say they appear to have a mixture of chinese and japanese blood against this scheme many thing may be say in detail especially that accord to the apparently well-grounded assertion of mueller-beeck the going of the chinese to the philippine be develop about the end of the fourteenth century and chiefly after the spaniard have get a foothold and be use the mexican silver in trade at any rate the apprehension of semper which rest on somewhat superficial physiognomic ground be not confirm by search investigation so the head-hunting of the mountain tribe so far as it hint at relation with borneo give no sure chronological result since it might have be contemporaneous in they and could have come here through invasion from other island the chief inquiry be this : whether there take place other and older invasion for this we be not only to draw upon the present tribe but if possible upon the remains of earlier and perhaps now extinct tribe this possibility have be bring nearer for the philippine through certain cave deposit we have to thank for the first information the traveler jagor whose exceptional talent as collector have place we in the possession of rich material especially cranium to he excellent report of he journey i have already dedicate a special chapter in which i have present and partially illustrate not only the cave cranium but also a series of other skull a extended conference upon they have be hold in the anthropological society the old spanish chronicler describe accurately the mortuary custom which be in vogue in they time the dead be lay in coffin make from excavate tree trunk and cover with a well-fitting lid they be then deposit on some elevated place or mountain or river bank or seashore cave in the mountain be also utilize for this purpose jagor describe such cave on the island of samar west of luzon whose contents have recently be annihilate the few cranium from there which have be intrust to I bear the mark of recent pedigree as also do the additional object unfortunately dr jagor do not himself visit these interesting cave but he have bring cranium thence which be of the highest interest and which i must now mention -lrb- study of a giant skull -rrb- the cave in question lie near lanang on the east coast of samar on the bank of a river it be say it be as the traveler report celebrate in the locality on account of its depressed gigantic cranium without suture the singular statement be make clear by means of a well-preserved example which i lay before you the entire cranium include the face be cover with a thick layer of sinter which give it the appearance of belong to the class of skull with leontiasis ossea it be in fact of good size but through the incrustation it be increase to gigantic proportion it be true likewise that it have a much flatten broad and compress form the cleaning of another skull have show that artificial deformation have take place which obviously be complete before the incrustation be lay on by the mineral water of the cave i will here add that on the testimony of traveler no negrito be on samar the island lie in the neighborhood of the bisaya although no description of the position of the skull be at hand and of the skeleton to which it apparently belong it must be assume that the dead man be not lay away in a coffin but place on the ground that in fact he belong to a earlier period how long ago that be can not be know unfortunately since no datum be at hand however the bone be in a nearly fossilized condition which allow the conclusion that they be deposit long ago the deformation itself furnish no clue to a chronological conclusion in thévenot be find the statement that accord to the account of a priest probably in the 16th century the custom prevail in some of the island to press the head of new-born babe between two board also to flatten the forehead since they believe that this form be a special mark of beauty a similar deformation with more pronounced flattening and backward pressure of the forehead be show on the cranium which jagor produce from a cave at caramuan in luzon there be mode of flatten which remind one of peru when they come into we hand it be indeed a immense surprise since no knowledge of such deformation in the south sea be at hand first we information lead to more thorough investigation so we be aware of several example of it from indonesium and indeed from the south sea -lrb- mallicolo -rrb- however this deformation furnish no clue to the antiquity of the grave -lrb- chinese and korean pottery be say to have be find with the deform cranium similar deformation exist in the celebe new britain etc head-shaping have be universal cf a b meyer ueber kunstliche deformirte schaedel von borneo und mindanao and ueber die verbreitung der sitte der kunstlichen schaedeldeformirung 1881 36 pp 4 ° -- translator -rrb- i have saw one of these skull in two along the sagittal suture the illustration give a good idea of the amount of compression and of the violence which this skull endure when quite young the cranial cavity be inclined backward and lengthen and curve out above while the occiput be press downward and the region of the front fontanelle be correspondingly lack likewise a considerable thickness of the bone be to be note especially of the vertex the upper jaw be slightly prognathous and the roof of the mouth unusually arch for the purpose of the present study it be unnecessary to go further into particulars it might be mention that all lanang skull be characterize by they size and the firmness of bone so that they depart widely from the characteristic of the other philippine example know to I similar skull have be receive only from cave which exist in one of the little rocky island east from luzon they suggest most kanaka crania from hawaius and moriorus cranium from chatham island and they raise the question whether they do not belong to a migration period long before the time of the malay i have on various occasion mention this probable pre-malayan or at least proto-malayan population which stand in nearest relation to the settling of polynesium here i will merely mention that the polynesian saga bring the progenitor from the west and that the passage between halmahera -lrb- gilolo -rrb- and the philippine be point out as the course of invasion at any rate it be quite probable that the skull from lanang cragaray and other philippine island be the remains of a very old if not autochthonous prehistoric layer of population the present mountain tribe have furnish no close analogy as to the igorot which blumentritt attribute to the first invasion i refer to my description give on the ground of chronological investigation accord to the account give by han meyer the disposal of the dead in log coffin and in cave still go on of the skull themselves none be brachycephalous on the contrary they exhibit platyrrhine and in part decidedly pithecoid nose on the whole i come to the conclusion as do earlier quatrefage and hamy that -lrb- indication of pre-malay invasion -rrb- they stand next in comparison with the dayak of borneo but i hold yet the impression that they belong to a very old probably pre-malay immigration when on the 18th of march 1897 i make a communication on the population of the philippine a bloody uprising have break out everywhere against the exist spanish rule in this uprising a certain portion of the population and indeed that which have the most valid claim to aboriginality the so-called negrito be not involve they isolation they lack of every sort of political often indeed of village organization also they meager number render it conceivable that the greatest change might go on among they neighbor without they take such a practical view of they as to lead to they engaging in they thus it can be understand how they would take no interest in the further development of the affair since then the result of the war between spain and the american have be the destruction of spanish power and the treaty of pari bring the entire philippine archipelago into the possession of the united state of america henceforth the principal interest be center upon the deportment of the insurgent who have not only outlive the great war between the power but be now determine to assert or win they independence from the conqueror these insurgent who for brevity be call filipino belong as i have remark to the light-colored race of so-called indio who be sharply differentiate from the negrito they ethnological position be difficult to fix since numerous mixture have take place with immigrant whites especially with spaniard but also with people of yellow and of brown race -- that be with mongol and chinese perhaps here and there the importance of this mixture on the composite type of the indio have be overestimate at least in most place positive proof be not forthcoming that foreign blood have impose itself upon the bright-colored population both history and tradition teach on the contrary as also the study of the physical peculiarity of the people that among the various tribe difference exist which suggest family trait to this effect be the testimony of several traveler who have follow one another during a long period of time as have be develop especially by blumentritt -lrb- all immigration from the west -rrb- in this connection it must not be overlook that all these immigration howsoever many they be suppose to have be must have come this way from the west indeed a noteworthy migration from the east be entirely bar out if we look no farther back than the chinese and japanese on the contrary all sign point to the assumption that from of old long before the come of portuguese and spaniard a strong movement have go on from this region to the east and that the great sea way which exist between mindanao and the sulu island on the north and halmahera and the molucca in the south be the entrance road along which those tribe or at least those navigator whose arrival people the polynesian island find they way into the pacific ocean but also the movement of the polynesian point to the west and if they ancestor may have come from indonesium there be no doubt that in they long journey eastward they must have touch at the coast of other island on they way especially the philippine polynesian invasion of the philippine be not suppose to have close when a migration of people or of man pass out to the pacific ocean lay the foundation of a large fraction of the population of the archipelago it be know that now and then single canoe from the pelew or the ladrone island be drive upon the east coast of luzon but they importance ought not to be overestimate the migration this way from the west must henceforth remain as the point of departure for all explanation of this eastern ethnology -lrb- these statement be well enough for work hypothesis but actual proof be not at hand ratzel berl verhandl etc phil hist class 1898 i p 33 -- translator -rrb- now how be the local difference of various tribe to be explain when on the whole the place of origin be the same be there here a secondary variation of the type something bring about through climate food circumstance it be a large theme which unfortunately be too often dominate by previously-formed theory the importance of environment and mode of life upon the corporeal development of man can not be contest but the measure of this importance be very much in doubt nowhere be this measure at least in the present consideration less known than in the philippine in spite of wide geological and biological difference on these island there exist a close anthropological agreement of the indio in the chief characteristic and the effort to trace back the tribal difference that have be mark to climatic and alimentary cause have not succeed the influence of inherit peculiarity be also more mighty here as in most part of the earth than that of milieu if we assume first that the immigrant bring they peculiarity with they which be fix already when they come we must also accept as self-evident that the negrito of the philippine do not belong to the same stock as the more powerful bright-colored indio as long as these island have be know more than three century the skin of the negrito have be dark brown almost black they hair short and spirally twist and just as long have the skin of the indio be brownish in various shades relatively clear and the hair have be long and arrange in wavy lock at no time so far as know have it be discover that among a single family a pronounced variation from these peculiarity have take place on this point there be entire unanimity in case of the negrito there be not the least doubt of the indio a doubt may arise for in fact the shades of skin color appear greatly vary since the brown be at time quite blackish at time yellowish almost as varied as be the color of the sunburnt hair but even then the practice eye easily detect the descent and if the skin alone be not sufficient the first glance at the hair complete the diagnosis the correct explanation of individual or tribal variation be difficult only with the indio while no such necessity exist in the case of the negrito but among the indio these individual and tribal variation be so frequent and so outspoken that one be justified in make the inquiry whether there have not develop here a new type of inherit peculiarity if this be the case it must still be hold that already the immigrant tribe have possess they -lrb- assistance from history -rrb- now history record that different immigration have actually take place lay aside the latest before the arrival of the spaniard that of the islamite in the fourteenth and the fifteenth century there remain the older one if ethnologist and traveler in general come to the conclusion concern borneo -- and it be to be take as certain -- that the difference now exist among the wild tribe of this island be very old it ought not be think so wonderful if accord to the condition of the tribe which have immigrate thence there should exist on the philippine near one another dissimilar though related people this difference be not difficult to recognize in manners and custom -- a side of the discussion which be further on to be treat more fully we begin with physical characteristic -lrb- hair difference -rrb- among these the hair occupy the chief place to be sure among all the indio it be black but it show not the slightest approach to the frizzled condition which be such a prominent feature in the external appearance of the negrito and of all the papuan tribe of the east this frizzled condition may be call woolly or in somewhat exaggerated refinement in the name may be attribute to the term wool all sort of meaning akin to wool in every case there be want to all the indio the crinkling of the hair from its exit out of the follicle whereby would result wide or narrow spiral tube and the coarse appearance of the so-called peppercorn the hair of all indio be smooth and straighten out and when it form curve they be only feeble and they make the whole outward appearance wavy or at most curl but within this wavy or curl condition of the hair there be again difference in my former communication i have attend to examination which i make upon a large number of island in the malay sea and in which it be show that a certain area exist which begin with the molucca and extend to the sunda group in which the hair show a strong inclination to form wavy lock indeed pass gradually into crinkled if not into spiral roll such hair be find specially in the interior of the island where the so-called aboriginal population be purer and where for a long time the name of alfuro have be confer on they on most point affinity with negrito or papuan be not to be recognize should such at any time have exist we be a long way from the period when the direct cause therefor be to be look for in this connection the study of the philippine be rich with instruction in the limit of the almost insular isolate negrito enclave mixture between negrito and indio very seldom surprise one and never the transition that can have arise in the post-generative time of development -lrb- the island of negro on the contrary be people by such crossbreed -- translator -rrb- if there be among the bright-colored islander of the indian ocean alfuro and malay close together there be nothing against come upon this contrast in the philippine population also among the more central people the tribal difference be so great that almost every explorer stumble on the question of mixture there not only the dayak and the other malay obtrude themselves but also the chinese and the mongolian people of farther india indeed many fact be know chiefly in the language the religion the domestic art the agriculture the pastoral life which remind one of known condition peculiarly indian the result of the ethnologist be so tangled here that one have to be cautious when one or another of they draw conclusion concern immigration because of certain local or territorial specialization of course when a brahmanic custom occur anywhere it be right to conclude that it come here from indium but before assume that the tribe in which such a custom prevail itself come from hither or farther india the time have to be ascertain to which the custom be to be trace back the chronological evidence lead to the confident belief that the custom and the tribe immigrate together -lrb- ancestor worship -rrb- over the whole philippine archipelago religious custom have change with the progress of external relation christianity have in many place spread its peculiar custom observance and opinion and change entirely the direction of think on closer view be to be detect in the midst of christian activity older survival as ingredient of belief which in spite of that religion have not vanish before christianity in many place islam flourish and it be not surprising to witness as on mindanao christian and mohammedan belief side by side but before islam ancestor worship as have long be know be widely prevalent in almost every locality every hut have its anito with its special place its own dwelling there be anito picture and image certain tree and indeed certain animal in which some anito reside the ancestor worship be as old as history for the discoverer of the philippine find it in full bloom and rightly have blumentritt characterize anito worship as the ground form of philippine religion he have also furnished numerous example of anito cult survive in christian community chronology have a good groundwork and it will have to observe every footprint of vanish creed only it must not be overlook that the beginning of the chronology of religion have not be reach and that the origin of the generally diffused ancestor worship at least on the philippine be not know if it be bear in mind that belief in anito be widely diffuse in polynesium and in purely malay area the drawing of certain conclusion therefrom concern the prehistory of the philippine be to be despair of -lrb- tattooing -rrb- next to religious custom among wild tribe fashion be most enduring little of costume be to be see indeed among they therefore here tattoo assert its sway the more it have be study in late year the more valuable have be the information in decide the kinship relation of tribe unfortunately in the philippine the greater part of the early tattoo design have be lose and the art itself be also nearly eliminate but since the journey of carl semper it have be know that not only malay but also negrito tattoo indeed this admirable explorer have decide that the negro of the east coast practice a different method of tattoo from that of the marivele in the west and on that account they attain different result in the one case a needle be employ to make fine hole in the skin in which to introduce the color in the other long gash be make in the latter case prominent scar result in the former a smooth pattern but these combine pattern be on the whole the same instead of rectilinear figure schadenburg have the operation commence with a sharpened bamboo on child 10 year of age among the wild tribe of the light-colored population tattooing be not less diffused but the pattern be not alike in the different tribe isabelo de los reye report that the tinguiane who inhabit the mountain forest of the northern cordillera of luzon produce figure of star snake bird etc on child 7 to 9 year old han meyer describe the pattern of the igorot there appear to exist a great variety of symbol for example on the arm straight and crooked line cross one another on the breast feather-like pattern least frequently he see the so-called burik design which extend in parallel band across the breast the back and calf and give to the body the appearance of a sailor 's striped jacket it be very remarkable that the human form never occur what be true concern tattooing on so many polynesian island hold also completely here but reliable description be so few and especially there be such a meager number of useful drawing that it would not repay the trouble to assemble the scatter datum at least it will suffice to discover whether among they there be genuine tribal mark or to investigate concern the distribution of separate pattern those know show conclusively that in the matter of tattoo the filipino be not differentiate from the islander of the pacific they form moreover a important link in the chain of knowledge which demonstrate the genetic homogeneity of the inhabitant the tattooing of the eastern islander be comparable only to those of african aborigine with which last they furnish many family mark make out and recognize it be desirable that a trustworthy collection of all pattern be collect before the method become more altered or destroy -lrb- tooth alteration -rrb- next to the skin among the wild tribe the tooth be modify in the most numerous artificial alteration the preferable custom common in africa of break out the front tooth in greater or less number have not so far as i remember be describe among the filipino i only mention that while i be make a revision of we philippine cranium two of they turn up in which the middle upper incisor have evidently be break out for a long time for the alveolar border have shrink into a small quite smooth ridge without a trace of a aveolus it be otherwise with the point of the incisor especially the upper one which also be not common i must leave it undecided whether the sharpen be do by filing or by break off piece from the side the latter should be in general far more frequent in every case the otherwise broad and flat tooth be bring to such sharp point as to project like those of the carnivorous animal i have meet with this condition several time on negrito skull and furnished illustration of they on a zambal skull excavate by dr a b meyer and which i lay before you the deformation be easy to be see i call attention at the time to the fact that among the malay a entirely different method of modify the tooth be in vogue in which a horizontal filing on the front surface be practice and the sharp lower edge be straighten and widen already the elder thévenot have accent this contrast when he say : these cause the tooth to be equal those file they to point give they the shape of a saw this difference appear to have hold on till the present at least no skull of a indio be know to I with similar deformation of the tooth this custom of the negrito be so much more remarkable since the chip of the corner of the tooth be widely spread among the african black -lrb- skill flattening -rrb- the other part of the body use most for deformation -- the skull -- be in strong contrast to the last-named custom deform cranium especially from older time be quite numerous in the philippine probably they belong exclusively to the indio if they exist among the negrito i do not know it the only exception come from the tinguiane of whom i de los reye report they skull be flatten behind -lrb- por detrás oprimido -rrb- such flattening be find however not seldom among tribe who have the practice of binding child on hard cradle board -- chiefly among those family who keep they infant a long time on such contrivance a sure mark by which to discriminate accidental pressure of this sort from one intentionally produce be not at hand it may be that in accidental deformation oblique position of the deform spot be more frequent at any rate the difference in the philippine be a very striking one since there not so much the occiput as the front and middle portion suffer from the disfigurement and thereby deformation be produce that have have they most perfect expression among the ancient peruvian and other american tribe i have discuss cranial deformation of the american in greater detail where i exhibit the accidental and the artificial -lrb- intentional -rrb- deformation in they principal form the result be that in large section of america scarcely any ancient skull be find have they natural form but that the practice of deformation have not be general moreover a number of deformation center may be differentiate which stand in no direct association with one another the peruvian center be far remove from that of the northwest coast and this again from that of the gulf state from this it must not be say that each center may have have its own as it be autochthonous origin but the method have not so spread that its course can be follow immediately rather be the supposition confirm that the method be to be trace to some other time therefore that somewhere there must have be a place of origin for it on the eastern hemisphere and especially in the region here under consideration the relation be apparently otherwise here exist so far as known great area entirely free from deformation small one on the other hand full of it there be here also deformation center but only a few among these with we present knowledge the philippine occupy the first place the knowledge of this indeed be not of long duration public attention be first arouse about thirty year ago concern skull from samar and luzon gather by f jagor from ancient cave to furnish the proof of they deformation up to that time next to nothing be know of deform cranium in the oriental island world first through my publication the attention of j g riedel a most observant dutch resident be call to the fact that cranial deformation be still practice in the celebe and he be so good as to send we a specimen of the compress apparatus for delicate infant -lrb- 1874 -rrb- compress cranium be also find but the number be small and the compression of the separate specimen be only slight in both respect what be observe in the sunda island do not differ from the state of the case in the philippine through jagor 's collection different place have become know where deform cranium be bury since then the number of locality have multiply i shall mention only two on account of they peculiar locality one be cagraray a small island east of luzon in the pacific ocean at the entrance of the bay of albay the other the island of marinduque in the west between luzon and mindoro from the last-named island i see ten year ago the first picture of one in a photograph album accidentally place in my hand since then i have opportunity to examine the schadenberg collection of cranium lately come into the possession of the reichsmuseum in leyden and to my great delight discover in it a series of skull which be compress in exactly the same fashion as those of lanang it be say that these will soon be describe in a publication it be of especial interest that this method have be note in the philippine for more than three hundred year in my first publication i cite a passage in thévenot where he say on the testimony of a priest that the native on some island have the custom of compress the head of a newborn child between two board so that it would be no longer round but lengthen out also they flatten the forehead which they look upon as a special mark of beauty this be therefore a ancient example it be confirm by the circumstance that these cranium be find especially in cave from the roof of which mineral water have drip which have overlay the bone partly with a thick layer of calcareous matter the bone themselves have a uncommonly thick almost ivory fossil-like appearance only the outer surface be in place corrode and on these place saturate with a greenish infiltration it be to be assume therefore that they be very old i have the impression that they must have be place here before the discovery of the island and the introduction of christianity they peculiar appearance especially they angular form and the thickness of the bone remind one of cranium from other part of the south sea especially those from chatham and sandwich island i shall not here go further into this question but merely mention that i come to the conclusion that these people must be look upon as proto-malayan -lrb- hope of filipino and american study -rrb- the change which will take place in the political condition of the philippine may be of little service to scientific exploration at first but the study of the population will be surely take up with renew energy already in america scholar have begin to occupy themselves therewith a brief article by dr brinton be to be mention as the first sign of this but should the ardent desire of the filipino be realize that they island \* hould have political autonomy it be to be hope that out of the patriotic enthusiasm of the population and the scientific spirit of many of they best man new source of information will be open for the history and the development of oriental people to this end it may be here mention by the way that the connect link of ancient philippine history and the custom of these island as well with the melanesian as with the polynesian of the south be yet to be discover as representative of these two group i present in close two especially well-formed cranium from the philippine one of they which show the mark of antiquity that i have set forth belong to a indio -lrb- comparison of indio and negrito skull -rrb- it have the high cranial capacity of 1540 cubic centimeter a horizontal circumference of 525 millimeter and a sagitta-circumference of 386 millimeter its form be hypsidolicho quite on the border of mesocephaly : index of width 753 index of height 763 besides it have the appearance of a race capable of development only the nose be platyrrhine -lrb- index 523 -rrb- as among so many malay tribe and in the left temple it bear a processus frontali squama temporali develop partly from a enlarged fontanelle the other skull be one take from a negrito grave of zambale by dr a b meyer it make at first glance just as favorable a impression but its capacity be only 1182 cubic centimeter therefore 358 cubic centimeter less than the other its form be orthobrachycephalic breadth index 802 height index 706 as in single trait of development so in the measurement the difference and the debased character of this race obtrude themselves only the nasal index be somewhat smaller on the whole the nose have in its separate part a decidedly pithecoid form part vi people and prospects of the philippine blackwood 's magazine for August 1818 have a account of condition in manila and the philippine from datum give by a english merchant who leave the island in 1798 after twenty year ' residence in which he accumulate a fortune you first question with respect to the spanish population must refer to native spaniard only as they numerous descendant through all the variety of half-caste would include one third at least of the whole population of luconium -lrb- ie luzon -- a c -rrb- of native spaniard accordingly settle in the philippine island the total number may be state at 2000 not military the military include all description man and officer be about 2500 out of which number the native regiment be officer these last in 1796-7 be almost entirely compose of south american and be reckon at 5000 man make a military force of about 7500 the caste bear a mixture of the spanish blood be in luconium alone at least 200000 the sangley or chinese descendant be upward of 20000 and indian who call themselves the original tagala about 340000 make a total population in that island of about 600000 soul what may be the respective number in the other philippine island i never have any opportunity of learning -lrb- this opinion of a day when it be not desire to disparage the people give a idea of the mixed blood of the filipino which in the opinion of the ethnologist like ratzel be a source of strength it class they with the english and american one danger of the present appear in over-emphasize the malay blood just as in spanish time a real loss seem to have come from the contempt toward the chinese which lead to minimize and conceal a most creditable ancestry prejudice in the past call all trouble maker mestizo but today 's study be show that trouble maker mean man who would stand up for he rights one must not forget that mestizo be use as a reproach that the leader of the people be really typical of the people by the old injustice those who be mediocre be call native and whoever rise above he fellow be claim as a spaniard but a fairer way would seem to be to consider filipino all bear in the philippine -- c -rrb- the cornhill magazine in the late '70 have a contribution by the then british consul mr palgreave
