pantheism ii post-christian pantheism iii modern pantheism afterword pantheism foreword -lrb- sidenote : pantheism not sectarian or even racial -rrb- pantheism differ from the system of belief constitute the main religion of the world in be comparatively free from any limit of period climate or race for while what we roughly call the egyptian religion the vedic religion the greek religion buddhism and other of similar fame have be necessarily local and temporary pantheism have be for the most part a dimly discern background a esoteric significance of many or all religion rather than a denomination by itself the best illustration of this characteristic of pantheism be the catholicity of its great prophet spinoza for he feel so little antagonism to any christian sect that he never urge any member of a church to leave it but rather encourage he humbler friend who seek he advice to make full use of such spiritual privilege as they appreciate most he could not indeed content himself with the fragmentary form of any sectarian creed but in the few writings which he make some effort to adapt to the popular understanding he seem to think it possible that the faith of pantheism might some day leaven all religion alike i shall endeavor briefly to sketch the story of that faith and to suggest its significance for the future but first we must know what it mean -lrb- sidenote : meaning of pantheism -rrb- -lrb- sidenote : god be all -rrb- -lrb- sidenote : but not everything be god -rrb- -lrb- sidenote : analogy of the human organism -rrb- pantheism then be a term derive from two greek word signify all and god suggest to a certain extent its own meaning thus if atheism be take to mean a denial of the being of god pantheism be its extreme opposite because pantheism declare that there be nothing but god this however need explanation for no pantheist have ever hold that _ everything _ be god any more than a teacher of physiology in enforce on he student the unity of the human organism would insist that every toe and finger be the man but such a teacher at least in these day would almost certainly warn he pupil against the notion that the man can be really divide into limb or organ or faculty or even into soul and body indeed he might without affectation adopt the language of a much controverted creed so far as to pronounce that the reasonable soul and flesh be one man -- one altogether in this view the man be the unity of all organ and faculty but it do not in the least follow that any of these organ or faculty or even a selection of they be the man -lrb- sidenote : the analogy imperfect but useful -rrb- if i apply this analogy to a explanation of the above definition of pantheism as the theory that there be nothing but god it must not be suppose that i regard the parallelism as perfect in fact one purpose of the follow exposition will be to show why and where all such analogy fail for pantheism do not regard man or any organism as a true unity in the view of pantheism the only real unity be god but without any inconsistency i may avail myself of common impression to correct a common mis-impression thus those who hold that the reasonable soul and flesh be one man -- one altogether -- but at the same time deny that the toe or the finger or the stomach or the heart be the man be bind in consistency to recognize that if pantheism affirm god to be all in all it do not follow that pantheism must hold a man or a tree or a tiger to be god -lrb- sidenote : farther definition -rrb- exclude then such a apparently plausible but really fallacious inversion of the pantheistic view of the universe i repeat that the latter be the precise opposite of atheism so far from tolerate any doubt as to the being of god it deny that there be anything else for all object of sense and think include individual consciousness whether directly observe in ourselves or infer as exist in other be accord to pantheism only facet of a infinite unity which be altogether one in a sense inapplicable to anything else because that unity be not merely the aggregate of all the finite object which we observe or infer but be a living whole express itself in infinite variety of that infinite variety we gleam of consciousness be infinitesimal part but not part in a sense involve any real division the question raise by such a view of the universe many of they unanswerable -- as be also the case with question raise by every other view of the universe -- will be consider further on all that i be try to secure in these preliminary observation be a general idea of the pantheistic view of the universe as distinguish from that of polytheism monotheism or atheism -lrb- sidenote : various form of pantheism -rrb- -lrb- sidenote : spurious form -rrb- -lrb- sidenote : exclusion of creation -rrb- -lrb- sidenote : evolution and decay applicable only to part not to the whole -rrb- of course there have be different form of pantheism as there have be also various phase of monotheism and in the brief historical review which will follow this introductory explanation of the name i shall note at least the most important of those form but any which fail to conform to the general definition here give will not be recognize as pantheism at all though they may be worth some attention as approximation thereto for any view of the universe allow the existence of anything outside the divine unity deny that god be all in all and therefore be obviously not pantheism whether we should recognize as true pantheism any theory involve the evolution of a finite world or world out of the divine substance at some definite epoch or epoch may be a debatable question provide that the eternity and inviolability of the divine oneness be absolutely guard in thought yet i will anticipate so far as to say that in my view the question must be negative at any rate we must exclude all creed which tolerate the idea of a creation in the popular sense of the word or of a final catastrophe true the individual object great or small from a galaxy to a moth which have to we apparently a separate existence have all be evolve out of precede mode of be by a process which seem to we to involve a beginning and to ensure a end but in the view of pantheism properly so-called the transference of such a process to the whole universe be the result of a illusion suggest by false analogy for the process call evolution though everywhere operative affect each of they only part of the infinite whole of thing and experience can not possibly afford any justification for suppose that they affect the universe itself thus the matter or energy of which we think we consist be in existence every atom of it and every element of force before we be bear and will survive we apparent death and the same thing at least on the pantheistic view be true of every other mode of apparently separate or finite existence therefore no birth of a new nebula ever add a grain of matter or a impulse of new energy to the universe and the final decease of we solar system if such a event be in prospect can not make any difference whatever to the infinite balance of force of which speaking in anthropomorphic and inadequate language we suppose the eternal all to consist -lrb- sidenote : limitation of scope -rrb- these observation be not intend to be controversial but only to make clear the general sense in which the term pantheism be here use not that it would be possible at the outset to indicate all that be implicit in the definition i only wish to premise plainly that i be not concern with any view of the world such as imply or admit that whether by process of creation or emanation or self-division or evolution the oneness of the eternal have ever be mar or anything other than the being of god have be or can be produce -lrb- sidenote : pantheism either philosophical or religious or both -rrb- -lrb- sidenote : pantheism as a religion almost entirely modern -rrb- -lrb- sidenote : mystic not necessarily pantheist -rrb- but before pass on to the promise historical review it be perhaps necessary to refer again to a remark previously make that pantheism may be consider either from the point of view of philosophy or from that of religion not that the two point of view be mutually exclusive but as a matter of fact pantheism as a religion be with certain exception among indian saint and later neoplatonist almost entirely a modern development of which spinoza be the first distinct and devout teacher for this statement justification will be give hereafter meantime to deprecate adverse prejudice i may suggest that a careful study of the most ancient form of pantheism seem to show that they be purely philosophical a endeavor to reach in think the ultimate reality which polytheism travesty and which the sens disguise but little or no attempt be make to substitute the contemplation of the eternal for the worship of mediator divinity thus in the same spirit in which socrate order the sacrifice of a cock to aesculapius for he recovery from the disease of mortal life philosophical pantheist whether egyptian or greek or even indian -lrb- 1 -rrb- satisfy they religious instinct by hearty communion with the popular worship of traditional god or if it be think that the mediaeval mystic be religious pantheist a closer examination of they devout utterance will show that though they approximate to pantheism and even use language such as if interpret logically must have imply it yet they carefully reserve article of the ecclesiastical creed entirely inconsistent with the fundamental position that there be nothing but god indeed they favorite comparison of creature life to the ray of a candle be not really a pantheistic conception because to the true pantheist the creature be not a emanation external to god but a finite mode of infinite be still the mystic do much to prepare the devout for a acceptance of spinoza 's teaching and although so amazing a transfiguration of religion rather dazzle than convince the world at first nay though it must be acknowledge that one and perhaps more of spinoza 's fundamental conception have increasingly repel rather than attract religious people yet it can hardly be dispute that he give a impulse to contemplative religion of which the effect be only now begin to be fully realize footnote : -lrb- footnote 1 : if buddha occur to the reader it should be remember that he be not a pantheist at all he ultimate aim be the dissolution of personality in the nothing but that be not pantheism -rrb- chapter i pre-christian pantheism -lrb- sidenote : its origin doubtful and unimportant -rrb- -lrb- sidenote : the secret of pantheism be within we -rrb- it have be the customary and perhaps inevitable method of writer on pantheism to trace its main idea back to the dream of vedic poet the musing of egyptian priest and the speculation of the greek but though it be undeniable that the divine unity of all be be a almost necessary issue of earliest human thought upon the many and the one yet the above method of treat pantheism be to some extent misleading and therefore caution be need in use it for the revival of pantheism at the present day be much more a tangible resultant of action and reaction between science and religion than a ghost conjure up by speculation thus religious belief drive out from the darkness and the cloud of sinaus take refuge in the mystery of matter and if the glory pass from the mount of transfiguration it be because it expand to etherialise the whole world as the garment of god again the evanescence of the atom into galaxy of electron destroy the only physical theory that ever threaten we with atheism and the infinitesimal electron themselves open up a immeasurable perspective into the abyss of a unknowable in which all thing live and move and have they be therefore it matter little to we except as a matter of antiquarian interest to know what the vedic singer may have dream or what thale or xenophane or parmenide may have think about the first principle of thing or about the many and the one for we spiritual genealogy be not from they but from a nearer and double line of begetter include seer -- in the true sense of the word -- and saint for both be represent by kepler and hooker newton and jeremy taylor descarte and spinoza leibnitz and wesley spencer and newman and even these have authority not through any divine right of genius or acquire claim of learning but because they illumine and interpret obscure suggestion of we own thought indeed to the sacrament of historic communion with the past as well as to the chief rite of the church the apostolic injunction be applicable : let a man examine himself and so let he eat of that bread -lrb- sidenote : suggestion of nature -rrb- obey that injunction any man possess ordinary power of observation and reflection may in the course of a summer day 's walk find abundant reason for interest in the speculation of historic pantheism for the aspect of nature then present to he be one both of movement and repose of variety and harmony of multiplicity and unity thus the slight breeze scarcely stir the drowsy flowery the monotonous cadence of the stony brook and the glide of feathery fleck of cloud across the blue create a peace far deeper than absolute stillness and suggest a infinite life in which activity and repose be one besides there be evident everywhere a interplay of force act and react so as mutually to help and fulfil one another for instance the fall leave give back the carbon they gather from the air and so repay the soil with interest for the subtler essence derive therefrom and dissolve in the sap the bee again hum among the flower while actuate only by instinct of appetite and thrift fructify the bloom and become a connect link between one vegetable generation and another the heat of the sun draw up water from ocean and river and lake while chilly current of higher air return it here and there in rain so earth sea and air be for ever trafficking together and they interchange of riches and force be complicate ten thousandfold by the activity of innumerable living thing all adapt themselves by some internal energy to the ever vary balance of heat and cold moisture and drought light and darkness chemical action and reaction and all this have be go on for untold million of year nor be there any sign of weariness now -lrb- sidenote : sympathy thus awaken with the old pantheistic aspiration to find the one in the many -rrb- in the mood engender by such familiar experience of a holiday saunter it may well occur to anyone to think with interest and sympathy of the poet and seer who thousand of year ago first dare to discern in this maze of existence the varied expression of one all-embracing and eternal life or power such contemplation and speculation be entirely uninfluenced by anything which the christian church recognize as revelation -lrb- 2 -rrb- yet we must not on that account suppose that they be without religion or pretend to explain anything without reference to superhuman being call god and demon on the contrary they for the most part share subject to such modification as be imperatively require by cultivate common sense the belief of they native land but the difference between these man and they unthinking contemporary lay in this that the former conceive of one supreme and comprehensive divinity beyond the reach of common think a ultimate and eternal be which include god as well as nature within its unity so for they indra zeus or jove be mere mode of the one be also manifest in man and bird and tree -lrb- sidenote : the veda and related literature -rrb- every race possess even the rudiment of culture have be impel by a happy instinct which if we like we may call inspiration to record in more or less permanent form its experience of nature of life and of what seem the mystery of both to this inspiration we owe the sacred book of the jew but it be now generally recognize that a impulse not wholly dissimilar also move prophetic or poetic mind among other race such for instance as the egyptian the chaldaean and the aryan conqueror of indium to inscribe on papyrus or stone or brick or palm-leaf the result of experience as interpret by free imagination traditional habit of thought and limited knowledge of this ancient literature a considerable part be take up by the mystery apparently involve in life conduct and death most notably be this the case with the ancient indian literature call the veda and such sequel as the upanishad sutra and -- much later -- the bhagavad gîtâ this collection like we bible form a library of writings issue at various date extend over much more than a thousand year -lrb- sidenote : indian pantheism -rrb- the forget singer and preacher of this prehistoric wisdom be as much haunt as we ourselves be with the harass question suggest by sin and sorrow by life and death and by aspiration after a higher state and many perhaps we may say most of they find comfort in the thought that essentially they belong to a all comprehensive and infinite life in which if they act purely and nobly they seeming personality might be merge and find peace they frame of mind be religious rather than philosophical but they philosophy be naturally conform to it and in they contrast of the bewildering variety of finite visible thing with the unity of the eternal being of which all be phase those ancient be in close sympathy with the thought of the modern meditative saunterer by field and river and wood -lrb- sidenote : difference between ancient and modern condition of thought -rrb- but the enormous interval of time separate we from those early indian thinker necessarily involve very great difference in condition of thought and we should not be surprise if amidst much in they writings that stir we sympathy there be also a great deal which be to we incongruous and absurd therefore it may be well before quote these writings to note one or two point mark a almost incommensurable difference between they mode and ours of regard the world -lrb- sidenote : 1 survival in they day of fetishistic and animistic idea -rrb- 1 first they be much less remove than we be from the influence of fetishistic and animistic tradition even in the greek and roman classic the casual reader be often revolt by the grossly absurd story tell of god and hero and indeed it be impossible to conceive of the amours of zeus -lrb- or jove -rrb- for instance with leda europa or danaë as have be first conceive during a age mark by the poetic genius and comparative culture evince in the most ancient epic but the most probable solution of the puzzle be that the earliest civilization inherit a number of animal story such as be characteristic of savagery in all part of the world and that the first literary generation into whose poetic myth those story be transfer be as much accustomed to they as to other surroundings of they childhood such as bloody sacrifice mystic expiation and fantastic initiation see no incongruity in anything tell they of the god besides as those wild myth be associate with sacred rite the inveterate conservatism of religion which insist on stone knife in sacrifice long after bronze and iron come in be likely enough to maintain the divine importance of those fable just as the historicity of balaam 's ass and jonah 's whale be in some church piously uphold still -lrb- sidenote : 2 ancient ignorance of natural order -rrb- 2 in the time from which the first known pantheistic teaching date idea of nature 's order be incongruous and indeed incommensurable with ours not that the world be then regard as a chaos but such order as exist be consider to be a kind of balance of power between various unseen being some good some evil some indifferent true some indian prophet project a idea of one eternal be include all such veil principality and power but they pantheism be necessarily condition by they ignorance of natural phenomenon in fact a irreducible inconsistency mar they view of the world for while they pantheism should have teach they to think of a universal life or energy as work within all thing they theological habit of mind bind they to the incongruous notion of devil or deity moulding or at least ruling matter from without and indeed the nearest approach they make to the more genuine pantheism of modern time be the conception of a world emanate from and project outside brahma to be re-merged in he after the lapse of age now if i be right in my definition of pantheism as absolutely identify god with the universe -lrb- 3 -rrb- so that in fact there can not be anything but god the inconsistency here note must be regard as fatal to the genuineness of the indian or indeed of any other ancient pantheism for the defect prove during many century to be incurable and be not indeed fully remove until spinoza 's time -lrb- sidenote : 3 absence of definite creed -rrb- 3 another difference between ancient pantheist and ourselves be the absence in they case of any religious creed sanction by supernatural authority and embody in a definite form like that of the three anglican creed or the westminster confession of faith not that those ancient suppose themselves to be without a revelation for the veda at least be consider to be of divine authority and they word metre and grammar be regard with a superstitious awe such as remind we of what have be call the bibliolatry of the jewish rabbi but subject to this verbal veneration the rishi or learn divine use the utmost freedom in regard to the force and fanciful interpretation extort from the sacred text a freedom which again remind we of the paradoxical caprice show by some school of jewish rabbi in they treatment of the volume they profess to regard with awe the various finite god such as vishnu indra krishna marut or varuna be not the subject of any church creed chant every day and carefully stereotyped in the tender mind of child on the contrary various rôles be assign by successive generation to these divinity so that for instance varuna be at one time the god of the ocean and at another of the sky but the uniform tendency of all poet and rishi alike be to seek beyond all these god one unbeginning unending and all comprehensive be from whom these deva emerge and into whom they must return not only so but it be clearly suggest in many passage of which a instance will presently be quote that the eternal call brahma who be the true self of all god be also the true self of man and bird and beast so that in fact notwithstanding the illogical emanation theory he be the only real be the all in all -lrb- sidenote : illustration from the upanishad -rrb- -lrb- sidenote : monism -rrb- thus one section of the khandogya upanishad -lrb- 4 -rrb- consist entirely of instruction give by a father uddâlaka to he son svetaketu who have go through the ordinary course of study in the veda but who in the father 's view have fail to reach the true significance of life accordingly uddâlaka inquire : have you ever ask for that instruction by which we hear what can not be hear by which we perceive what can not be perceive by which we know what can not be know -lrb- 5 -rrb- the youth more accustomed than we be to teaching by paradox express no surprise at this mode of put thing but simply ask : what be that instruction sir the father then proceed to give a explanation of what in these day be call monism that be the absolute singleness of ultimate being and trace all that be or seem to be up to one ultimate essence now whether in the form give by uddâlaka to he exposition he theory can properly be call pantheism accord to the definition of it assume above be perhaps questionable but that it be intend to be pantheism there can be no doubt in the beginning say uddâlaka there be that only which be -lrb- -lrb- greek : to hon -rrb- -rrb- one only without a second other say in the beginning there be that only which be not -lrb- -lrb- greek : to mae hon -rrb- -rrb- one only without a second and from that which be not that which be be bear but uddâlaka reject this latter doctrine as unthinkable -- which indeed many explorer of hegel have find with pain and anguish of mind and then the father trace all the multiformity of the universe to the desire or will of the original one that which be -lrb- sidenote : evolution from the one through desire -rrb- it think ` may i be many may i grow forth ' it send forth fire my limit do not allow I to quote further the fantastic account give of the farther process by which water and earth plant animal and man spring out of that desire of the one : may i become many may i grow forth for we purpose it be more important to show that in the view of uddâlaka -- however inconsistently he may express himself -- the original one be never really divide but remain the true self of every finite be however apparently separate thus consider the follow dialogue the first word be a direction of the father uddâlaka : -- fetch I from thence a fruit of the nyagrodha tree here be one sir break it it be broken sir what do you see there these seed almost infinitesimal break one of they it be broken sir what do you see there not anything sir the father say : my son that subtile essence which you do not perceive there of that very essence this great nyagrodha tree exist believe it my son that which be the subtile essence in it all that exist have itself it be the true it be the self and thou o svetaketu art it here we be clearly teach that the self or inmost reality of every person and thing be the eternal one or brahma or god -lrb- sidenote : illustration from the bhagavad gîtâ -rrb- the same doctrine be teach in a more advanced form by the poem call the bhagavad gîtâ the date of which be probably more than a thousand year later than that of the upanishad just quote in this poem krishna incarnate for the nonce as arjuna 's charioteer reveal for a special purpose he identity with brahma the eternal all and arjuna when sufficiently instruct adore he thus : -- o infinite lord of god the world 's abode thou undivided art o'er all supreme thou art the first of god the ancient sire the treasure-house supreme of all the world the know and the know the highest seat from thee the all have spring o boundless form varuna vayu agnus yama thou -lrb- 6 -rrb- the moon the sire and grandsire too of man the infinite in power of boundless force the all thou dost embrace the thou art all -lrb- 7 -rrb- -lrb- sidenote : omission of buddhism -rrb- these illustration must suffice for indian pantheism because with buddhism we have nothing to do for accord to its ablest european exponent -lrb- professor tw rhy david -rrb- that system of religion simply ignore the conception of a all in all and this not at all on philosophical grounds but because its aim be entirely practical for the aim of its founder be to show man how by a virtuous life or live they might at last attain annihilation -- or at any rate the extinction of the individual self the apparent separateness of which be in he view the source of all misery and if he could teach he follower to attain that salvation he be entirely indifferent as to the opinion they might hold about the ultimate nature of the world provide only that they do not fall into any heresy which proclaim a immortal soul -lrb- 8 -rrb- -lrb- sidenote : persian religion not strictly pantheistic -rrb- -lrb- sidenote : a world drama or process be a human not a divine aspect of thing -rrb- the account give to we by the best authority on zoroaster and parseeism scarcely justify we in think the religion of the zendavesta to be pantheistic in we sense of the term for though it would appear that ormuzd -lrb- or ahuramazda -rrb- the god of light and goodness originate in or be bear from and one with a nameless impersonal unity such as may answer to herbert spencer 's unknowable it can not be accurately say that accord to the persian view of the world there be nothing but god for to say nothing of the apparently independent existence of the principle of darkness and evil call ahriman the relation of the amshaspand or supreme spirit and of the ized or secondary spirit as well as of the fereur or divine idea to the impersonal unity seem to be rather that of emanation than part of a whole again if it be true that accord to the zend avesta the conflict of light and darkness will ultimately cease and ahriman with he demon be annihilate it be obvious that this imply a beginning and a end with a process originate in the one and consummate in the other but such a process though most actual on the finite scale and joyfully or painfully real to we contemplate as we do only infinitesimal part of the universe and always under the form of time and space be yet incongruous and incommensurate with the thought of one all in all unlimited by time or space and whose lifetime be a eternal now thus true pantheism take the universe as it be in its infinity regard it as without begin or end and worship it not that pantheism deny the existence of evil or be unmoved by the struggle between evil and good or be uninspired by faith in the reiterate triumph of good wherever the local conflict arise but it insist that evil be relative to the finite part of the universe in they suppose isolation and can not possibly affect the eternal all it allow of no creation or emanation which would put any part of the wondrous whole in opposition to or separation from the eternal but from its point of view all change evolution progress retrogression sin pain or any other good or evil be local finite partial while the infinite coordination of such infinitesimal movement make one eternal peace -lrb- sidenote : pantheism in ancient egypt -rrb- -lrb- sidenote : permanent effect of prehistoric animism -rrb- -lrb- sidenote : isis accord to plutarch -rrb- egyptian religion need not detain we for though there be clear trace of pantheistic speculation among the priest it can scarcely be contend that such speculation have the same influence on the culture laity as the teaching of the rishi have in ancient indium but the truth seem to be that the oldest popular theology of egypt be only a variety of negro animism and fetishism -lrb- 9 -rrb- yet these grovel superstition as be often the case evolve in unbroken continuity a higher faith for in the attempt make to adapt this savage cult to the religious need of various district all alike gradually advance in culture the number and variety of divinity become so bewildering to the priest that the latter almost inevitably adopt the device of recognize in parochial god only so many hint of one all-comprehensive divine energy not that they ever embrace monotheism -- or the belief in one personal god distinct from the universe but if plutarch be accurate -- as there seem no reason to doubt in he record of a inscription in a temple of isis -- they or at least the most spiritual of they find refuge in pantheism for the transfigured and glorified goddess be not regard as the maker of the universe but as identical with it and therefore unknowable i be all that have be be or shall be and no mortal have lift my veil the prevalence of such pantheism at least among the learn and spiritual of ancient egypt be to a considerable extent confirm by other greek writer besides plutarch but the inscription note by plutarch give the sum and substance of what they tell we -lrb- sidenote : greek pantheism -rrb- -lrb- sidenote : evolve from polytheism -rrb- before consider the classical and neo-platonic greek speculation commonly regard as pantheistic we may do well to recall to mind the immense difference between the established habit of theological thought in we day and the vague or at best poetically vivid idea of the ancient for the long tradition of nearly two thousand year which have make monotheism to we almost as fix a assumption as that of we own individuality be entirely want in this case not that the idea of one supreme god have never be suggest but it be not the hebrew or christian idea that be occasionally propound for in the ethnic mind it be rarely if ever regard as inconsistent with polytheism and consequently it verge on pantheism consequently i say because such monotheism as exist have necessarily to explain the innumerable minor deity as emanation from or manifestation of the supreme god and though such conscious attempt at reconciliation of belief in many god and in one supreme be confine to a small minority of meditative priest and speculative philosopher yet really the combination be implicit in the sort of polytheistic religion which possess the family affection and patriotic association of the early greek world -lrb- sidenote : not the material figure but the divinity suggest be the object of worship -rrb- for though we may find a difficulty in rid ourselves of a prejudice work into the tissue of we early faith by the nursery lesson of childhood it be not the graven or molten image which be really worship by the devout but that form of superhuman power which by local accident have be identify with the idol if indeed we suppose every idolator to have receive definite religious teaching analogous to that with which we ourselves be imbue in youth we might well find he attitude inconceivable but he have nothing of the kind he only know that in war in hunting in fishing in farm he be confront with power which pass he comprehension and tradition permeate he with the expectation that such power would be propitiate by he worship of the image set up in they name there be therefore no reason creed such as those of the catholic and reform church but only a vague sentiment bring to a focus by the association of the shrine from such a view of polytheism it be easy to understand how most if not all of the old speculative philosopher could allow the existence of the traditional god even while in reason contemplation they see that all deity be subordinate to and merge in one universal god -lrb- sidenote : possible influence of oriental pantheism -rrb- how far this unstable religious position be subject to the influence of the oriental mysticism at which we have glance already be at any rate so far as concern the classical age of greek philosophy a matter of conjecture but the resurrection of a prehistoric and almost forget civilization from the bury city of crete have bring to light many evidence of frequent intercourse two or three thousand year before the christian era between european and egyptian or asiatic centre of life therefore we may well believe that during the earliest stage of the evolution of think in east and west it be as impossible as at the present time for any local school of thinker to be absolutely original or independent thus later greek philosopher whether themselves within sound of the echo of hindoo teaching or not may very well have grow up in a atmosphere impregnate with mythic germ whose origin they do not know but however that may be greek pantheism while it have many point of contact with eastern speculation be more purely intellectual and less essentially religious than the pantheism of the veda or the solemn dream that haunt egyptian temple for while the aspiration of hindoo pantheist be to find and assume the right attitude toward the glory of the sum of thing the greek as st paul long afterward say seek after wisdom and be fascinate by the idea of trace all the bewildering variety of nature up to some one principle -lrb- -lrb- greek : archê -rrb- -rrb- begin origin -lrb- sidenote : thale about 640 bc -rrb- thus thale of miletus during the late seventh and early sixth century bc be say to have be satisfy when he find in water -- or moisture -- the ultimate principle out of which all thing and all life include god and man be evolve with such a speculation of infant philosophy we be here not concerned except to say that it be not pantheism as understand in modern time for while he ablest exponent admit that no sufficient evidence be leave to show very clearly what he mean there seem no reason for suppose that to he the universe be a living god -lrb- sidenote : successor of thale -rrb- it would be fruitless to relate how successor of thale vary he theory of a ultimate principle by substitute air or fire for water but it be worth while to note that another citizen of miletus anaximander after a interval of some forty year

confess that they can not be sure of he mean this may very well be because he anticipate herbert spencer by two and a half millennium in acknowledge that all thing merge in one and the same unknowable but so far as we evidence go he make no such attempt as the modern philosopher do to persuade the religious instinct that this unknowable could supply the place of all the god -lrb- sidenote : xenophane of elea about 570 to 480 bc -rrb- -lrb- sidenote : he pantheism dispute but well establish -rrb- -lrb- sidenote : he religion -rrb- the position of xenophane who toward the latter part of the sixth century bc migrate apparently for political reason in fear of persian imperialism from colophon in asia minor to elea in italy be a little different and for we purpose more interesting for the few fragment which be unfortunately all that be leave to we of he philosophical poetry be strongly suggestive of pantheism and the interpretation put upon they by later classical and sub-classical writer who have he work before they would appear decisive true the distinguish and enlighten scholar simon karsten who in the first quarter of the nineteenth century find a labor of love in collect and editing the remains of early greek philosopher deprecate such a judgment yet while the motive for he special plead be honorable see the odious misrepresentation of pantheism still prevalent in the dutch scholar 's native land -- misrepresentation undissipated even by the splendor of spinoza -- he protest remain special plead still and he himself candidly quote at large from a alleged work of aristotle -- possibly only a student 's note of the latter 's lecture -- and also from simplicius as report by theophrastus in a comment on aristotle 's physics sentence which describe the system of xenophano as unquestionably pantheistic from which description i gather that the devout philosopher regard god as the only real be include all that in human language have be be and will be without begin or end living and perceive equally everywhere throughout he infinite essence and if that essence be compare by xenophane to a sphere neither bound nor boundless neither move nor immovable this be only because few if any in that age of the world could content themselves with loyally accept the limit impose on man by the very nature of thing limit which now compel we to own that while the eternal be more real than ourselves yet in the strict sense of know he be from a intellectual standpoint the unknowable -lrb- sidenote : extent of he sympathy with popular religion -rrb- -lrb- sidenote : a pantheistic communion feast -rrb- this pantheism do not generate in xenophane any arrogant disdain for the religion of he time for though he condemn in word often quote the folly which suppose the god to have the human form sens passion and appetite he be yet glad to worship the divine all as partially manifest in finite being -- perhaps personify power of nature thus among the fragment of he poetry fortunately preserve be one exquisite gem a description of a festive repast in the open air there purity come first symbolise by clear floor clean hand and spotless dish upon purity wait beauty not in the form desire by sensuous passion but in garland of flower and in delicate scent the wine be unstinted yet temper with sparkling water but lest the plentifulness of bread and honey and cheese upon the lordly table should eclipse the highest sanction of human joy a altar prominent in the festive scene be heap with offering of flower then the first note of music be the praise of god a praise take form in blameless poetic myth and holy thought in such a feast the mind of the guest be kindle with a desire to be capable of do right there be no harm in drinking with reasonable moderation -lrb- 10 -rrb- and we may honor the guest who warm by wine talk of such noble deed and instance of virtue as he memory may suggest but let he not tell of titan battle or those of the giant or centaur the fiction of bygone day nor yet of factious quarrel nor gossip that can serve no good end rather let we ever keep a good conscience towards the god -lrb- 11 -rrb- -lrb- sidenote : empedocle middle of fifth century bc -rrb- -lrb- sidenote : not properly a pantheist -rrb- have give so much space to a ancient who seem to I specially interesting as a prophet of the ultimate apotheosis of earthly religion i must be content to indicate in a very few line the course of the pantheistic tradition among the greek after he day the arithmetical mysticism of pythagora have no bearing upon we subject empedocle of agrigentum live about the middle of the fifth century bc and thus perhaps in the second generation after xenophane be in many respects a much more impose figure -- clothe in purple wield political power possess medical skill and even work miraculous cure such as be apparently easy to man of personal impressiveness sympathy and magnetism but he do not appear to have so nearly anticipate modern pantheism as do he humbler predecessor for though the fragment of empedocle much larger in volume than those of xenophane certainly hint at some kind of everlasting oneness in thing and expressly tell we that there be no creation nor annihilation but only perpetual change of arrangement yet they present other phase of thought apparently irreconcileable with the doctrine that there be nothing other than god thus he teach that there be four element -- earth air water and fire -- out of which all thing be generate he also anticipate lucretius in he pessimistic view of humanity 's lot and insist on the apparently independent existence of a principle of discord or strife in the universe it would be a forced interpretation to suppose he to have set forth precociously the darwinian theory of the struggle for life for he notion seem much more akin to the zoroastrian imagination of ahriman again he sing melodiously but most unphilosophically of a former golden age in which the lion and the lamb would seem to have lie down together in peace and tree yield fruit all the year round at that time the only deity be venus who be worship with bloodless offering alone still it must be remember that whether consistently or not empedocle produce a elaborate work on the nature of thing to which lucretius make eloquent and earnest acknowledgment but that very approval of lucretius forbid we to regard the older poet as a pantheist in we sense of the term for certainly to he the universe can not have be a living god -lrb- sidenote : genesis of modern religious pantheism -rrb- between this philosophical idea of a oneness not think of as god and the spiritual contemplation of a universal life of which all thing be mode the highest thought of man hover during the process by which in some measure under extraneous influence greek speculation finally produce neo-platonism -- or as we might say in the current phraseology of we time -- a restatement of plato 's teaching of this school arise in the early christian century some leader be undoubtedly pantheist but we can not say this of plato himself nor of he master socrate for though these great man be more profoundly interested in the moral order of the world than in any question of physical nature or even of metaphysical subtlety they be never give to the kind of contemplation suggest above in extract from the classical book of the east the contemplation which educe the moral ideal from unreserved subordination of self to the universe as of the part to the whole doubtless the inspiration impart by socrate to a disciple in mere intellect he superior and the result moral and religious suggestion abound in the dialogue do much to impel the current of religious evolution toward that spiritual aspect of the infinite all which fascinate some of the neo-platonist and receive its most splendid exposition from spinoza but the condition impose by necessary brevity compel I to pass by those classic name with this acknowledgment and to hasten toward the fuller revelation of pantheism as a religion footnote : -lrb- footnote 2 : some scholar think they can trace christian

its apparent subjection to extraneous influence these of course include the rise power of christianity and its jewish tradition -lrb- sidenote : the hebrew tradition -rrb- even before the advent of the new revelation the jewish settlement exist in all great city of the graeco-roman world excited interest at any rate among sentimentalist touch by the fascination at that time begin to be exert by oriental religion and this influence of jewish tradition be much facilitate by the existence of a greek translation of the hebrew scripture -lrb- sidenote : its influence on greek philosophy -rrb- -lrb- sidenote : to inspire devotion not solve problem -rrb- now what the hebrew tradition do for greek philosophy be of course not to favor its pantheistic trend where that exist but much more to convert such semi-pantheism from a mere intellectual speculation to contemplative devotion for hebraism itself have become almost as intensely monotheistic as the later islam and though monotheism may be a stage in the progress of religion from animism to pantheism it may also by the peculiar intensity of the personal devotion it sometimes inspire cause the very idea of any farther expansion of faith to be count a sin -lrb- sidenote : philo the jew of alexandrium -rrb- perhaps the influence of hebraism on hellenism may be illustrate by the alexandrian philo 's pathetic endeavor not only to trace the wisdom of the greek to mose but to show that this derive lore be much mightier for good when re-invest with the spiritual power and ardent devotion of the jewish faith if any one will speak plainly he write -lrb- 12 -rrb- he might say that the intelligible world be nothing other than the word -lrb- se -lrb- greek : logo -rrb- reason -rrb- of the world-making god for neither be the intelligible city anything other than the thought -lrb- greek : logismo -rrb- of the architect already intend to build the city this be the teaching of mose not mine at any rate in what follow when he record the origin of man he declare outright that man be make in the image of god but if a part -lrb- of creation -rrb- reflect the type so also must the entire manifestation this intelligible order world which be a reproduction of the divine image on a larger scale than that of man -lrb- 13 -rrb- -lrb- sidenote : motive underlie he distortion of hebraism -rrb- -lrb- sidenote : not pantheistic -rrb- how philo manage to extort this out of the pentateuch be a question of interest but one on which i can not delay suffice it that while he thus show he reverence for the tradition of he race he whole aim be to fire philosophy with religious devotion but he be not in any strict sense of the word a pantheist though he regard the logo as a emanation from the eternal and the kosmo the order world as in some way emanate from the logo perhaps indeed if we could exclude from emanation the idea of time as christian be suppose to do when they speak of the eternal generation of the divine son or the procession of the holy ghost we might regard philo with the succeed neo-platonist and some of the gnostic as approximately pantheistic but he vagueness and uncertainty about matter forbid such a conclusion for whether he regard matter as eternally exist apart from the divine substance or whether he look upon it as the opposite of be as a sort of positive nothing in either case it can not be say that for he the whole universe be god and nothing but god -lrb- sidenote : neo-platonism -rrb- -lrb- sidenote : resultant of contact between east and west -rrb- if i have give more space to the great alexandrian jew than my narrow limit ought to afford it be because i think i may thus avoid the necessity of say much about the philosophic scheme of the neo-platonist the phantasy of the gnostic or the occasionally daring speculation of the christian father for whether the work of philo be much study by the greek or not they certainly describe the spiritual resultant -- so to speak -- emerge from the mutual impact of western and oriental especially jewish idea which resultant be in the air from the first century of the christian age and the later epistle ascribe to st paul as well as the fourth gospel show clear trace of it -lrb- 14 -rrb- -lrb- sidenote : its religious inspiration -rrb- -lrb- sidenote : suggestive of pantheism but not such in spinoza 's sense -rrb- but the inspiration of the time-spirit be not confine to the christian church for the city of alexandrium where that spirit seem to have be peculiarly potent as show in the transfigured judaism of philo be the birthplace of the neo-platonic school already mention above and among its greatest member such as plotinus porphyry proclus the religious influence of the east be distinctly apparent true they follow socrate and plato in reverence for knowledge as the unfailing begetter of virtue but they speculation about the divine be be touch by oriental emotion and we may with some confidence believe that they development of the platonic trinity owe a good deal to the rapid spread of christianity thus the sentiment the fervor the yearning for salvation the worship and devotion teach by the best of the neo-platonist be not so much from athen as from sinaus and galilee yet though there be in they world-conception many anticipation of the gospel of the god-intoxicated man whom the counsel of the eternal reserve for the fulness of time it would scarcely be accurate to describe the system of any of they as strictly pantheistic for they be always trouble about matter as a anomalous thing in a divine universe and in treat of it they hesitate between the notion of a eternal nuisance which the demiurgus or act god could only modify not destroy and on the other hand a strained theory of a evil nothing which be yet something again so far from realize spinoza 's faith in god as so literally all in all that there be nothing else but he they would not tolerate the contact of the infinite with the finite of god with the world consistently with such prepossession they hold obstinately to the notion of some beginning and therefore some ending of the order world and this beginning be effect by emanation such as the logo or as other have it the world-soul and other divine energy between the eternal and creation a phantasy which however poetically work out be not really consistent with pantheism -lrb- sidenote : the gnostic -rrb- such idea of a hierarchy of subordinate emanation to fill the suppose abyss between the infinite and the finite be eagerly adopt and develop by the pseudo-philosopher call gnostic on both side of the boundary between the church and the world suffice it that like most though by no means all of they predecessor they regard the world of earth sun planet star and animated nature with man at its head as the whole universe and assume that it must have have a begin they vex they soul with futile attempt to frame some gradual transition from the uncreated to the create from the eternal to the mortal the grotesque chimaera engender thus be remembered now only as illustration of the facile transition from the sublime to the ridiculous and from philosophy to folly -lrb- sidenote : the church father -rrb- -lrb- sidenote : augustine -rrb- the orthodox christian father be not less conscious than the neo-platonist or gnostic of the perennial problem of the many and the one but they be restrain perhaps by the faith that come of self-control perhaps by mere common sense from indulge in attempt to connect the infinite with the finite by vain genealogy indeed for the most part they confess that whatever light the gospel might shed on moral issue it leave untouched the ultimate question of the relation of the infinite to the finite and the only aspect of they most venturesome speculation which i need recall be they insistence even when apparently verge toward pantheism on a transcendent as well as a immanent god that be on a creator exist so to speak outside the universe and apart from it as well as permeate every part thus for example augustine would seem to deny to the world any separate creature existence when he say that but for the divinity everywhere in it creation would cease to be but in he insistence on the creation of the world from nothing he directly contradict pantheism because he must necessarily be take to mean that there be now something other than god that there have be devout christian whose mystic speculation on the relation of the soul to the eternal logically involve pantheism -- if logic in such a case have any function -- there can be no doubt but for most of they god 's word write seem to confirm god 's word in heaven and earth as know to they proclaim that there have be a beginning and there must be a end therefore whatever might be the immanence of the creator in he work god could not in they mind be identify with the fashion of this world which passeth away yet the time be come when the divine word both in scripture and in nature be to be otherwise read for man begin to learn that the bible be other than they have suppose and the universe immeasurably greater than they have conceive

should be note that philo who be contemporary with jesus often use the title the father -lrb- greek : ho pataer -rrb- as a sufficient designation of the eternal it be not very usual and be suggestive

viii 58 -rrb- chapter iii modern pantheism -lrb- sidenote : spinoza -rrb- -lrb- sidenote : a pantheistic prophet -rrb- -lrb- sidenote : the main subject here be he religion and not he philosophy -rrb- modern pantheism as a religion begin with spinoza whether it end with he be a question which the future will have to decide but the sign of the time be at least in my view very clearly against such a conclusion and amongst the omen which portend immortality not necessarily for the philosophical scheme but for the god-intoxicated devoutness of he pantheism be the desire or rather the imperious need increasingly realize for a religion emancipate from theory of creation or teleology intolerant of any miracle save indeed the wonder of the spiritual life and satisfy the heart with a ever present god for it be to be remember that spinoza be the first pantheist who be also a prophet in the sense of speak out the divine voice of the infinite universe to its human constituent part not that i would minimize the religious fervor of the neo-platonist : it be they pantheism that seem to have be imperfect but in spinoza we have a man who inherit by birth the tradition -- i might even say the apostolic succession -- of the jewish prophet and gifted with a insight into the consummation of that tradition in jesus christ be drive by a commanding intellect to divorce the spiritual life he prize from creed that have become to he impossible and to enshrine it in the worthier temple of a eternal universe identical with god it be not then with he philosophy that i be so much concern as with he religion -lrb- 15 -rrb- -lrb- sidenote : he originality -rrb- -lrb- sidenote : relation to descarte -rrb- it be give to no man to be absolutely original in the sense of create idea of which no germ exist before he day but short of such a impossible independence of the past benedict de spinoza have perhaps as much originality as any man who ever live yet with a modesty ever characteristic of moral greatness he himself be dispose at any rate during he earlier philosophical development to exaggerate he indebtedness to the philosopher descarte whose system he laboriously abridge in the inappropriate form of a series of proposition suppose to be demonstrate after the fashion of euclid -lrb- sidenote : fundamental difference -rrb- -lrb- sidenote : spinoza discard creator and creation -rrb- -lrb- sidenote : beginning and end -rrb- -lrb- sidenote : take the universe as it be -rrb- -lrb- sidenote : and worship the static whole as god -rrb- but whatever may have be the esoteric belief of descarte about creation out of nothing and the theological dogma connect therewith he attach too much importance to the social and political function of established ecclesiastical institution to declare himself independent of they and though he submission signalise on he death-bed do not interfere with the freest working of he brilliant intellect within limit permit to the former ecclesiastical schoolman it do prevent he frank realization of the eternal oneness of all be for it compel he to retain belief in a creator distinct in essence from creation such a belief spinoza entirely reject for though he natura naturan or nature active may in a manner be call the creator of he natura natura or nature passive these be consubstantial and co-eternal neither be before or after the other thus for he there be no beginning of the universe and there could be no end there be no creation out of nothing nor any omen of weariness decay or death in the eternal order he teach we in effect to take the universe as it be and to pry into no suppose secret of origin or end a entirely gratuitous labor impose by illusion arise out of the continuous redistribution of part of the whole instead of thus spend we mental energy for nought he would have we regard the whole of be as one substance characterize by innumerable attribute of which extension and thought alone come within we human cognizance while each attribute be subject to infinite mode or modification which in they effect on the two attribute know to we -- extension and thought -- constitute the universe of we experience that infinite and eternal substance reveal by attribute and they mode be god absolute in he perfection if he could be fully conceive and know in all he activity and even to we ignorance he be entrance in he gradual self-revelation as with we inadequate idea we pursue the unattainable from glory to glory -lrb- sidenote : this view of the universe apply to psalm civ -rrb- this then be the first note we make of the gospel of spinoza but if any one think that the sacred word gospel be here misuse and that such teaching be fatal to piety let he turn to the 104th psalm and read from spinoza 's point of view the cosmic vision of the hebrew seer true we can think no longer of the supernatural carpenter who work on the beam of he chamber above or of the mythical engineer who dig deep in the darkness to lay the foundation of the earth for that be poetry appealing by concrete image to the emotion but it do not bind the intellect to a literal interpretation and we be no longer torment by vain effort to reconcile with infinite impossibility the half-human personality present in poetic guise so that the vision of the seer be now the suggestion to we of a infinite and eternal be whose attribute by modification take the innumerable shape of sun moon and star and mountain and river and tree and flower and bird and beast and man and the wind that sweep and the flood that roll and the rocky barrier that stand fast and the river that wind among the hill and the tree that flourish and the living society that gather in fruitful place the labourer in he vineyard the sailor in he ship all be in and of the one eternal be yet we echo not with less but perhaps with more reverence than the believer in a divine artisan the word of the psalmist : o lord how manifold be thy work in wisdom hast thou make they all : the earth be full of thy riches but if the thunder and the flaming fire and the sweeping flood seem discordant they exist for the psalmist as well as for we and they do not seem to have trouble he at this point therefore we need only say that spinoza 's religion of one divine substance whose unity in variety be holy ought to stir within we with not less fervor at least the spirit of the psalmist 's conclude prayer : let the sinner be consume out of the earth and let the wicked be no more -lrb- sidenote : spinoza no materialist -rrb- -lrb- sidenote : notwithstanding he attribution of extension to god -rrb- -lrb- sidenote : criticism by sir f pollock -rrb- -lrb- sidenote : change in theory of matter since spinoza 's time -rrb- spinoza 's maintenance of extension as one of the two infinite divine attribute cognizable by we have with a certain amount of plausibility be urge as a note of materialism and this reproach have be support by reference to he insistence that in man the body and the soul be only two different aspect of the same thing for to he the body be a finite mode of god 's infinite attribute of extension and the soul a finite mode of god 's infinite attribute of thought while both be manifestation of the one eternal divine substance still if in any way we be to regard god as extend it seem impossible to avoid the inference that we regard he as identify with matter or at least the possibility of matter sir frederick pollock have admit that this be a weak point in spinoza 's philosophy -lrb- 16 -rrb- and mar its symmetry but be more concerned with he religion i be content to point out that such a objection be much more effective in spinoza 's time than it be to-day for the whole trend of philosophy during the nineteenth century be towards a view of extension itself as a mode of thought and therefore toward the absorption of one of spinoza 's theoretical divine attribute in the other -lrb- sidenote : they effect on he system -rrb- now if this should prove to be the permanent tendency of the most influential thinker -- as indeed seem most likely -- it will probably be hold that spinoza be wrong in attribute extension to the eternal as one of the quality of he substance except in so far as extension be if not a necessary at any rate a actual and so far as we know a universal mode of thought but though as sir frederick pollock have point out spinoza have in a manner count think twice over while treat of the only two infinite attribute cognizable to we we need not on that account surrender he luminous idea of god as a be absolutely infinite that be substance consist of infinite attribute whereof each one express eternal and infinite be nor need we abandon he supplementary but essential idea of mode or modification which mould the attribute into the variety of finite world know and unknown thus it may be that in spinoza 's sense of the word attribute we shall have to confess that only one come within we human ken that of think in a sense which include feeling but if the late herbert spencer apart from he synthetic philosophy of phenomenon have leave any permanent mark on the religion consciousness it have be by a consecration of the mystery of the ultimate unknowable -lrb- 17 -rrb- and in the spirit of reverence thus teach by he we may still hold with spinoza that the eternal have a infinity of other attribute with they infinite modification not within we cognizance this would only be a enlarged application of hamlet 's word : there be more thing in heaven and earth horatio than be dream of in you philosophy or to put it in another way the universe perceptible to we be only one of a infinity of universe by which be not mean a infinite extension of galaxy in space but the co-existence and so to speak interpenetration of a infinity of mode of existence imperceptible to we -lrb- sidenote : god be identical with the whole of be -rrb- to spinoza then god be the totality of be but it be not to be infer that he identify god with the visible or with any conceivable universe for either of these must fall far short of infinity and the being of god be infinite all i mean when i say that spinoza identify god with the totality of existence be that he regard the deity as that perfect be without begin or end whose essence it be to be and of whom all that exist whether know to we or not be separately a partial and comprehensively a perfect expression -lrb- sidenote : he doctrine of man -rrb- of more practical interest to we perhaps be spinoza 's doctrine of man though it would have be impossible to explain that without first indicate he idea of god in he view then man be a finite mode of the two divine attribute extension and think thus both the extended body and the conscious mind have they substance and reality in god -lrb- 18 -rrb- but the essence of man do not necessarily involve he separate existence as the essence of god imply be of course the substance of man be imperishable because it be of god 's substance nay there be a sense in which each man be a eternal thought of god have a aspect towards eternity or exist sub specie eternitati but that be a truth transcend the finite practical world with which we have to do -lrb- sidenote : illustration by the vortex theory -rrb- -lrb- sidenote : distinction between man and beast -rrb- accord to spinoza what constitute the real essence of the human mind be the -lrb- divine -rrb- idea of a certain individual creature actually exist -lrb- 19 -rrb- here perhaps modern speculation about the constitution of matter may help we -- if we use they with due reserve -- to grasp spinoza 's notion of a re singulari in actu -- or as it might be render freely a creature of individual function for what be call the vortex theory though as old as cartesian philosophy have recently flash into sudden prominence and whether or no the speculation be only a pass phase of human think about the unknowable it equally answer the purpose of illustration thus the so-called ether be suppose to fill all space and within it there be imagine or infer innumerable tourbillon or vortex which though part of the indefinitely extend ether form by they self-contained motion little world in themselves these little world be by some regard as the atom which by composition and differentiation build up we palpable universe with the possibility of such a theory i have nothing to do but the notion of the vortex in the ether may perhaps help we to a glimpse of spinoza 's notion when he speak of a re singulari in actu a creature of individual function for to he man be as it be a infinitesimal vortex in a phase or attribute of the divine substance the analogy like all other analogy would not bear be press but it do suggest to we a picture of finite individuality in action or function subordinate to unity with infinite substance if it be say that such a explanation would necessarily include the conscious life of beast and bird the answer would seem to be that admit this to be the case yet in man the divine idea of individuality be more fully express and have more of reality than in any lower creature -lrb- sidenote : moral difficulty -rrb- man then accord to spinoza be in god and of god but what be we to say of bad man the vile the base the liar the murderer be they also in god and of god spinoza do not blench yes they be but here come in he doctrine of adequate and inadequate idea thus if you see the color red it completely express itself it can not be define and need no explanation -lrb- 20 -rrb- as it be in the infinite thought so it be in ours we have a adequate idea of it but now if you see on a artist 's canvas a splotch of red and blue and yellow part of a work only begin it give you no adequate idea true you have a adequate idea of each several color but not of they relation to the work conceive to get that you would have to enter into the mind of the artist and see as he see then the splotch of color would take its place as part of a harmonious whole and would give you a adequate idea just as it do to the artist -lrb- sidenote : but the universe be not a unfinished picture -rrb- -lrb- sidenote : it be a eternal whole of which a partial consideration be mislead -rrb- now accord to spinoza when we see thing as they appear in infinite thought we have a adequate idea but if we see only a component element in a idea -- let we say -- of the divine artist then we idea be inadequate -lrb- 21 -rrb- hence we misjudge thing and of the part play by bad man in the divine whole we certainly have no adequate idea but here again we must be on we guard against the abuse of illustration for it be not to be infer that spinoza regard the universe as a unfinished picture of which the completion will justify the beginning on the contrary the universe be to he eternal the necessary expression of the infinite attribute of eternal be still the analogy may help we for the concentration of attention on a single part of a order whole may quite as certainly as a glance at a unfinished work be the occasion of a inadequate idea in effect the suggestion be that if we like god could contemplate the infinite universe all at once and have a adequate idea thereof in other word if we could ascend to the self contemplation of the eternal we should have the bliss associate by long habit with the word of the psalmist : i shall be satisfy when i awake with thy likeness such bliss however be only approximately attainable in moment of mystic transport and when as in so many experience we see only in part and have inadequate idea faith in the eternal whole be need to keep we from blasphemy -lrb- sidenote : doctrine of man resume -rrb- -lrb- sidenote : final cause replace by idea -rrb- -lrb- sidenote : freedom purity love -rrb- with such necessarily brief hint as to spinoza 's attitude towards evil i resume he doctrine of man -- the individual creature as a center of action of final cause spinoza will not hear but if instead of ask what be the chief end of man we ask what be the idea of man spinoza answer that it be the realization of a mode of the divine attribute extension and thought and if this should seem unsatisfying let it be remember that to this devout pantheist the divine attribute and they mode be the expression of the very substance and life of god now with extension for reason already give we need not trouble ourselves except to say that at least spinoza 's teaching would suggest the idea of _ men sana in corpore sano _ because to he the mind be the idea of the body and the body the object -- not quite in the modern sense -- of the mind but as regard the human mode of the divine attribute of thought spinoza make its ideal to be a life absorb in such contemplation of the bless god the infinite whole as shall react on the creature in inspiration of freedom purity and love -lrb- sidenote : idea of freedom -rrb- and first as to freedom spinoza mean by this not caprice nor the monstrous miracle of causeless action but independence of external force or of any disproportionate and illegitimate passion the freedom to which he aspire be the freedom of god who eternally act in accordance with the mutual harmony of the whole attribute of he nature not one of which clash with another so spinoza 's free man be one in whom all aspiration and energy converge in one resultant the expression of the divine idea move he in harmony with the universe from such a point of view the quibble about free will in the sense of causeless action cease to have any meaning for if the good man say i could have do otherwise if i have like the obvious reply be yes but you would not have like because the will be not a separate faculty but the expression of the whole nature as that exist at the moment of willing and the only real freedom be the unimpeded conglomerate impulse to do right but should it be ask what if the resultant impulse of the whole nature be toward wrong the answer be in that case there be no freedom but a slavery to some external influence or to a disturbed balance of the passion or if it be ask what be right that be a far reach question to the solution of which spinoza bend all he splendid power but limit of space preclude I from say more than that he ideal of right will be find conformable to the highest standard of the most spiritual religion -lrb- sidenote : purity -rrb- this ideal i venture to symbolize rather than define as purity for after all the philosophic reasoning with which it be no less lucidly than laboriously work out in the final book of he _ ethica _ concern human freedom -- the moral result of all this intellectual effort be that same cleanse of the soul from vain desire and that subordination of the earthly self to its divine idea which we be teach in the sermon on the mount and while surely every one but a fanatical anti-christian must allow the greater prophetic worth of the galilean who could teach these sublime lesson so that the common people hear he gladly it seem difficult to deny to the heretic jew of the hague the second rank among the teacher give to the world by that strangely gifted race for though he could not speak to the common people he leave as he legacy to mankind not so much a system of philosophy as a impregnable foundation for moral and religion available for the time now come upon we -- such a time as that suggest by the writer of the epistle to the hebrew when he speak of the remove of those thing that be shake as of thing that be make that those thing which can not be shake may remain no doubt sir frederic pollock be quite right in declare that spinoza would have be the very last man to desire any one to become a spinozist but that be quite consistent with the inspired pantheist 's infinite longing to see all man bless by that inward peace which he prove by he own heroic experience to be identical with the self-control confer and maintain by devout contemplation of god 's all-comprehensive be and we place therein if then i regard purity as the best symbol of such a moral ideal it be because the word connote together with freedom from discordant passion a frankly unconstrained recognition of the simplicity of we relation to god for surely when once the self have make the great surrender and become content to be nothing that in st paul 's word god may be all in all the whole problem of life be infinitely simplify in the sense that no farther degree of simplification be possible because all contradiction of pain and evil and sorrow be dissolve in that act of surrender we must indeed recognize that to we inadequate idea the time often seem out of joint but we need not with hamlet cry out on a impossible spite for when once it be heartily and loyally realize that not we partial liking but the eternal harmony of the whole be the glory of god we already anticipate the peace of absorption in the infinite -lrb- sidenote : love -rrb- nor be this moral ideal without a sacred passion at least to ordinary man though it must be confess that spinoza in the stillness of he sacred peace ignore the word but he still hold that the larger we view of the universe and of we communion therewith the more we have of god in we and the more do we realize a intellectual love towards he that this in he case be no barren sentiment but a genuine moral inspiration be prove by he life for truly he endure as see he who be invisible and it be not by faculty wholly want to smaller man that he do this for though he intellect be in some respects almost beyond compare it be rather by he self-subordinating contemplation that he be keep at peace indeed he know far less of the extended universe than we man of science do and he doctrine of mind and thought be by indisputable authority regard as imperfect but imagine what god must be could we have a adequate idea not only of he be -- which spinoza think he have -- but of he infinite attribute and they mode -- which spinoza recognize that he have not -- he declare that love toward god be the very highest good and it be supremely bless in this that it could engender no jealousy nor selfishness nor sectarian zeal but rather a large-hearted charity which would gather all mankind into the present heaven of that love footnote : -lrb- footnote 15 : it be not within the scope of the present essay to give a life of barach -lrb- or benedict -rrb- de spinoza but for the sake of those to whom the work of sir frederick pollock be not easily accessible the follow particulars may be give spinoza be bear in amsterdam November 1632 of a fairly prosperous jewish family originally from portugal he receive thorough instruction in the language and literature of the hebrew and in addition become a good latin scholar so far as to write and correspond in that language he be early interested in philosophy and especially attract for a time by the writings of descarte by the time he be twenty-three year old he be suspect of heresy and in he twenty-fourth year -lrb- 1655 -rrb- be cut off from the synagogue with a frightful curse he family disown he and for he maintenance he turn to the polishing of lens a trade already learn in accordance with the jewish custom that every boy must have a handicraft what he earn would hardly be consider a living wage in these day but accord to colerus he first biographer who enquire of the householder with whom spinoza lodge he day 's maintenance of often cost no more than 4-1\/2 _ d _ various incident prove he total indifference to money except as far as need to provide thing honest in the sight of all man though of a amiable and sociable disposition he live a solitary life while not indispose to kindly talk with he humbler neighbor he have some of the greatest scholar of the day among he correspondent he publish but little during he life leave he greatest work as a legacy to the world on he early death at the hague from consumption in 1677 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 16 : it be to be observe that inasmuch as attribute be define by reference to intellect and think itself be a attribute think appear to be in a manner count twice over -- _ spinoza : he life and philosophy _ by sir frederick pollock second edition 1899 p 153 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 17 : it be of course true that spinoza consider himself to have a clear and adequate conception of god but by this he mean only that as a philosopher he have a intuitive certainty of eternal and infinite be so have all of we humbler mortal though we should not have be able to express it for ourselves no one suppose that for a indefinite space of time or eternity there be nothing and then suddenly there be something but if not then everyone recognize with spinoza the fact of eternal be though of course he see what this recognition mean as the many do not but when it come to the fact of mortal imperfection and ignorance spinoza with he theory of inadequate idea be as ready as spencer to acknowledge the unknowable -rrb- -lrb- footnote 18 : i do not think it necessary in a essay of this kind to discuss spinoza 's theory of the body as object of the mind and the mind as idea of the body both be different aspect of the same thing -rrb- -lrb- footnote 19 : rei alicujus singularis actu existentis the word divine do not occur in prop xi ethice ii from which i quote but it be imply because the mind be only a mode or modification of the infinite attribute of thought which again express the eternal substance in god i venture a doubt whether actually exist though adopt by such authority as sir f pollock give with any distinctness spinoza 's meaning i may be wrong but i suspect that one of the later use of actus as quote in ducange affect spinoza 's latinity thus several ecclesiastical writer be quote as use the word in the sense of office or function surely this would suit spinoza 's definition of the mind for he treat it as a center of phenomenal activity amidst the infinite mode of the divine attribute its apparent individuality be a consequence of its spontaneity as a center of action -- always understand that the spontaneity be consistent with the absolute eternal order assume throughout the work -rrb- -lrb- footnote 20 : of course the professor of optics can tell we how many vibration in a second go to produce the particular shade of color but these can not by any means be identify with conscious perception and it be with this only that we be concerned -rrb- -lrb- footnote 21 : ethice par ii prop xi corollarium hence it follow that the human mind be part of the infinite intellect -lrb- thought -rrb- of god and accordingly when we say that the human mind perceive this or that we only say that god -- not in he infinity but so far as he be express by the nature of the human mind or so far as he constitute the essence of the human mind -- have this or that idea and when we say that god have this or that idea not only so far as he constitute the nature of the human mind but so far as he have the idea also of some other thing together with the human mind then we say that the human mind perceive the thing in part or inadequately eg all race have naturally suppose earthquake and storm battle murder and sudden death to present idea identical in the mind of they god and of themselves but spinoza 's suggestion as i interpret it be that the true god have the idea of such thing not only so far as he constitute the human mind but as he include the idea of some correlate thing to we inconceivable we idea be therefore inadequate -rrb- afterword -lrb- sidenote : spinoza 's apparent failure -rrb- -lrb- sidenote : power of ecclesiasticism -rrb- -lrb- sidenote : identification of moral interest with conventional belief -rrb- notwithstanding the admiration and even reverence with which spinoza be regard by a few scholar during he life-time it can not be say that during the century follow he death in 1677 there be any wide acceptance of he idea the time be not favourable for the political and social power of ecclesiasticism whether establish or unestablished compel man of science and philosopher to treat dominant creed as consecrated ground on which ordinary method of research reasoning or criticism could not be pursue in say this i be far from accuse those illustrious man of insincerity some few of they indeed use a sort of cryptic satire to excuse to themselves a unwilling conformity but for the most part the moral pressure of tradition and education compel enlighten man to identify the doctrine of a personal god creation fall redemption and immortality with moral interest vitally essential to human welfare under such circumstance a prudent conservatism be inevitable -lrb- sidenote : gradual spread of spinoza 's influence -rrb- -lrb- sidenote : fichte -rrb- -lrb- sidenote : hegel -rrb- yet notwithstanding these restrain influence the thought breathe forth by the lonely thinker be as live seed waft abroad and fall here and there on good ground germinate and bring forth fruit sometimes he influence be acknowledge sometimes it be repudiate but it be there nevertheless it be doubtful whether fichte 's idealism could have take the form it do have not spinoza precede he hegel set out on he great intellectual career with a resolve to defend the faith once deliver to the saint yet trace its root to a philosophy of be which at any rate look very like pantheism this be perhaps delicate ground to tread for if one be ask whether one understand hegel one be tempt to answer like the pious scotch lady when she friend enquire whether she have understand the minister 's sermon hech sir d'ye think i would presume still not my own reading of he only but mr haldane 's profoundly interesting interpretation give in he _ gifford lecture _ make the impression that hegel 's eternal process be always a projection of subject as object and re-integration of the two and this go on not only on the infinite but on the finite scale amidst the infinite number of process which constitute the whole of be but this seem to leave no room for creation out of nothing and it be to that extent pantheistic there be doubtless saving interpretation but it be difficult to follow they and they can not cancel the initial postulate of one eternal process consist in the relation of infinite subject object and reunion on such a system i do not see how there can be anything but god and therefore notwithstanding he aversion to the name count hegel a pantheist -lrb- sidenote : goethe and wordsworth -rrb- goethe and wordsworth in many inspired passage of they poetry echo the faith of spinoza wordsworth of course in the reaction from he first expectation of the new order that he hope to see arise out of the french revolution be incline to magnify the importance of established religious ceremony and creed but we can not suppose that he ever repent of he reverence for nature as a divine revelation and we may believe that he continue to regard he practically pantheistic vision as a insight into the eternal reality from which the detailed scheme of orthodox theology be project -lrb- sidenote : schleiermacher -rrb- that schleiermacher be much indebted to spinoza be abundantly evident from he own word he speak of the holy repudiate spinoza he declare that the high world-spirit penetrate he the infinite be he beginning and he end the universe he only and eternal love in holy innocence and lowliness he mirror himself in the eternal world and see himself as its most love-worthy image he be full of religion and of the holy spirit and therefore he stand alone and unreachable master in he art above the profane multitude without disciple and without citizenship -lrb- 22 -rrb- -lrb- sidenote : anglican broad churchman -rrb- come down to anglican broad churchman it would scarcely be fair to quote isolate utterance as proof of they pantheism and yet when frederick robertson ask what be this world itself but the form of deity whereby the manifoldness and beauty of he mind manifest itself and still farther when he quote with approval channing 's word that perhaps matter be but a mode of think the most earnest pantheist would hardly desire more for the conception of the universe involve must surely exclude the real be or even the real existence of anything but god matthew arnold never commit himself to pantheism nor indeed to any other theory of the universe for he delicate humor and lambent satire always have in view simply the practical object of clear a plain way for the good life through the aberglaube of theology he description of god as the power not ourselves which make for righteousness might seem in fact the negation of pantheism because if god be not ourselves there be something other than god but the man who deliberately justify the loose phraseology of the bible about infinite be by the plea that it be language throw out at a object infinitely transcend linguistic expression ought not himself to be pin to the implication logically deducible from he own word throw out at the same transcendant object and though matthew arnold be too literary to be a pantheist that be though he think more of form of expression than of ultimate reality he satirical disintegration of the creed wherever it be effective make pantheism the only religious alternative so-called secular and godless alternative may be offer but they incongruity with the whole evolution of humanity from prehistoric animism to the higher pantheism will make they doom short and sure -lrb- sidenote : why pantheism as a religion be call modern -rrb- in the earlier part of this essay i make the remark that pantheism as a religion be almost entirely modern the context however clearly show what be mean for several page have be occupy with indication of the idea and teaching of individual pantheist from xenophane to spinoza but we do not usually take much note of a religion that be confine to one or two man in a age if it die out we treat it merely as a curiosity or a intellectual puzzle like the dream of jacob boehme or the atheistic ecclesiasticism of comte but if it afterwards show symptom of unexpected adaptation to the mental and moral condition of a newer world and if on account of this adaptation it gain a hold on man who be neither philosopher nor metaphysician but only religious it demand we consideration on far other grounds than those of intellectual curiosity -lrb- sidenote : pantheistic tendency of contemporary thought -rrb- now it have only be during the second half of the last century that pantheism have be able to claim attention as a religion in such a sense as this as to the fact there can hardly be any dispute for not only have it become ever a more prominent motive in the music of the poet and not only be all rationalization of christianity more or less transparent disguise of pantheism but i may safely appeal to those ordinary member of intelligent society who be neither poet nor divine nor philosopher whether the freest and most confidential interchange of religious thought do not continually verge on a faith which merge everything in god -lrb- sidenote : cause by the mutual pressure of science and faith -rrb- -lrb- sidenote : the nebular hypothesis take alone involve absurdity -rrb- nor be the reason of this tendency far to seek indeed they be palpable and conspicuous in the mutual pressure of science and faith for on the one hand science have make unthinkable the old-world conception of a three-storeyed universe construct by a artificer god who suddenly awake from a eternity of idleness to make heaven earth and hell -- a conception involve a king of king enthrone like a eastern monarch and send forth he minister spirit or appoint he angel deputy to direct and govern at he beck or if it be say that never except in the age of primeval simplicity or amongst later generation live under primeval condition have such a conception be entertain it would be difficult for the broadest churchman to say what have be put in its place it be vain to remind we how later christianity have patronise nebular hypothesis and the doctrine of evolution for these give no definite substitute whatever for the old story that elohim speak and it be do -- he command and it stand fast whence the fiery mist by the rotation and cooling of which the world be slowly evolve we be tell that the same process be go on now within the ken of astronomer but do any one suppose that in those realm of space god be evoke something out of nothing or say be and there be no we be assure that these fiery mist be form by the collision of misguided orb and we be even ask -- or at least we _ be _ ask -- to believe that this process must go on until all system be agglomerate in one orb to be ultimately congeal into stone what then be the office of the creator accord to this scheme as repulsive as it be absurd it would appear that at some moment in a vacuous eternity he call matter out of nothing whirl it into fiery vortex and then let it cool down to the absolute zero wherein death reign for ever -lrb- sidenote : the protest of faith -rrb- -lrb- sidenote : sustain by latest science -rrb- -lrb- sidenote : which suggest a infinite unity -rrb- but after all there be a spirit in man and the inspiration of the almighty of the eternal of the glorious whole to which we belong stir in we a protest against this blasphemy of ignorance ignorance i say for it be not the knowledge of we wise man that whisper such thing but they sense of the vacuity beyond they knowledge up to certain bound they grasp of fact they insight into physical order they mathematical skill be beyond all praise but beyond that bind aye and within it in every inconceivable mode of the action of force as for example in gravitation brood the unknowable and it be not they knowledge but they ignorance that entail absurd issue already there be sign that even celestial physics and mathematics will refuse to endorse as final so revolt a scheme of material evolution and devolution end only in universal death -lrb- 23 -rrb- and when once the re-birth of new order out of the old be see to be everywhere and eternally take place then all the hint give we by science of the ultimate oneness of all thing converge in the faith that all be god and god be all for certainly the latest observation on matter suggest that all form of it be variation of one ultimate substance and the convertibility of force as well as the conservation of force point to one eternal energy nor be the duality thus suggest any final conclusion for few i imagine would now contend that in the last result matter and force be fundamentally different thing in fact monism hold the field and though the evolution of human opinion be very slow it appear safe to predict that the triumph of that world theory be assure -lrb- sidenote : idea of creation incongruous with modern knowledge -rrb- this result be additionally secure by the increase incongruity feel between the immeasurable vastness of the universe even as know and the idea of creation out of nothing when the almighty could be seriously picture as construct chamber for himself and he heavenly host above the middle floor of earth for the child of man and the abyss for ghost and devil the notion that he word evoke that puny structure from nothing might be invest by poet and prophet with a certain grandeur each part of the work have a object as conceivable as that of each floor in a house and accord to petty human notion of utility nothing be waste but now when we astronomer confront we with countless million of orb to whose extension in space no bind can be prove while some of they tell we that the whole immensity be a desert of alternate fire and darkness with no spark of finite intellect except in we tiny earth some of we at least can not help feeling that the notion of a personal divine worker call this huge enigma out of blank eternal nothing be enormously and utterly incongruous both with reverence and common sense and if the pantheist in these day be ask what interpretation then do you propose he answer be i propose none i take thing as they be in they totality they be unknowable as indeed even science find they be in they infinitesimal part but we need not on this account lose the divinity that shape we end -lrb- sidenote : pantheistic morality -rrb- -lrb- sidenote : the law of the whole -rrb- for between the infinite and the infinitesimal the human experience realize itself in surroundings which when observe and reflect on make the impression of order relation of part by a necessity of we finite and individual existence as centre of action -- a necessity of which we can give no account -- we present those relation to ourselves in form of time and space then when we experience be large enough and ripe enough be enriched and stimulate by the stored-up experience of humanity as record in tradition custom bible and epic we attain to the moral sense and realize that we be bind to be loyal to something greater than self that greater may be the tribe the nation humanity or god but in far the larger number of case in which this sense of willing loyalty be arouse its cause be the appeal to we of some whole of which we form a part certainly this be so with the patriot and the philanthropist indeed it would be difficult or impossible to find any human relationship from the family upward through the wider circle of school club municipality nationality in which this sense of loyalty or devotion to the law of the whole be not the best incentive to devotion -lrb- sidenote : of that law of the whole loyalty to god in the supreme application -rrb- yet when we come to contemplate the final and supreme object of devotion the eternal himself it have be almost the universal custom to make a surprising exception and to regard religion as maintainable only by recognition of a tremendous outward authority to which only such loyalty be possible as in barbarous time be foster towards a personal chieftain or feudal king now pantheism hold this to be a error and regard obedience and devotion to god as the ultimate and most inspiring application of that principle of the loyalty of the part to the whole which run through all morality -lrb- sidenote : conclusion -rrb- why should we be suppose to be without god because we acknowledge he to be superpersonal and past find out or why should we be suspect of deny the divinity of evolution because we do not believe the eternal all to be subject to it this instinct of loyalty in the sense of self-subordination to any greater whole of which we be part the distinction of right and wrong thence arise and the aspiration after a moral ideal be not of man 's invention speaking as we can not help do in term of time i hold that the germ of this higher creature-life be always in the divine unity out of which man be evolve and in pursue the inspiration of that higher life as experience suggest they humanity have always have a guide and a savior in the living god of whom the race life-time of man be a infinitesimal phase in such a interpretation of man 's relation to god there be nothing necessarily hostile to any form of genuine religion -lrb- 24 -rrb- true there be in the creed many statement which we can not accept in the letter but there be few which have not some spiritual suggestion for we and if we can attain to that intellectual love of god in which spinoza be absorb we have no quarrel with any mode of sincere devotion pious catholic protestant vedantist mohammedan -- all by the implicit though unrecognised necessity of they faith worship the same god as ourselves but the wrangle of sectarian zeal no longer concern we : for we
