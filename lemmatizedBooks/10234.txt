plantation posson jone ' jean-ah poquelin ` tite poulette ` sieur george madame délicieuse madame delphine chapter i a old house a few step from the st charle hotel in new orlean bring you to and across canal street the central avenue of the city and to that corner where the flower-women sit at the inner and outer edge of the arcaded sidewalk and make the air sweet with they fragrant merchandise the crowd -- and if it be near the time of the carnival it will be great -- will follow canal street but you turn instead into the quiet narrow way which a lover of creole antiquity in fondness for a romantic past be still prone to call the rue royale you will pass a few restaurant a few auction-room a few furniture warehouse and will hardly realize that you have leave behind you the activity and clatter of a city of merchant before you find yourself in a region of architectural decrepitude where a ancient and foreign-seeming domestic life in second story overhang the ruin of a former commercial prosperity and upon every thing have settle down a long sabbath of decay the vehicle in the street be few in number and be merely pass through the store be shrunken into shop you see here and there like a patch of bright mould the stall of that significant fungus the chinaman many great door be shut and clamp and grow gray with cobweb many street window be nail up half the balcony be begrime and rust-eaten and many of the humid arch and alley which characterize the older franco-spanish pile of stuccoed brick betray a squalor almost oriental yet beauty linger here to say nothing of the picturesque sometimes you get sight of comfort sometimes of opulence through the unlatched wicket in some _ porte-cochère _ -- red-painted brick pavement foliage of dark palm or pale banana marble or granite masonry and bloom parterre or through a chink between some pair of heavy batten window-shutter open with a almost reptile wariness you eye get a glimpse of lace and brocade upholstery silver and bronze and much similar rich antiquity the face of the inmate be in keep of the passenger in the street a sad proportion be dingy and shabby but just when these be put you off you guard there will pass you a woman -- more likely two or three -- of patrician beauty now if you will go far enough down this old street you will see as you approach its intersection with -- name in that region elude one like ghost however as you begin to find the way a trifle more open you will not fail to notice on the right-hand side about midway of the square a small low brick house of a story and a half set out upon the sidewalk as weather-beaten and mute as a aged beggar fall asleep its corrugated roof of dull red tile slope down toward you with a inward curve be overgrow with weed and in the fall of the year be gay with the yellow plume of the golden-rod you can almost touch with you cane the low edge of the broad overhang eave the batten shutter at door and window with hinge like those of a postern be shut with a grip that make one 's knuckle and nail feel lacerated save in the brick-work itself there be not a cranny you would say the house have the lockjaw there be two door and to each a single chip and batter marble step continue on down the sidewalk on a line with the house be a garden mask from view by a high close board-fence you may see the top of its fruit-tree -- pomegranate peach banana fig pear and particularly one large orange close by the fence that must be very old the resident over the narrow way who live in a three-story house originally of much pretension but from whose front door hard time have remove almost all vestige of paint will tell you : yass de ` ouse be in ` abit ` tis live in and this be likely to be all the information you get -- not that they would not tell but they can not grasp the idea that you wish to know -- until possibly just as you be turn to depart you informant in a single word and with the most evident non-appreciation of its value drop the simple key to the whole matter : dey 's quadroon he may then be arouse to mention the better appearance of the place in former year when the house of this region generally stand farther apart and that garden comprise the whole square here dwell sixty year ago and more one delphine carraze or as she be commonly designate by the few who know she madame delphine that she own she home and that it have be give she by the then deceased companion of she day of beauty be fact so generally admit as to be even as far back as that sixty year ago no longer a subject of gossip she be never point out by the denizen of the quarter as a character nor she house as a feature it would have pass all creole power of guess to divine what you could find worthy of inquiry concern a retired quadroon woman and not the least puzzle of all would have be the timid and restive madame delphine herself chapter ii madame delphine during the first quarter of the present century the free quadroon caste of new orlean be in its golden age earlier generation -- spring upon the one hand from the merry gallant of a french colonial military service which have grow gross by affiliation with spanish-american frontier life and upon the other hand from comely ethiopian cull out of the less negroidal type of african live goods and buy at the ship 's side with vestige of quill and cowrie and copper wire still in they head-dress -- these earlier generation with scar of battle or private rencontre still on the father and of servitude on the manumitted mother afford a mere hint of the splendor that be to result from a survival of the fairest through seventy-five year devote to the elimination of the black pigment and the cultivation of hyperian excellence and nymphean grace and beauty nor if we turn to the present be the evidence much stronger which be offer by the _ gen de couleur _ whom you may see in the quadroon quarter this afternoon with ichabod legible on they murky forehead through a vain smearing of toilet powder drag they chair down to the narrow gateway of they close-fenced garden and stare shrinkingly at you as you pass like a nest of yellow kitten but as the present century be in its second and third decade the _ quadroone _ -lrb- for we must contrive a feminine spelling to define the strict limit of the caste as then establish -rrb- come forth in splendor old traveller spare no term to tell they praise they faultlessness of feature they perfection of form they varied style of beauty -- for there be even pure caucasian blonde among they -- they fascinating manners they sparkling vivacity they chaste and pretty wit they grace in the dance they modest propriety they taste and elegance in dress in the gentlest and most poetic sense they be indeed the siren of this land where it seem always afternoon -- a momentary triumph of a arcadian over a christian civilization so beautiful and so seductive that it become the subject of special chapter by writer of the day more original than correct as social philosopher the ball that be get up for they by the male _ sang-pur _ be to that day what the carnival be to the present society ball give the same night prove failure through the coincidence the magnate of government -- municipal state federal -- those of the army of the learn profession and of the club -- in short the white male aristocracy in every thing save the ecclesiastical desk -- be there ticket be high-priced to insure the exclusion of the vulgar no distinguished stranger be allow to miss they they be beautiful they be clothe in silken extenuation from the throat to the foot and wear withal a pathos in they charm that give they a family likeness to innocence madame delphine be you not a stranger could have tell you all about it though hardly i suppose without tear but at the time of which we would speak -lrb- 1821-22 -rrb- she day of splendor be set and she husband -- let we call he so for she sake -- be long dead he be a american and if we take she word for it a man of noble heart and extremely handsome but this be knowledge which we can do without even in those day the house be always shut and madame delphine 's chief occupation and end in life seem to be to keep well lock up in-door she be a excellent person the neighbor say -- a very worthy person and they be maybe nearer correct then they know they rarely see she save when she go to or return from church a small rather tired-looking dark quadroone of very good feature and a gentle thoughtfulness of expression which would take long to describe : call it a widow 's look in speaking of madame delphine 's house mention should have be make of a gate in the fence on the royal-street sidewalk it be go now and be out of use then be fasten once for all by a iron staple clasp the cross-bar and drive into the post which lead we to speak of another person chapter iii capitaine lemaitre he be one of those man that might be any age -- thirty forty forty-five there be no tell from he face what be year and what be only weather he countenance be of a grave and quiet but also luminous sort which be instantly admire and ever afterward remember as be also the fineness of he hair and the blueness of he eye those pronounce he youngest who scrutinize he face the closest but waive the discussion of age he be odd though not with the oddness that he who have rear he have strive to produce he have not be bring up by mother or father he have lose both in infancy and have fall to the care of a rugged old military grandpa of the colonial school whose unceasing endeavor have be to make he boy as savage and ferocious a holder of unimpeachable social rank as it become a pure-blooded french creole to be who would trace he pedigree back to the god mar remember my boy be the adjuration receive by he as regularly as he wake cup of black coffee that none of you family line ever keep the law of any government or creed and if it be well that he should bear this in mind it be well to reiterate it persistently for from the nurse 's arm the boy wear a look not of docility so much as of gentle _ judicial _ benevolence the domestic of the old man 's house use to shed tear of laughter to see that look on the face of a babe he rude guardian address himself to the modification of this facial expression it have not enough of majesty in it for instance or of large dare-deviltry but with care these could be make to come and true enough at twenty-one -lrb- in ursin lemaitre -rrb- the labor of he grandfather be a apparent success he be not rugged nor be he loud-spoken as he venerable trainer would have like to present he to society but he be as serenely terrible as a well-aimed rifle and the old man look upon he result with pride he have cultivate he up to that pitch where he scorn to practice any vice or any virtue that do not include the principle of self-assertion a few touch only be want here and there to achieve perfection when suddenly the old man die yet it be he proud satisfaction before he finally lay down to see ursin a favored companion and the peer both in courtesy and pride of those polish gentleman famous in history the brother lafitte the two lafitte be at the time young lemaitre reach he majority -lrb- say 1808 or 1812 -rrb- only merchant-blacksmith so to speak a term intend to convey the idea of blacksmith who never soil they hand who be man of capital stand a little higher than the clergy and move in society among its autocrat but they be full of possibility man of action and man too of think with already a pronounced disbelief in the custom-house in these day of big carnival they would have be patent as the duke of little manchac and baratarium young ursin lemaitre -lrb- in full the name be lemaitre-vignevielle -rrb- have not only the hearty friendship of these good people but also a natural turn for account and as he two friend be look about they with a enterprising eye it easily result that he presently connect himself with the blacksmithing profession not exactly at the forge in the lafitte ' famous smithy among the african samson who with they shine black body bare to the waist make the rue st pierre ring with the stroke of they hammer but as a -- there be no occasion to mince the word in those day -- smuggler smuggler -- patriot -- where be the difference beyond the ken of a community to which the enforcement of the revenue law have long be merely so much out of every man 's pocket and dish into the all-devouring treasury of spain at this date they have come under a kinder yoke and to a treasury that at least echo when the custom be drop into it but the change be still new what could a man be more than capitaine lemaitre be -- the soul of honor the pink of courtesy with the courage of the lion and the magnanimity of the elephant frank -- the very exchequer of truth nay go higher still : he paper be good in toulouse street to the gossip in the gaming-club he be the culminate proof that smuggling be one of the sublimer virtue year go by event transpire which have they place in history under a government which the community by and by saw be conduct in they interest smuggling begin to lose its respectability and to grow disreputable hazardous and debased in certain onslaught make upon they by officer of the law some of the smuggler become murderer the business become unprofitable for a time until the enterprising lafitte -- thinker -- bethought they of a corrective -- privateer thereupon the united state government set a price upon they head later yet it become know that these outlaw pirate have be offer money and rank by great britain if they would join she standard then hover about the water-approach to they native city and that they have spurn the bribe wherefore they head be rule out of the market and meeting and treat with andrew jackson they be receive as lover of they country and as compatriot fight in the battle of new orlean at the head of they fearless man and -- here tradition take up the tale -- be never see afterward capitaine lemaitre be not among the kill or wound but he be among the miss chapter iv three friend the roundest and happiest-looking priest in the city of new orlean be a little man fondly know among he people as père jerome he be a creole and a member of one of the city 's lead family he dwelling be a little frame cottage standing on high pillar just inside a tall close fence and reach by a narrow out-door stair from the green batten gate it be well surround by crape myrtle and communicate behind by a descend stair and a plank-walk with the rear entrance of the chapel over whose worshipper he daily spread he hand in benediction the name of the street -- ah there be where light be want save the cathedral and the ursuline there be very little of record concern church at that time though they be spring up here and there all there be certainty of be that père jerome 's frame chapel be some little new-born down-town thing that may have survive the passage of year or may have escape paxton 's directory so as by fire he parlor be dingy and carpetless one could smell distinctly there the vow of poverty he bed-chamber be bare and clean and the bed in it narrow and hard but between the two be a dining-room that would tempt a laugh to the lip of any who look in the table be small but stout and all the furniture of the room substantial make of fine wood and carve just enough to give the notion of wrinkle pleasantry he mother 's and sister 's do père jerome would explain they would not permit this apartment -- or department -- to suffer therein as well as in the parlor there be odor but of a more epicurean sort that explain interestingly the père jerome 's rotundity and rosy smile in this room and about this miniature round table use sometimes to sit with père jerome two friend to whom he be deeply attach -- one evariste varrillat a playmate from early childhood now he brother in-law the other jean thompson a companion from youngest manhood and both like the little priest himself the regretful rememberer of a fourth comrade who be a comrade no more like père jerome they have come through year to the thick of life 's conflict -- the priest 's brother-in-law a physician the other a attorney and brother-in-law to the lonely wanderer -- yet they love to huddle around this small board and be boy again in heart while man in mind neither one nor another be leader in earlier day they have always yield to he who no longer meet with they a certain chieftainship and they still think of he and talk of he and in they conjecture grope after he as one of whom they continue to expect greater thing than of themselves they sit one day draw thus close together sip and theorize speculate upon the nature of thing in a easy bold sophomoric way the conversation for the most part be in french the native tongue of the doctor and priest and speak with facility by jean thompson the lawyer who be half américain but run sometimes into english and sometimes into mild laughter mention have be make of the absentee père jerome advance a idea something like this : it be impossible for any finite mind to fix the degree of criminality of any human act or of any human life the infinite one alone can know how much of we sin be chargeable to we and how much to we brother or we father we all participate in one another 's sin there be a community of responsibility attach to every misdeed no human since adam -- nay nor adam himself -- ever sin entirely to himself and so i never be call upon to contemplate a crime or a criminal but i feel my conscience point at I as one of the accessory in a word say evariste varrillat the physician you think we be partly to blame for the omission of many of you paternoster eh father jerome smile no a man can not plead so in he own defense we first father try that but the plea be not allow but now there be we absent friend i tell you truly this whole community ought to be recognize as partner in he moral error among another people rear under wiser care and with better companion how different might he not have be how can we speak of he as a law-breaker who might have save he from that name here the speaker turn to jean thompson and change he speech to english a lady sez to I to-day : ` père jerome ` ow dat be a dreadfool dat ' e go at de coas ' of cuba to be one corsair be not it ' ` ah madame ' i sez '' tis a terrible i ` ope de good god will fo ` give I a ' you fo ' dat ' jean thompson answer quickly : you should not have let she say that _ mai _ fo ' w ' y why because if you be partly responsible you ought so much the more to do what you can to shield he reputation you should have say -- the attorney change to french -- ` he be no pirate he have merely take out letter of marque and reprisal under the flag of the republic of carthagena ' _ ah bah _ exclaim doctor varrillat and both he and he brother-in-law the priest laugh why not demand thompson oh say the physician with a shrug say id thad way iv you wand then suddenly become serious he be about to add something else when père jerome speak i will tell you what i could have say i could have say : ` madame yes ` tis a terrible fo ' he he stum ` le in de dark but dat good god will mek it a _ mo ' terrible fo ' _ dat man oohever he be w ` at put ` at light out ' but how do you know he be a pirate demand thompson aggressively how do we know say the little priest return to french ah there be no other explanation of the ninety-and-nine story that come to we from every port where ship arrive from the north coast of cuba of a commander of pirate there who be a marvel of courtesy and gentility -- -lrb- 1 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 1 : see gazette of the period -rrb- and whose name be lafitte say the obstinate attorney and who nevertheless be not lafitte insist père jerome daz troo jean say doctor varrillat we hall know daz troo père jerome lean forward over the board and speak with a air of secrecy in french you have hear of the ship which come into port here last Monday you have hear that she be board by pirate and that the captain of the ship himself drive they off a incredible story say thompson but not so incredible as the truth i have it from a passenger there be on the ship a young girl who be very beautiful she come on deck where the corsair stand about to issue he order and more beautiful than ever in the desperation of the moment confront he with a small missal spread open and she finger on the apostle ' creed command he to read he read it uncover he head as he read then stand gaze on she face which do not quail and then with a low bow say : ` give I this book and i will do you bidding ' she give he the book and bid he leave the ship and he leave it unmolested père jerome look from the physician to the attorney and back again once or twice with he dimpled smile but he speak english they say say jean thompson he have no doubt learn it since he leave we say the priest but this ship-master too say he man call he lafitte lafitte no do you not see it be you brother-in-law jean thompson it be you wife 's brother not lafitte but -lrb- softly -rrb- lemaitre lemaitre capitaine ursin lemaitre the two guest look at each other with a grow drollery on either face and presently break into a laugh ah say the doctor as the three rise up you juz kip dad cog-an ' - bull fo ' yo ' neg summon père jerome 's eye light up -- i goin ' to do it i tell you say evariste turn upon he with sudden gravity iv dad be troo i tell you w ` ad be sure-sure ursin lemaitre din kyare nut 'n fo ' doze creed _ he fall in love _ then with a smile turn to jean thompson and back again to père jerome : but anny'ow you tell it in dad summon dad ' e hyare fo ' dad creed père jerome sit up late that night write a letter the remarkable effect upon a certain mind effect which we shall presently find he attribute solely to the influence of surround nature may find for some a more sufficient explanation in the fact that this letter be but one of a series and that in the rover of doubt identity and incredible eccentricity père jerome have a regular correspondent chapter v the cap fit about two month after the conversation just give and therefore somewhere about the christmas holiday of the year 1821 père jerome delight the congregation of he little chapel with the announcement that he have appoint to preach a sermon in french on the follow sabbath -- not there but in the cathedral he be much beloved notwithstanding that among the clergy there be two or three who shake they head and raise they eyebrow and say he would be at least as orthodox if he do not make quite so much of the bible and quite so little of the dogma yet the common people hear he gladly when tell one day of the unfavorable whisper he smile a little and answer he informant -- whom he know to be one of the whisperer himself -- lay a hand kindly upon he shoulder : father murphy -- or whatever the name be -- you word comfort I how be that because -- _ ` voe quum benedixerint mihi homine ' _ -lrb- 1 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 1 : woe unto I when all man speak well of I -rrb- the appoint morning when it come be one of those exquisite day in which there be such a universal harmony that worship rise from the heart like a spring truly say père jerome to the companion who be to assist he in the mass this be a sabbath day which we do not have to make holy but only to _ keep _ so maybe it be one of the secret of père jerome 's success as a preacher that he take more think as to how he should feel than as to what he should say the cathedral of those day be call a very plain old pile boast neither beauty nor riches but to père jerome it be very lovely and before its homely altar not homely to he in the performance of those solemn office symbol of heaven 's mightiest truth in the hearing of the organ 's harmony and the yet more elegant interunion of human voice in the choir in overlook the worship throng which kneel under the soft chromatic light and in breathe the sacrificial odor of the chancel he find a deep and solemn joy and yet i guess the finest thought of he the while be one that come thrice and again : be not deceive père jerome because saintliness of feeling be easy here you be the same priest who oversleep this morning and over-ate yesterday and will in some way easily go wrong to-morrow and the day after he take it with he when -- the _ venus creator _ sing -- he go into the pulpit of the sermon he preach tradition have preserve for we only a few brief saying but they be strong and sweet my friend he say -- this be near the beginning -- the angry word of god 's book be very merciful -- they be mean to drive we home but the tender word my friend they be sometimes terrible notice these the tenderest word of the tenderest prayer that ever come from the lip of a bless martyr -- the die word of the holy saint stephen ` lord lay not this sin to they charge ' be there nothing dreadful in that read it thus : ` lord lay not this sin to they charge ' not to the charge of they who stone he to whose charge then go ask the holy saint paul three year afterward pray in the temple at jerusalem he answer that question : ' i stand by and consent ' he answer for himself only but the day must come when all that wicked council that send saint stephen away to be stone and all that city of jerusalem must hold up the hand and say : ` we also lord -- we stand by ' ah friend under the simpler meaning of that die saint 's prayer for the pardon of he murderer be hide the terrible truth that we all have a share in one another 's sin thus père jerome touch he key-note all that time have spare we beside may be give in a few sentence ah he cry once if it be merely my own sin that i have to answer for i might hold up my head before the rest of mankind but no no my friend -- we can not look each other in the face for each have help the other to sin oh where be there any room in this world of common disgrace for pride even if we have no common hope a common despair ought to bind we together and forever silence the voice of scorn and again this : even in the promise to noë not again to destroy the race with a flood there be a whisper of solemn warn the moral account of the antediluvian be close off and the balance bring down in the year of the deluge but the account of those who come after run on and on and the bless bow of promise itself warn we that god will not stop it till the judgment day o god i thank thee that that day must come at last when thou wilt destroy the world and stop the interest on my account it be about at this point that père jerome notice more particularly than he have do before sit among the worshipper near he a small sad-faced woman of please feature but dark and fade who give he profound attention with she be another in better dress seemingly a girl still in she teens though she face and neck be scrupulously conceal by a heavy veil and she hand which be small by glove quadroone think he with a stir of deep pity once as he utter some stir word he see the mother and daughter -lrb- if such they be -rrb- while they still bent they gaze upon he clasp each other 's hand fervently in the daughter 's lap it be at these word : my friend there be thousand of people in this city of new orlean to whom society give the ten commandment of god with all the _ not _ rub out ah good gentleman if god send the poor weakling to purgatory for leave the right path where ought some of you to go who strew it with thorn and brier the movement of the pair be only see because he watch for it he glance that way again as he say : o god be very gentle with those child who would be nearer heaven this day have they never have a father and mother but have get they religious training from such a sky and earth as we have in louisiana this holy morning ah my friend nature be a big-print catechism the mother and daughter lean a little farther forward and exchange the same spasmodic hand-pressure as before the mother 's eye be full of tear i once know a man continue the little priest glance to a side aisle where he have notice evariste and jean sit against each other who be carefully teach from infancy to manhood this single only principle of life : defiance not justice not righteousness not even gain but defiance : defiance to god defiance to man defiance to nature defiance to reason defiance and defiance and defiance he be go to tell it murmur evariste to jean this man continue père jerome become a smuggler and at last a pirate in the gulf of mexico lord lay not that sin to he charge alone but a strange thing follow be in command of man of a sort that to control require to be keep at the austerest distance he now find himself separate from the human world and throw into the solemn companionship with the sea with the air with the storm the calm the heaven by day the heaven by night my friend that be the first time in he life that he ever find himself in really good company now this man have a great aptness for account he have keep they -- have render they there be beauty to he in a correct balanced and close account a account unsatisfied be a deformity the result be plain that man look out night after night upon the grand and holy spectacle of the starry deep above and the watery deep below be sure to find himself sooner or later master by the conviction that the great author of this majestic creation keep account of it and one night there come to he like a spirit walk on the sea the awful silent question : ` my account with god -- how do it stand ' ah friend that be a question which the book of nature do not answer do i say the book of nature be a catechism yes but after it answer the first question with ` god ' nothing but question follow and so one day this man give a ship full of merchandise for one little book which answer those question god help he to understand it and god help you monsieur and you madame sit here in you _ smuggle clothes _ to beat upon the breast with I and cry ' i too lord -- i too stand by and consent ' père jerome have not intend these for he closing word but just there straight away before he sight and almost at the farthest door a man rise slowly from he seat and regard he steadily with a kind bronzed sedate face and the sermon as if by a sign of command be end while the credo be be chant he be still there but when a moment after its close the eye of père jerome return in that direction he place be empty as the little priest he labor do and he vestment change be turn into the rue royale and leave the cathedral out of sight he just have time to understand that two woman be purposely allow he to overtake they when the one nearer he speak in the creole _ patoi _ say with some timid haste : good-morning père -- père jerome père jerome we thank the good god for that sermon then so do i say the little man they be the same two that he have notice when he be preach the younger one bow silently she be a beautiful figure but the slight effort of père jerome 's kind eye to see through the veil be vain he would presently have pass on but the one who have speak before say : i think you live in the rue des ursulines yes but i be go this way to see a sick person the woman look up at he with a expression of mingled confidence and timidity it must be a bless thing to be so useful as to be need by the good god she say père jerome smile : god do not need I to look after he sick but he allow I to do it just as you let you little boy in frock carry in chip he might have add that he love to do it quite as much it be plain the woman have somewhat to ask and be try to get courage to ask it you have a little boy ask the priest no i have only my daughter she indicate the girl at she side then she begin to say something else stop and with much nervousness ask : père jerome what be the name of that man he name say the priest you wish to know he name yes monsieur -lrb- or _ miché _ as she speak it -rrb- it be such a beautiful story the speaker 's companion look another way he name say father jerome -- some say one name and some another some think it be jean lafitte the famous you have hear of he and do you go to my church madame -- no miché not in the past but from this time yes my name -- she choke a little and yet it evidently give she pleasure to offer this mark of confidence -- be madame delphine -- delphine carraze chapter vi a cry of distress père jerome 's smile and exclamation as some day later he enter he parlor in response to the announcement of a visitor be indicative of hearty greet rather than surprise madame delphine yet surprise could hardly have be altogether absent for though another Sunday have not yet come around the slim smallish figure sit in a corner look very much alone and clothe in dark attire which seem to have be wash a trifle too often be delphine carraze on she second visit and this he be confident be over and above a attendance in the confessional where he be sure he have recognize she voice she rise bashfully and give she hand then look to the floor and begin a falter speech with a swallow motion in the throat smile weakly and commence again speak as before in a gentle low note frequently lift up and cast down she eye while shadow of anxiety and smile of apology chase each other rapidly across she face she be try to ask he advice sit down say he and when they have take seat she resume with downcast eye : you know -- probably i should have say this in the confessional but -- no matter madame delphine i understand you do not want a oracle perhaps you want a friend she lift she eye shine with tear and drop they again i -- she cease i have do a -- she drop she head and shake it despondingly -- a cruel thing the tear roll from she eye as she turn away she face père jerome remain silent and presently she turn again with the evident intention of speak at length it begin nineteen year ago -- by -- she eye which she have lift fall lower than ever she brow and neck be suffuse with blush and she murmur -- i fall in love she say no more and by and by père jerome reply : well madame delphine to love be the right of every soul i believe in love if you love be pure and lawful i be sure you angel guardian smile upon you and if it be not i can not say you have nothing to answer for and yet i think god may have say ` she be a quadroone all the rights of she womanhood trample in the mire sin make easy to she -- almost compulsory -- charge it to account of whom it may concern ' no no say madame delphine look up quickly some of it might fall upon -- she eye fall and she commence bite she lip and nervously pinch little fold in she skirt he be good -- as good as the law would let he be -- better indeed for he leave I property which really the strict law do not allow he love we little daughter very much he write to he mother and sister own all he error and ask they to take the child and bring she up i send she to they when he die which be soon after and do not see my child for sixteen year but we write to each other all the time and she love I and then -- at last -- madame delphine cease speaking but go on diligently with she agitate finger turn down foolish hem lengthwise of she lap at last you mother-heart conquer say père jerome she nod the sister marry the mother die i see that even where she be she do not escape the reproach of she birth and blood and when she ask I to let she come -- the speaker 's brimming eye rise a instant i know it be wicked but -- i say come the tear drip through she hand upon she dress be it she who be with you last Sunday yes and now you do not know what to do with she _ ah c'est ça ouus _ -- that be it do she look like you madame delphine oh thank god no you would never believe she be my daughter she be white and beautiful you thank god for that which be you main difficulty madame delphine alas yes père jerome lay he palm tightly across he knee with he

vignevielle chapter viii she a quiet footstep a grave new presence on financial sidewalk a neat garb slightly out of date a gently strong and kindly pensive face a silent bow a new sign in the rue toulouse a lone figure with a cane walk in meditation in the evening light under the willow of canal marigny a long-darkened window re-lighted in the rue conti -- these be all a fall of dew would scarce have be more quiet than be the return of ursin lemaitre-vignevielle to the precinct of he birth and early life but we hardly give the event its right name it be capitaine lemaìtre who have disappear it be monsieur vignevielle who have come back the pleasure the haunt the companion that have once hold out they charm to the impetuous youth offer no enticement to madame delphine 's banker

charitable institution how do you know say monsieur vignevielle there the conversation cease why do you not find hospital and asylum at once ask the attorney at another time with a vex laugh and get the credit of it and make the end worse than the beginning ' say the banker with a gentle smile turn away to a desk of book bah muttered jean thompson monsieur vignevielle betray one very bad symptom wherever he go he seem look for somebody it may have be perceptible only to those who be sufficiently interested in he to study he movement but those who see it once see it always he never pass a open door or gate but he glance in and often where it stand but slightly ajar you might see he give it a gentle push with he hand or cane it be very singular he walk much alone after dark the _ gurchinango _ -lrb- garroter we might say -rrb- at those time the city 's particular terror by night never cross he path he be one of those man for whom danger appear to stand aside one beautiful summer night when all nature seem hush in ecstasy the last blush go that tell of the sun 's parting monsieur vignevielle in the course of one of those contemplative uncompanioned walk which it be he habit to take come slowly along the more open portion of the rue royale with a step which be soft without intention occasionally touch the end of he stout cane gently to the ground and look upward among he old acquaintance the star it be one of those southern night under whose spell all the sterner energy of the mind cloak themselves and lie down in bivouac and the fancy and the imagination that can not sleep slip they fetter and escape beckon away from behind every flowering bush and sweet-smelling tree and every stretch of lonely half-lighted walk by the genius of poetry the air stir softly now and then and be still again as if the breeze lift they expectant pinion and lower they once more await the rise of the moon in a silence which fall upon the field the road the garden the wall and the suburban and half-suburban street like a pause in worship and anon she rise monsieur vignevielle 's step be bent toward the more central part of the town and he be presently pass along a high close board-fence on the right hand side of the way when just within this enclosure and almost overhead in the dark bough of a large orange-tree a mocking-bird begin the first low flute-note of he all-night song it may have be only the nearness of the songster that attract the passer 's attention but he pause and look up and then he remark something more -- that the air where he have stop be fill with the overpowering sweetness of the night-jasmine he look around it could only be inside the fence there be a gate just there would he push it as he wont be the grass be grow about it in a thick turf as though the entrance have not be use for year a iron staple clasp the cross-bar and be drive deep into the gate-post but now a eye that have be in the blacksmithing business -- a eye which have later receive high training as a eye for fastening -- fall upon that staple and see at a glance that the wood have shrink from it and it have spring from its hold though without fall out the strange habit assert itself he lay he large hand upon the cross-bar the turf at the base yield and the tall gate be draw partly open at that moment as at the moment whenever he draw or push a door or gate or look in at a window he be think of one the image of whose face and form have never leave he inner vision since the day it have meet he in he life 's path and turn he face about from the way of destruction the bird cease the cause of the interruption standing within the opening see before he much obscure by its own numerous shadow a broad ill-kept many-flowered garden among whose untrimmed rose-tree and tangled vine and often also in its old walk of pound shell the coco-grass and crab-grass have spread riotously and sturdy weed stand up in bloom he step in and draw the gate to after he there very near by be the clump of jasmine whose ravishing odor have tempt he it stand just beyond a brightly moonlit path which turn from he in a curve toward the residence a little distance to the right and escape the view at a point where it seem more than likely a door of the house might open upon it while he still look there fall upon he ear from around that curve a light footstep on the broken shell -- one only and then all be for a moment still again have he mistake no the same soft click be repeat nearer by a pale glimpse of robe come through the tangle and then plainly to view appear a outline -- a presence -- a form -- a spirit -- a girl from throat to instep she be as white as cynthium something above the medium height slender lithe she abundant hair rolling in dark rich wave back from she brow and down from she crown and fall in two heavy plait beyond she round broadly girt waist and full to she knee a few escape lock eddy lightly on she graceful neck and she temple -- she arm half hide in a snowy mist of sleeve let down to guide she spotless skirt free from the dewy touch of the grass -- straight down the path she come will she stop will she turn aside will she espy the dark form in the deep shade of the orange and with one pierce scream wheel and vanish she draw near she approach the jasmine she raise she arm the sleeve fall like a vapor down to the shoulder rise upon tiptoe and pluck a spray o memory can it be _ can it be _ be this he quest or be it lunacy the ground seem to monsieur vignevielle the unsteady sea and he to stand once more on a deck and she as she be now if she but turn toward the orange the whole glory of the moon will shine upon she face he heart stand still he be wait for she to do that she reach up again this time a bunch for she mother that neck and throat now she fasten a spray in she hair the mockingbird can not withhold he break into song -- she turn -- she turn she face -- it be she it be she madame delphine 's daughter be the girl he meet on the ship chapter ix olive she be just pass seventeen -- that beautiful year when the heart of the maiden still beat quickly with the surprise of she new dominion while with gentle dignity she brow accept the holy coronation of womanhood the forehead and temple beneath she loosely bind hair be fair without paleness and meek without languor she have the soft lack-lustre beauty of the south no ruddiness of coral no waxen white no pink of shell no heavenly blue in the glance but a face that seem in all its other beauty only a tender accompaniment for the large brown melting eye where the openness of child-nature mingled dreamily with the sweet mystery of maiden thought we say no color of shell on face or throat but this be no deficiency that which take its place be the warm transparent tint of sculptured ivory this side doorway which lead from madame delphine 's house into she garden be over-arched partly by a old remnant of vine-covered lattice and partly by a crape-myrtle against whose small polished trunk lean a rustic seat here madame delphine and olive loved to sit when the twilight be balmy or the moon be bright _ chérie _ say madame delphine on one of those evening why do you dream so much she speak in the _ patois _ most natural to she and which she daughter have easily learn the girl turn she face to she mother and smile then drop she glance to the hand in she own lap which be listlessly handle the end of a ribbon the mother look at she with fond solicitude she dress be white again this be but one night since that in which monsieur vignevielle have see she at the bush of night-jasmine he have not be discover but have go away shut the gate and leave it as he have find it she head be uncover its plaited mass quite black in the moonlight hang down and coil upon the bench by she side she chaste drapery be of that revive classic order which the world of fashion be again lay aside to re-assume the medaeval bondage of the staylace for new orlean be behind the fashionable world and madame delphine and she daughter be behind new orlean a delicate scarf pale blue of lightly net worst fall from either shoulder down beside she hand the look that be bent upon she changed perforce to one of gentle admiration she seem the goddess of the garden olive glance up madame delphine be not prepare for the movement and on that account repeat she question : what be you think about the dreamer take the hand that be lay upon hers between she own palm bow she head and give they a soft kiss the mother submit wherefore in the silence which follow a daughter 's conscience feel the burden of have withhold a answer and olive presently say as the pair sit look up into the sky : i be think of père jerome 's sermon madame delphine have fear so olive have live on it ever since the day it be preach the poor mother be almost ready to repent have ever afford she the opportunity of hear it meat and drink have become of secondary value to she daughter she feed upon the sermon olive feel she mother 's thought and know that she mother know she own but now that she have confess she would ask a question : do you think _ maman _ that père jerome know it be i who give that missal no say madame delphine i be sure he do not another question come more timidly : do -- do you think he know _ he _ yes i do he say in he sermon he do both remain for a long time very still watch the moon glide in and through among the small dark-and-white cloud at last the daughter speak again i wish i be père -- i wish i be as good as père jerome my child say madame delphine she tone betray a painful summon of strength to say what she have lack the courage to utter -- my child i pray the good god you will not let you heart go after one whom you may never see in this world the maiden turn she glance and they eye meet she cast she arm about she mother 's neck lay she cheek upon it for a moment and then feel the maternal tear lift she lip and kiss she say : i will not i will not but the voice be one not of willing consent but of desperate resolution it would be useless anyhow say the mother lay she arm around she daughter 's waist olive repeat the kiss prolong it passionately i have nobody but you murmur the girl i be a poor quadroone she throw back she plaited hair for a third embrace when a sound in the shrubbery startle they _ qui ci pa _ call madame delphine in a frightened voice as the two stand up hold to each other no answer it be only the drop of a twig she whisper after a long holding of the breath but they go into the house and bar it everywhere it be no longer pleasant to sit up they retire and in course of time but not soon they fall asleep hold each other very tight and fear even in they dream to hear another twig fall chapter x bird monsieur vigneville look in at no more door or window but if the disappearance of this symptom be a favorable sign other come to notice which be especially bad -- for instance wakefulness at well-nigh any hour of the night the city guard which itself dare not patrol singly would meet he on he slow unmolested sky-gazing walk seem to enjoy it say jean thompson

day it be true monsieur vignevielle be at he post in he quiet bank yet here day by day he be the source of more and more vivid astonishment to those who hold preconceived notion of a banker 's call as

bird for olive -- the child 's appetite be so poor and as she be out she would drop a early prayer at the cathedral faith and work one must venture something sometimes in the cause of religion think she as she start timorously on she way but she have not go a dozen step before she repent she temerity there be some one behind she there should not be any thing terrible in a footstep merely because it be masculine but madame delphine 's mind be not prepare to consider that a terrible secret be haunt she yesterday morning she have find a shoe-track in the garden she have not disclose the discovery to olive but she have hardly close she eye the whole night the step behind she now might be the fall of that very shoe she quicken she pace but do not leave the sound behind she hurry

second Saturday afternoon follow be hot and calm the lamp burning before the tabernacle in père jerome 's little church might have hang with as motionless a flame in the window behind the lily of st joseph 's wand shine in one of the half open pane be not more completely at rest than the leaf on tree and vine without suspend in the slumbering air almost as still down under the organ-gallery with a single band of light fall athwart he box from a small door which stand ajar sit the little priest behind the lattice of the confessional silently wipe away the sweat that bead on he brow and roll down he face at distant interval the shadow of some one enter softly through the door would obscure for a moment the band of light and a aged crone or a little boy or some gentle presence that the listen confessor have know only by the voice for many year would kneel a few moment beside he wait ear in prayer for blessing and in review of those slip and error which prove we all akin the day have be long and fatiguing first early mass a hasty meal then a business call upon the archbishop in the interest of some project charity then back to he cottage and so to the banking-house of vignevielle in the rue toulouse there all be open bright and re-assure its master virtually though not actually present the search be over and the seeker go personally wiser than they would tell and officially

be dead and bury at noon there have be a wedding in the little church its scene linger before père jerome 's vision now -- the kneel pair : the bridegroom rich in all the excellence of man strength and kindness slumbering interlock in every part and feature the bride a saintly weariness on she pale face she awesome eye lift in adoration upon the image of the savior the small knot of friend behind : madame thompson large fair self-contained jean thompson with the affidavit of madame delphine show through he tightly button coat the physician and he wife share one expression of amiable consent and last -- yet first -- one small shrink female figure here at one side in fade robe and dingy bonnet she sit as motionless as stone yet wear a look of apprehension and in the small restless black eye which peer out from the pinch and waste face betray the peacelessness of a harrowed mind and neither the recollection of bride nor of groom nor of potential friend behind nor the occupation of the present hour could shut out from the tired priest the image of that woman or the sound of he own low word of invitation to she give as the company leave the church -- come to confession this afternoon by and by a long time pass without the approach of any step or any glancing of light or shadow save for the occasional progress from station to station of some one over on the right who be noiselessly go the way of the cross yet père jerome tarry she will surely come he say to himself she promise she would come a moment later he sense quicken by the prolonged silence catch a subtle evidence or two of approach and the next moment a penitent knelt noiselessly at the window of he box and the whisper come tremblingly in the voice he have wait to hear : _ bénissez-moin mo ' père pa ` ce que mo péché _ -lrb- bless I father for i have sin -rrb- he give he blessing ainsus soit-il -- amen murmur the penitent and then in the soft accent of the creole _ patoi _ continue : ' i confess to almighty god to the bless mary ever virgin to bless michael the archangel to bless john the baptist to the holy apostle peter and paul and to all the saint that i have sin exceedingly in think word and deed _ through my fault through my fault through my most grievous fault _ ' i confess on Saturday three week ago and receive absolution and i have perform the penance enjoin since then -- there she stop there be a soft stir as if she sink slowly down and another as if she rise up again and in a moment she say : olive _ be _ my child the picture i show to jean thompson be the half-sister of my daughter 's father dead before my child be bear she be the image of she and of he but o god thou knowest oh olive my own daughter she cease and be still père jerome wait but no sound come he look through the window she be kneel with she forehead rest on she arm -- motionless he repeat the word of absolution still she do not stir my daughter he say go to thy home in peace but she do not move he rise hastily step from the box raise she in he arm and call she by name : madame delphine she head fall back in he elbow for a instant there be life in the eye -- it glimmer -- it vanish and tear gush from he own and fall upon the gentle face of the dead as he look up to heaven and cry : lord lay not this sin to she charge café des exilés that which in 1835 -- i think he say thirty-five -- be a reality in the rue burgundy -- i think he say burgundy -- be now but a reminiscence yet so vividly be its story tell I that at this moment the old café des exilés appear before my eye float in the cloud of revery and i doubt not i see it just as it be in the old time a antiquated story-and-a-half creole cottage sit right down on the banquette as do the choctaw squaw who sell bay and sassafras and life-everlasting with a high close board-fence shut out of view the diminutive garden on the southern side a ancient willow droop over the roof of round tile and partly hide the discolor stucco which keep drop off into the garden as though the old café be strip for the plunge into oblivion -- disrobe for its execution i see well up in the angle of the broad side gable shaded by its rude awning of clapboard as the eye of a old dame be shaded by she wrinkled hand the window of pauline oh for the image of the maiden be it but for one moment lean out of the casement to hang she mocking-bird and look down into the garden -- where above the barrier of old board i see the top of the fig-tree the pale green clump of banana the tall palmetto with its jagged crown pauline 's own two orange-tree hold up they band toward the window heavy with the promise of autumn the broad crimson mass of the many-stemmed oleander and the crisp bough of the pomegranate load with freckled apple and with here and there a linger scarlet blossom the café des exilés to use a figure flowered bear fruit and drop it long ago -- or rather time and fate like some uncursed adam and eve come side by side and cut away its cluster as we sever the golden burden of the banana from its stem then like a banana which have bear its fruit it be raze to the ground and make way for a newer brighter growth i believe it would set every tooth on edge should i go by there now -- now that i have hear the story -- and see the old site cover by the shoo-fly coffee-house pleasanter far to close my eye and call to view the unpretentious portal of the old café with she child -- for such those exile seem to I -- drag they rocking-chair out and sit in they wonted group under the long out-reaching eaves which shaded the banquette of the rue burgundy it be in 1835 that the café des exilés be as one might say in full blossom old m d'hemecourt father of pauline and host of the café himself a refugee from san domingo be the cause -- at least the human cause -- of its opening as its white-curtained glazed door expand emit a little puff of he own cigarette smoke it be like the bursting of catalpa blossom and the exile come like bee push into the tiny room to sip its rich variety of tropical sirup its lemonade its orangeade its orgeat its barley-water and its outlandish wine while they talk of dear home -- that be to say of barbado of martinique of san domingo and of cuba there be pedro and benigno and fernandez and francisco and benito benito be a tall swarthy man with immense gray moustachio and hair as harsh as tropical grass and gray as ash when he could spare he cigarette from he lip he would tell you in a cavernous voice and with a wrinkled smile that he be a-t-thorty-seveng there be martinez of san domingo yellow as a canary always sit with one leg curl under he and hold the back of he head in he knit finger against the back of he rocking-chair father mother brother sister all have be massacre in the struggle of '21 and '22 he alone be leave to tell the tale and tell it often with that strange infantile insensibility to the solemnity of he bereavement so peculiar to latin people but besides these and many who need no mention there be two in particular around whom all the story of the café des exilés of old m d'hemecourt and of pauline turn as on a double center first manuel mazaro whose small restless eye be as black and bright as those of a mouse whose light talk become he dark girlish face and whose redundant lock curl so prettily and so wonderfully black under the fine white brim of he jaunty panama he have the hand of a woman save that the nail be stain with the smoke of cigarette he could play the guitar delightfully and wear he knife down behind he coat-collar the second be major galahad shaughnessy i imagine i can see he in he white duck brass-buttoned roundabout with he sabreless belt peep out beneath all he boyishness in he sea-blue eye lean lightly against the door-post of the café des exilés as a child lean against he mother run he finger over a basketful of fragrant lime and watch he chance to strike some solemn creole under the fifth rib with a good old irish joke old d'hemecourt draw he close to he bosom the spanish creole be as the old man term it both cold and hot but never warm major shaughnessy be warm and it be no uncommon thing to find those two apart from the other talk in a undertone and playing at confidante like two schoolgirl the kind old man be at this time drift close up to he sixtieth year there be much he could tell of san domingo whither he have be carry from martinique in he childhood whence he have become a refugee to cuba and thence to new orlean in the flight of 1809 it fall one day to manuel mazaro 's lot to discover by saunter within earshot that to galahad shaughnessy only of all the child of the café des exilés the good host speak long and confidentially concern he daughter the word half hear and magnify like object seem in a fog meaning manuel mazaro know not what but make portentous by he suspicious nature be but the old man 's recital of the grind he have get between the millstone of he poverty and he pride in try so long to sustain for little pauline 's sake that attitude before society which earn respect from a surface-viewing world it be while he be tell this that manuel mazaro draw near the old man pause in a embarrassed way the major sit sidewise in he chair lift he cheek from its resting-place on he elbow and mazaro after stand a awkward moment turn away with such a inward feeling as one may guess would arise in a heart full of cuban blood not unmixed with indian as he move off m d'hemecourt resume : that in a last extremity he have open partly from dire want partly for very love to homeless soul the café des exilés he have hope that as strong drink and high word be to be alike unknown to it it might not prejudice sensible people but it have he have no doubt they say among themselves she be a excellent and beautiful girl and deserving all respect and respect they accord but they _ respect _ they never come to pay a café be a café say the old gentleman it be nod possib ' to ezcape he aldough de café des exilés be differen from de rez it be different from the café des réfugiés suggest the irishman differen ' as possib ' reply m d'hemecourt he look about upon the wall the shelf be luscious with rank of cool sirup which he alone know how to make the expression of he face change from sadness to a gentle pride which speak without word say -- and let we story pause a moment to hear it say : if any poor exile from any island where guava or mango or plantain grow want a draught which will make he see he home among the cocoa-palm behold the café des exilés ready to take the poor child up and give he the breast and if gold or silver he have they not why heaven and santa marium and saint christopher bless he it make no difference here be a rocking-chair here a cigarette and here a light from the host 's own tinder he will pay when he can as this easily pardon pride say so it often occur and if the newly come exile say he father be a spaniard -- come old m d'hemecourt would cry another glass it be a innocent drink my mother be a castilian but if the exile say he mother be a frenchwoman the glass would be forthcoming all the same for my father the old man would say be a frenchman of martinique with blood as pure as that wine and a heart as sweet as this honey come a glass of orgeat and he would bring it himself in a quart tumbler now there be jealousy and jealousy there be people who rise up quickly and kill and there be other who turn they hot thought over silently in they mind as a brooding bird turn she egg in the nest thus do manuel mazaro and take it ill that galahad should see a vision in the temple while he and all the brethren tarry without pauline have be to the café des exilés in some degree what the image of the virgin be to they church at home and for she father to whisper she name to one and not to another be it seem to mazaro as if the old man be he a sacristan should say to some single worshiper here you may have this madonna i make it a present to you or if such be not the handsome young cuban 's feeling such at least be the disguise he jealousy put on if pauline be to be hand down from she niche why then farewell café des exilés she be its preserving influence she make the place holy she be the burning candle on the altar surely the reader will pardon the pen that linger in the mention of she and yet i know not how to describe the forbearing unspoken tenderness with which all these exile regard the maiden in the balmy afternoon as i have say they gather about they mother 's knee that be to say upon the banquette outside the door there loll back in they rocking-chair they would pass the evening hour with oft-repeated tale of home and the moon would come out and glide among the cloud like a silver barge among island wrap in mist and they love the silently glide orb with a sort of worship because from she soar height she look down at the same moment upon they and upon they home in the far antille it be somewhat thus that they look upon pauline as she seem to they hold up half way to heaven they know not how ah those who have be pilgrim who have wander out beyond harbor and light whom fate have lead in lonely path strew with thorn and brier not of they own sowing who homeless in a land of home see window gleaming and door ajar but not for they -- it be they who well understand what the worship be that cry to any daughter of we dear mother eve whose footstep chance may draw across the path the silent beseeching cry stay a little instant that i may look upon you oh woman beautifier of the earth stay till i recall the face of my sister stay yet a moment while i look from afar with helpless-hanging hand upon the softness of thy cheek upon the fold coil of thy shine hair and my spirit shall fall down and say those prayer which i may never again -- god knoweth -- say at home she be seldom see but sometimes when the lounge exile would be sit in they afternoon circle under the eaves and some old man would tell he tale of fire and blood and capture and escape and the head would lean forward from the chair-back and a great stillness would follow the ending of the story old m d'hemecourt would all at once speak up and say lay he hand upon the narrator 's knee comrade you throat be dry here be fresh lime let my dear child herself come and mix you a lemonade then the neighbor over the way sit about they door would by and by softly say see see there be pauline and all the exile would rise from they rocking-chair take off they hat and stand as man stand in church while pauline come out like the moon from a cloud descend the three step of the café door and stand with waiter and glass a new rebecca with she pitcher before the swarthy wanderer what tale that would have be tear-compelling nay heart-rending have they not be palpable invention the pretty womanish mazaro from time to time pour forth in the ever ungratified hope that the goddess might come down with a draught of nectar for he it profiteth not to recount but i should fail to show a family feature of the café des exilés do i omit to say that these make-believe adventure be hear with every mark of respect and credence while on the other hand they be never attempt in the presence of the irishman he would have move a eyebrow or make some barely audible sound or drop some seemingly innocent word and the whole company spite of themselves would have smile wherefore it may be doubt whether at any time the curly-haired young cuban have that playful affection for he celtic comrade which a habit of give little velvet tap to galahad 's cheek make a show of such be the café des exilés such its inmate such its guest when certain apparently trivial event begin to fall around it as germ of blight fall upon corn and to bring about that end which cometh to all thing the little seed of jealousy drop into the heart of manuel mazaro we have already take into account galahad shaughnessy begin to be specially active in organize a society of spanish american the design of which as set forth in its manuscript constitution be to provide proper funeral honor to such of they membership as might be overtake by death and whenever it be practicable to send they ash to they native land next to galahad in this movement be a elegant old mexican physician dr -- he name escape I -- whom the café des exilés sometimes take upon she lap -- that be to say door-step -- but whose favorite resort be the old café des réfugiés in the rue royale -lrb- royal street as it be begin to be call -rrb- manuel mazaro be make secretary it be for some reason think judicious for the society to hold its meeting in various place now here now there but the most frequent rendezvous be the café des exilés it be quiet those spanish creole however they may afterward cackle like to lay they plan noiselessly like a hen in a barn there be a very general confidence in this old institution a kind of inward assurance that mother would not tell though after all what great secret could there be connect with a mere burial society before the hour of meet the café des exilés always send away she child and close she door presently they would commence return one by one as a flock of wild fowl will do that have be startle up from its accustomed haunt frequenter of the café des réfugiés also would appear a small gate in the close garden-fence let they into a room behind the café proper and by and by the apartment would be full of dark-visaged man converse in the low courteous tone common to they race the shutter of door and window be close and the chink stop with cotton some people be so jealous of observation on a certain night after one of these meeting have disperse in its peculiar way the member retire two by two at interval manuel mazaro and m d'hemecourt be leave alone sit close together in the dimly light room the former speak the other with no

he face begin to repent they love they father as daughter can and when they see they pretended dejection harass he seriously they restrain they complaint display more than ordinary tenderness and

garden of belle demoiselle put on its spring attire the seven fair sister move from rise to rise the cloud of discontent have warm into invisible vapor in the rich sunlight of family affection and on the common memory the only scar of last year 's wound be old charlie 's sheer impertinence in cross the caprice of the de charleus the cup of gladness seem to fill with the filling of the river how high that river be its tremendous current rolled and tumble and spin along hustle the long funeral flotilla of drift -- and how near shore it come man be out day and night watch the levee on windy night even the old colonel take part and grow light-hearted with occupation and excitement as every minute the river throw a white arm over the levee 's top as though it would vault over but all hold fast and as the summer drift in the water sink down into its bank and look quite incapable of harm on a summer afternoon of uncommon mildness old colonel jean albert henrus joseph de charleu-marot be in a mood for revery slip the custody of he feminine ruler and seek the crown of the levee where it be he wont to promenade presently he sit upon a stone bench -- a favorite seat before he lay he broad-spread field near by he lordly mansion and be still -- perhaps by female contact -- somewhat sentimental he fall to muse on he past it be hardly worthy to be proud of all its morning be redden

angel walk in eden be the seven goddess of he only worship just then a slight sound behind he bring he to he foot he cast he eye anxiously to the outer edge of the little strip of bank between the levee 's base and the river there be nothing visible he pause with he ear toward the water he face full of frightened expectation ha there come a single plashing sound like some great beast slip into the river and little wave in a wide semi-circle come out from under the bank and spread over the water my god he plunge down the levee and bound through the low weed to the edge of the bank it be sheer and the water about four foot below he do not stand quite on the edge but fall upon he knee a couple of yard away wring he hand moan and weep and stare through he watery eye at a fine long crevice just discernible under the matted grass and curve outward on either hand toward the river my god he sob aloud my god and even while he call he god answer : the tough bermuda grass stretch and snap the crevice slowly become a gape and softly gradually with no sound but the closing of the water at last a ton or more of earth settle into the boiling eddy and disappear at the same instant a pulse of the breeze bring from the garden behind the joyous thoughtless laughter of the fair mistress of belle demoiselle the old colonel spring up and clamber over the levee then force himself to a more compose movement he hasten into the house and order he horse tell my child to make merry while i be go he leave word i shall be back to-night and the horse 's hoof clatter down a by-road lead to the city charlie say the planter ride up to a window from which the old man 's nightcap be thrust out what you say charlie -- my house for yours eh charlie -- what you say ello say charlie from where

demoiselle have stir the depths of a intense love for he beautiful home true if he hold to it the caving of the bank at its present fearful speed would let the house into the river within three month but be it not better to lose it so than sell he birthright again -- come back to the first thought -- to betray he own blood it be only injin charlie but have not the de charleu blood just speak out in he unconsciously he groan after a time they strike a path approach the plantation in the rear and a little after pass from behind a clump of live-oak they come in sight of the villa it look so like a gem shine through its dark grove so like a great glow-worm in the dense foliage so significant of luxury and gayety that the poor master from a overflow heart groan again what ask charlie the colonel only draw he rein and dismount mechanically contemplate the sight before he the high arched door and window be throw wide to the summer air from every open the bright light of numerous candelabrum dart out upon the sparkling foliage of magnolia and bay and here and there in the spacious veranda a color lantern sway in the gentle breeze a sound of revel fall on the ear the music of harp and across one window brighter than the rest flit once or twice the shadow of dancer but oh the shadow flit across the heart of the fair mansion 's master old charlie say he gaze fondly at he house you and I be both old eh yaa say the stolid charlie and we have both be bad enough in we time eh charlie charlie surprise at the tender tone repeat yaa and you and I be mighty close blame close

the mississippus twelve long month be midnight to the mind of the childless father when they be only half go he take he bed and every day and every night old charlie the low-down the fool watch he tenderly tend he lovingly for the sake of he name he misfortune and he broken heart no woman 's step cross the floor of the sick-chamber whose western dormer-window overpeer the dingy architecture of old charlie 's block charlie and a skilled physician the one all interest the other all gentleness hope and patience -- these only enter by the door but by the window come in a sweet-scented evergreen vine transplant from the cave bank of belle demoiselle it catch the ray of sunset in its flowery net and let then softly in upon the sick man 's bed gather the glance beam of the moon at midnight and often waken the sleeper to look with he mindless eye upon they pretty silver fragment strew upon the floor by and by there seem -- there be -- a twinkling dawn of return reason slowly peacefully with a increase unseen from day to day the light of reason come into the eye and speech become coherent but withal there come a fail of the wreck body and the doctor say that monsieur be both better and

shake he head with still more vigor to signify that they have not so much as approach a bargain and the smile return charlie want to see the vine recognize he step backward to the window with a broad smile shake the foliage nod and look smart i know say the colonel with beam eye -- many week the next day -- charl -- the best ear go down send for a priest the priest come and be alone with he a

decade of the present century when the newly establish american government be the most hateful thing in louisiana -- when the creole be still kick at such vile innovation as the trial by jury american

far be feel only as slippery seepage which make the creole tremble for he footing -- there stand a short distance above what be now canal street and considerably back from the line of villa which fringe the river-bank on tchoupitoula road a old colonial plantation-house half in ruin it stand aloof from civilization the tract that have once be its indigo field give over to they first noxious wildness and grow up into one of the horridest marsh within a circuit of fifty mile the house be of heavy cypress lift up on pillar grim solid and spiritless its massive build a strong reminder of day still earlier when every man have be he own peace officer and the insurrection of the black a daily contingency its dark weatherbeaten roof and side be hoist up above the jungly plain in a distract way like a gigantic ammunition-wagon stick in the mud and abandon by some retreat army around it be a dense growth of low water willow with half a hundred sort of thorny or fetid bush savage stranger alike to the language of flower and to the botanist 's greek they be hang with countless strand of discolor and prickly smilax and the impassable mud below bristle with _ chevaux de frise _ of the dwarf palmetto two lone forest-tree dead cypress stand in the center of the marsh dot with roost vulture the shallow strip of water be hide by myriad of aquatic plant under whose coarse and spiritless flower could one have see it be a harbor of reptile great and small to make one shudder to the end of he day the house be on a slightly raise spot the levee of a drain canal the water of this canal do not run they crawl and be full of big ravening fish and alligator that hold it against all comer such be the home of old jean marie poquelin once a opulent indigo planter stand high in the esteem of he small proud circle of exclusively male acquaintance in the old city now a hermit alike shun by and shun all who have ever know he the last of he line say the gossip he father lie under the floor of the st loui cathedral with the wife of he youth on one side and the wife of he old age on the other old jean visit the spot daily he half-brother -- alas there be a mystery no one know what have become of the gentle young half brother more than thirty year he junior whom once he seem so fondly to love but who seven year ago have disappear suddenly once for all and leave no clew of he fate they have seem to live so happily in each other 's love no father mother wife to either no kindred upon earth the elder a bold frank impetuous chivalric adventurer the younger a gentle studious book-loving recluse they live upon the ancestral estate like mate bird one always on the wing the other always in the nest there be no trait in jean marie poquelin say the old gossip for which he be so well know among he few friend as he apparent fondness for he little brother jacque say this and jacque say that he would leave this or that or any thing to jacque for jacque be a scholar and jacque be good or wise or just or far-sighted as the nature of the case require and he should ask jacque as soon as he get home since jacque be never elsewhere to be see it be between the roving character of the one brother and the bookishness of the other that the estate fall into decay jean marie generous gentleman gamble the slave away one by one until none be leave man or woman but one old african mute the indigo-field and vat of louisiana have be generally abandon as unremunerative certain enterprising man have substitute the culture of sugar but while the recluse be too apathetic to take so active a course the other saw larger and at time equally respectable profit first in smuggling and later in the african slave-trade what harm could he see in it the whole people say it be vitally necessary and to minister to a vital public necessity -- good enough certainly and so he lay up many a doubloon that make he none the worse in the public regard one day old jean marie be about to start upon a voyage that be to be longer much longer than any that he have yet make jacque have beg he hard for many day not to go but he laugh he off and finally say kiss he : _ adieu ` tit frère _ no say jacque i shall go with you they leave the old hulk of a house in the sole care of the african mute and go away to the guinea coast together two year after old poquelin come home without he vessel he must have arrive at he house by night no one see he come no one see he little brother rumor whisper that he too have return but he have never be see again a dark suspicion fall upon the old slave-trader no matter that the few keep the many remind of the tenderness that have ever mark he bear to the miss man the many shake they head you know he have a quick and fearful temper and why do he cover he loss with mystery grief would out with the truth but say the charitable few look in he face see that expression of true humanity the many do look in he face and as he look in theirs he read the silent question : where be thy brother abel the few be silence he former friend die off and the name of jean marie poquelin become a symbol of witchery devilish crime and hideous nursery fiction the man and he house be alike shun the snipe and duck hunter forsake the marsh and the wood-cutter abandon the canal sometimes the hardier boy who venture out there snake-shooting hear a slow thumping of oar-lock on the canal they would look at each other for a moment half in consternation half in glee then rush from they sport in wanton haste to assail with they gibe the unoffending withered old man who in rusty attire sit in the stern of a skiff row homeward by he white-headed african mute o jean-ah poquelin o jean-ah jean-ah poquelin it be not necessary to utter more than that no hint of wickedness deformity or any physical or moral demerit merely the name and tone of mockery : oh jean-ah poquelin and while they tumble one over another in they needless haste to fly he would rise carefully from he seat while the aged mute with downcast face go on rowing and roll up he brown fist and extend it toward the urchin would pour forth such a unholy broadside of french imprecation and invective as would all but craze they with delight among both black and whites the house be the object of a thousand superstition every midnight they affirm the _ feu follet _ come out of the marsh and run in and out of the room flash from window to window the story of some lad whose word in ordinary statement be worthless be generally credit that the night they camp in the wood rather than pass the place after dark they see about sunset every window blood-red and on each of the four chimney a owl sit which turn he head three time round and moan and laugh with a human voice there be a bottomless well everybody profess to know beneath the sill of the big front door under the rotten veranda whoever set he foot upon that threshold disappear forever in the depth below what wonder the marsh grow as wild as africa take all the faubourg ste marie and half the ancient city you would not find one graceless dare-devil reckless enough to pass within a hundred yard of the house after nightfall \* \* \* \* \* the alien race pour into old new orlean begin to find the few street name for the bourbon prince too strait for they the wheel of fortune begin to whirl throw they off beyond

enterprise that ask neither co-operation nor advice of they but wait till they come yonder to jean poquelin 's marsh ha ha ha the suppose predicament so delighted they that they put on a mock terror and whirl about in a assume stampede then catch they clasped hand between they knee in excess of mirth and laugh till the tear run for whether the street-maker mire in the marsh or contrived to cut through old jean-ah 's property either event would be joyful meantime a line of tiny rod with bit of white paper in they split top gradually extend its way straight through the haunt ground and across

so close to jean poquelin 's house be fill and the street or rather a sunny road just touch a corner of the old mansion 's dooryard the morass run dry its venomous denizen slip away through the bulrush the cattle roam freely upon its hardened surface trample the superabundant undergrowth the bellow frog croak to westward lily and the flower-de-luce spring up in the place of reed smilax and poison-oak give way to the purple-plumed iron-weed and pink spiderwort the bindweed run everywhere bloom as they run and on one of the dead cypress a giant creeper hang its green burden of foliage and lift its scarlet trumpet sparrow and red-bird flit through the bush and dewberry grow ripe beneath over all these come a sweet dry smell of salubrity which the place have not know since the sediment of the mississippus first lift it from the sea but its owner do not build over the willow-brake and down the vista of the open street bright new house some singly some by rank be prying in upon the old man 's privacy they even settle down toward he southern side first a wood-cutter 's hut or two then a market gardener 's shanty then a paint cottage and all at once the faubourg have flank and half surround he and he dried-up marsh ah then the common people begin to hate he the old tyrant you do not mean a old _ tyrant _ well then why do not he build when the public need demand it what do he live in that unneighborly way for the old pirate the old kidnapper how easily even the most ultra louisianian put on the import virtue of the north when they could be bring to bear against the hermit there he go with the boy after he ah ha ha jean-ah poquelin ah jean-ah aha aha jean-ah marie jean-ah poquelin the old villain how merrily the swarm américains echo the spirit of persecution the old fraud they say -- pretend to live in a haunt house do he we 'll tar and feather he some day guess we can fix he he can not be row home along the old canal now he walk he have break sadly of late and the street urchin be ever at he heel it be like the day when they cry : go up thou bald-head and the old man now and then turn and deliver ineffectual curse to the creole -- to the incoming lower class of superstitious german irish sicilian and other -- he become a omen and embodiment of public and private ill-fortune upon he all the vagary of they superstition gather and grow if a house catch fire it be imputed to he machination do a woman go off in a fit he have bewitch she do a child stray off for a hour the mother shiver with the apprehension that jean poquelin have offer he to strange god the house be the subject of every bad boy 's invention who love to contrive ghostly lie as long as that house stand we shall have bad luck do you not see we pea and bean die we cabbage and lettuce go to seed and we garden turn to dust while every day you can see it rain in the wood the rain will never pass old poquelin 's house he keep a fetich he have conjure the whole faubourg st marie and why the old wretch simply because we playful and innocent child call after he as he pass a building and improvement company which have not yet get its charter but be go to and which have not indeed any tangible capital yet but be go to have some join the jean-ah poquelin war the haunt property would be such a capital site for a market-house they send a deputation to the old mansion to ask its occupant to sell the deputation never get beyond the chained gate and a very barren interview with the african mute the president of the board be then empower -lrb- for he have study french in pennsylvanium and be consider qualify -rrb- to call and persuade m poquelin to subscribe to the company 's stock but -- fact be gentleman he say at the next meeting it would take we at least twelve month to make mr pokaleen understand the rather original feature of we system and he would not subscribe when we would do besides the only way to see he be to stop he on the street there be a great laugh from the board they could not help it better meet a bear rob of she whelp say one you be mistake as to that say the president i do meet he and stop he and find he quite polite but i could get no satisfaction from he the fellow would not talk in french and when i speak in english he hoist he old shoulder up and give the same answer to every thing i say and that be -- ask one or two impatient of the pause that it ` do not worse w ` ile ' one of the board say : mr president this market-house project as i take it be not altogether a selfish one the community be to be benefit by it we may feel that we be work in the public interest -lrb- the board smile knowingly -rrb- if we employ all possible means to oust this old nuisance from among we you may know that at the time the street be cut through this old poquelann do all he could to prevent it it be owe to a certain connection which i have with that affair that i hear a ghost story -lrb- smile follow by a sudden dignified check -rrb- -- ghost story which of course i be not go to relate but i _ may _ say that my profound conviction arise from a prolonged study of that story be that this old villain john poquelann have he brother lock up in that old house now if this be so and we can fix it on he i merely _ suggest _ that we can make the matter highly useful i do not know he add begin to sit down but that it be a action we owe to the community -- hem how do you propose to handle the subject ask the president i be think say the speaker that as a board of director it would be unadvisable for we to authorize any action involve trespass but if you for instance mr president should as it be for mere curiosity _ request _ some one as for instance we excellent secretary simply as a personal favor to look into the matter -- this be merely a suggestion the secretary smile sufficiently to be understand that while he certainly do not consider such preposterous service a part of he duty as secretary he might notwithstanding accede to the president 's request and the board adjourn little white as the secretary be call be a mild kind-hearted little man who nevertheless have no fear of any thing unless it be the fear of be unkind i tell you frankly he privately say to the president i go into this purely for reason of my own the next day a little after nightfall one might have descry this little man slip along the rear fence of the poquelin place preparatory to vault over into the rank grass-grown yard and bear himself altogether more after the manner of a collector of rare chicken than accord to the usage of secretary the picture present to he eye be not calculate to enliven he mind the old mansion stand out against the western sky black and silent one long lurid pencil-stroke along a sky of slate be all that be leave of daylight no sign of life be apparent no light at any window unless it might have be on the side of the house hide from view no owl be on the chimney no dog be in the yard he enter the place and venture up behind a small cabin which stand apart from the house through one of its many cranny he easily detect the african mute crouch before a flicker pine-knot he head on he knee fast asleep he conclude to enter the mansion and with that view stand and scan it the broad rear step of the veranda would not serve he he might meet some one midway he be measure with he eye the proportion of one of the pillar which support it and estimate the practicability of climb it when he hear a footstep some one drag a chair out toward the railing then seem to change he mind and begin to pace the veranda he footfall resounding on the dry board with singular loudness little white draw a step backward get the figure between himself and the sky and at once recognize the short broad-shouldered form of old jean poquelin he sit down upon a billet of wood and to escape the sting of a whine cloud of mosquito shroud he face and neck in he handkerchief leave he eye uncover he have sit there but a moment when he notice a strange sickening odor faint as if come from a distance but loathsome and horrid whence could it come not from the cabin not from the marsh for it be as dry as powder it be not in the air it seem to come from the ground rise up he notice for the first time a few step before he a narrow footpath lead toward the house he glance down it -- ha right there be some one come -- ghostly white quick as thought and as noiselessly he lay down at full length against the cabin it be bold strategy and yet there be no deny it little white feel that he be frighten it be not a ghost he say to himself i _ know _ it can not be a ghost but the perspiration burst out at every pore and the air seem to thicken with heat it be a living man he say in he thought i hear he footstep and i hear old poquelin 's footstep too separately over on the veranda i be not discover the thing have pass there be that odor again what a smell of death be it come back yes it stop at the door of the cabin be it peer in at the sleep mute it move away it be in the path again now it be go he shudder now if i dare venture the mystery be solve he rise cautiously close against the cabin and peer along the path the figure of a man a presence if not a body -- but whether clothe in some white stuff or naked the darkness would not allow he to determine -- have turn and now with a seeming painful gait move slowly from he great heaven can it be that the dead do walk he withdraw again the hand which have go to he eye the dreadful object pass between two pillar and under the house he listen there be a faint sound as of foot upon a staircase then all be still except the measure tread of jean poquelin walk on the veranda and the heavy respiration of the mute slumbering in the cabin the little secretary be about to retreat but as he look once more toward the haunt louse a dim light appear in the crack of a close window and presently old jean poquelin come drag he chair and sit down close against the shine cranny he speak in a low tender tone in the french tongue make some inquiry a answer come from within be it the voice of a human so unnatural be it -- so hollow so discordant so unearthly -- that the stealthy listener shudder again from head to foot and when something stir in some bush near by -- though it may have be nothing more than a rat -- and come scuttle through the grass the little secretary actually turn and flee as he leave the enclosure he move with bolder leisure through the bush yet now and then he speak aloud : oh oh i see i understand and shut he eye in he hand how strange that henceforth little white be the champion of jean poquelin in season and out of season -- wherever a word be utter against he -- the secretary with a quiet aggressive force that instantly arrest gossip demand upon what authority the statement or conjecture be make but as he do not condescend to explain he own remarkable attitude it be not long before the disrelish and suspicion which have follow jean poquelin so many year fall also upon he it be only the next evening but one after he adventure that he make himself a source of sullen amazement to one hundred and fifty boy by order they to desist from they wanton hallooing old jean poquelin standing and shake he cane roll out he long-drawn malediction pause and stare then give the secretary a courteous bow and start on the boy save one from pure astonishment cease but a ruffianly little irish lad more daring than any have yet be throw a big hurtle clod that strike old poquelin between the shoulder and burst like a shell the enraged old man wheel with uplifted staff to give chase to the scamper vagabond and -- he may have trip or he may not but he fall full length little white hasten to help he up but he wave he off with a fierce imprecation and stagger to he foot resume he way homeward he lip be redden with blood little white be on he way to the meeting of the board he would have give all he dare spend to have staid away for he feel both too fierce and too tremulous to brook the criticism that be likely to be make i can not help it gentleman i can not help you to make a case against the old man and i be not go to we do not expect this disappointment mr white i can not help that sir no sir you have better not appoint any more investigation somebody 'll investigate himself into trouble no sir it be not a threat it be only my advice but i warn you that whoever take the task in hand will rue it to he die day -- which may be hasten too the president express himself surprise i do not care a rush answer little white wildly and foolishly i do not care a rush if you be sir no my nerve be not disorder my head 's as clear as a bell no i be _ not _ excite a director remark that the secretary look as though he have wake from a nightmare well sir if you want to know the fact i have and if you choose to cultivate old poquelin 's society you can have one too white call a facetious member but white do not notice white he call again what demand white with a scowl do you see the ghost yes sir i do cry white hit the table and hand the president a paper which bring the board to other business the story get among the gossip that somebody -lrb- they be afraid to say little white -rrb- have be to the poquelin mansion by night and behold something appalling the rumor be but a shadow of the truth magnify and distort as be the manner of shadow he have see skeleton walk and have barely escape the clutch of one by make the sign of the cross some madcap boy with a appetite for the horrible pluck up courage to venture through the dry marsh by the cattle-path and come before the house at a spectral hour when the air be full of bat something which they but half saw -- half a sight be enough -- send they tear back through the willow-brake and acacia bush to they home where they fairly drop down and cry : be it white no -- yes -- nearly so -- we can not tell -- but we see it and one

lately-opened street the view be not attractive on the score of beauty the house be small and scattered and across the flat common spite of the lofty tangle of weed and bush and spite of the thicket

: do not go away why not i want you to go to the funeral presently if some louisianian too loyal to dear france or spain to understand english look bewilder some one would interpret for he and

it the rabble stop behind he something be move out from under the veranda the many whisperer stretch upward to see the african mute come very slowly toward the gate lead by a cord in the nose a small brown bull which be harness to a rude cart on the flat body of the cart under a black cloth be see the outline of a long box hat off gentleman say little white as the box come in view and the crowd silently uncovered gentleman say little white here come the last remains of jean marie poquelin a better man i be afraid with all he sin -- yes a better -- a kinder man to he blood -- a man of more self-forgetful goodness -- than all of you put together will ever dare to be there be a profound hush as the vehicle come creak through the gate but when it turn away from they toward the forest those in front start suddenly there be a backward rush then all stand still again stare one way for there behind the bier with eye cast down and labor step walk the living remain -- all that be leave -- of little jacque poquelin the long-hidden brother -- a leper as white as snow dumb with horror the cringe crowd gaze upon the walk death they watch in silent awe the slow _ cortége _ creep down the long straight road and lessen on the view until by and by it stop where a wild unfrequented path branch off into the undergrowth toward the rear of the ancient city they be go to the _ terre aux lépreux _ say one in the crowd the rest watch they in silence the little bull be set free the mute with the strength of a ape lift the long box to he shoulder for a moment more the mute and the leper stand in sight while the former adjust he heavy burden then without one backward glance upon the unkind human world turn they face toward the ridge in the depths of the swamp know as the leper 's land they step into the jungle disappear and be never see again tite poulette kristian koppig be a rosy-faced beardless young dutchman he be one of that army of gentleman who after the purchase of louisiana swarm from all part of the commercial world over the mountain of franco-spanish exclusiveness like the goth over the pyrenee and settle down in new orlean to pick up they fortune with the diligence of hungry pigeon he may have be a german the distinction be too fine for creole haste and disrelish he make he home in a room with one dormer window look out and somewhat down upon a building opposite which still stand flush with the street a century old its big round-arched window in a long second-story row be wall up and two or three from time to time have have smaller window let into they again with odd little latticed peep-hole in they batten shutter this have already be do when kristian koppig first begin to look at they from he solitary dormer window all the feature of the building lead I to guess that it be a remnant of the old spanish barracks whose extensive structure fall by government sale into private hand a long time ago at the end toward the swamp a great oriental-looking passage be leave with a arched entrance and a pair of ponderous wooden door you look at it and almost see count o'reilly be artillery come bumping and trundle out and dash around into the ancient plaza to bang away at king st charle 's birthday i do not know who live there now you might stand about on the opposite _ banquette _ for week and never find out i suppose it be a residence for it do not look like one that be the rule in that region in the good old time of duel and bagatelle-club and theatre-ball and cayetano 's circus kristian koppig rooming as describe there live in the portion of this house partly overhang the archway a palish handsome woman by the name -- or go by the name -- of madame john you would hardly have think of she be color though fading she be still of very attractive countenance fine rather severe feature nearly straight hair carefully keep and that vivid black eye so peculiar to she kind she smile which come and go with she talk be sweet and exceedingly intelligent and something tell you as you look at she that she be one who have have to learn a great deal in this troublesome life but -- the creole lad in the street would say -- she daughter and there would be lifting of arm wringing of finger roll of eye round of mouth gasping and clasping of hand so beautiful beautiful beautiful white -- white like a water lily white -- like a magnolia applause would follow and invocation of all the saint to witness and she could sing sing -lrb- disdainfully -rrb- -- if a mocking-bird can _ sing _ ha they could not tell just how old she be they would give she about seventeen mother and daughter be very fond the neighbor could hear they call each other pet name and see they sit together sew talk happily to each other in the unceasing french way and see they go out and come in together on they little task and errand ` tite poulette the daughter be call she never go out alone and who be this madame john why you know -- she be -- say the wig-maker at the corner to kristian koppig -- i 'll tell you you know -- she be -- and the rest atomize off in a rasping whisper she be the best yellow-fever nurse in a thousand yard round but that be not what the wig-maker say a block nearer the river stand a house altogether different from the remnant of old barracks it be of frame with a deep front gallery over which the roof extend it have become a den of italian who sell fuel by daylight and by night be up to no tell what extent of deviltry this be once the home of a gay gentleman whose first name happen to be john he be a member of the good child social club as he parent live with he he wife would accord to custom have be call madame john but he have no wife he father die then he mother last of all himself as he be about to be off in come madame john with ` tïte poulette then a infant on she arm zallus say he i be go she bow she head and weep you have be very faithful to I zalli she weep on nobody to take care of you now zalli zallus only go on weep i want to give you this house zallus it be for you and the little one a hour after amid the sob of madame john she and the little one inherit the house such as it be with the fatal caution which characterize ignorance she sell the property and place the proceeds in a bank which make haste to fail she put on widow 's weed and wear they still when ` tite poulette have seventeen as the frantic lad would say how they do chatter over she quiet kristian koppig have never see the like he write to he mother and tell she so a pretty fellow at the corner would suddenly double himself up with beckon to a knot of chum these would hasten up recruit would come in from two or three other direction as they reach the corner they countenance would quickly assume a genteel severity and presently with she mother ` tite poulette would pass -- tall straight lithe she great black eye make tender by they sweeping lash the faintest tint of color in she southern cheek she form all grace she carriage a wonder of simple dignity the instant she be go every tongue be let slip on the marvel of she beauty but though theirs be only the loose new orlean moral of over fifty year ago they unleash tongue never have attempt any greater liberty than to take up the pet name ` tite poulette and yet the mother be soon to be as we shall discover a pay dancer at the _ salle de condé _ to zallus of course as to all quadroon lady the festivity of the conde-street ball-room be familiar of old there in the happy day when dear monsieur john be young and the eighteenth century old she have often repair under guard of she mother -- dead now alas -- and monsieur john would slip away from the dull play and dry society of théâtre d'orléans and come around with he crowd of elegant friend and through the long sweet hour of the ball she have dance and laugh and coquet under she satin mask even to the baffling and tormenting of that prince of gentleman dear monsieur john himself no man of questionable blood dare set he foot within the door many noble gentleman be please to dance with she colonel de -- and general la -- : city councilman and officer from the government house there be no pay dancer then every thing be decorously conduct indeed every girl 's mother be there and the more discreet always leave before there be too much drinking yes it be gay gay -- but sometimes dangerous ha more time than a few have monsieur john knock down some long-haired and long-knifed rowdy and kick the breath out of he for look saucily at she but that be like he he be so brave and kind -- and he be go there be no room for widow 's weed there so when she put these on she glittering eye never again look through she pink and white mask and she be glad of it for never never in she life have they so look for anybody but she dear monsieur john and now he be in heaven -- so the priest say -- and she be a sick-nurse living be hard work and as madame john have be bring up tenderly and have do what she could to rear she daughter in the same mistaken way with of course no more education than the lady in society get they know nothing beyond a little music and embroidery they struggle as they could faintly now give a few private dancing lesson now dress hair but ever beat back by the steady detestation of they imperious patroness and by and by for want of that priceless worldly grace know among the flippant as money-sense these two poor child bear of misfortune and the complacent badness of the time begin to be in want kristian koppig notice from he dormer window one day a man standing at the big archway opposite and clank the brass knocker on the wicket that be in one of the door he be a smooth man with he hair part in the middle and he cigarette poise on a tiny gold holder he wait a

put out hold a row of cigar-box with wretched little botanical specimen in they try to die ` tite poulette be they gardener and it be odd to see -- dry weather or wet -- how many watering per day those plant could take she never look up from she task but i know she perform it with that unacknowledged pleasure which all girl love and deny that of be look upon by noble eye on this peculiar Saturday afternoon in may kristian koppig have be witness of the distressful scene over the way it occur to ` tite poulette that such might be the case and she step to the casement to shut it as she do so the marvellous delicacy of kristian koppig move he to draw in one of he shutter both young head come out at one moment while at the same instant -- rap rap rap rap rap clank the knocker on the wicket the black eye of the maiden and the blue over the way from look into each other for the first time in life glance down to the arched doorway upon monsieur the manager then the black eye disappear within and kristian koppig think again and re-open he shutter stand up at the window prepare to become a bold spectator of what might follow but for a moment nothing follow trouble over there think the rosy dutchman and wait the manager wait too rub he hat and brushing he clothes with the tip of he kidded finger they do not wish to see he slowly conclude the spectator rap rap rap rap rap quoth the knocker and m de la rue look up around at the window opposite and notice the handsome young dutchman look at he dutch say the manager softly between he tooth he be stare at I say kristian koppig to himself -- but then i be stare at he which account for it a long pause and then another long rap they want he to go away think koppig knock hard suggest a street youngster standing by rap rap -- the manager have no sooner recommence than several neighbor look out of door and window very bad think we dutchman somebody should make he go off i wonder what they will do the manager step into the street look up at the close window return to the knocker and stand with it in he hand they be all go out monsieur say the street-youngster you lie say the cynosure of neighbor eye ah think kristian koppig i will go down and ask he -- here he thought lose outline he be only convinced that he have somewhat to say to he and turn to go down stair in go he become a little vexed with himself because he could not help hurry he notice too that he arm hold the stair-rail tremble in a silly way whereas he be perfectly calm precisely as he reach the street-door the manager raise the knocker but the latch click and the wicket be draw slightly ajar inside could just be descry madame john the manager bow smile talk talk on held money in he hand bow smile talk on flourish the money smile bow talk on and plainly persist in some intention to which madame john be steadfastly oppose the window above too -- it be kristian koppig who notice that -- open a wee bit like the shell of a terrapin presently the manager lift he foot and put forward a arm as though he would enter the gate by push but as quick as gunpowder it clap -- in he face you could hear the flee foot of zallus pound up the staircase as the panting mother re-enter she room see maman say ` tite poulette peeping at the window the young gentleman from over the way have cross holy mary bless he say the mother i will go over think kristian koppig and ask he kindly if he be not make a mistake what be they do dear ask the mother with clasped hand they be talk the young man be tranquil but ` sieur de la rue be very angry whisper the daughter and just then -- pang come a sharp keen sound rattle up the wall on either side of the narrow way and aha and laughter and clapping of female hand from two or three window oh what a slap cry the girl half in fright half in glee jerk herself back from the casement simultaneously with the report but the aha and laughter and clapping of feminine hand which still continue come from another cause ` tite poulette 's rapid action have strike the slender cord that hold up a end of she hanging garden and the whole rank of cigar-box slide from they place turn gracefully over as they shoot through the air and empty themselves plump upon the head of the slap manager breathless dirty pale as whitewash he gasp a threat to be hear from again and get round the corner as quick as he could walk left kristian koppig standing motionless the most astonished man in that street kristian koppig kristian koppig say greatheart to himself slowly drag up-stair what a mischief you have do one poor woman certainly to be rob of she bitter wages and another -- so lovely -- put to the burning shame of be the subject of a street brawl what will this silly neighborhood say ` have the gentleman a heart as well as a hand ' ` be it jealousy ' there he pause afraid himself to answer the suppose query and then -- oh kristian koppig you have be such a dunce and i can not apologize to they who in this street would carry my note and not wink and grin over it with low surmise i can not even make restitution money they would not dare receive it oh kristian koppig why do you not mind you own business be she any thing to you do you love she _ of course not _ oh -- such a dunce the reader will eagerly admit that however faulty this young man 's course of reasoning he conclusion be correct for mark what he do he go to he room which be already grow dark shut he window light he big dutch lamp and sit down to write something _ must _ be do say he aloud take up he pen i will be calm and cool i will be distant and brief but -- i shall have to be kind or i may offend ah i shall have to write in french i forget that i write it so poorly dunce that i be when all my brother and sister speak it so well he get out he french dictionary two hour slip by he make a new pen wash and refill he inkstand mend he abominable chair and after two hour more make another attempt and another failure my head ache say he and lay down on he couch the better to frame he phrase he be awaken by the sabbath sunlight the bell of the cathedral and the ursuline ' chapel be ring for high mass and a mocking-bird perching on a chimney-top above madame john 's room be carolling whistle mewing chirp scream and trill with the ecstasy of a whole may in he throat oh sleepy kristian koppig be the young man 's first thought -- such a dunce madame john and daughter do not go to mass the morning wear away and they casement remain closed they be offend say kristian koppig leave the house and wander up to the little protestant affair know as christ church no possibly they be not he say return and find the shutter throw back by a sad accident which mortify he extremely he happen to see late in the afternoon -- hardly conscious that he be look across the street -- that madame john be -- dress could it be that she be go to the _ salle de condé _ he rush to he table and begin to write he have guess aright the wages be too precious to be lose the manager have write she a note he beg to assure she that he be a gentleman of the clearest cut if he have make a mistake the previous afternoon he be glad no unfortunate result have follow except he have be assault by a ruffian that the _ danse du shawl _ be promise in he advertisement and he hope madame john -lrb- whose wages be in hand wait for she -rrb- would not fail to assist as usual lastly and delicately put he express he conviction that mademoiselle be wise and discreet in decline to entertain gentleman at she home so against much beseech on the part of ` tite poulette madame john be go to the ball-room maybe i can discover what ` sieur de la rue be plan against monsieur over the way she say know certainly the slap would not be forgive and the daughter though tremblingly at once withdraw she objection the heavy young dutchman now thoroughly electrify be write like mad he write and tear up write and tear up light he lamp start again and at last sign he name a letter by a dutchman in french -- what can be make of it in english we will see : madame and mademoiselle : a stranger seek not to be acquaint but see and admire all day the goodness and high honor beg to be pardon of they for the mistake alas of yesterday and to make reparation and satisfaction in destroy the ornament of the window as well as the loss of compensation from monsieur the manager with the enclosed bill of the _ banque de la louisiane _ for fifty dollar -lrb- $ 50 -rrb- and hope they will see what he be mean remain respectfully kristian koppig p -- madame must not go to the ball he must bear the missive himself he must speak in french what should the word be a moment of study -- he have it and be off down the long three-story stairway at the same moment madame john step from the wicket and glide off to the _ salle de condé _ a trifle late i shall see madame john of course think the young man crush a hope and rattle the knocker ` tite poulette spring up from pray for she mother 's safety what have she forget she ask herself and hasten down the wicket open the two innocent be stunned aw -- aw -- say the pretty dutchman aw -- blurt out something in virgin dutch hand she the letter and hurry down street alas what have i do say the poor girl bend over she candle and burst into tear that fall on the unopened letter and what shall i do it may be wrong to open it -- and worse not to like she sex she take the benefit of the doubt and intensify she perplexity and misery by reading and misconstrue the all but unintelligible contents what then not only sob and sigh but moan and beat of little fist together and outcry of soul-felt agony stifle against the bedside and temple press into knit palm because of one who seek _ not to be _ acquaint but offer money -- money -- in pity to a poor -- shame on she for say that -- a poor _ nigresse _ and now we self-confessed dolt turn back from a half-hour 's walk

must pray monsieur to go away my mother be at the _ salle de condé _ at the ball kristian koppig stray off repeat the word for want of definite thought all at once it occur to he that at the ball he could make madame john 's acquaintance with impunity be it court sin to go by no means he should most likely save a woman from trouble and help the poor in they distress behold kristian koppig standing on the floor of the _ salle de condé _ a large hall a blaze of lamp a bewildering flutter of fan and float robe strain of music column of gay promenader a long row of turbaned mother line either wall gentleman of the portlier sort fill the recess of the window whirling waltzer glide here and there -- smile and grace smile and grace all fair orderly elegant bewitch a young creole 's

brown a sort of periodically animate mummy in the business he smoke cascarillum wear velveteen and be as punctual as a executioner to kookoo 's venerable property a certain old man use for many year to come every evening stumble through the group of prattle child who frolic about in the early moonlight -- whose name no one know but whom all the neighbor designate by the title of ` sieur george it be he wont to be see take a straight -- too straight -- course toward he home never careen to right or left but now force himself slowly forward as though there be a high gale in front and now scud briskly ahead at a ridiculous little dog-trot as if there be a tornado behind he would go up the main staircase very carefully sometimes stop half-way up for thirty or forty minute ' doze but get to the landing eventually and tramp into he room in the second story with no little elation to find it still there be it not for these slight symptom of potation he be such a one as you would pick out of a thousand for a miser a year or two ago he suddenly disappear a great many year ago when the old house be still new a young man with no baggage save a small hair-trunk come and take the room i have mention and another adjoining he suppose he might stay fifty day -- and he staid fifty year and over this be a very fashionable neighborhood and he keep the room on that account month after month but when he have be here about a year something happen to he so it be rumor that greatly change the tenor of he life and from that time on there begin to appear in he and to accumulate upon each other in a manner which become the profound study of kookoo the symptom of a decay whose cause baffle the landlord 's limited power of conjecture for well-nigh half a century hint of a duel of a reason warped of disinheritance and many other unauthorized rumor flutter up and float off while he become recluse and some say begin incidentally to betray the unmanly habit which we have already notice he neighbor would have continue neighborly have he allow they but he never let himself be understand and _ les américains _ be very droll anyhow so as they could do nothing else they cut he so exclusive he become that -lrb- though it may have be for economy -rrb- he never admit even a housemaid but keep he apartment himself only the merry serenader who in those time use to sing under the balcony would now and then give he a crumb of they feast for pure fun 's sake and after a while because they could not find out he full name call he at hazard george -- but always prefix monsieur afterward when he begin to be careless in he dress and the fashion of serenade have pass away the commoner people dare to shorten the title to ` sieur george many season come and go the city change like a grow boy gentility and fashion go uptown but ` sieur george still retain he room every one know he slightly and bow but no one seem to know he well unless it be a brace or so of those convivial fellow in regulation-blue at little fort st charle he often come home late with one of these on either arm all singing different tune and stop at every twenty step to tell secret but by and by the fort be demolish church and goverment property melt down under the warm demand for building-lot the city spread like a ringworm -- and one day ` sieur george step out of the old house in full regimental the creole neighbor rush barehead into the middle of the street as though there be a earthquake or a chimney on fire what to do or say or think they do not know they be at they wit ' end therefore well-nigh happy however there be a german blacksmith 's shop near by and they watch to see what _ jacob _ will do jacob step into the street with every eye upon he he approach monsieur -- he address to he a few remark -- they shake hand -- they engage in some conversation -- monsieur place he hand on he sword -- now monsieur pass the populace crowd around the blacksmith child clap they hand softly and jump up and down on tiptoe of expectation -- ` sieur george be go to the war in mexico ah say a little girl in the throng ` sieur george 's two room will be empty i find that very droll the landlord -- this same kookoo -- be in the group he hurl himself into the house and up the stair fifteen year pass since he have be in those room he arrive at the door -- it be shut -- it be lock in short further investigation reveal that a youngish lady in black who have be see by several neighbor to enter the house but have not of course be suspect of such remarkable intention have in company with a middle-aged slave-woman take these two room and now at the slightly-opened door proffer a month 's rent in advance what could a landlord do but smile yet there be a pretext leave the room must need repair -- no sir he could look in and see joy he look in all be neatness the floor unbroken the wall crack but a little and the crack close with new plaster no doubt by the jealous hand of ` sieur george himself kookoo 's eye sweep sharply round the two apartment the furniture be all there moreover there be monsieur 's little hair-trunk he should not soon forget that trunk one day fifteen year or more before he have take hold of that trunk to assist monsieur to arrange he apartment and monsieur have draw he fist back and cry to he to drop it _ mai _ there it be look very suspicious in kookoo 's eye and the lady 's domestic as tidy as a yellow-bird go and sit on it could that trunk contain treasure it might for madame want to shut the door and in fact do so the lady be quite handsome -- have be more so but be still young -- speak the beautiful language and keep in the inner room she discreet and taciturn mulattress a tall straight woman with a fierce eye but call by the young creole of the neighborhood confound ' good lookin ' among _ les américaines _ where the new neighbor always expect to be call upon by the older resident this lady might have make friend in spite of be as reserve as ` sieur george but the reverse be the creole custom and she be well pleased to keep she own company choose mystery rather than society the poor landlord be sorely trouble it must not that any thing _ de trop _ take place in he house he watch the two room narrowly but without result save to find that madame ply she needle for pay spend she money for little else besides harpstring and take good care of the little trunk of monsieur this espionage be a good turn to the mistress and maid for when kookoo announce that all be proper no more be say by outsider they landlord never get but one question answer by the middle-aged maid : madame he fear be a litt ' bit embarrass ' _ pour _ money eh _ non _ mademoiselle -lrb- mademoiselle you notice -rrb- have some property but do not want to eat it up sometimes lady-friend come in very elegant private carriage to see she and one or two seem to beg she -- but in vain -- to go away with they but these gradually drop off until lady and servant be alone in the world and so year and the mexican war go by the volunteer come home peace reign and the city go on spread up and down the land but ` sieur george do not return it overrun the country like cocoa-grass field road woodland that be once ` sieur george 's place of retreat from mankind be cover all over with little one-story house in the old third and fine residence and garden up in lafayette street go slice like a butcher 's knife through old colonial estate whose first master never dream of the city reach they -- and ` sieur george be still away the four-story brick get old and ugly and the surroundings dim and dreamy theater procession dry-goods store government establishment bank hotel and all spirit of enterprise be go to canal street and beyond and the very beggar be go with they the little trunk get very old and bald and still its owner linger still the lady somewhat the worse for lapse of time look from the balcony-window in the brief southern twilight and the maid every morning shake a worn rug or two over the dangerous-looking railing and yet neither have make friend or enemy the two room from have be stingily keep at first be need repair half the time and the occupant be often move now into one now back into the other yet the hair-trunk be see only by glimpse the landlord to he infinite chagrin always be a little too late in offer he service the woman whether it be light or heavy have already move it he think it significant late one day of a most bitter winter -- that season when to the ecstatic amazement of a whole city-full of child snow cover the street ankle-deep -- there come a soft tap on the corridor-door of this pair of room the lady open it and behold a tall lank iron-gray man a total stranger standing behind -- monsieur george both man be weather-beaten scar and tattered across ` sieur george 's crown leave a long bare streak through he white hair be the souvenir of a mexican sabre the landlord have accompany they to the door : it be a magnificent opportunity mademoiselle ask they all in and try to furnish a seat to each but fail ` sieur george go straight across the room and _ sit on the hair-trunk _ the action be so conspicuous the landlord lay it up in he penetrative mind ` sieur george be quiet or as it appear quiet the mulattress stand near he and to she he address in a undertone most of the little he say leave mademoiselle to he companion the stranger be a warm talker and seem to please the lady from the first but if he please nothing else do kookoo intensely curious seek some pretext for stay but find none they be altogether a uncongenial company the lady seem to think kookoo have no business there ` sieur george seem to think the same concern he companion and the few word between mademoiselle and ` sieur george be cool enough the maid appear nearly satisfied but could not avoid cast a anxious eye at time upon she mistress naturally the visit be short the next day but one the two gentleman come again in better attire ` sieur george evidently dislike he companion yet would not rid himself of he the stranger be a gesticulate stagy fellow much monsieur 's junior a incessant talker in creole-french always excite on small matter and unable to appreciate a great one once as they be leave kookoo -- accident will happen -- be under the stair as they begin to descend the tall man be speak : -- better to bury it -- the startled landlord hear he say and hold he breath thinking of the trunk but no more be utter a week later they come again a week later they come again a week later they come yet again the landlord 's eye begin to open there must be a courtship in progress it be very plain now why ` sieur george have wish not to be accompany by the rail gentleman but since he visit have become regular and frequent it be equally plain why he do not get rid of he -- because it would not look well to be go and come too often alone maybe it be only this tender passion that the tall man have think better to bury lately there often come sound of gay conversation from the first of the two room which have be turn into a parlor and as week after week the friend come down-stair the tall man be always in high spirit and anxious to embrace ` sieur george who -- sly dog think the landlord -- would try to look grave and only smile in a embarrassed way ah monsieur you tink to be varry conning _ mai _ you not so conning as kookoo no and the inquisitive little man would shake he head and smile and shake he head again as a man have a perfect right to do under the conviction that he have be for twenty year baffle by a riddle and be learn to read it at last he have guess what be in ` sieur george 's head he would by and by guess what be in the trunk a few month pass quickly away and it become apparent to every eye in or about the ancient mansion that the landlord 's guess be not so bad in fact that mademoiselle be to be marry on a certain rainy spring afternoon a single hire hack drive up to the main entrance of the old house and after some little bustle and the gathering of a crowd of damp child about the big doorway ` sieur george muffle in a newly-repaired overcoat jump out and go up-stair a moment later he re-appear lead mademoiselle wreathe and veil down the stairway very fair be mademoiselle still she beauty be mature -- fully ripe -- maybe a little too much so but only a little and as she come down with the ravishing odor of bridal flower float about she she seem the garlanded victim of a pagan sacrifice the mulattress in holiday gear follow behind the landlord owe a duty to the community he arrest the maid on the last step : you mistress she goin ' _ pour marier _ ` sieur george it make I glad glad glad marry ` sieur george non monsieur non not marrie ` sieur george _ mais comment _ she be go to marry the tall gentleman _ diable _ ze long gentyman -- with he hand upon he forehead he watch the carriage trundle away it pass out of sight through the rain he turn to enter the house and all at once totter under the weight of a tremendous thought -- they have leave the trunk he hurl himself up-stairs as he have do seven year before but again -- ah bah -- the door be lock and not a picayune of rent due late that night a small square man in a wet overcoat fumble he way into the damp entrance of the house stumble up the crack stair unlock after many languid effort the door of the two room and fall over the hair-trunk sleep until the morning sunbeam climb over the balcony and in at the window and shone full on the back of he head old kookoo pass the door just then be surprise to find it slightly ajar -- push it open silently and see within ` sieur george in the act of rise from he knee beside the mysterious trunk he have come back to be once more the tenant of the two room ` sieur george for the second time be a changed man -- change from bad to worse from be retire and reticent he have come by reason of advance year or mayhap that which have leave the terrible scar on he face to be garrulous when once in a while employment seek he -lrb- for he never seek employment -rrb- whatever remuneration he receive go its way for something that leave he dingy and threadbare he now make a lively acquaintance with he landlord as indeed with every soul in the neighborhood and tell all he adventure in mexican prison and cuban city include full detail of the hardship and peril experience jointly with the long gentleman who have marry mademoiselle and who be no mexican or cuban but a genuine louisianian it be he that fancy I he say not i he but once he have fall in love with I i have not the force to cast he off how madame ever should have like he be one of those woman 's freak that a man must not expect to understand he be no more fit for she than rag be fit for a queen and i could have choke he head off the night he hug I round the neck and tell I what a suicide she have commit but other fine woman be commit that same folly every day only they do not wait until they be thirty-four or five to do it -- ` why do not i like he ' well for one reason he be a drunkard here kookoo whose imperfect knowledge of english prevent he intelligent reception of the story would laugh as if the joke come in just at this point however with all monsieur 's prattle he never drop a word about the man he have be before he go away and the great hair-trunk puzzle be still the same puzzle grow greater every day thus the two room have be the scene of some event quite queer if not really strange but the queerest that ever they present i guess be ` sieur george come in there one day cry like a little child and bearing in he arm a infant -- a girl -- the lovely offspring of the drunkard whom he so detest and poor rob spirit-broken and now dead madame he take good care of the orphan for orphan she be very soon the long gentleman be pull out of the old basin one morning and ` sieur george identify the body at the trémé station he never hire a nurse -- the father have sell the lady 's maid quite out of sight so he bring she through all the little ill and around all the sharp corner of baby-life and childhood without a human hand to help he until one evening have persistently shut he eye to it for week and month like one try to sleep in the sunshine he awake to the realization that she be a woman it be a smoky one in November the first cool day of autumn the sunset be dim by the smoke of burn prairie the air be full of the ash of grass and reed ragged urchin be lug home stick of cordwood and when a bit of coal fall from a cart in front of kookoo 's old house a child be boxed half across the street and rob of the booty by a _ blanchisseuse de fin _ from over the way the old man come home quite steady he mount the stair smartly without stop to rest go with a step unusually light and quiet to he chamber and sit by the window opening upon the rusty balcony it be a small room sadly change from what it have be in old time but then so be ` sieur george close and dark it be the wall stain with dampness and the ceiling full of bald place that show the lathe the furniture be cheap and meager include conspicuously the small curious-looking hair-trunk the floor be of wide slab fasten down with spike and slope up and down in one or two broad undulation as if they have drift far enough down the current of time to feel the tide-swell however the floor be clean the bed well make the cypress table in place and the musty smell of the wall partly neutralize by a geranium on the window-sill he so come in and sit down a unseen person call from the room adjoining -lrb- of which also he be still the rentee -rrb- to know if he be he and be answer in the affirmative say papa george guess who be here to-day kookoo for the rent yes but he will not come back no why not because you will not pay he no and why not because i have pay he impossible where do you get the money can not guess -- mother nativity what not for embroidery no and why not _ mais oui _ -- say which and with a pleasant laugh the speaker enter the room she be a girl of sixteen or thereabout very beautiful with very black hair and eye a face and form more entirely out of place you could not have find in the whole city she sit herself at he foot and with she interlocked hand upon he knee and she face full of childish innocence mingle with womanly wisdom turn to he appear for a time to take principal part in a conversation which of course could not be overhear in the corridor outside whatever be say she presently rise he open he arm and she sit on he knee and kiss he this do there be a silence both smile pensively and gaze out over the rotten balcony into the street after a while she start up say something about the change of weather and slip away thrust a match between the bar of the grate the old man turn about to the fire and she from she little room bring a low sewing-chair and sit beside he lay she head on he knee and he stroke she brow with he brown palm and then in a altered -- a low sad tone -- he begin a monotonous recital thus they sit he talk very steadily and she listen until all the neighborhood be wrap in slumber -- all the neighbor but not kookoo kookoo in he old age have become a great eavesdropper he ear and eye take turn at the keyhole that night for he tell thing that be not intend for outside hearer he hear the girl sob and the old man say but you must go now you can not stay with I safely or decently much as i wish it the lord only know how i be to bear it or where you be to go but he be you lord child and he 'll make a place for you i be you grandfather 's death i fritter you poor dead mother 's fortune away : let that be the last damage i do i have always mean everything for the best he add half in soliloquy from all kookoo could gather he must have be tell she the very story just recount she have drop quite to the floor hide she face in she hand and be say between she sob i can not go papa george oh papa george i can not go just then ` sieur george kaving keep a good resolution all day be encourage by the orphan 's pitiful tone to contemplate the most senseless act he ever attempt to commit he say to the sob girl that she be not of he blood that she be nothing to he by natural tie that he covenant be with she grandsire to care for he offspring and though it have be poorly keep it might be break it worse than ever to turn she out upon ever so kind a world i have try to be good to you all these year when i take you a wee little baby i take you for better or worse i intend to do well by you all you childhood-day and to do best at last i think surely we should be live well by this time and you could choose from a world full of home and a world full of friend i do not see how i miss it here he pause a moment in meditation and presently resume with some suddenness : i think that education far better than mother nativity have give you should have afford you sweet charm a noble setting that good mother and sister would be want to count you into they family and that the blossom of a happy womanhood would open perfect and full of sweetness i would have give my life for it i do give it such as it be but it be a very poor concern i know -- my life -- and not enough to buy any good thing i have have a thought of something but i be afraid to tell it it do not come to I to-day or yesterday it have beset I a long time -- for month the girl gaze into the ember listen intensely and oh dearie if i could only get you to think the same way you might stay with I then how long she ask without stir oh be long as heaven should let we but there be only one chance he say as it be feel he way only one way for we to stay together do you understand I she look up at the old man with a glance of painful inquiry if you could be -- my wife dearie she utter a low distressful cry and glide swiftly into she room for the first time in she young life turn the key between they and the old man sit and weep then kookoo peer through the keyhole see that they have be look into the little trunk the lid be up but the back be toward the door and he could see no more than if it have be close he stoop and stare into the aperture until he dry old knee be ready to crack it seem as if ` sieur george be stone only stone could not weep like that every separate bone in he neck be hot with pain he would have give ten dollar -- ten sweet dollar -- to have see ` sieur george get up and turn that trunk around there ` sieur george rise up -- what a face he start toward the bed and as he come to the trunk he pause look at it mutter something about ruin and something about fortune kick the lid down and throw himself across the bed small profit to old kookoo that he go to he own couch sleep be not for the little landlord for well-nigh half a century he have suspect he tenant of have a treasure hide in he house and to-night he have hear he own admission that in the little trunk be a fortune kookoo have never feel so poor in all he day before he feel a creole 's anger too that a tenant should be the holder of wealth while he landlord suffer poverty and he know very well too do kookoo what the tenant would do if he do not know what he keep in the trunk he know what he keep behind it and he know he would take enough of it to-night to make he sleep soundly no one would ever have suppose kookoo capable of a crime he be too fearfully impressed with the extra-hazardous risk of dishonesty he be old too and weak and besides all intensely a coward nevertheless while it be yet two or three hour before daybreak the sleep-forsaken little man arise shuffle into he garment and in he stocking-feet seek the corridor lead to ` sieur george 's apartment the November night as it often do in that region have grow warm and clear the star be sparkling like diamond pendent in the deep blue heaven and at every window and lattice and cranny the broad bright moon pour down its glitter beam upon the hoary-headed thief as he creep along the moulder gallery and down the ancient corridor that lead to ` sieur george 's chamber ` sieur george 's door though ever so slowly open protest with a loud creak the landlord wet with cold sweat from head to foot and shake till the floor

and ten thousand odd scrap of writing-paper strew with crumb of lonely lunch and intersperse with long-lost spatula and rust-eaten lancet all new orlean at least all creole new orlean know and yet do not know the dear little doctor so gentle so kind so skilful so patient so lenient so careless of the rich and so attentive to the poor a man all in all such as should you once love he you would love he forever so very learn too but with apparently no idea of how to _ show himself _ to he social profit -- two feature much more smile at than respect not to say admire by a people remote from the seat of learning and spending most of they esteem upon animal heroism and exterior display alas say he wealthy acquaintance what a pity when he might as well be rich yes he father have plenty certainly and give it freely but intend he son shall see none of it he son you dare not so much as mention he well well how strange but they can never agree -- not even upon they name be not that

washington say he could not why no doubt she and she friend generally look upon it as a mere question of enterprise she have charm too of intellect -- albeit not such a sinner against time and place as to be a educate woman -- charm that even in a plainer person would have bring down the half of new orlean upon one knee with both hand on the left side _ she _ have the _ whole _ city at she foot and with the fine tact which be the perfection of she character keep it there contented madame be in short one of the kind that gracefully wrest from society the prerogative of do as they please and

hurriedly from the place while the editor complacently resume he pen assure that he would not return general villivicencio sit and wait among the serpent and innocent he spirit begin to droop again revolving mossy 's word he could not escape the fear that possibly after all he son might compromise the villivicencio honor in the interest of peace not that he prefer to put he son 's life in jeopardy he would not object to a adjustment provide the enemy should beg for it but if not whom would he son select to perform those friendly office indispensable in polite quarrel some half-priest

open the door to whom half rise from he chair he answer with a polite smile that the doctor be out nor could he say how long he might be absent still the time drag painfully and he begin at length to
