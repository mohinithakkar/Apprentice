can not begin the preface in a manner more satisfactory to the feeling of the benevolent reader than by give a account of those humane and worthy person who have endeavor to draw upon it that share of the publick attention which it have obtain among the well disposed individual of different nation and age who have humanely exert themselves to suppress the abject personal slavery introduce in the original cultivation of the _ european _ colony in the western world _ bartholomew de las casas _ the pious bishop of _ chiapa _ in the fifteenth century seem to have be the first this amiable man during he residence in _ spanish america _ be so sensibly affect at the treatment which the miserable indian undergo that he return to _ spain _ to make a publick remonstrance before the celebrated emperor _ charle _ the fifth declare that heaven would one day call he to a account for those cruelty which he then have it in he power to prevent the speech which he make on the occasion be now extant and be a most perfect picture of benevolence and piety but he intreaty by opposition of avarice be render ineffectual : and i do not find by any book which i have read upon the subject that any other person interfere till the last century when _ morgan godwyn _ a _ british _ clergyman distinguish himself in the cause the present age have also produce some zealous and able opposer of the _ colonial _ slavery for about the middle of the present century _ john woolman _ and _ anthony benezet _ two respectable member of the religious society call quaker devoted much of they time to the subject the former travel through most part of _ north america _ on foot to hold conversation with the member of he own sect on the impiety of retain those in a state of involuntary servitude who have never give they offence the latter keep a free school at _ philadelphium _ for the education of black people he take every opportunity of plead in they behalf he publish several treatise against slavery -lrb- 001 -rrb- and give a hearty proof of he attachment to the cause by leave the whole of he fortune in support of that school to which he have so generously devoted he time and attention when alive till this time it do not appear that any body of man have collectively interested themselves in endeavor to remedy the evil but in the year 1754 the religious society call quaker publickly testify they sentiment upon the subject -lrb- 002 -rrb- declare that to live in ease and plenty by the toil of those whom fraud and violence have put into they power be neither consistent with christianity nor common justice impress with these sentiment many of this society immediately liberate they slave and though such a measure appear to be attend with considerable loss to the benevolent individual who unconditionally present they with they freedom yet they adopt it with pleasure : nobly consider that to possess a little in a honorable way be better than to possess much through the medium of injustice they example be gradually follow by the rest a general emancipation of the slave in the possession of quaker at length take place and so effectually do they serve the cause which they have undertake that they deny the claim of membership in they religious community to all such as should hereafter oppose the suggestion of justice in this particular either by retain slave in they possession or by be in any manner concern in the slave trade : and it be a fact that through the vast tract of north america there be not at this day a single slave in the possession of a acknowledged quaker but though this measure appear as have be observe before to be attend with considerable loss to the benevolent individual who adopt it yet as virtue seldom fail of obtain its reward it become ultimately beneficial most of the slave who be thus unconditionally free return without any solicitation to they former master to serve they at state wages as free man the work which they now do be find to better do than before it be find also that a greater quantity be do in the same time hence less than the former number of labourer be sufficient from these and a variety of circumstance it appear that they plantation be considerably more profitable when work by free man than when work as before by slave and that they derive therefore contrary to they expectation a considerable advantage from they benevolence animated by the example of the quaker the member of other sect begin to deliberate about adopt the same measure some of those of the church of england of the roman catholick and of the presbyterian and independant free they slave and there happen but one instance where the matter be debate where it be not immediately put in force this be in _ pennsylvanium _ it be agitate in the synod of the presbyterian there to oblige they member to liberate they slave the question be negative by a majority of but one person and this opposition seem to arise rather from a dislike to the attempt of force such a measure upon the member of that community than from any other consideration i have the pleasure of be credibly inform that the manumission of slave or the employment of free man in the plantation be now daily gain ground in north america should slavery be abolish there -lrb- and it be a event which from these circumstance we may reasonably expect to be produce in time -rrb- let it be remember that the quaker will have have the merit of its abolition nor have they brethren here be less assiduous in the cause as there be happily no slave in this country so they have not have the same opportunity of shew they benevolence by a general emancipation they have not however omit to shew it as far as they have be able at they religious meeting they have regularly inquire if any of they member be concern in the iniquitous _ african _ trade they have appoint a committee for obtain every kind of information on the subject with a view to its suppression and about three or four year ago petition parliament on the occasion for they interference and support i be sorry to add that they benevolent application be ineffectual and that the reformation of a evil productive of consequence equally impolitick and immoral and generally acknowledge to have long disgraced we national character be yet leave to the unsupported effort of piety morality and justice against interest violence and oppression and these i blush to acknowledge too strongly countenance by the legislative authority of a country the basis of whose government be _ liberty _ nothing can be more clearly shewn than that a inexhaustible mine of wealth be neglect in _ africa _ for prosecution of this impious traffick that if proper measure be take the revenue of this country might be greatly improve its naval strength increase its colony in a more flourishing situation the planter richer and a trade which be now a scene of blood and desolation convert into one which might be prosecute with _ advantage _ and _ honor _ such have be the exertion of the quaker in the cause of humanity and virtue they be still prosecute as far as they be able they benevolent design and i should stop here and praise they for thus continue they humane endeavor but that i conceive it to be unnecessary they be act consistently with the principle of religion they will find a reward in they own conscience and they will receive more real pleasure from a single reflection on they conduct than they can possibly experience from the praise of a host of writer in give this short account of those humane and worthy person who have endeavor to restore to they fellow creature the rights of nature of which they have be unjustly deprive i would feel myself unjust be i to omit two zealous opposer of the _ colonial _ tyranny conspicuous at the present day the first be mr _ granville sharp _ this gentleman have particularly distinguish himself in the cause of freedom it be a notorious fact that but a few year since many of the unfortunate black people who have be bring from the colony into this country be sell in the metropolis to merchant and other when they master have no farther occasion for they service though it be always understand that every person be free as soon as he land on the british shore in consequence of this notion these unfortunate black people refuse to go to the new master to whom they be consign they be however seize and forcibly convey under cover of the night to ship then lie in the _ thame _ to be retransport to the colony and to be deliver again to the planter as merchantable goods the humane mr _ sharpe _ be the means of put a stop to this iniquitous traffick whenever he gain information of people in such a situation he cause they to be bring on shore at a considerable expence he undertake they cause and be instrumental in obtain the famous decree in the case of _ somersett _ that as soon as any person whatever set he foot in this country he come under the protection of the _ british _ law and be consequently free nor do he interfere less honourably in that cruel and disgraceful case in the summer of the year 1781 when _ a hundred and thirty two _ negro in they passage to the colony be throw into the sea alive to defraud the underwriter but he pious endeavor be by no means attend with the same success to enumerate he many laudable endeavor in the extirpation of tyranny and oppression would be to swell the preface into a volume : suffice it to say that he have write several book on the subject and one particularly which he distinguish by the title of _ a limitation of slavery _ the second be the _ rev jame ramsay _ this gentleman reside for many year in the _ west-indy _ in the clerical office he peruse all the colonial code of law with a view to find if there be any favourable clause by which the grievance of slave could be redress but he be severely disappoint in he pursuit he publish a treatise since he return to england call _ a essay on the treatment and conversion of african slave in the british sugar colony _ which i recommend to the perusal of the humane reader this work reflect great praise upon the author since in order to be of service to this singularly oppressed part of the human species he compile it at the expence of forfeit that friendship which he have contract with many in those part during a series of year and at the hazard as i be credibly inform of suffer much in he private property as well as of subject himself to the ill will and persecution of numerous individual this essay _ on the treatment and conversion of african slave _ contain so many important truth on the colonial slavery and have come so home to the planter -lrb- be write by a person who have a thorough knowledge of the subject -rrb- as to have occasion a considerable alarm within the last eight month two publication have expressly appear against it one of they be intitle _ cursory remark _ on mr ramsay 's essay the other a _ apology for negroe slavery _ on each of these i be bind as write on the subject to make a few remark the _ cursory remarker _ insinuate that mr ramsay 's account of the treatment be greatly exaggerate if not wholly false to this i shall make the following reply i have the honor of know several disinterested gentleman who have be acquaint with the west indian island for year i call they disinterested because they have neither have a concern in the _ african _ trade nor in the _ colonial _ slavery : and i have hear these unanimously assert that mr _ ramsay 's _ account be so far from be exaggerated or take from the most dreary picture that he could find that it be absolutely below the truth that he must have omit many instance of cruelty which he have see himself and that they only wonder how he could have write with so much moderation upon the subject they allow the _ cursory remark _ to be excellent as a composition but declare that it be perfectly devoid of truth but the _ cursory remarker _ do not depend so much on the circumstance which he have advance -lrb- nor can he since they have no other existence than in he own brain -rrb- as on the instrument _ detraction _ this he have use with the utmost virulence through the whole of he publication artfully suppose that if he could bring mr _ ramsay 's _ reputation into dispute he work would fall of course as of no authenticity i submit this simple question to the reader when a writer in attempt to silence a publication attack the character of its author rather than the principle of the work itself be it not a proof that the work itself be unquestionable and that this writer be at a loss to find a argument against it but there be something so very ungenerous in this mode of replication as to require farther notice for if this be the mode to be adopt in literary dispute what writer can be safe or who be there that will not be deter from take up he pen in the cause of virtue there be circumstance in every person 's life which if give to the publick in a malevolent manner and without explanation might essentially injure he in the eye of the world though be they explain they would be even reputable the _ cursory remarker _ have adopt this method of dispute but mr _ ramsay _ have explain himself to the satisfaction of all party and have refute he in every point the name of this _ cursory remarker _ be _ tobin _ : a name which i feel myself oblige to hand down with detestation as far as i be able and with a hint to future writer that they will do themselves more credit and serve more effectually the cause which they undertake if on such occasion they attack the work rather than the character of the writer who afford they a subject for they lucubration nor be this the only circumstance which induce I to take such particular notice of the _ cursory remark _ i feel it incumbent upon I to rescue a injured person from the cruel aspersion that have be throw upon he as i have be repeatedly inform by those who have the pleasure of he acquaintance that he character be irreproachable i be also interested myself for if such detraction be pass over in silence my own reputation and not my work may be attack by a anonymous hireling in the cause of slavery the _ apology for negroe slavery _ be almost too despicable a composition to merit a reply i have only therefore to observe -lrb- as be frequently the case in a bad cause or where writer do not confine themselves to truth -rrb- that the work refute itself this writer speaking of the slave-trade assert that people be never kidnap on the coast of _ africa _ in speaking of the treatment of slave he assert again that it be of the very mildest nature and that they live in the most comfortable and happy manner imaginable to prove each of he assertion he propose the follow regulation that the _ steal _ of slave from _ africa _ should be felony that the _ premeditated murder _ of a slave by any person on board should come under the same denomination that when slave arrive in the colony land should be allot for they provision _ in proportion to they number _ or commissioner should see that a _ sufficient _ quantity of _ sound wholesome _ provision be purchase that they should not work on _ sunday _ and _ other _ holy-day that extra labor or _ night-work out of crop _ should be prohibit that a _ limited number _ of stripe should be inflict upon they that they should have _ annually _ a suit of clothes that old infirm slave should be _ properly care for _ & c -- now it can hardly be conceive that if this author have try to injure he cause or contradict himself he could not have do it in a more effectual manner than by this proposal of these salutary regulation for to say that slave be honourably obtain on the coast to say that they treatment be of the mildest nature and yet to propose the above-mentioned regulation as necessary be to refute himself more clearly than i confess myself to be able to do it : and i have only to request that the regulation propose by this writer in the defense of slavery may be consider as so many proof of the assertion contain in my own work i shall close my account with a observation which be of great importance in the present case of all the publication in favor of the slave-trade or the subsequent slavery in the colony there be not one which have not be write either by a chaplain to the african factory or by a merchant or by a planter or by a person whose interest have be connect in the cause which he have take upon he to defend of this description be mr _ tobin _ and the _ apologist for negroe slavery _ while on the other hand those who have have as competent a knowledge of the subject but not the _ same interest _ as themselves have unanimously condemn it and many of they have write they sentiment upon it at the hazard of create a innumerable host of enemy and of be subject to the most malignant opposition now which of these be we to believe on the occasion be we to believe those who be party concern who be interested in the practice -- but the question do not admit of a dispute concern my own work it seem proper to observe that when the original latin dissertation as the title page express be honor by the university of cambridge with the first of they annual prize for the year 1785 i be wait upon by some gentleman of respectability and consequence who request I to publish it in english the only objection which occur to I be this that have be prevent by a attention to other study from obtain that critical knowledge of my own language which be necessary for a english composition i be fearful of appear before the publick eye : but that as they flatter I with the hope that the publication of it might be of use i would certainly engage to publish it if they would allow I to postpone it for a little time till i be more in the habit of write they reply that as the publick attention be now excite to the case of the unfortunate _ african _ it would be serve the cause with double the effect if it be to be publish within a few month this argument prevail nothing but this circumstance could have induce I to offer a english composition to the inspection of a host of critick : and i trust therefore that this circumstance will plead much with the benevolent reader in favor of those fault which he may find in the present work have thus promise to publish it i be for some time doubtful from which of the copy to translate there be two the original and a abridgement the latter -lrb- as these academical composition be generally of a certain length -rrb- be that which be send down to cambridge and honor with the prize i be determine however upon consult with my friend to translate from the former this have be faithfully do with but few -lrb- 003 -rrb- addition the reader will probably perceive the latin idiom in several passage of the work though i have endeavor as far as i have be able to avoid it and i be so sensible of the disadvantage under which it must yet lie as a translation that i wish i have write upon the subject without any reference at all to the original copy it will perhaps be ask from what authority i have collect those fact which relate to the colonial slavery i reply that i have have the means of the very best of information on the subject have the pleasure of be acquaint with many both in the naval and military department as well as with several other who have be long acquaint with _ america _ and the _ west-indian _ island the fact therefore which i have relate be compile from the disinterested account of these gentleman all of whom i have the happiness to say have coincide in the minutest manner in they description it mud be remark too that they be compile not from what these gentleman hear while they be resident in those part but from what they actually _ saw _ nor have a single instance be take from any book whatever upon the subject except that which be mention in the 235th page and this book be publish in _ france _ in the year 1777 by _ authority _ i have now the pleasure to say that the account of these disinterested gentleman whom i consult on the occasion be confirm by all the book which i have ever peruse upon slavery except those which have be write by _ merchant planter & c _ they be confirm by sir _ han sloane 's _ voyage to barbado _ griffith hughe 's _ history of the same island print 1750 a account of north america by _ thoma jeffry _ 1761 all _ benezet 's _ work & c & c and particularly by mr _ ramsay 's _ essay on the treatment and conversion of the african slave in the british sugar colony a work which be now firmly establish and i may add in a very extraordinary manner in consequence of the controversy which this gentleman have sustain with the _ cursory remarker _ by which several fact which be mention in the original copy of my own work before the controversy begin and which have never appear in any work upon the subject have be bring to light nor have it receive less support from a letter publish only last week from capt js smith of the royal navy to the rev mr hill on the former of whom too high encomium can not be bestow for stand forth in that noble and disinterested manner in behalf of a injured character i have now only to solicit the reader again that he will make a favourable allowance for the present work not only from those circumstance which i have mention but from the consideration that only two month be allow by the university for these they annual composition should he however be unpropitious to my request i must console myself with the reflection -lrb- a reflection that will always afford I pleasure even amidst the censure of the great -rrb- that by undertake the cause of the unfortunate _ african _ i have undertake as far as my ability would permit the cause of injured innocence london June 1st 1786 \* \*

essay on the slavery and commerce of the human species in three part \* \* \* \* \* part i the history of slavery \* \* \* \* \* chap i when civilized as well as barbarous nation have be find through a long succession of age uniformly to concur in the same custom there seem to arise a presumption that such custom be not only eminently useful but be found also on the principle of justice such be the case with respect to _ slavery _ : it have have the concurrence of all the nation which history have record and the repeat practice of age from the remotest antiquity in its favor here then be a argument deduce from the general consent and agreement of mankind in favor of the propose subject : but alas when we reflect that the people thus reduce to a state of servitude have have the same feeling with ourselves when we reflect that they have have the same propensity to pleasure and the same aversion from pain another argument seem immediately to arise in opposition to the former deduce from we own feeling and that divine sympathy which nature have implant in we breast for the most useful and generous of purpose to ascertain the truth therefore where two such opposite source of argument occur where the force of custom plead strongly on the one hand and the feeling of humanity on the other be a matter of much importance as the dignity of human nature be concerned and the rights and liberty of mankind will be involve in its discussion it will be necessary before this point can be determine to consult the history of slavery and to lay before the reader in as concise a manner as possible a general view of it from its earliest appearance to the present day the first whom we shall mention here to have be reduce to a state of servitude may be comprehend in that class which be usually denominate the _ mercenary _ it consist of free-born citizen who from the various contingency of fortune have become so poor as to have recourse for they support to the service of the rich of this kind be those both among the egyptian and the jew who be record in the sacred writings -lrb- 004 -rrb- the grecian _ thete _ -lrb- 005 -rrb- also be of this description as well as those among the roman from whom the class receive its appellation the -lrb- 006 -rrb- _ mercenarii _ we may observe of the above-mentioned that they situation be in many instance similar to that of we own servant there be a express contract between the party they could most of they demand they discharge if they be ill use by they respective master and they be treat therefore with more humanity than those whom we usually distinguish in we language by the appellation of _ slave _ as this class of servant be compose of man who have be reduce to such a situation by the contingency of fortune and not by they own misconduct so there be another among the ancient compose entirely of those who have suffer the loss of liberty from they own imprudence to this class may be reduce the grecian _ prodigal _ who be detain in the service of they creditor till the fruit of they labor be equivalent to they debt the _ delinquent _ who be sentence to the oar and the german _ enthusiast _ as mention by tacitus who be so immoderately charm with gaming as when every thing else be go to have stake they liberty and they very selve the loser say he go into a voluntary servitude and though younger and stronger than the person with whom he play patiently suffer himself to be bind and sell they perseverance in so bad a custom be stile honor the slave thus obtain be immediately exchange away in commerce that the winner may get rid of the scandal of he victory to enumerate other instance would be unnecessary it will be sufficient to observe that the servant of this class be in a far more wretched situation than those of the former they drudgery be more intense they treatment more severe and there be no retreat at pleasure from the frown and lash of they despotick master have premise this we may now proceed to a general division of slavery into _ voluntary _ and _ involuntary _ the _ voluntary _ will comprehend the two class which we have already mention for in the first instance there be a _ contract _ found on _ consent _ and in the second there be a _ choice _ of engage or not in those practice the known consequence of which be servitude the _ involuntary _ on the other hand will comprehend those who be force without any such _ condition _ or _ choice _ into a situation which as it tend to degrade a part of the human species and to class it with the brutal must have be of all human situation the most wretched and insupportable these be they whom we shall consider solely in the present work we shall therefore take we leave of the former as they be mention only that we might state the question with greater accuracy and be the better enable to reduce it to its proper limit \* \* \* \* \* footnote -lrb- footnote 004 : genesis ch 47 leviticus xxv v 39 40 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 005 : the _ thete _ appear very early in the grecian history -- kai tine auto kourous epont ` ithakes exairetoi he eoi autou thentes te dmo -lrb- -rrb- te od homer d 642 they be afterwards so much in

c -rrb- \* \* \* \* \* chap ii the first that will be mention of the _ involuntary _ be _ prisoner of war _ -lrb- 007 -rrb- it be a law establish from time immemorial among the nation of antiquity to oblige those to undergo the severity of servitude whom victory have throw into they hand conformably with this we find all the eastern nation unanimous in the practice the same custom prevail among the people of the west for as the helot become the slave of the spartan from the right of conquest only so prisoner of war be reduce to the same situation by the rest of the inhabitant of greece by the same principle that actuate these be the roman also influence they history will confirm the fact : for how many city be record to have be take how many army to have be vanquish in the field and the wretched survivor in both instance to have be doom to servitude it remain only now to observe in shewing this custom to have be universal that all those nation which assist in overturn the roman empire though many and various adopt the same measure for we find it a general maxim in they polity that whoever should fall into they hand as a prisoner of war should immediately be reduce to the condition of a slave it may here perhaps be not unworthy of remark that the _ involuntary _ be of greater antiquity than the _ voluntary _ slave the latter be first mention in the time of pharaoh : they could have arise only in a state of society when property after its division have become so unequal as to multiply the want of individual and when government after its establishment have give security to the possessor by the punishment of crime whereas the former seem to be date with more propriety from the day of nimrod who give rise probably to that inseparable idea of _ victory _ and _ servitude _ which we find among the nation of antiquity and which have exist uniformly since in one country or another to the present day -lrb- 008 -rrb- add to this that they might have arise even in

chap iii but it be not victory alone or any presuppose right found in the damages of war that afford a pretence for invade the liberty of mankind : the honorable light in which _ piracy _ be consider in the uncivilized age of the world contribute not a little to the _ slavery _ of the human species piracy have a very early beginning the grecian -lrb- 009 -rrb- say thucydide in they primitive state as well as the contemporary barbarian who inhabit the sea coast and island give themselves wholly to it it be in short they only profession and support the writings of homer be sufficient of themselves to establish this account they shew it to have be a common practice at so early a period as that of the trojan war and abound with many lively description of it which have they be as groundless as they be beautiful would have frequently spare the sigh of the reader of sensibility and reflection the piracy which be thus practice in the early age may be consider as _ publick _ or _ private _ in the former whole crew embark for the benefit -lrb- 010 -rrb- of they respective tribe they make descent on the sea coast carry off cattle surprize whole village put many of the inhabitant to the sword and carry other into slavery in the latter individual only be concerned and the emolument be they own these land from they ship and go up into the country conceal themselves in the wood and thicket where they wait every opportunity of catch the unfortunate shepherd or husbandman alone in this situation they sally out upon he drag he on board convey he to a foreign market and sell he for a slave to this kind of piracy ulyss allude in opposition to the former which he have be just before mention in he question to eumoeus do pirate wait till all thy friend be go to catch thee singly with thy flock alone say do they force thee from thy fleecy care and from thy field transport and sell thee here -lrb- 011 -rrb- but no picture perhaps of this mode of depredation be equal to that with which -lrb- 012 -rrb- xenophon present we in the simple narrative of a dance he inform we that the grecian army have conclude a peace with the paphlagonian and that they entertain they embassador in consequence with a banquet and the exhibition of various feat of activity when the thracian say he have perform the part allot they in this entertainment some aenianian and magnetian soldier rise up and accoutr in they proper arm exhibit that dance which be call _ karpoea _ the figure of it be thus one of they in the character of a husbandman be see to till he land and be observe as he drive he plough to look frequently behind he as if apprehensive of danger another immediately appear in fight in the character of a robber the husbandman have see he previously advance snatch up he arm a battle ensue before the plough the whole of this performance be keep in perfect time with the musick of the flute at length the robber have get the better of the husbandman bind he and drive he off with he team sometimes it happen that the husbandman subdue the robber : in this case the scene be only reverse as the latter be then bind and drive off by the former it be scarcely necessary to observe that this dance be a representation of the general manners of man in the more uncivilized age of the world shew that the husbandman and shepherd live in continual alarm and that there be people in those age who derive they pleasure and fortune from _ kidnapping _ and _ enslave _ they fellow creature we may now take notice of a circumstance in this narration which will lead we to a review of we first assertion on this point that the honorable light in which _ piracy _ be consider in the time of barbarism contribute not a little to the _ slavery _ of the human species the robber be represent here as frequently defeat in he attempt and as reduce to that deplorable situation to which he be endeavor to bring another this shew the frequent difficulty and danger of he undertaking : people would not tamely resign they life or liberty without a struggle they be sometimes prepare be superior often in many point of view to these invader of they liberty there be a hundred accidental circumstance frequently in they favor these adventure therefore require all the skill strength agility valor and every thing in short that may be suppose to constitute heroism to conduct they with success upon this idea piratical expedition first come into repute and they frequency afterwards together with the danger and fortitude that be inseparably connect with they bring they into such credit among the barbarous nation of antiquity that of all human profession piracy be the most honorable -lrb- 013 -rrb- the notion then which be thus annex to piratical expedition do not fail to produce those consequence which we have mention before they afford a opportunity to the view of avarice and ambition to conceal themselves under the mask of virtue they excite a spirit of enterprize of all other the most irresistible as it subsist on the strongest principle of action emolument and honor thus could the vilest of passion be gratify with impunity people be rob steal murder under the pretended idea that these be reputable adventure : every enormity in short be commit and dress up in the habiliment of honor but as the notion of man in the less barbarous age which follow become more correct and refine the practice of piracy begin gradually to disappear it have hitherto be support on the grand column of _ emolument _ and _ honor _ when the latter therefore be remove it receive a considerable shock but alas it have still a pillar for its support _ avarice _ which exist in all state and which be ready to turn every invention to its own end strain hard for its preservation it have be produce in the age of barbarism it have be point out in those age as lucrative and under this notion it be continue people be still steal many be intercept -lrb- some in they pursuit of pleasure other in the discharge of they several occupation -rrb- by they own countryman who previously lay in wait for they and sell they afterwards for slave while other seize by merchant who trade on the different coast be tear from they friend and connection and carry into slavery the merchant of thessaly if we can credit aristophane -lrb- 014 -rrb- who never spare the vice of the time be particularly infamous for the latter kind of depredation the athenian be notorious for the former for they have practice these robbery to such a alarming degree of danger to individual that it be find necessary to enact a law -lrb- 015 -rrb- which punish kidnapper with death -- but this be sufficient for we present purpose it will enable we to assert that there be two class of _ involuntary _ slave among the ancient of those who be take publickly in a state of war and of those who be privately steal in a state of innocence and peace we may now add that the child and descendent of these compose a

life of servitude to enumerate they various employment and to describe the misery which they endure in consequence either from the severity or the long and constant application of they labor would exceed the bound we have propose to the present work we shall confine ourselves to they _ personal treatment _ as depend on the power of they master and the protection of the law they treatment if consider in this light will equally excite we pity and abhorrence they be beat starve tortured murder at discretion : they be dead in a civil sense they have neither name nor tribe be incapable of a judicial process be in short without appeal poor unfortunate man to be deprive of all possible protection to suffer the bitterest of injury without the possibility of redress to be condemn unheard to be murder with impunity to be consider as dead in that state the very member of which they be support by they labor yet such be they general situation : there be two place however where they condition if consider in this point of view be more tolerable the ægyptian slave though perhaps of all other the greatest drudge yet if he have time to reach the temple -lrb- 016 -rrb- of hercule find a certain retreat from the persecution of he master and he receive additional comfort from the reflection that he life whether he could reach it or not could not be take with impunity wise and salutary law -lrb- 017 -rrb- how often must it have curb the insolence of power and stop those passion in they progress which have otherwise be destructive to the slave but though the person of slave be thus greatly secure in ægypt yet there be no place so favourable to they as athen they be allow a greater liberty of speech -lrb- 018 -rrb- they have they convivial meeting they amours they hour of relaxation pleasantry and mirth they be treat in short with so much humanity in general as to occasion that observation of demosthene in he second philippick that the condition of a slave at athen be preferable to that of a free citizen in many other country but if any exception happen -lrb- which be sometimes the case -rrb- from the general treatment describe if persecution take the place of lenity and make the fang of servitude more pointed than before -lrb- 019 -rrb- they have then they temple like the ægyptian for refuge where the legislature be so attentive as to examine they complaint and to order they if they be found in justice to be sell to another master nor be this all : they have a privilege infinitely greater than the whole of these they be allow a opportunity of work for themselves and if they diligence have procure they a sum equivalent with they ransom they could immediately on pay it down -lrb- 020 -rrb- demand they freedom for ever this law be of all other the most important as the prospect of liberty which it afford must have be a continual source of the most please reflection and have greatly sweeten the draught even of the most bitter slavery thus then to the eternal honor of ægypt and athen they be the only place that we can find where slave be consider with any humanity at all the rest of the world seem to vie with each other in the debasement and oppression of these unfortunate people they use they with as much severity as they choose they measure they treatment only by they own passion and caprice and by leave they on every occasion without the possibility of a appeal they render they situation the most melancholy and intolerable that can possibly be conceive \* \* \* \* \* footnote -lrb- footnote 016 : herodotus l 2 113

mention the barbarous and inhuman treatment that generally fall to the lot of slave it may not be amiss to inquire into the various circumstance by which it be produce the first circumstance from whence it originate be the _ commerce _ : for if man could be consider as _ possession _ if like _ cattle _ they could be _ buy _ and _ sell _ it will not be difficult to suppose that they could be hold in the same consideration or treat in the same manner the commerce therefore which be begin in the primitive age of the world by class they with the brutal species and by habituate the mind to consider the term of _ brute _ and _ slave _ as _ synonimous _ soon cause they to be view in a low and despicable light and as greatly inferior to the human species hence proceed that treatment which might not unreasonably be suppose to arise from so low a estimation they be tame like beast by the sting of hunger and the lash and they education be direct to the same end to make they commodious instrument of labor for they possessor this _ treatment _ which thus proceed in the age of barbarism from the low estimation in which slave be unfortunately hold from the circumstance of the commerce do not fail of produce in the same instant its _ own _ effect it depress they mind it numb they faculty and by prevent those spark of genius from blaze forth which have otherwise be conspicuous it give they the appearance of be endue with inferior capacity than the rest of mankind this effect of the _ treatment _ have make so considerable a progress as to have be a matter of observation in the day of homer for half _ he _ sens jove convey away _ whom _ once he doom to see the _ servile _ day -lrb- 021 -rrb- thus then do the _ commerce _ by class they originally with _ brute _ and the consequent _ treatment _ by cramp they _ ability _ and hinder they from become _ conspicuous _ give to these unfortunate people at a very early period the most unfavourable _ appearance _ the rise generation who receive both the commerce and treatment from they ancestor and who have always be accustom to behold they _ effect _ do not consider these _ effect _ as _ incidental _ : they judge only from what they see they believe the _ appearance _ to be _ real _ and hence arise the combined principle that slave be a _ inferior _ order of man and perfectly void of _ understanding _ upon this _ principle _ it be that the former treatment begin to be fully confirm and establish and as this _ principle _ be hand down and disseminate so it become in succeed age a _ excuse _ for any severity that despotism might suggest we may observe here that as all nation have this excuse in common as arise from the _ circumstance _ above-mentioned so the greek first and the roman afterwards have a _ additional excuse _ as arise from they own _ vanity _ the former have conquer troy and have unite themselves under one common name and interest begin from that period to distinguish the rest of the world by the title of _ barbarian _ infer by such a appellation that they be man who be only noble in they own country that they have no right from they _ nature _ to authority or command that on the contrary so low be they capacity they be _ destine _ by nature _ to obey _ and to live in a state of perpetual drudgery and subjugation -lrb- 022 -rrb- conformable with this opinion be the treatment which be accordingly prescribe to a _ barbarian _ the philosopher aristotle himself in the advice which he give to he pupil alexander before he go upon he asiatick expedition intreat he to use the greek as it become a _ general _ but the _ barbarian _ as it become a _ master _ consider say he the former as _ friend _ and _ domestick _ but the latter as _ brute _ and _ plant _ -lrb- 023 -rrb- infer that the greek from the superiority of they capacity have a _ natural _ right to dominion and that the rest of the world from the inferiority of they own be to be consider and treat as the _ irrational _ part of the creation now if we consider that this be the treatment which they judge to be absolutely proper for people of this description and that they slave be uniformly those whom they term _ barbarian _ be generally such as be either kidnap from _ barbary _ or purchase from the _ barbarian _ conqueror in they war with one another we shall immediately see with what a additional excuse they own vanity have furnish they for the sally of caprice and passion to refute these cruel sentiment of the ancient and to shew that they slave be by no mean a inferior order of being than themselves may perhaps be consider as a unnecessary task particularly as have shewn that the cause of this inferior appearance be _ incidental _ arise on the one hand from the combined effect of the _ treatment _ and _ commerce _ and on the other from _ vanity _ and _ pride _ we seem to have refute they already but we trust that some few observation in vindication of these unfortunate people will neither be unacceptable nor improper how then shall we begin the refutation shall we say with seneca who see many of the slave in question what be a _ knight _ or a _ libertine _ or a _ slave _ be they not name assume either from _ injury _ or _ ambition _ or shall we say with he on another occasion let we consider that he whom we call we slave be bear in the same manner as ourselves that he enjoy the same sky with all its heavenly luminary that he breathe that he live in the same manner as ourselves and in the same manner that he expire these consideration we confess would furnish we with a plentiful source of argument in the case before we but we decline they assistance how then shall we begin shall we enumerate the many instance of fidelity patience or valor that be record of the _ servile _ race shall we enumerate the many important service that they render both to the individual and the community under whom they live here would be a second source from whence we could collect sufficient material to shew that there be no inferiority in they nature but we decline to use they we shall content ourselves with some few instance that relate to the _ genius _ only : we shall mention the name of those of a _ servile _ condition whose writings have escape the wreck of time and have be hand down even to the present age be now to be see as so many live monument that neither the grecian nor roman genius be superior to they own the first whom we shall mention here be the famous æsop he be a phrygian by birth and live in the time of croesus king of lydium to whom he dedicate he fable the writings of this great man in whatever light we consider they will be equally entitle to we admiration but we be well aware that the very mention of he as a writer of fable may depreciate he in the eye of some to such we shall propose a question whether this species of writing have not be more beneficial to mankind or whether it have not produce more important event than any other with respect to the first consideration it be evident that these fable as consist of plain and simple transaction be particularly easy to be understand as convey in image they please and seduce the mind and as contain a _ moral _ easily deducible on the side of virtue that they afford at the same time the most weighty precept of philosophy here then be the two grand point of composition a manner of expression to be apprehend by the lowest capacity and -lrb- what be consider as a victory in the art -rrb- a happy conjunction of utility and pleasure -lrb- 024 -rrb- hence quintilian recommend they as singularly useful and as admirably adapt to the puerile age as a just gradation between the language of the nurse and the preceptor and as furnish maxim of prudence and virtue at a time when the speculative principle of philosophy be too difficult to be understand hence also have be introduce by most civilized nation into they system of education they have produce that general benefit to which we at first allude nor have they be of less consequence in maturity but particularly to those of inferior capacity or little erudition whom they have frequently serve as a guide to conduct they in life and as a medium through which a explanation might be make on many and important occasion with respect to the latter consideration which be easily deducible from hence we shall only appeal to the wonderful effect which the fable pronounced by demosthene against philip of macedon produce among he hearer or to the fable which be speak by menenius agrippa to the roman populace by which a illiterate multitude be bring back to they duty as citizen when no other species of oratory could prevail to these truly _ ingenious _ and _ philosophical _ work of æsop we shall add those of he imitator phoedrus which in purity and elegance of style be inferior to none we shall add also the lyrick _ poetry _ of alcman which be no _ servile _ composition the sublime _ moral _ of epictetus and the incomparable _ comedy _ of terence thus then do it appear that the _ excuse _ which be uniformly start in defense of the _ treatment _ of slave have no foundation whatever either in truth or justice the instance that we have mention above be sufficient to shew that there be no inferiority either in they _ nature _ or they understanding : and at the same time that they refute the principle of the ancient they afford a valuable lesson to those who have be accustom to form too precipitate a judgment on the ability of man : for alas how often have _ secret anguish _ depress the spirit of those whom they have frequently censure from they gloomy and dejected appearance and how often on the other hand have they judgment result from they own _ vanity _ and _ pride _ \* \* \* \*

be make subject to the law and limitation of _ possession _ this commerce of the human species be of a very early date it be found on the idea that man be _ property _ and as this idea be coeval with the first order of _ involuntary _ slave it must have arise -lrb- if the date which we previously affix to that order be right -rrb- in the first practice of barter the story of joseph as record in the sacred writings whom he brother sell from a envious suspicion of he future greatness be a ample testimony of the truth of this conjecture it shew that there be man even at that early period who travel up and down as merchant collect not only balm myrrh spicery and other wares but the human species also for the purpose of traffick the instant determination of the brother on the first sight of the merchant _ to sell he _ and the immediate acquiescence of these who purchase he for a foreign market prove that this commerce have be then establish not only in that part of the country where this transaction happen but in that also whither the merchant be then travel with they camel namely ægypt : and they shew farther that as all custom require time for they establishment so it must have exist in the age previous to that of pharaoh that be in those age in which we fix the first date of _ involuntary _ servitude this commerce then as appear by the present instance exist in the earliest practice of barter and have descend to the ægyptians through as long a period of time as be sufficient to have make it in the time allude to a established custom thus be ægypt in those day the place of the greatest resort the grand emporium of trade to which people be drive they merchandize as to a center and thus do it afford among other opportunity of traffick the _ first market _ that be record for the sale of the human species this market which be thus supply by the constant concourse of merchant who resort to it from various part could not fail by these means to have be considerable it receive afterwards a additional supply from those piracy which we mention to have exist in the uncivilized age of the world and which in fact it greatly promote and encourage and it become from these unite circumstance so famous as to have be know within a few century from the time of pharaoh both to the grecian colony in asia and the grecian island homer mention cyprus and ægypt as the common market for slave about the time of the trojan war thus antinous offend with ulyss threaten to send he to one of these place if he do not instantly depart from he table -lrb- 025 -rrb- the same poet also in he hymn to bacchus -lrb- 026 -rrb- mention they again but in a more unequivocal manner as the common market for slave he take occasion in that hymn to describe the pirate method of scour the coast from the circumstance of they have kidnap bacchus as a noble youth for whom they expect a immense ransom the captain of the vessel have drag he on board be represent as address himself thus to the steersman : haul in the tackle hoist aloft the sail then take you helm and watch the doubtful gale to mind the captive prey be we 's the care while you to _ ægypt _ or to _ cyprus _ steer there shall he go unless he friend he 'll tell whose ransom-gift will pay we full as well it may not perhaps be consider as a digression to mention in few word by itself the wonderful concordance of the writings of mose and homer with the case before we : not that the former from they divine authority want additional support but because it can not be unpleasant to see they confirm by a person who be one of the earliest writer and live in a very remote age be the first that could afford we any additional proof of the circumstance above-mentioned ægypt be represent in the first book of the sacred writings as a market for slave and in the -lrb- 027 -rrb- second as famous for the severity of its servitude -lrb- 028 -rrb- the same line which we have already cite from homer convey to we the same idea it point it out as a market for the human species and by the epithet of _ bitter _ ægypt -lrb- -lrb- 029 -rrb- which epithet be peculiarly annex to it on this occasion -rrb- allude in the strongest manner to that severity and rigor of which the sacred historian transmit we the first account but to return though ægypt be the first market record for this species of traffick and though ægypt and cyprus afterwards be particularly distinguish for it in the time of the trojan war yet they be not the only place even at that period where man be buy and sell the odyssey of homer shew that it be then practice in many of the island of the ægean sea and the iliad that it have take place among those grecian on the continent of europe who have embark from thence on the trojan expedition this appear particularly at the end of the seventh book a fleet be describe there as have just arrive from lemno with a supply of wine for the grecian camp the merchant be describe also as immediately expose it to sale and as receive in exchange among other article of barter _ a number of slave _ it will now be sufficient to observe that as other state arise and as circumstance contribute to make they know this custom be discover to have exist among they that it travel over all asia that it spread through the grecian and roman world be in use among the barbarous nation which overturn the roman

conquest to decline and on they full establishment be abolish a difference of opinion have arise respect the cause of they abolition some have assert that they be the necessary consequence of the _ feudal system _ while other superior both in number and in argument have maintain that they be the natural effect of _ christianity _ the mode of argument which the former adopt on this occasion be as follow the multitude of little state which spring up from one great one at this æra occasion infinite bickering and matter for contention there be not a state or seignory which do not want all the hand they could muster either to defend they own right or to dispute that of they neighbor thus every man be take into the service : whom they arm they must trust : and there could be no trust but in free man thus the barrier between the two nature be throw down and _ slavery _ be no more hear of in the _ west _ that this be not the _ necessary _ consequence of such a situation be apparent the political state of greece in its early history be the same as that of europe when divide by the feudal system into a infinite number of small and independent kingdom there be the same matter therefore for contention and the same call for all the hand that could be muster : the grecian in short in _ heroick _ be in the same situation in these respects as the _ feudal baron _ in the _ gothick _ time have this therefore be a _ necessary _ effect there have be a cessation of servitude in greece in those age in which we have already shewn that it exist but with respect to _ christianity _ many and great be the argument that it occasion so desirable a event it teach that all man be originally equal that the deity be no respecter of person and that as all man be to give a account of they action hereafter it be necessary that they should be free these doctrine could not fail of have they proper influence on those who first embrace _ christianity _ from a _ conviction _ of its truth and on those of they descendent afterwards who by engage in the _ crusade _ and hazard they life and fortune there shew at least a _ attachment _ to that religion we find they accordingly actuate by these principle : we have a positive proof that the _ feudal system _ have no share in the honor of suppress slavery but that _ christianity _ be the only cause for the greatest part of the _ charter _ which be grant for the freedom of slave in those time -lrb- many of which be still extant -rrb- be grant _ pro amore dei pro mercede animæ _ they be found in short on religious consideration that they might procure the favor of the deity which they conceive themselves to have forfeit by the subjugation of those whom they find to be the object of the divine benevolence and attention equally with themselves these consideration which have thus they first origin in _ christianity _ begin to produce they effect as the different nation be convert and procure that general liberty at last which at the close of the twelfth century be conspicuous in the west of europe what a glorious and important change those who would have have otherwise no hope but that they misery would be terminate by death be then free from they servile condition those who by the law of war would have have otherwise a immediate prospect of servitude from the hand of they imperious conqueror be then _ exchange _ a custom which have happily descend to the present day thus a numerous class of man who formerly have no political existence and be employ merely as instrument of labor become useful citizen and contribute towards augment the force or riches of the society which adopt they as member and thus do the greater part of the european by they conduct on this occasion assert not only liberty for themselves but for they fellow-creature also \* \* \* \* \* chap viii but if man therefore at a time when under the influence of religion they exercise they serious thought abolish slavery how impious must they

slavery this practice however trifling and partial it might appear at first soon become serious and general a melancholy instance of the depravity of human nature as it shew that neither the law nor religion of any country however excellent the form of each be sufficient to bind the conscience of some but that there be always man of every age country and persuasion who be ready to sacrifice they dearest principle at the shrine of gain we own ancestor together with the spaniard french and most of the maritime power of europe soon follow the _ piratical _ example and thus do the european to they eternal infamy renew a custom which they _ own _ ancestor have so lately explode from a _ conscientiousness _ of its _ impiety _ the unfortunate african terrify at these repeat depredation flee in confusion from the coast and seek in the interior part of the country a retreat from the persecution of they invader but alas they be miserably disappointed there be few retreat that can escape the penetrate eye of avarice the european still pursue they they enter they river sail up into the heart of the country surprize the unfortunate african again and carry they into slavery but this conduct though successful at first defeat afterwards its own end it create a more general alarm and point out at the same instant the best method of security from future depredation the bank of the river be accordingly desert as the coast have be before and thus be the _ christian _ invader leave without a prospect of they prey in this situation however expedient be not want they now form to themselves

they curiosity : they dazzle the eye and bewitch the sens not only of those to whom they be give but of those to whom they be shewn thus follow a speedy intercourse with each other and a confidence highly favourable to the view of avarice or ambition it be now time for the european to embrace the opportunity which this intercourse have thus afford they of carry they scheme into execution and of fix they on such a permanent foundation as should secure they future success they have already discover in the different interview obtain the chief of the african tribe they pay they court therefore to these and so compleatly intoxicate they sens with the luxury which they bring from home as to be able to seduce they to they design a treaty of peace and commerce be immediately conclude : it be agree that the king on they part should from this period sentence _ prisoner of war _ and _ convict _ to _ european servitude _ and that the european should supply they in return with the luxury of the north this agreement immediately take place and thus begin that _ commerce _ which make so considerable a figure at the present day but happy have the african be if those only who have be justly convict of crime or take in a just war have be sentence to the severity of servitude how many of those misery which afterwards attend they have be never know and how would they history have save those sigh and emotion of pity which must now ever accompany its perusal the european on the establishment of they western colony require a greater number of slave than a strict adherence to the treaty could produce the prince therefore have only the choice of relinquish the commerce or of consent to become unjust they have long experience the emolument of the trade they have acquire a taste for the luxury it afford and they now behold a opportunity of gratify it but in a more extentive manner _ avarice _ therefore which be too powerful for _ justice _ on this occasion immediately turn the scale : not only those who be fairly convict of offence be now sentence to servitude but even those who be _ suspect _ new crime be invent that new punishment might succeed thus be every appearance soon construe into reality every shadow into a substance and often virtue into a crime such also be the case with respect to prisoner of war not only those be now deliver into slavery who be take in a state of publick enmity and injustice but those also who conscious of no injury whatever be take in the _ arbitrary _ skirmish of these _ venal _ sovereign war be now make not as formerly from the motive of retaliation and defense but for the sake of obtain prisoner alone and the advantage result from they sale if a ship from europe come but into sight it be now consider as a sufficient motive for a war and as a signal only for a instantaneous commencement of hostility but if the african king could be capable of such injustice what vice be there that they conscience would restrain or what enormity that we might not expect to be commit when man once consent to be unjust they lose at the same instant with they virtue a considerable portion of that sense of shame which till then have be find a successful protector against the sally of vice from that awful period almost every expectation be forlorn : the heart be leave unguarded : its great protector be no more : the vice therefore which so long encompass it in vain obtain a easy victory : in croud they pour into the defenceless avenue and take possession of the soul : there be nothing now too vile for they to meditate too impious to perform such be the situation of the despotick sovereign of africa they have once venture to pass the bound of virtue and they soon proceed to enormity this be particularly conspicuous in that general conduct which they uniformly observe after any unsuccessful conflict influence only by the venal motive of european traffick they first make war upon the neighbouring tribe contrary to every principle of justice and if by the flight of the enemy or by other contingency they be disappoint of they prey they make no hesitation of immediately turn they arm against they own subject the first village they come to be always mark on this occasion as the first object of they avarice they be immediately surround be afterwards set on fire and the wretched inhabitant seize as they be escape from the flame these consist of whole family father brother husband wife and child be instantly drive in chain to the merchant and consign to slavery to these calamity which thus arise from the tyranny of the king we may now subjoin those which arise from the avarice of private person many be kidnap by they own countryman who encourage by the merchant of europe previously lay in wait for they and sell they afterwards for slave while the seaman of the different ship by every possible artifice entice other on board and transport they to the region of servitude as these practice be in full force at the present day it appear that there be four order of _ involuntary _ slave on the african continent of -lrb- 033 -rrb- _ convict _ of _ prisoner of war _ of those who be publickly seize by virtue of the _ authority _ of they prince and of those who be privately _ kidnap _ by individual it remain only to observe on this head that in the sale and purchase of these the african commerce or _ slave trade _ consist that they be deliver to the merchant of europe in exchange for they various commodity that these transport they to they colony in the west where they _ slavery _ take place and that a fifth order arise there compose of all such as be bear to the native african after they transportation and slavery have commence have thus explain as much of the history of modern servitude as be sufficient for the prosecution of we design we should have close we account here but that a work just publish have furnish we with a singular anecdote of the colonist of a neighbouring nation which we can not but relate the learn -lrb- 034 -rrb- author have describe the method which the dutch colonist at the cape make use of to take the hottentot and enslave they take occasion in many subsequent part of the work to mention the dreadful effect of the practice of slavery which as he justly remark lead to all manner of misdemeanor and wickedness pregnant woman say he and child in they tenderest year be not at this time neither indeed be they ever exempt from the effect of the hatred and spirit of vengeance constantly harbour by the colonist with respect to the -lrb- 035 -rrb- boshies-man nation _ except such indeed as be mark out to be carry away into bondage _ do a colonist at any time get sight of a boshies-man he take fire immediately and spirit up he horse and dog in order to hunt he with more ardor and fury than he would a wolf or any other wild beast on a open plain a few colonist on horseback be always sure to get the better of the greatest number of boshies-man that can be bring together as the former always keep at the distance of about a hundred or a hundred and fifty pace -lrb- just as they find it convenient -rrb- and charge they heavy fire-arm with a very large kind of shot jump off they horse and rest they piece in they usual manner on they ramrod in order that they may shoot with the greater certainty so that the ball discharge by they will sometimes as i have be assure go through the body of six seven or eight of the enemy at a time especially as these latter know no better than to keep close together in a body -- and not only be the capture of the hottentot consider by they merely as a party of pleasure but in cold blood they destroy the band which nature have knit between they husband and they wife and child & c with what horror do these passage seem to strike we what indignation do they seem to raise in we breast when we reflect that a part of the human species be consider as _ game _ and that _ party of pleasure _ be make for they _ destruction _ the lion do not imbrue he claw in blood unless call upon by hunger or provoke by interruption whereas the merciless dutch more savage than the brute themselves not only murder they fellow-creature without any provocation or necessity but even make a diversion of they suffering and enjoy they pain \* \* \* \* \* footnote -lrb- footnote 030 : the follow short

history of slavery in the first part of this essay as far as it be necessary for we purpose we shall now take the question into consideration which we propose at first as the subject of we inquiry viz how far the commerce and slavery of the human species as revive by some of the nation of europe in the person of the unfortunate african and as revive in a great measure on the principle of antiquity be consistent with the law of nature or the common notion of equity as establish among man this question resolve itself into two separate part for discussion into _ the african commerce -lrb- as explain in the history of slavery -rrb- _ and _ the subsequent slavery in the colony as found on the equity of the commerce _ the former of course will be first examine for this purpose we shall inquire into the rise nature and design of government such a inquiry will be particularly useful in the present place it will afford we that general knowledge of subordination and liberty which be necessary in the case before we and will be find as it be a source to which we may frequently refer for many and valuable argument it appear that mankind be originally free and that they possess a equal right to the soil and produce of the earth for proof of this we need only appeal to the _ divine _ writings to the _ golden age _ of the poet which like other fable of the time have its origin in truth and to the institution of the _ saturnalia _ and of other similar festival all of which be so many monument of this original equality of man hence then there be no rank no distinction no superior every man wander where he choose change he residence as a spot attract he fancy or suit he convenience uncontrouled by he neighbor unconnected with any but he family hence also -lrb- as every thing be common -rrb- he collect what he choose without injury and enjoy without injury what he have collect such be the first situation of mankind -lrb- 036 -rrb- a state of _ dissociation _ and _ independence _ in this dissociate state it be impossible that man could have long continue the danger to which they must have frequently be expose by the attack of fierce and rapacious beast by the proedatory attempt of they own species and by the dispute of contiguous and independent family these together with they inability to defend themselves on many such occasion must have incite they to unite hence then be _ society _ form on the grand principle of preservation and defense : and as these principle begin to operate in the different part of the earth where the different family have roam a great number of these _ society _ begin to be form and establish which take to themselves particular name from particular occurrence begin to be perfectly distinct from one another as the individual of whom these society be compose have associate only for they defense so they experience at first no change in they condition they be still independent and free they be still without discipline or law they have every thing still in common they pursue the same manner of life wander only in _ herd _ as the earth give they or refuse they sustenance and do as a _ publick body _ what they have be accustom to do as _ individual _ before this be the exact situation of the getæ and scythian -lrb- 037 -rrb- of the lybian and goetulian -lrb- 038 -rrb- of the italian aborigine -lrb- 039 -rrb- and of the hun and alan -lrb- 040 -rrb- they have leave they original state of _ dissociation _ and have step into that which have be just describe thus be the second situation of man a state of _ independent society _ have thus join themselves together and have form themselves into several large and distinct body they could not fail of submit soon to a more considerable change they number must have rapidly increase and they society in process of time have become so populous as frequently to have experience the want of subsistence and many of the commotion and tumult of intestine strife for these inconvenience however there be remedy to be find _ agriculture _ would furnish they with that subsistence and support which the earth from the rapid increase of its inhabitant have become unable spontaneously to produce a _ assignation _ of _ property _ would not only enforce a application but excite a emulation to labor and _ government _ would at once afford a security to the acquisition of the industrious and heal the intestine disorder of the community by the introduction of law such then be the remedy that be gradually apply the _ society _ which have hitherto see they member undistinguished either by authority or rank admit now of magistratical pre-eminence they be divide into tribe to every tribe be allot a particular district for its support and to every individual he particular spot the german -lrb- 041 -rrb- who consist of many and various nation be exactly in this situation they have advance a step beyond the scythian goetulian and those whom we describe before and thus be the third situation of mankind a state of _ subordinate society _ \* \* \* \* \* footnote -lrb- footnote 036 : this conclusion concern the dissociate state of mankind be confirm by all the early writer with whose description of primitive time no other conclusion be reconcileable -rrb- -lrb- footnote 037 : justin l 2 c 2 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 038 : sallust bell jug

quo mox inter se secundum dignationem partiuntur tacitus c 26 de mor germ -rrb- \* \* \* \* \* chap ii as we have thus trace the situation of man from unbounded liberty to subordination it will be proper to carry we inquiry farther and to consider who first obtain the pre-eminence in these _ primoeval society _ and by what particular method it be obtain there be only two way by which such a event could have be produce by _ compulsion _ or _ consent _ when mankind first see the necessity of government it be probable that many have conceive the desire of rule to be place in a new situation to be take from the common herd to be the first distinguish among man be thought that must have have they charm let we suppose then that these thought have work so unusually on the passion of any particular individual as to have drive he to the extravagant design of obtain the preeminence by force how could he design have be accomplish how could he forcibly have usurp the jurisdiction at a time when all be equally free there be not a single person whose assistance he could command add to this that in a state of universal liberty force have be repay by force and the attempt have be fatal to the usurper as _ empire _ then could never have be gain at first by _ compulsion _ so it could only have be obtain by _ consent _ and as man be then go to make a important sacrifice for the sake of they _ mutual _ happiness so he alone could have obtain it -lrb- not whose _ ambition _ have greatly distinguish he from the rest -rrb- but in whose _ wisdom justice prudence _ and _ virtue _ the whole community could confide to confirm this reasoning we shall appeal as before to fact and shall consult therefore the history of those nation which have just leave they former state of _ independent society _ be the very people that establish _ subordination _ and _ government _ the commentary of cæsar afford we the follow account of the ancient gaul when any of they king either by death or deposition make a vacancy in the regal office the whole nation be immediately convene for the appointment of a successor in these national convention be the regal office confer every individual have a voice on the occasion and every individual be free the person upon whom the general approbation appear to fall be immediately advance to pre-eminence in the state he be uniformly one whose action have make he eminent whose conduct have gain he previous applause whose valor the very assembly that elect he have themselves witness in the field whose prudence wisdom and justice have render he signally serviceable have endear he to he tribe for this reason they kingdom be not hereditary the son do not always inherit the virtue of the sire and they be determine that he alone should possess authority in whose virtue they could confide nor be this all so sensible be they of the important sacrifice they have make so extremely jealous even of the name of superiority and power that they limit by a variety of law the authority of the very person whom they have just elect from a confidence of he integrity ambiorix himself confess that he people have as much power over he as he could possibly have over he people the same custom as appear from tacitus prevail also among the german they have they national council like the gaul in which the regal and ducal office be confirm accord to the majority of voice they elect also on these occasion those only whom they virtue by repeat trial have unequivocally distinguish from the rest and they limit they authority so far as neither to leave they the power of inflict imprisonment or stripe nor of exercise any penal jurisdiction but as punishment be necessary in a state of civil society it be permit to the priest alone that it might appear to have be inflict by the order of the god and not by any superior authority in man the account which we have thus give of the ancient german and gaul will be find also to be equally true of those people which have arrive at the same state of subordinate society we might appeal for a testimony of this to the history of the goth to the history of the frank and saxon to the history in short of all those nation from which the different government now conspicuous in europe have undeniably spring and we might appeal as a farther proof to the american who be represent by many of the modern from they own ocular testimony as observe the same custom at the present day it remain only to observe that as these custom prevail among the different nation describe in they early state of subordinate society and as they be moreover the custom of they respective ancestor it appear that they must have be hand down both by tradition and use from the first introduction of _ government _ \* \* \* \* \* chap iii we may now deduce those general maxim concern _ subordination _ and _ liberty _ which we mention to have be essentially connect with the subject and which some from speculation only and without any allusion to fact have be bold enough to deny it appear first that _ liberty _ be a _ natural _ and _ government _ a _ adventitious _ right because all man be originally free it appear secondly that government be a -lrb- 042 -rrb- _ contract _ because in these primeval subordinate society we have see it voluntarily confer on the one hand and accept on the other we have see it subject to various restriction we have see its article which could then only be write by tradition and use as perfect and binding as those which be now commit to letter we have see it in short partaking of the _ federal _ nature as much as it could in a state which want the means of record its transaction it appear thirdly that the grand object of the _ contrast _ be the _ happiness _ of the people because they give the supremacy to he alone who have be conspicuous for the splendor of he ability or the integrity of he life : that the power of the multitude be direct by the _ wisdom _ and _ justice _ of the prince they might experience the most effectual protection from injury the highest advantage of society the greatest possible _ happiness _ \* \* \* \* \* footnote -lrb- footnote 042 : the author have lately read a work intitle paley 's moral and political philosophy which in this one respect favor those which have be hint at as it deny that government be a contract no social compact be ever make in fact -- it be to suppose it possible to call savage out of cave and desert to deliberate upon topick which the experience and study and the refinement of civil life alone suggest therefore no government in the universe begin from this original but there be no grounds for so absurd a supposition for government and of course the social compact do not appear to have be introduce at the time when family come out of they cave and desert or in other word quit they former _ dissociate _ state join themselves together they have live a considerable time in _ society _ like the lybian and gætulians before-mentioned and have feel many of the disadvantage of a want of discipline and law before government be introduce at all the author of this essay before he take into consideration the origin of government be determine in a matter of such importance to be biass by no opinion whatever and much less to indulge himself in speculation he be determine solely to adhere to fact and by look into the account leave we of those government which be in they infancy and of course in the least complicated state to attempt to discover they foundation : he can not say therefore that upon a very minute perusal of the excellent work before quote he have be so far convince as to retract in the least from he sentiment on this head and to give up maxim which be draw from historical fact for those which be the result of speculation he may observe here that whether government be a _ contract _ or not it will not affect the reasoning of the present essay since where ever the contract be afterwards mention it be infer only that its object be the _ happiness of the people _ which be confessedly the end of government notwithstanding this he be under the necessity of insert this little note though he almost feel himself ungrateful in contradict a work which have afford he so much entertainment -rrb- \* \* \* \* \* chap iv have now collect the material that be necessary for the prosecution of we design we shall immediately enter upon the discussion if any man have originally be endue with power as with other faculty so that the rest of mankind have discover in themselves a _ innate necessity _ of obey this particular person it be evident that he and he descendant from the superiority of they nature would have have a claim upon man for obedience and a natural right to command : but as the right to empire be _ adventitious _ as all be originally free as nature make every man 's body and mind _ he own _ it be evident that no just man can be consign to _ slavery _ without he own _ consent _ neither can man by the same principle be consider as land goods or house among _ possession _ it be necessary that all _ property _ should be inferior to its _ possessor _ but how do the _ slave _ differ from he _ master _ but by _ chance _ for though the mark with which the latter be please to brand he shew at the first sight the difference of they _ fortune _ what mark can be find in he _ nature _ that can warrant a distinction to this consideration we shall add the follow that if man can justly become the property of each other they child like the offspring of cattle must inherit they _ paternal _ lot now as the action of the father and the child must be thus at the sole disposal of they common master it be evident that the _ authority _ of the one as a _ parent _ and the _ duty _ of the other as a _ child _ must be instantly annihilate rights and obligation which as they be sound in nature be implant in we feeling and be establish by the voice of god must contain in they annihilation a solid argument to prove that there can not be any _ property _ whatever in the _ human species _ we may consider also as a farther confirmation that it be impossible in the nature of thing that _ liberty _ can be _ buy _ or _ sell _ it be neither _ saleable _ nor _ purchasable _ for if any one man can have a absolute property in the liberty of another or in other word if he who be call a _ master _ can have a _ just _ right to command the action of he who be call a _ slave _ it be evident that the latter can not be accountable for those crime which the former may order he to commit now as every reasonable being be accountable for he action it be evident that such a right can not _ justly _ exist and that human liberty of course be beyond the possibility either of _ sale _ or _ purchase _ add to this that whenever you sell the liberty of a man you have the power only of allude to the _ body _ : the _ mind _ can not be confine or bind : it will be free though its mansion be beset with chain but if in every sale of the _ human species _ you be under the necessity of consider you slave in this abstracted light of allude only to the body and of make no allusion to the mind you be under the necessity also of treat he in the same moment as a _ brute _ and of abuse therefore that nature which can not otherwise be consider than in the double capacity of _ soul _ and _ body _ but some person perhaps will make a objection to one of the former argument if man from _ superiority _ of they nature can not be consider like land goods or house among possession so neither can cattle : for be endue with life motion and sensibility they be evidently _ superior _ to these but this objection will receive its answer from those observation which have be already make and will discover the true reason why cattle be justly to be estimate as property for first the right to empire over brute be _ natural _ and not _ adventitious _ like the right to empire over man there be secondly many and evident sign of the _ inferiority _ of they nature and thirdly they liberty can be buy and sell because be void of reason they can not be _ accountable _ for they action we might stop here for a considerable time and deduce many valuable lesson from the remark that have be make but that such a circumstance might be consider as a digression there be one however which as it be so intimately connect with the subject we can not but deduce we be teach to treat man in a different manner from brute because they be so manifestly superior in they nature we be teach to treat brute in a different manner from stone for the same reason and thus by give to every create thing its due respect to answer the view of providence which do not create a variety of nature without a purpose or design but if these thing be so how evidently against reason nature and every thing human and divine must they act who not only force man into _ slavery _ against they own _ consent _ but treat they altogether as _ brute _ and make the _ natural liberty _ of man a article of publick commerce and by what argument can they possibly defend that commerce which can not be carry on in any single instance without a flagrant violation of the law of nature and of god \* \* \* \* \* chap v that we may the more accurately examine the argument that be advance on this occasion it will be proper to divide the _ commerce _ into two part first as it relate to those who _ sell _ and secondly as it relate to those who _ purchase _ the _ human species _ into slavery to the former part of which have give every previous and necessary information in the history of servitude we shall immediately proceed let we inquire first by what particular right the _ liberty _ of the harmless people be invade by the _ prince _ by the _ right of empire _ it will be answer because he possess dominion and power by they own approbation and consent but subject though under the dominion be not the _ property _ of the prince they can not be consider as he _ possession _ they _ nature _ be both the same they be both bear in the same manner be subject to the same disorder must apply to the same remedy for a cure be equally partaker of the grave : a _ incidental _ distinction accompany they through life and this -- be all we may add to this that though the prince possess dominion and power by the consent and approbation of he subject he possess it only for the most _ salutary _ end he may tyrannize if he can : he may alter the _ form _ of he government : he can not however alter its _ nature _ and _ end _ these will be immutably the same though the whole system of its administration should be change and he will be still bind to _ defend _ the life and property of he subject and to make they _ happy _ do he defend those therefore whom he invade at discretion with the sword do he protect the property of those whose house and effect he consign at discretion to the flame do he make those happy whom he seize as they be try to escape the general devastation and compel with they wife and family to a wretched _ servitude _ he act surely as if the use of empire consist in violence and oppression as if he that be most exalted ought of necessity to be most unjust here then the voice of _ nature _ and _ justice _ be against he he break that law of _ nature _ which ordain that no just man shall be give into slavery against he own _ consent _ : he violate the first law of _ justice _ as establish among man that no person shall do harm to another without a previous and sufficient _ provocation _ and he violate also the sacred condition of _ empire _ make with he ancestor and necessarily understand in every species of government that the power of the multitude be give up to the wisdom and justice of the prince they may experience in return the most effectual protection from injury the highest advantage of society the greatest possible _ happiness _ but if king then to whom they own people have grant dominion and power be unable to invade the liberty of they harmless subject without the highest _ injustice _ how can those private person be justify who treacherously lie in wait for they fellow-creature and sell they into slavery what argument can they possibly bring in they defense what treaty of empire can they produce by which they innocent victim ever resign to they the least portion of they _ liberty _ in vain will they plead the _ antiquity _ of the custom : in vain will the _ honorable _ light in which _ piracy _ be consider in the age of barbarism afford they a excuse impious and abandon man ye invade the liberty of those who -lrb- with respect to you impious self -rrb- be in a state of _ nature _ in a state of original _ dissociation _ perfectly _ independent _ perfectly _ free _ it appear then that the two order of slave which have be mention in the history of the african servitude of those who be publickly seize by virtue of the authority of they prince and of those who be privately kidnap by individual be collect by means of violence and oppression by means repugnant to _ nature _ the principle of _ government _ and the common notion of _ equity _ as establish among man \* \* \* \* \* chap vi we come now to the third order of _ involuntary _ slave to convict the only argument that the seller advance here be this that they have be find guilty of offence and that the punishment be just but before the equity of the sentence can be allow two question must be decide whether the punishment be _ proportion _ to the offence and what be its particular _ object _ and _ end _ to decide the first we may previously observe that the african servitude comprehend _ banishment _ a _ deprivation _ of _ liberty _ and many _ corporal _ suffering on _ banishment _ the follow observation will suffice mankind have they _ local _ attachment they have a particular regard for the spot in which they be bear and nurture here it be that they first draw they infant-breath : here that they be cherish and support : here that they pass those scene of childhood which free from care and anxiety be the happiest in the life of man scene which accompany they through life which throw themselves frequently into they thought and produce the most agreeable sensation these then be weighty consideration and how great this regard be may be evidence from we own feeling from the testimony of some who when remote from they country and in the hour of danger and distress have find they thought unusually direct by some impulse or other to they native spot and from the example of other who have brave the storm and adversity of life either repair to it for the remainder of they day or desire even to be convey to it when existence be no more but separately from these they _ local _ they have also they _ personal _ attachment they regard for particular man there be tie of blood there be tie of friendship in the former case they must of necessity be attach : the constitution of they nature demand it in the latter it be impossible to be otherwise since friendship be found on a harmony of temper on a concordance of sentiment and manners on habit of confidence and a mutual exchange of favor we may now mention as perfectly distinct both from they _ local _ and _ personal _ the _ national _ attachment of mankind they regard for the whole body of the people among whom they be bear and educate this regard be particularly conspicuous in the conduct of such as be thus _ nationally _ connected reside in foreign part how anxiously do they meet together how much do they enjoy the fight of other of they countryman whom fortune place in they way what a eagerness do they show to serve they though not bear on the same particular spot though not connect by consanguinity or friendship though unknown to they before neither be this affection wonderful since they be creature of the same education of the same principle of the same manners and habit cast as it be in the same mould and mark with the same impression if man therefore be thus separately attach to the several object describe it be evident that a separate exclusion from either must afford they considerable pain what then must be they suffering to be force for ever from they country which include they all which contain the _ spot _ in which they be bear and nurture which contain they _ relation _ and _ friend _ which contain the whole body of the _ people _ among whom they be breed and educate in these suffering which arise to man both in bidding and in have bid adieu to all that they esteem as dear and valuable _ banishment _ consist in part and we may agree therefore with the ancient without add other melancholy circumstance to the account that it be no inconsiderable punishment of itself with respect to the _ loss _ of _ liberty _ which be the second consideration in the punishment it be evident that man bear nothing worse that there be nothing that they lay more at heart and that they have shew by many and memorable instance that even death be to be prefer how many could be name here who have suffer the _ loss _ of _ liberty _ have put a period to they existence how many that have willingly undergo the hazard of they life to destroy a tyrant how many that have even glory to perish in the attempt how many bloody and publick war have be undertake -lrb- not to mention the numerous _ servile _ insurrection with which history be stain -rrb- for the cause of _ freedom _ but if nothing be dearer than _ liberty _ to man with which the barren rock be able to afford its joy and without which the glorious fun shine upon they but in vain and all the sweet and delicacy of life be tasteless and unenjoyed what punishment can be more severe than the loss of so great a blessing but if to this _ deprivation _ of _ liberty _ we add the agonizing pang of _ banishment _ and if to the complicated sting of both we add the incessant _ stripe wound _ and _ misery _ which be undergo by those who be sell into this horrid _ servitude _ what crime can we possibly imagine to be so enormous as to be worthy of so great a punishment how contrary then to reason justice and nature must those act who apply this the severest of human punishment to the most insignificant offence yet such be the custom with the african : for from the time in which the european first intoxicate the african prince with they foreign draught no crime have be commit no shadow of a crime devise that have not immediately be punish with _ servitude _ but for what purpose be the punishment apply be it apply to amend the manners of the criminal and thus render he a better subject no for if you banish he he can no longer be a subject and you can no longer therefore be solicitous for he moral add to this that if you banish he to a place where he be to experience the hardship of want and hunger -lrb- so powerfully do hunger compel man to the perpetration of crime -rrb- you force he rather to corrupt than amend he manners and to be wicked when he might otherwise be just be it apply then that other may be deter from the same proceedings and that crime may become less frequent no but that _ avarice _ may be gratify that the prince may experience the emolument of the sale : for horrid and melancholy think the more crime he subject commit the richer be he make the more _ abandon _ the subject the _ happier _ be the prince neither can we allow that the punishment thus apply tend in any degree to answer _ publick happiness _ for if man can be sentence to slavery right or wrong if shadow can be turn into substance and virtue into crime it be evident that none can be happy because none can be secure but if the punishment be infinitely greater than the offence -lrb- which have be shew before -rrb- and if it be inflict neither to amend the criminal nor to deter other from the same proceedings nor to advance in any degree the happiness of the publick it be scarce necessary to observe that it be totally unjust since it be repugnant to _ reason _ the dictate of _ nature _ and the very principle of _ government _ \* \* \* \* \* chap vii we come now to the fourth and last order of slave to _ prisoner of war _ as the _ seller _ lay a particular stress on this order of man and infer much from its _ antiquity _ in support of the justice of they cause we shall examine the principle on which it subsist among the ancient but as this principle be the same among all nation and as a citation from many of they history would not be less tedious than unnecessary we shall select the example of the roman for the consideration of the case the law by which prisoner of war be say to be sentence to servitude be the _ law of nation _ -lrb- 043 -rrb- it be so call from the universal concurrence of nation in the custom it have two point in view the _ person _ of the _ capture _ and they _ effect _ both of which it immediately sentence without any of the usual form of law to be the property of the _ captor _ the principle on which the law be establish be the _ right of capture _ when any of the contend party have overcome they opponent and be about to destroy they the right be consider to commence a right which the victor conceive themselves to have to recall they sword and from the consideration of have save the life of the vanquish when they could have take they by the law of war to commute _ blood _ for _ service _ hence the roman lawyer pomponius deduce the etymology of _ slave _ in the roman language they be call _ servi _ -lrb- 044 -rrb- say he from the follow circumstance it be usual with we commander to take they prisoner and sell they : now this circumstance imply that they must have be previously _ preserved _ and hence the name such then be the _ right of capture _ it be a right which the circumstance of _ take _ the vanquish that be of _ preserving _ they alive give the conqueror to they person by this right as always include the idea of a previous preservation from death the vanquish be say _ to be slave _ -lrb- 045 -rrb- and as all slave say justinian be themselves in the power of other and of course can have nothing of they own so they effect follow the condition of they person and become the property of the captor to examine this right by which the vanquish be say to be slave we shall use the word of a celebrated roman author and apply they to the present case -lrb- 046 -rrb- if it be lawful say he to deprive a man of he life it be certainly not inconsistent with nature to rob he to rob he of he liberty we admit the conclusion to be just if the supposition be the same : we allow if man have a right to commit that which be consider as a greater crime that they have a right at the same instant to commit that which be consider as a less but what shall we say to the _ hypothesis _ we deny it to be true the voice of nature be against it it be not lawful to kill but on _ necessity _ have there be a necessity where have the wretched captive survive to be break with chain and servitude the very act of save he life be a argument to prove that no such necessity exist the _ conclusion _ be therefore false the captor have no right to the _ live _ of the capture and of course none to they _ liberty _ : they have no right to they _ blood _ and of course none to they _ service _ they right therefore have no foundation in justice it be found on a principle contrary to the law of nature and of course contrary to that law which people under different government be bind to observe to one another it be scarce necessary to observe as a farther testimony of the injustice of the measure that the european after the introduction of christianity explode this principle of the ancient as frivolous and false that they spare the life of the vanquish not from the sordid motive of _ avarice _ but from a conscientiousness that homicide could only be justify by _ necessity _ that they introduce a _ exchange _ of prisoner and by many and wise regulation deprive war of many of its former horror but the advocate for slavery unable to defend themselves against these argument have flee to other resource and ignorant of history have deny that the _ right of capture _ be the true principle on which slavery subsist among the ancient they reason thus the learn grotius and other have consider slavery as the just consequence of a private war -lrb- suppose the war to be just and the opponent in a state of nature -rrb- upon the principle of _ reparation _ and _ punishment _ now as the law of nature which be the rule of conduct to individual in such a situation be applicable to member of a different community there be reason to presume that these principle be apply by the ancient to they prisoner of war that they _ effect _ be confiscate by the right of _ reparation _ and they _ person _ by the right of _ punishment _ -- but such a presumption be false the _ right of capture _ be the only argument that the ancient adduce in they defense hence polybius what must they -lrb- the mantinens -rrb- suffer to receive the punishment they deserve perhaps it will be say _ that they must be sell when they be take with they wife and child into slavery _ : but this be not to be consider as a punishment since even those suffer it by the law of war who have do nothing that be base the truth be that both the _ offend _ and the _ offend _ party whenever they be victorious inflict slavery alike but if the _ offend _ party inflict slavery on the person of the vanquish by what right do they inflict it it must be answer from the presumption before-mentioned by the right of _ reparation _ or of _ punishment : _ a answer plainly absurd and contradictory as it suppose the _ aggressor _ to have a _ right _ which the _ injured _ only could possess neither be the argument less fallacious than the presumption in apply these principle which in a _ publick _ war could belong to the _ publick _ only to the person of the _ individual _ that be take this call we again to the history of the ancient and as the rights of reparation and punishment could extend to those only who have be injure to select a particular instance for the consideration of the case as the roman have be injure without a previous provocation by the conduct of hannibal at saguntum we may take the treaty into consideration which they make with the carthaginian when the latter defeat at zama sue for peace it consist of three article -lrb- 047 -rrb- by the first the carthaginian be to be free and to enjoy they own constitution and law by the second they be to pay a considerable sum of money as a reparation for the damages and expence of war : and by the third they be to deliver up they elephant and ship of war and to be subject to various restriction as a punishment with these term they comply and the war be finish thus then do the roman make that distinction between _ private _ and _ publick _ war which be necessary to be make and which the argument be fallacious in not suppose the treasury of the vanquish be mark as the means of _ reparation _ and as this treasury be supply in a great measure by the imposition of tax and be wholly the property of the _ publick _ so the _ publick _ make the reparation that be due the _ elephant _ also and _ ship of war _ which be mark as the means of _ punishment _ be _ publick _ property and as they be considerable instrument of security and defense to they possessor and of annoyance to a enemy so they loss add to the restriction of the treaty operate as a great and _ publick _ punishment but with respect to the carthaginian prisoner who have be take in the war they be retain in _ servitude : _ not upon the principle of _ reparation _ and _ punishment _ because the roman have already receive by they own confession in the treaty a sufficient satisfaction : not upon these principle because they be inapplicable to _ individual : _ the legionary soldier in the service of the injure who take he prisoner be not the person to whom the _ injury have be do _ any more than the soldier in the service of the aggressor who be take be the person who have _ commit the offence : _ but they be retain in servitude by the _ right of capture _ because when both party have send they military into the field to determine the dispute it be at the _ private _ choice of the legionary soldier before-mentioned whether he would spare the life of he conquered opponent when he be think to be entitle to take it if he have choose by the law of war to produce more instance as a illustration of the subject or to go farther into the argument would be to trespass upon the patience as well as understanding of the reader in _ a state of nature _ where a man be suppose to commit a injury and to be unconnected with the rest of the world the act be _ private _ and the right which the injured acquire can extend only to _ himself : _ but in _ a state of society _ where any member or member of a particular community give offence to those of another and they be patronize by the state to which they belong the case be alter the act become immediately _ publick _ and the _ publick _ alone be to experience the consequence of they injustice for as no particular member of the community if consider as a individual be guilty except the person by whom the injury be do it would be contrary to reason and justice to apply the principle of _ reparation _ and _ punishment _ which belong to the people as a collective body to any individual of the community who should happen to be take now as the principle of _ reparation _ and _ punishment _ be thus inapplicable to the prisoner take in a _ publick _ war and as the _ right of capture _ as we have shew before be insufficient to intitle the victor to the _ service _ of the vanquish it be evident that _ slavery _ can not justly exist at all since there be no other maxim on which it can be found even in the most equitable war but if these thing be so if slavery can not be defend even in the most _ equitable _ war what argument will not be find against that servitude which arise from those that be _ unjust _ which arise from those african war that relate to the present subject the african prince corrupt by the merchant of europe seek every opportunity of quarrel with one another every spark be blow into a flame and war be undertake from no other consideration than that _ of procure slave : _ while the european on the other hand happy in the quarrel which they have thus excite supply they with arm and ammunition for the accomplishment of they horrid purpose thus have africa for the space of two hundred year be the scene of the most iniquitous and bloody war and thus have many thousand of man in the most iniquitous manner be send into servitude \* \* \* \* \*

observation to the substance of the three precede chapter as the two order of man of those who be privately kidnap by individual and of those who be publickly seize by virtue of the authority of they prince compose together at least -lrb- 048 -rrb- nine tenth of the african slave they can not contain upon a moderate computation less than ninety thousand man annually transport : a immense number but easily to be credit when we reflect that thousand be employ for the purpose of steal the unwary and that these diabolical practice be in force so far have european _ injustice _ be spread at the distance of a thousand mile from the factory on the coast the _ slave merchant _ among whom a quantity of european goods be previously divide travel into the heart of the country to this amazing distance some of they attend the various market that be establish through so large a extent of territory to purchase the kidnap people whom the _ slave-hunter _ be continually bring in while the rest subdivide they merchandize among the petty sovereign with whom they deal receive by a immediate exertion of fraud and violence the stipulate number now will any man assert in opposition to the argument before advance that out of this immense body of man thus annually collect and transport there be even _ one _ over whom the original or subsequent seller can have any power or right whoever assert this in the first instance must contradict he own feeling and must consider _ himself _ as a just object of prey whenever any daring invader shall think it proper to attack _ he _ and in the second instance the very idea which the african prince entertain of they village as _ park _ or _ reservoir _ stock only for they own convenience and of they subject as _ wild beast _ whom they may pursue and take at pleasure be so shocking that it need only be mention to be instantly reprobate by the reader the order of slave which be next to the former in respect to the number of people whom it contain be that of prisoner of war this order if the former statement be true be more inconsiderable than be generally imagine but whoever reflect on the prodigious slaughter that be constantly make in every african skirmish can not be otherwise than of this opinion : he will find that where _ ten _ be take he have every reason to presume that a _ hundred _ perish in some of these skirmish though they have be begin for the express purpose of _ procure slave _ the conqueror have suffer but few of the vanquish to escape the fury of the sword and there have not be want instance where they have be so incensed at the resistance they have find that they spirit of vengeance have entirely get the better of they avarice and they have murder in cool blood every individual without discrimination either of age or sex the following -lrb- 049 -rrb- be a account of one of these skirmish as describe by a person who be witness to the scene i be send with several other in a small sloop up the river niger to purchase slave : we have some free negro with we in the practice and as the vessel be liable to frequent attack from the negro on one side of the river or the moor on the other they be all arm as we ride at anchor a long way up the river we observe a large number of negro in hut by the river 's side and for we own safety keep a wary eye on they early next morning we see from we masthead a numerous body approach with apparently but little order but in close array they approach very fast and fall furiously on the inhabitant of the town who seem to be quite _ surprize _ but nevertheless as soon as they could get together fight stoutly they have some fire-arm but make very little use of they as they come directly to close fight with they spear lance and sabre many of the invader be mount on small horse and both party fight for about half a hour with the fiercest animosity exert much more courage and perseverance than i have ever before be witness to amongst they the woman and child of the town cluster together to the water 's edge run shriek up and down with terror wait the event of the combat till they party give way and take to the water to endeavor to swim over to the barbary side they be closely pursue even into the river by the victor who though they come for the purpose of _ get slave _ give no quarter _ they cruelty even prevail over they avarice _ they make no prisoner but put all to the sword without mercy horrible indeed be the carnage of the vanquish on this occasion and as we be within two or three hundred yard of they they cry and shriek affect we extremely we have get up we anchor at the beginning of the fray and now stand close in to the spot where the victor have follow the vanquish into the water be continually drag out and murder those whom by reason of they wound they easily overtake the very child whom they take in great number do not escape the massacre enrage at they barbarity we fire we gun loaden with grape shot and a volley of small arm among they which effectually check they ardor and oblige they to retire to a distance from the shore from whence a few round cannon shot soon remove they into the wood the whole river be black over with the head of the fugitive who be swim for they life these poor wretch fear _ we _ as much as they conqueror dive when we fire and cry most lamentably for mercy have now effectually favor they retreat we stand backwards and forwards and take up several that be wound and tire all whose wound have disabled they from swimming be either butcher or drown before we get up to they with a justice and generosity _ never i believe before hear of among slaver _ we give those they liberty whom we have take up set they on shore on the barbary side among the poor residue of they companion who have survive the slaughter of the morning we shall make but two remark on this horrid instance of african cruelty it add first a considerable weight to the statement that have be make and confirm secondly the conclusion that be draw in the precede chapter for if we even allow the right of capture to be just and the principle of reparation and punishment to be applicable to the individual of a community yet would the former be unjust and the latter inapplicable in the present case every african war be a robbery and we may add to we former expression when we say that thus have many thousand of man in the most iniquitous manner be send into servitude that we believe there be few of this order who be not as much the example of injustice as the people that have be kidnap and who do not additionally convey when we consider they as prisoner of war a idea of the most complicated scene of murder the order of _ convict _ as it exist almost solely among those prince whose dominion be contiguous to the european factory be from this circumstance so inconsiderable when compare with either of the precede that we should not have mention it again but that we be unwilling to omit any additional argument that occur against it it have be shewn already that the punishment of slavery be inflict from no other motive than that of gratify the _ avarice _ of the prince a confederation so detestable as to be sufficient of itself to prove it to be unjust and that it be so disproportionate from its _ nature _ to the offence as to afford a additional proof of its injustice we shall add now as a second argument its disproportion from its _ continuance : _ and we shall derive a third from the consideration that in civil society every violation of the law of the community be a offence against the _ state _ -lrb- 050 -rrb- let we suppose then a african prince disdain for once the idea of emolument : let we suppose he for once inflamed with the love of he country and resolve to punish from this principle alone that by exhibit a example of terror he may preserve that _ happiness of the publick _ which he be bind to secure and defend by the very nature of he contract or in other word that he may answer the end of government if actuate then by this principle he should adjudge slavery to a offender as a just punishment for he offence for whose benefit must the convict labor if it be answer for the benefit of the state we allow that the punishment in whatever light it be consider will be find to be equitable : but if it be answer for the benefit of any _ individual whom he please to appoint _ we deny it to be just the state -lrb- 051 -rrb- alone be consider to have be injure and as _ injury can not possibly be transfer _ the state alone can justly receive the advantage of he labor but if the african prince when he thus condemn he to labor for the benefit of a _ unoffended individual _ should at the same time sentence he to become he _ property _ that be if he should make the person and life of the convict at the absolute disposal of he for whom he have sentence he to labor it be evident that in addition to he former injustice he be usurp a power which no ruler or ruler of a state can possess and which the great creator of the universe never yet give to any order whatever of create being that this reasoning be true and that civilized nation have consider it as such will be best testify by they practice we may appeal here to that _ slavery _ which be now adjudge to delinquent as a punishment among many of the state of europe these delinquent be sentence to labor at the _ oar _ to work in _ mine _ and on _ fortification _ to cut and clear _ river _ to make and repair _ road _ and to perform other work of national utility they be employ in short in the _ publick _ work because as the crime they have commit be consider to have be crime against the publick no individual can justly receive the emolument of they labor and they be neither _ sell _ nor make capable of be _ transfer _ because no government whatsoever be invest with such a power thus then may that slavery in which only the idea of _ labor _ be include be perfectly equitable and the delinquent will always receive he punishment as a man whereas in that which additionally include the idea of _ property _ and to undergo which the delinquent must previously change he nature and become a _ brute _ there be a inconsistency which no argument can reconcile and a contradiction to every principle of nature which a man need only to appeal to he own feeling immediately to evince and we will venture to assert from the unite observation that have be make upon the subject in opposition to any argument that may be advance that there be scarcely one of those who be call african convict on whom the prince have a right to inflict a punishment at all and that there be no one whatever whom he have a power of sentence to labor for the benefit of a unoffended individual and much less whom he have a right to sell have now fully examine the argument of the _ seller _ -lrb- 052 -rrb- and have make such additional remark as be necessary we have only to add that we can not sufficiently express we detestation at they conduct be the reader coolly to reflect upon the case of but _ one _ of the unfortunate man who be annually the victim of _ avarice _ and consider he situation in life as a father a husband or a friend we be sure that even on such a partial reflection he must experience considerable pain what then must be he feeling when he be tell that since the slave-trade begin -lrb- 053 -rrb- _ nine million _ of man have be tear from they dearest connection and sell into slavery if at this recital he indignation should arise let he consider it as the genuine production of nature that she recoil at the horrid thought and that she apply instantly a torch to he breast to kindle he resentment and if during he indignation she should awaken the sigh of sympathy or seduce the tear of commiseration from he eye let he consider each as a additional argument against the iniquity of the _ seller _ \* \* \* \* \* footnote -lrb- footnote 048 :

_ they fellow-creature into slavery defend the _ commerce _ they first plea be that they receive those with propriety who be convict of crime because they be deliver into they hand by _ they own magistrate _ but what be this to you _ receiver _ have the unfortunate _ convict _ be guilty of injury to _ you _ have they break _ you _ treaty have they plunder _ you _ ship have they carry _ you _ wife and child into slavery that _ you _ should thus retaliate have they offend _ you _ even by word or gesture but if the african convict be innocent with respect to you if you have not even the shadow of a claim upon they person by what right do you receive they by the law of the african you will say by which it be positively allow -- but can _ law _ alter the nature of vice they may give it a sanction perhaps : it will still be immutably the same and though dress in the outward habiliment of _ honor _ will still be _ intrinsically base _ but alas you do not only attempt to defend yourselve by these argument but even dare to give you action the appearance of lenity and assume _ merit _ from you _ baseness _ and how first ought you particularly to blush when you assert that prisoner of war be only purchase from the hand of they conqueror _ to deliver they from death _ ridiculous defense can the most credulous believe it you entice the african to war you foment they quarrel you supply they with arm and ammunition and all -- from the _ motive of benevolence _ do a man set fire to a house for the purpose of rescue the inhabitant from the flame but if they be only purchase to _ deliver they from death _ why when they be deliver into you hand as protector do you torture they with hunger why do you kill they with fatigue why do the whip deform they body or the knife they limb why do you sentence they to death to a death infinitely more excruciating than that from which you so kindly save they what answer do you make to this for if you have not humanely preserve they from the hand of they conqueror a quick death perhaps and that in the space of a moment have free they from they pain : but on account of you _ favor _ and _ benevolence _ it be know that they have linger year in pain and agony and have be sentence at last to a dreadful death for the most insignificant offence neither can we allow the other argument to be true on which you find you merit that you take they from they country for they own convenience because africa scorch with incessant heat and subject to the most violent rain and tempest be unwholesome and unfit to be inhabit preposterous man do you thus judge from you own feeling do you thus judge from you own constitution and frame but if you suppose that the african be incapable of endure they own climate because you can not endure it yourselve why do you receive they into slavery why do you not measure they here by the same standard for if you be unable to bear hunger and thirst chain and imprisonment wound and torture why do you not suppose they incapable of endure the same treatment thus then be you argument turn against yourselve but consider the answer which the scythian give the ægyptians when they contend about the antiquity of they original -lrb- 054 -rrb- that nature when she first distinguish country by different degree of heat and cold temper the body of animal at the same instant to endure the different situation : that as the climate of scythium be severer than that of ægypt so be the body of the scythian harder and as capable of endure the severity of they atmosphere as the ægyptians the temperateness of they own but you may say perhaps that though they be capable of endure they own climate yet they situation be frequently uncomfortable and even wretched : that africa be infested with locust and insect of various kind that they settle in swarm upon the tree destroy the verdure consume the fruit and deprive the inhabitant of they food but the same answer may be apply as before that the same kind providence who temper the body of the animal temper also the body of the tree that he give it a quality to recover the bite of the locust which he send and to reassume in a short interval of time its former glory and that such be the case experience have shew : for the very tree that have be infested and strip of they bloom and verdure so surprizingly quick be vegetation appear in a few day as if a insect have be utterly unknown we may add to these observation from the testimony of those who have write the history of africa from they own inspection that no country be more luxurious in prospects none more fruitful none more rich in herd and flock and none where the comfort of life can be gain with so little trouble but you say again as a confirmation of these you former argument -lrb- by which you would have it understand that the african themselves be sensible of the goodness of you intention -rrb- that they do not appear to go with you against they will impudent and base assertion why then do you load they with chain why keep you you daily and nightly watch but alas as a farther though a more melancholy proof of the falsehood of you assertion how many when on board you ship have put a period to they existence how many have leap into the sea how many have pine to death that even at the expence of they life they might fly from you _ benevolence _ do you call they obstinate then because they refuse you favor do you call they ungrateful because they make you this return how much rather ought you receiver to blush how much rather ought you receiver to be consider as abandon and execrable who when you usurp the dominion over those who be as free and independent as yourselve break the first law of justice which ordain that no person shall do harm to another without a previous provocation who offend against the dictate of nature which command that no just man shall be give or receive into slavery against he own consent and who violate the very law of the empire that you assume by consign you subject to misery now as a famous heathen philosopher observe from whose mouth you shall be convict -lrb- 055 -rrb- there be a considerable difference whether a injury be do during any perturbation of mind which be generally short and momentary or whether it be do with any previous meditation and design for those crime which

man into slavery -lrb- as we have shew before -rrb- and of those who _ receive _ or _ purchase _ they -lrb- as we have now shewn -rrb- be wholly false it be evident that this _ commerce _ be not only

and most conspicuous point of view we shall throw a considerable part of we information on this head into the form of a narrative : we shall suppose ourselves in short on the continent of africa and relate a scene which from its agreement with unquestionable fact might not unreasonably be presume to have be present to we view have we be really there and first let we turn we eye to the cloud of dust that be before we it seem to advance rapidly and accompany with dismal shriek and yelling to make the very air that be above it tremble as it roll along what can possibly be the cause let we inquire of that melancholy african who seem to walk deject near the shore whose eye be stedfastly fix on the approach object and whose heart if we can judge from the appearance of he countenance must be greatly agitate alas say the unhappy african the cloud that you see approach be a train of wretched slave they be go to the ship behind you they be destine for the english colony and if you will stay here but for a little time you will see they pass they be last night draw up upon the plain which you see before you where they be brand upon the breast with a _ hot iron _ and when they have undergo the whole of the treatment which be customary on these occasion and which i be inform that you englishmen at home use to the _ cattle _ which you buy they be return to they prison as i have some dealings with the member of the factory which you see at a little distance -lrb- though thanks to the great spirit i never deal in the _ liberty _ of my fellow creature -rrb- i gain admittance there i learn the history of some of the unfortunate people whom i see confine and will explain to you if my eye should catch they as they pass the real cause of they servitude scarcely be these word speak when they come distinctly into sight they appear to advance in a long column but in a very irregular manner there be three only in the front and these be chained together the rest that follow seem to be chained by pair but by press forward to avoid the lash of the driver the breadth of the column begin to be greatly extend and ten or more be observe abreast while we be make these remark the intelligent african thus resume he discourse the first three whom you observe at the head of the train to be chained together be prisoner of war as soon as the ship that be behind you arrive the news be dispatch into the inland country when one of the petty king immediately assemble he subject and attack a neighbouring tribe the wretched people though they be surprize make a formidable resistance as they resolve almost all of they rather to lose they life than survive they liberty the person whom you see in the middle be the father of the two young man who be chained to he on each side he wife and two of he child be kill in the attack and he father be wound and on account of he age _ incapable of servitude _ be leave bleed on the spot where this transaction happen with respect to those who be now pass we and be immediately behind the former i can give you no other intelligence than that some of they to about the number of thirty be take in the same skirmish they tribe be say to have be numerous before the attack these however be _ all that be left alive _ but with respect to the unhappy man who be now opposite to we and whom you may distinguish as he be now look back and wring he hand in despair i can inform you with more precision he be a unfortunate convict he live only about five day journey from the factory he go out with he king to hunt and be one of he train but through too great a anxiety to afford he royal master diversion he rouse the game from the covert rather sooner than be expect the king exasperate at this circumstance immediately sentence he to slavery he wife and child fear lest the tyrant should extend the punishment to themselves _ which be not unusual _ flee directly to the wood where they be all devour the people whom you see close behind the unhappy convict form a numerous body and reach a considerable way they speak a language which no person in this part of africa can understand and they feature as you perceive be so different from those of the rest that they almost appear a distinct race of man from this circumstance i recollect they they be the subject of a very distant prince who agree with the _ slave merchant for a quantity of spirituous liquor _ to furnish he with a stipulate number of slave he accordingly surround and set fire to one of he own village in the night and seize these people who be unfortunately the inhabitant as they be escape from the flame i first see they as the merchant be drive they in about two day ago they come in a large body and be tie together at the neck with leather thong which permit they to walk at the distance of about a yard from one another many of they be loaden with elephant tooth which have be purchase at the same time all of they have bag make of skin upon they shoulder for as they be to travel in they way from the great mountain through barren sand and inhospitable wood for many day together they be oblige to carry water and provision with they notwithstanding this many of they perish some by hunger but the greatest number by fatigue as the place from whence they come be at such a amazing distance from this and the obstacle from the nature of the country so great that the journey could scarcely be complete in seven moon when this relation be finish and we have be look stedfastly for some time on the croud that be go by we lose sight of that peculiarity of feature which we have before remark we then discover that the inhabitant of the depopulate village have all of they pass we and that the part of the train to which we be now opposite be a numerous body of kidnap people here we indulge we imagination we think we behold in one of they a father in another a husband and in another a son each of whom be force from he various and tender connection and without even the opportunity of bid they adieu while we be engage in these and other melancholy reflection the whole body of slave have entirely pass we we turn almost insensibly to look at they again when we discover a unhappy man at the end of the train who could scarcely keep pace with the rest he foot seem to have suffer much from long and constant travel for he be limp painfully along this man resume the african have travel a considerable way he live at a great distance from hence and have a large family for whom he be daily to provide as he go out one night to a neighbouring spring to procure water for he thirsty child he be kidnap by two _ slave hunter _ who sell he in the morning to some country merchant for a _ bar of iron _ these drive he with other slave procure almost in the same manner to the nearest market where the english merchant to whom the train that have just now pass we belong purchase he and two other by means of they travel agent for a _ pistol _ he wife and child have be long wait for he return but he be go for ever from they sight : and they must be now disconsolate as they must be certain by he delay that he have fall into the hand of the _ christian _ and now as i have mention the name of _ christian _ a name by which the european distinguish themselves from we i could wish to be inform of the meaning which such a appellation may convey they consider themselves as _ man _ but we unfortunate african whom they term _ heathen _ as the _ beast _ that serve we but ah how different be the fact what be _ christianity _ but a system of _ murder _ and _ oppression _ the cry and yell of the unfortunate people who be now soon to embark for the region of servitude have already pierce my heart have you not hear I sigh while we have be talk do you not see the tear that now trickle down my cheek and yet these harden _ christian _ be unable to be move at all : nay they will scourge they amidst they groan and even smile while they be torture they to death happy happy heathenism which can detest the vice of christianity and feel for the distress of mankind but we reply you be totally mistaken : _ christianity _ be the most perfect and lovely of moral system it bless even the hand of persecution itself and return good for evil but the people against whom you so justly declaim be not _ christian _ they be _ infidel _ they be _ monster _ they be out of the common course of nature they countryman at home be generous and brave they support the sick the lame and the blind they fly to the succor of the distressed they have noble and stately building for the sole purpose of benevolence they be in short of all nation the most remarkable for humanity and justice but why then reply the honest african do they suffer this why be africa a scene of blood and desolation why be she child wrest from she to administer to the luxury and greatness of those whom they never offend and why be these dismal cry in vain alas we reply again can the cry and groan with which the air now tremble be hear across this extensive continent can the southern wind convey they to the ear of britain if they could reach the generous englishman at home they would pierce he heart as they have already pierce you own he would sympathize with you in you distress he would be enrage at the conduct of he countryman and resist they tyranny -- but here a shriek unusually loud accompany with a dreadful rattle of chain interrupt the discourse the wretched african be just about to embark : they have turn they face to they country as if to take a last adieu and with arm uplift to the sky be make the very atmosphere resound with they prayer and imprecation \* \* \* \* \* chap ii the foregoing scene though it may be say to be imaginary be strictly consistent with fact it be a scene to which the reader himself may have be witness if he have ever visit the place where it be suppose to lie as no circumstance whatever have be insert in it for which the fullest and most undeniable evidence can not be produce we shall proceed now to describe in general term the treatment which the wretched african undergo from the time of they embarkation when the african slave who be collect from various quarter for the purpose of sale be deliver over to the _ receiver _ they be conduct in the manner above describe to the ship they situation on board be beyond all description : for here they be crouded hundred of they together into such a small compass as would scarcely be think sufficient to accommodate twenty if consider as _ free man _ this confinement soon produce a effect that may be easily imagine it generate a pestilential air which co-operate with bad provision occasion such a sickness and mortality among they that not less than _ twenty thousand _ -lrb- 056 -rrb- be generally take off in every yearly transportation thus confine in a pestilential prison and almost entirely exclude from the chearful face of day it remain for the sickly survivor to linger out a miserable existence till the voyage be finish but be no farther evil to be expect in the interim particularly if we add to they already wretched situation the indignity that be daily offer they and the regret which they must constantly feel at be for ever force from they connexion these evil be but too apparent some of they have resolve and notwithstanding the threat of the _ receiver _ have carry they resolve into execution to starve themselves to death other when they have be bring upon deck for air if the least opportunity have offer have leap into the sea and terminate they misery at once other in a fit of despair have attempt to rise and regain they liberty but here what a scene of barbarity have constantly ensue some of they have be instantly kill upon the spot some have be take from the hold have be bruise and mutilate in the most barbarous and shocking manner and have be return bleed to they companion as a sad example of resistance while other tie to the rope of the ship and mangled alternately with the whip and knife have be leave in that horrid situation till they have expire but this be not the only inhuman treatment which they be frequently oblige to undergo for if there should be any necessity from tempestuous weather for lighten the ship or if it should be presume on the voyage that the provision will fall short before the port can be make they be many of they throw into the sea without any compunction of mind on the part of the _ receiver _ and without any other regret for they loss than that which _ avarice _ inspire wretched survivor what must be they feeling at such a sight how must they tremble to think of that servitude which be approach when the very _ dog _ of the _ receiver _ have be retain on board and prefer to they unoffending countryman but indeed so lightly be these unhappy people esteem that they life have be even take away upon speculation : there have be a instance within the last five year of _ one hundred and thirty two _ of they be throw into the sea because it be suppose that by this _ trick _ they value could be recover from the insurer -lrb- 057 -rrb- but if the ship should arrive safe at its destine port a circumstance which do not always happen -lrb- for some have be blow up and many lose -rrb- the wretched african do not find a alleviation of they sorrow here they be again expose to sale here they be again subject to the inspection of other brutal _ receiver _ who examine and treat they with a inhumanity at which even avarice should blush to this mortifying circumstance be add another that they be pick out as the purchaser please without any consideration whether the wife be separate from she husband or the mother from she son : and if these cruel instance of separation should happen if relation when they find themselves about to be part should cling together or if filial conjugal or parental affection should detain they but a moment longer in each other 's arm than these _ second receiver _ should think sufficient the lash instantly sever they from they embrace we can not close we account of the treatment which the wretched african undergo while in the hand of the _ first receiver _ without mention a instance of wanton barbarity which happen some time ago particularly as it may be insert with propriety in the present place and may give the reader a better idea of the cruelty to which they be continually expose than any that he may have yet conceive to avoid make a mistake we shall take the liberty that have be allow we and transcribe it from a little manuscript account with which we have be favor by a person of the strictest integrity and who be at that time in the place where the transaction happen -lrb- 058 -rrb- not long after say he -lrb- continue he account -rrb- the perpetrator of a cruel murder commit in open day light in the most publick part of a town which be the seat of government escape every other notice than the curse of a few of the more humane witness of he barbarity a officer of a guinea ship who have the care of a number of new slave and be return from the _ sale-yard _ to the vessel with such as remain unsold observe a stout fellow among they rather slow in he motion which he therefore quicken with he rattan the slave soon afterwards fall down and be raise by the same application move forwards a few yard he fall down again and this be take as a proof of he sullen perverse spirit the enraged officer furiously repeat he blow till he expire at he foot the brute coolly order some of the survive slave to carry the dead body to the water 's side where without any ceremony or delay be throw into the sea the tragedy be suppose to have be immediately finish by the not more inhuman shark with which the harbor then abound these voracious fish be suppose to have follow the vessel from the coast of africa in which ten thousand slave be import in that one season be allure by the stench and daily feed by the dead carcass throw overboard on the voyage if the reader should observe here that cattle be better protect in this country than slave in the colony he observation will be just the beast which be drive to market be defend by law from the goad of the driver whereas the wretched african though a human being and whose feeling receive of course a double poignancy from the power of reflection be unnoticed in this respect in the colonial code and may be goad and beat till he expire we may now take we leave of the _ first receiver _ they crime have be already estimate and to reason farther upon it would be unnecessary for where the conduct of man be so manifestly impious there can be no need either of a single argument or a reflection as every reader of sensibility will anticipate they in he own feeling \* \* \* \* \* footnote -lrb- footnote 056 : it be universally allow that at least one fifth of the export negro perish in the passage this estimate be make from the time in which they be put on board to the time when they be dispose of in the colony the french be suppose to lose the greatest number in the voyage but particularly from this circumstance because they slave ship be in general so very large that many of the slave that have be put on board sickly die before the cargo can be complete -rrb- -lrb- footnote 057 : this instance happen in a ship command by one collingwood on the 29th of November 1781 fifty-four of they be throw into the sea alive on the 30th forty-two more and in about three day afterwards twenty-six ten other who be bring upon the deck for the same purpose do not wait to be hand-cuffed but bravely leap into the sea and share the fate of they companion it be a fact that the people on board this ship have not be put upon short allowance the excuse which this execrable wretch make on board for he conduct be the follow _ that if the slave who be then sickly have die a natural death the loss would have be the owner but as they be throw alive into the sea it would fall upon the underwriter _ -rrb- -lrb- footnote 058 : this gentleman be at present resident in england the author of this essay apply to he for some information on the treatment of slave so far as he own knowledge be concern he be so oblige as to furnish he with the write account allude to intersperse only with such instance as he himself could undertake to answer for the author as he have never meet with these instance before and as they be of such high authority intend to transcribe two or three of they and insert they in the fourth chapter they will be find in inverted comma -rrb- \* \* \* \* \* chap iii when the wretched african be thus put into the hand of the _ second receiver _ they be convey to the plantation where they be totally consider as _ cattle _ or _ beast of labor _ they very child if any should be bear to they in that situation be previously destine to the condition of they parent but here a question arise which will interrupt the thread of the narration for a little time viz how far they descendant who compose the fifth order of slave be justly reduce to servitude and upon what principle the _ receiver _ defend they conduct author have be at great pain to inquire why in the ancient servitude the child have uniformly follow the condition of the mother but we conceive that they would have save themselves much trouble and have do themselves more credit if instead of endeavor to reconcile the custom with _ heathen _ notion or they own labor conjecture they have shewn its inconsistency with reason and nature and its repugnancy to common justice suffice it to say that the whole theory of the ancient with respect to the descendant slave may be reduce to this principle that as the parent by become _ property _ be wholly consider as _ cattle _ they child like _ the progeny of cattle _ inherit they parental lot such also be the excuse of the tyrannical _ receiver _ before-mentioned they allege that they have purchase the parent that they can sell and dispose of they as they please that they possess they under the same law and limitation as they cattle and that they child like the progeny of these become they property _ by birth _ but the absurdity of the argument will immediately appear it depend wholly on the supposition that the parent be _ brute _ if they be _ brute _ we shall instantly cease to contend : if they be _ man _ which we think it not difficult to prove the argument must immediately fall as we have already shewn that there can not justly be any _ property _ whatever in the _ human species _ it have appear also in the second part of this essay that as nature make every man 's body and mind _ he own _ so no _ just _ person can be reduce to slavery against he own _ consent _ do the unfortunate offspring ever _ consent _ to be slave -- they be slave from they birth -- be they _ guilty _ of crime that they lose they freedom -- they be slave when they can not speak -- be they _ parent _ abandon the crime of the parent can not justly extend to the child thus then must the tyrannical _ receiver _ who presume to sentence the child of slave to servitude if they mean to dispute upon the justice of they cause either allow they to have be _ brute _ from they birth or to have be guilty of crime at a time when they be incapable of offend the very _ king of king _ \* \* \* \* \* chap iv but to return to the narration when the wretched african be convey to the plantation they be consider as _ beast of labor _ and be put to they respective work have lead in they own country a life of indolence and ease where the earth bring forth spontaneously the comfort of life and spare frequently the toil and trouble of cultivation they can hardly be expect to endure the drudgery of servitude calculation be accordingly make upon they life it be conjecture that if three in four survive what be call the _ seasoning _ the bargain be highly favourable this seasoning be say to expire when the two first year of they servitude be complete : it be the time which a african must take to be so accustomed to the colony as to be able to endure the common labor of a plantation and to be put into the _ gang _ at the end of this period the calculation become verify _ twenty thousand _ -lrb- 059 -rrb- of those who be annually import die before the seasoning be over this be surely a horrid and awful consideration : and thus do it appear -lrb- and let it be remember that it be the lowest calculation that have be ever make upon the subject -rrb- that out of every annual supply that be ship from the coast of africa _ forty thousand life _ -lrb- 060 -rrb- be regularly expend even before it can be say that there be really any additional stock for the colony when the seasoning be over and the survivor be thus enable to endure the usual task of slave they be consider as real and substantial supplies from this period -lrb- 061 -rrb- therefore we shall describe they situation they be summon at five in the morning to begin they work this work may be divide into two kind the culture of the field and the collection of grass for cattle the last be the most laborious and intolerable employment as the grass can only be collect blade by blade and be to be fetch frequently twice a day at a considerable distance from the plantation in these two occupation they be jointly take up with no other intermission than that of take they subsistence twice till nine at night they then separate for they respective hut when they gather stick prepare they supper and attend they family this employ they till midnight when they go to rest such be they daily way of life for rather more than half the year they be _ sixteen _ hour include two interval at meal in the service of they master : they be employ _ three _ afterwards in they own necessary concern _ five _ only remain for sleep and they day be finish during the remain portion of the year or the time of crop the nature as well as the time of they employment be considerably change the whole gang be generally divide into two or three body one of these besides the ordinary labor of the day be keep in turn at the mill that be constantly go during the whole of the night this be a dreadful encroachment upon they time of rest which be before too short to permit they perfectly to refresh they wearied limb and actually reduce they sleep as long as this season last to about three hour and a half a night upon a moderate computation -lrb- 062 -rrb- those who can keep they eye open during they nightly labor and be willing to resist the drowsiness that be continually come upon they be presently wear out while some of those who be overcome and who feed the mill between asleep and awake suffer for thus obey the call of nature by the loss of a limb -lrb- 063 -rrb- in this manner they go on with little or no respite from they work till the crop season be over when the year -lrb- from the time of we first description -rrb- be complete to support -lrb- 064 -rrb- a life of such unparalleled drudgery we should at least expect : to find that they be comfortably clothe and plentifully feed but sad reverse they have scarcely a cover to defend themselves against the inclemency of the night they provision be frequently bad and be always deal out to they with such a spare hand that the means of a bare livelihood be not place within the reach of four out of five of these unhappy people it be a fact that many of the disorder of slave be contract from eat the vegetable which they little spot produce before they be sufficiently ripe : a clear indication that the call of hunger be frequently so press as not to suffer they to wait till they can really enjoy they this situation of a want of the common necessaries of life add to that of hard and continual labor must be sufficiently painful of itself how then must the pain be sharpen if it be accompany with severity if a unfortunate slave do not come into the field exactly at the appoint time if droop with sickness or fatigue he appear to work unwillingly or if the bundle of grass that he have be collect appear too small in the eye of the overseer he be equally sure of experience the whip this instrument erase the skin and cut out small portion of the flesh at almost every stroke and be so frequently apply that the smack of it be all day long in the ear of those who be in the vicinity of the plantation this severity of master or manager to they slave which be consider only as common discipline be attend with bad effect it enable they to behold instance of cruelty without commiseration and to be guilty of they without remorse hence those many act of deliberate mutilation that have take place on the slightest occasion : hence those many act of inferior though shocking barbarity that have take place without any occasion at all : the very slitting -lrb- 065 -rrb- of ear have be consider as a operation so perfectly devoid of pain as to have be perform for no other reason than that for which a brand be set upon cattle _ as a mark of property _ but this be not the only effect which this severity produce : for while it harden they heart and make they insensible of the misery of they fellow-creature it beget a turn for wanton cruelty as a proof of this we shall mention one among the many instance that occur where ingenuity have be exert in contrive mode of torture a iron coffin with hole in it be keep by a certain colonist as a auxiliary to the lash in this the poor victim of the master 's resentment be inclose and place sufficiently near a fire to occasion extreme pain and consequently shriek and groan until the revenge of the master be satiate without any other inconvenience on he part than a temporary suspension of the slave 's labor have he be flog to death or he limb mutilate the interest of the brutal tyrant would have suffer a more irreparable loss in mention this instance we do not mean to insinuate that it be common we know that it be reprobate by many all that we would infer from it be that where man be habituate to a system of severity they become _ wantonly cruel _ and that the mere toleration of such a instrument of torture in any country be a clear indication _ that this wretched class of man do not there enjoy the protection of any law that may be pretend to have be enact in they favor _ such then be the general situation of the unfortunate african they be beat and tortured at discretion they be badly clothe they be miserably feed they drudgery be intense and incessant and they rest short for scarcely be they head recline scarcely have they body a respite from the labor of the day or the cruel hand of the overseer but they be summon to renew they sorrow in this manner they go on from year to year in a state of the lowest degradation without a single law to protect they without the possibility of redress without a hope that they situation will be change unless death should terminate the scene have describe the general situation of these unfortunate people we shall now take notice of the common consequence that be find to attend it and relate they separately as they result either from long and painful _ labor _ a _ want _ of the common necessaries of life or continual _ severity _ oppress by a daily task of such immoderate labor as human nature be utterly unable to perform many of they run away from they master they fly to the recess of the mountain where they choose rather to live upon any thing that the soil afford they nay the very soil itself than return to that _ happy situation _ which be represent by the _ receiver _ as the condition of a slave it sometimes happen that the manager of a mountain plantation fall in with one of these he immediately seize he and threaten to carry he to he former master unless he will consent to live on the mountain and cultivate he ground when he plantation be put in order he carry the delinquent home abandon he to all the suggestion of despotick rage and accept a reward for he _ honesty _ the unhappy wretch be chained scourge tortured and all this because he obey the dictate of nature and want to be free and who be there that would not have do the same thing in the same situation who be there that have once know the charm of liberty that would not fly from despotism and yet by the impious law of the _ receiver _ the absence -lrb- 066 -rrb- of six month from the lash of tyranny be -- _ death _ but this law be even mild when compare with another against the same offence which be in force sometime ago and which we fear be even now in force in some of those colony which this account of the treatment comprehend advertisement have frequently appear there offer a reward for the apprehending of fugitive slave either alive or _ dead _ the follow instance be give we by a person of unquestionable veracity under whose own observation it fall as he be travel in one of the colony allude to he observe some people in pursuit of a poor wretch who be seek in the wilderness a asylum from he labor he hear the discharge of a gun and soon afterwards stop at a house for refreshment the head of the fugitive still reek with blood be bring in and lay upon a table with exultation the production of such a trophy be the proof _ require by law _ to entitle the hero to they reward now reader determine if you can who be the most execrable the ruler of the state in authorize murder or the people in be bribe to commit it this be one of the common consequence of that immoderate share of labor which be impose upon they nor be that which be the result of a scanty allowance of food less to be lament the wretched african be often so deeply pierce by the excruciating fang of hunger as almost to be drive to despair what be he to do in such a try situation let he apply to the _ receiver _ alas the majesty of _ receivership _ be too sacred for the appeal and the intrusion would be fatal thus attack on the one hand and shut out from every possibility of relief on the other he have only the choice of be starve or of relieve he necessity by take a small portion of the fruit of he own labor horrid crime to be find eat the cane which probably he own hand have plant and to be eat it because he necessity be press this crime however be of such a magnitude as always to be accompany with the whip and so unmercifully have it be apply on such a occasion as to have be the cause in wet weather of the delinquent 's death but the smart of the whip have not be the only pain that the wretched african have experience any thing that passion could seize and convert into a instrument of punishment have be use and horrid to relate the very knife have not be overlook in the fit of phrenzy ear have be slit eye have be beat out and bone have be break and so frequently have this be the case that it have be a matter of constant lamentation with disinterested people who out of curiosity have attend the market -lrb- 067 -rrb- to which these unhappy people weekly resort that they have not be able to turn they eye on any group of they whatever but they have behold these inhuman mark of passion despotism and caprice but these instance of barbarity have not be able to deter they from similar proceedings and indeed how can it be expect that they should they have still the same appetite to be satisfy as before and to drive they to desperation they creep out clandestinely by night and go in search of food into they master 's or some neighbouring plantation but here they be almost equally sure of suffer the watchman who will be punish himself if he neglect he duty frequently seize they in the fact no excuse or intreaty will avail he must punish they for a example and he must punish they not with a stick nor with a whip but with a cutlass thus it happen that these unhappy slave if they be take be either send away mangled in a barbarous manner or be kill upon the spot we may now mention the consequence of the severity the wretched african daily subject to the lash and unmercifully whipt and beat on every trifling occasion have be find to resist they opposer unpardonable crime that they should have the feeling of nature that they breast should glow with resentment on a injury that they should be so far overcome as to resist those whom _ they be under no obligation to obey _ and whose only title to they service consist in _ a violation of the rights of man _ what have be the consequence -- but here let we spare the feeling of the reader -lrb- we wish we could spare we own -rrb- and let we only say without a recital of the cruelty _ that they have be murder at the discretion of they master _ for let the reader observe that the life of a african be only value at a price that would scarcely purchase a horse that the master have a power of murder he slave if he pay but a trifling fine and that the murder must be attend with uncommon circumstance of horror if it even produce a inquiry immortal alfred father of we invaluable constitution parent of the civil blessing we enjoy how ought thy law to excite we love and veneration who hast forbid we thy posterity to tremble at the frown of tyrant how ought they to perpetuate thy name as venerable to the remotest age who have secure even to the meanest servant a fair and impartial trial how much do nature approve thy law as consistent with she own feeling while she absolutely turn pale tremble and recoil at the institution of these _ receiver _ execrable man you do not murder the horse on which you only ride you do not mutilate the cow which only afford you she milk you do not torture the dog which be but a partial servant of you pleasure : but these unfortunate man from whom you derive you very pleasure and you fortune you torture mutilate murder at discretion sleep then you _ receiver _ if you can while you scarcely allow these unfortunate people to rest at all feast if you can and indulge you genius while you daily apply to these unfortunate people the sting of severity and hunger exult in riches at which even avarice ought to shudder and which humanity must detest \* \* \* \* \* footnote -lrb- footnote 059 : one third of the whole number import be often compute to be lose in the seasoning which in round number will be 27000 the loss in the seasoning depend in a great measure on two circumstance viz on the number of what be call refuse slave that be import and on the quantity of new land in the colony in the french windward island of martinico and guadaloupe which be clear and highly cultivate and in we old small island one fourth include refuse slave be consider as a general proportion but in st domingo where there be a great deal of new land annually take into culture and in other colony in the same situation the general proportion include refuse slave be find to be one third this therefore be a lower estimate than the former and reduce the number to about 23000 we may observe that this be the common estimate but we have reduce it to 20000 to make it free from all objection -rrb- -lrb- footnote 060 : include the number that perish on the voyage and in the season it be generally think that not half the number purchase can be consider as a additional stock and of course that 50000 be consume within the first two year from they embarkation -rrb- -lrb- footnote 061 : that part of the account that have be hitherto give extend to all the european and they colonist who be concern in this horrid practice but we be sorry that we must now make a distinction and confine the remain part of it to the colonist of the british west indium island and to those of the southern province of north america as the employment of slave be different in the two part of the world last mention we shall content ourselves with describe it as it exist in one of they and we shall afterwards annex such treatment and such consequence as be applicable to both we have only to add that the reader must not consider we account as _ universally _ but only _ generally _ true -rrb- -lrb- footnote 062 : this computation be make on a supposition that the gang be divide into three body we call it therefore moderate because the gang be frequently divide into two body which must therefore set up alternately _ every other night _ -rrb- -lrb- footnote 063 : a hand or arm be frequently grind off -rrb- -lrb- footnote 064 : the reader will scarcely believe it but it be a fact that a slave 's annual allowance from he master for provision clothing medicine when sick & c be limit upon a average to thirty shilling -rrb- -lrb- footnote 065 : a boy have receive six slave as a present from he father immediately slit they ear and for the follow reason that as he father be a whimsical man he might claim they again unless they be mark we do not mention this instance as a confirmation of the passage to which it be annex but only to shew how cautious we ought to be in give credit to what may be advance in any work write in defense of slavery by any native of the colony : for be train up to scene of cruelty from he cradle he may consistently with he own feeling represent that treatment as mild at which we who have never be use to see they should absolutely shudder -rrb- -lrb- footnote 066 : in this case he be consider as a criminal against the state the _ marshal _ a officer answering to we sheriff superintend he execution and the master receive the value of the slave from the publick treasury we may observe here that in all case where the delinquent be a criminal of the state he be execute and he value be receive in the same manner he be try and condemn by two or three justice of the peace and without any intervention of a _ jury _ -rrb- -lrb- footnote 067 : particularly in jamaica these observation be make by disinterested people who be there for three or four year during the late war -rrb- \* \* \* \* \* chap v some people may suppose from the melancholy account that have be give in the precede chapter that we have be absolutely deal in romance : that the scene exhibit be rather a dreary picture of the imagination than a representation of fact would to heaven for the honor of human nature that this be really the case we wish we could say that we have no testimony to produce for any of we assertion and that we description of the general treatment of slave have be greatly exaggerate but the _ receiver _ notwithstanding the ample and disinterested evidence that can be bring on the occasion do not admit the description to be true they say first that if the slavery be such as have be now represent no human being could possibly support it long melancholy truth the wretched african generally perish in they prime let they reflect upon the prodigious supplies that be _ annually _ require and they argument will be nothing less than a confession that the slavery have be justly depict they appeal next to every man 's own reason and desire he to think seriously whether self-interest will not always restrain the master from act of cruelty to the slave and whether such account therefore as the foregoing do not contain within themselves they own refutation we answer no for if this restrain principle be as powerful as it be imagine why do not the general conduct of man afford we a better picture what be imprudence or what be vice but a departure from every man 's own interest and yet these be the characteristick of more than half the world -- -- but to come more closely to the present case _ self-interest _ will be find but a weak barrier against the sally of _ passion _ : particularly where it have be daily indulge in its greatest latitude and there be no law to restrain its calamitous effect if the observation be true that passion be a short madness then it be evident that self-interest and every other consideration must be lose so long as it continue we can not have a stronger instance of this than in a circumstance relate in the second part of this essay that though the african have go to war for the express purpose of procure slave yet so great have be they resentment at the resistance they have frequently find that they _ passion _ have entirely get the better of they _ interest _ and they have murder all without any discrimination either of age or sex such may be presume to be the case with the no less savage _ receiver _ impress with the most haughty and tyrannical notion easily provoke accustom to indulge they anger and above all habituate to scene of cruelty and unawed by the fear of law they will hardly be find to be exempt from the common failing of human nature and to spare a unlucky slave at a time when man of cooler temper and better regulate passion be so frequently blind to they own interest but if _ passion _ may be suppose to be generally more than a ballance for _ interest _ how must the scale be turn in favor of the melancholy picture exhibit when we reflect that _ self-preservation _ additionally step in and demand the most _ rigorous severity _ for when we consider that where there be _ one _ master there be _ fifty _ slave that the latter have be all forcibly tear from they country and be retain in they present situation by violence that they be perpetually at war in they heart with they oppressor and be continually cherish the seed of revenge it be evident that even _ avarice _ herself however cool and deliberate however free from passion and caprice must sacrifice she own sordid feeling and adopt a system of tyranny and oppression which it must be ruinous to pursue thus then if no picture have be draw of the situation of slave and it have be leave solely to every man 's sober judgment to determine what it might probably be he would conclude that if the situation be justly describe the page must be frequently stain with act of uncommon cruelty it remain only to make a reply to a objection that be usually advance against particular instance of cruelty to slave as record by various writer it be say that some of these be so inconceivably and beyond all example inhuman that they very excess above the common measure of cruelty shew they at once exaggerated and incredible but they credibility shall be estimate by a supposition let we suppose that the follow instance have be record by a writer of the highest reputation that the master of a ship bind to the western colony with slave on a presumption that many of they would die select a _ hundred and thirty two _ of the most sickly and order they to be throw into the sea to recover they value from the insurer and above all that the fatal order be put into execution what would the reader have think on the occasion would he have believe the fact it would have surely stagger he faith because he could never have hear that any _ one _ man ever be and could never have suppose that any _ one _ man ever could be guilty of the murder of _ such a number _ of he fellow creature but when he be inform that such a fact as this come before a court -lrb- 068 -rrb- of justice in this very country that it happen within the last five year that hundred can come forwards and say that they hear the melancholy evidence with tear what bound be he to place to he belief the great god who look down upon all he creature with the same impartial eye seem to have infatuate the party concern that they might bring the horrid circumstance to light that it might be record in the annals of a publick court as a authentick specimen of the treatment which the unfortunate african undergo and at the same time as a argument to shew that there be no species of cruelty that be record to have be exercise upon these wretched people so enormous that it may not _ readily be believe _ \* \* \* \* \* footnote -lrb- footnote 068 : the action be bring by the owner against the underwriter to recover the value of the _ murder _ slave it be try at guildhall -rrb- \* \* \* \* \* chap vi if the treatment then as before describe be confirm by reason and the great credit that be due to disinterested writer on the subject if the unfortunate african be use as if they flesh be stone and they vitals brass by what argument do you _ receiver _ defend you conduct you say that a great part of you savage treatment consist in punishment for real offence and frequently for such offence as all civilized nation have concur in punish the first charge that you exhibit against they be specifick it be that of _ theft _ but how much rather ought you _ receiver _ to blush who reduce they to such a situation who reduce they to the dreadful alternative that they must either _ steal _ or _ perish _ how much rather ought you _ receiver _ to be consider as _ robber _ yourselve who cause these unfortunate people to be _ steal _ and how much greater be you crime who be _ robber of human liberty _ the next charge which you exhibit against they be general it be that of _ rebellion _ a crime of such a latitude that you can impose it upon almost every action and of such a nature that you always annex to it the most excruciating pain but what a contradiction be this to common sense have the wretched african formally resign they freedom have you any other claim upon they obedience than that of force if then they be you subject you violate the law of government by make they unhappy but if they be not you subject then even though they should resist you proceedings they be not _ rebellious _ but what do you say to that long catalogue of offence which you punish and of which no people but yourselve take cognizance at all you say that the wisdom of legislation have insert it in the colonial law and that you punish by authority but do you allude to that execrable code that _ authorise murder _ that tempt a unoffended person to kill the slave that abhor and fly you service that delegate a power which no host of man which not all the world can possess -- or -- what do you say to that daily unmerited severity which you consider only as common discipline here you say that the african be vicious that they be all of they ill-disposed that you must of necessity be severe but can they be well-disposed to they oppressor in they own country they be just generous hospitable : quality which all the african historian allow they eminently to possess if then they be vicious they must have contract many of they vice from yourselve and as to they own native vice if any have be import with they be they not amiable when compare with yours thus then do the excuse which have be hitherto make by the _ receiver _ force a relation of such circumstance as make they conduct totally inexcusable and instead of diminish at all highly aggravate they guilt \* \* \* \* \* chap vii we come now to that other system of reasoning which be always apply when the former be confute that the african be a inferior link of the chain of nature and be make for slavery this assertion be prove by two argument the first of which be advance also by the ancient and be draw from the _ inferiority of they capacity _ let we allow then for a moment that they appear to have no part that they appear to be void of understanding and be this wonderful when you _ receiver _ depress they sens by hunger be this wonderful when by incessant labor the continual application of the lash and the most inhuman treatment that imagination can devise you overwhelm they genius and hinder it from break forth -- no -- you confound they ability by the severity of they servitude : for as a spark of fire if crush by too great a weight of incumbent fuel can not be blow into a flame but suddenly expire so the human mind if depress by rigorous servitude can not be excite to a display of those faculty which might otherwise have shine with the brightest lustre neither be it wonderful in another point of view for what be it that awaken the ability of man and distinguish they from the common herd be it not often the amiable hope of become serviceable to individual or the state be it not often the hope of riches or of power be it not frequently the hope of temporary honor or a lasting fame these principle have all a wonderful effect upon the mind they call upon it to exert its faculty and bring those talent to the publick view which have otherwise be conceal but the unfortunate african have no such incitement as these that they should shew they genius they have no hope of riches power honor fame they have no hope but this that they misery will be soon terminate by death and here we can not but censure and expose the murmuring of the unthinking and the gay who go on in a continual round of pleasure and prosperity repine at the will of providence as exhibit in the shortness of human duration but let a weak and infirm old age overtake they : let they experience calamity : let they feel but half the misery which the wretched african undergo and they will praise the goodness of providence who have make they mortal who have prescribe certain ordinary bound to the life of man and who by such a limitation have give all man this comfortable hope that however persecute in life a time will come in the common course of nature when they suffering will have a end such then be the nature of this servitude that we can hardly expect to find in those who undergo it even the glimpse of genius for if they mind be in a continual state of depression and if they have no expectation in life to awaken they ability and make they eminent we can not be surprize if a sullen gloomy stupidity should be the lead mark in they character or if they should appear inferior to those who do not only enjoy the invaluable blessing of freedom but have every prospect before they eye that can allure they to exert they faculty now if to these consideration we add that the wretched african be tear from they country in a state of nature and that in general as long as they slavery continue every obstacle be place in the way of they improvement we shall have a sufficient answer to any argument that may be draw from the inferiority of they capacity it appear then from the circumstance that have be mention that to form a true judgment of the ability of these unfortunate people we must either take a general view of they before they slavery commence or confine we attention to such as after it have commence have have any opportunity give they of shew they genius either in art or letter if upon such a fair and impartial view there should be any reason to suppose that they be at all inferior to other in the same situation the argument will then gain some of that weight and importance which it want at present in they own country where we be to see they first we must expect that the prospect will be unfavourable they be mostly in a savage state they power of mind be limit to few object they idea be consequently few it appear however that they follow the same mode of life and exercise the same art as the ancestor of those very european who boast of they great superiority be describe to have do in the same uncultivated state this appear from the nubian 's geography the writings of leo the moor and all the subsequent history which those who have visit the african continent have write from they own inspection hence three conclusion that they ability be sufficient for they situation -- that they be as great as those of other people have be in the same stage of society -- and that they be as great as those of any civilized people whatever when the degree of the barbarism of the one be draw into a comparison with that of the civilization of the other let we now follow they to the colony they be carry over in the unfavourable situation describe it be observe here that though they ability can not be estimate high from a want of cultivation they be yet various and that they vary in proportion as the nation from which they have be bring have advance more or less in the scale of social life this observation which be so frequently make be of great importance : for if they ability expand in proportion to the improvement of they state it be a clear indication that if they be equally improve they would be equally ingenious but here before we consider any opportunity that may be afford they let it be remember that even they most polished situation may be call barbarous and that this circumstance should they appear less docile than other may be consider as a sufficient answer to any objection that may be make to they capacity notwithstanding this when they be put to the mechanical art they do not discover a want of ingenuity they attain they in as short a time as the european and arrive at a degree of excellence equal to that of they teacher this be a fact almost universally know and afford we this proof that have learn with facility such of the mechanical art as they have be teach they be capable of attain any other at least of the same class if they should receive but the same instruction with respect to the liberal art they proficiency be certainly less but not less in proportion to they time and opportunity of study not less because they be less capable of attain they but because they have seldom or ever a opportunity of learn they at all it be yet extraordinary that they talent appear even in some of these science in which they be totally uninstructed they ability in musick be such as to have be generally notice they play frequently upon a variety of instrument without any other assistance than they own ingenuity they have also tune of they own composition some of these have be import among we be now in use and be admire for they sprightliness and ease though the ungenerous and prejudiced importer have conceal they original neither be they talent in poetry less conspicuous every occurrence if they spirit be not too greatly depressed be turn into a song these song be say to be incoherent and nonsensical but this proceed principally from two cause a improper conjunction of word arise from a ignorance of the language in which they compose and a wildness of thought arise from the different manner in which the organ of rude and civilized people will be strike by the same object and as to they want of harmony and rhyme which be the last objection the difference of pronunciation be the cause upon the whole as they be perfectly consistent with they own idea and be strictly musical as pronounced by themselves they afford we as high a proof of they poetical power as the work of the most acknowledged poet but where these impediment have be remove where they have receive a education and have know and pronounce the language with propriety these defect have vanish and they production have be less objectionable for a proof of this we appeal to the writings of a african girl -lrb- 069 -rrb- who make no contemptible appearance in this species of composition she be kidnap when only eight year old and in the year 1761 be transport to america where she be sell with other slave she have no school education there but receive some little instruction from the family with whom she be so fortunate as to live she obtain such a knowledge of the english language within sixteen month from the time of she arrival as to be able to speak it and read it to the astonishment of those who hear she she soon afterwards learn to write and have a great inclination to learn the latin tongue she be indulge by she master and make a progress she poetical work be publish with he permission in the year 1773 they contain thirty-eight piece on different subject we shall beg leave to make a short extract from two or three of they for the observation of the reader _ from a hymn to the evening _ -lrb- 070 -rrb- fill would with the praise of he who give the light and draw the sable curtain of the night let placid slumber sooth each weary mind at morn to wake more heav ` nly and refin would so shall the labor of the day begin more pure and guard from the snare of sin -- & c & c \* \* \* \* \* _ from a hymn to the morning _ aurora hail and all the thousand die that deck thy progress through the vaulted sky the morn awake and wide extend she ray on ev'ry leaf the gentle zephyr play harmonious lay the feather would race resume dart the bright eye and shake the paint plume -- & c & c \* \* \* \* \* _ from thought on imagination _ now here now there the rove _ fancy _ fly till some lov would object strike she wand ` ring eye whose silken fetter all the sens bind and soft captivity involve the mind _ imagination _ who can sing thy force or who describe the swiftness of thy course soar through air to find the bright abode th ' empyreal palace of the thund ` ring god we on thy pinion can surpass the wind and leave the rolling universe behind : from star to star the mental optick reeve measure the sky and range the realm above there in one view we grasp the mighty whole or with new world amaze th ' unbounded soul -- & c & c \* \* \* \* \* such be the poetry which we produce as a proof of we assertion how far it have succeed the reader may by this time have determine in he own mind we shall therefore only beg leave to accompany it with this observation that if the authoress _ be design for slavery _ -lrb- as the argument must confess -rrb- the greater part of the inhabitant of britain must lose they claim to freedom to this poetry we shall only add as a farther proof of they ability the prose composition of ignatius sancho who receive some little education he letter be too well know to make any extract or indeed any farther mention of he necessary if other example of african genius should be require suffice it to say that they can be produce in abundance and that if we be allow to enumerate instance of african gratitude patience fidelity honor as so many instance of good sense and a sound understanding we fear that thousand of the enlighten european would have occasion to blush but a objection will be make here that the two person whom we have particularize by name be prodigy and that if we be to live for many year we should scarcely meet with two other african of the same description but we reply that consider they situation as before describe two person above mediocrity in the literary way be as many as can be expect within a certain period of year and farther that if these be prodigy they be only such prodigy as every day would produce if they have the same opportunity of acquire knowledge as other people and the same expectation in life to excite they genius this have be constantly and solemnly assert by the pious benezet -lrb- 071 -rrb- whom we have mention before as have devote a considerable part of he time to they instruction this great man for we can not but mention he with veneration have a better opportunity of know they than any person whatever and he always uniformly declare that he could never find a difference between they capacity and those of other people that they be as capable of reasoning as any individual european that they be as capable of the highest intellectual attainment in short that they ability be equal and that they only want to be equally cultivate to afford specimen of as fine production thus then do it appear from the testimony of this venerable man whose authority be sufficient of itself to silence all objection against african capacity and from the instance that have be produce and the observation that have be make on the occasion that if the mind of the african be unbroken by slavery if they have the same expectation in life as other people and the same opportunity of improvement they would be equal in all the various branch of science to the european and that the argument that state they to be a inferior link of the chain of nature and design for servitude as far as it depend on the _ inferiority of they capacity _ be wholly malevolent and false -lrb- 072 -rrb- \* \* \* \* \* footnote -lrb- footnote 069 : philli wheatley negro slave to mr john wheatley of boston in new-england -rrb- -lrb-

dr beattie in he essay on truth to which we refer the reader the whole of this admirable refutation extend from p 458 to 464 -rrb- \* \* \* \* \* chap viii the second argument by which it be attempt to be prove that the african be a inferior link of the chain of nature and be design for slavery be draw from _ color _ and from those other mark which distinguish they from the inhabitant of europe to prove this with the greater facility the _ receiver _ divide in opinion some of they contend that the african from these circumstance be the descendant of cain -lrb- 073 -rrb- : other that they be the posterity of ham and that as it be declare by divine inspiration that these should be servant to the rest of the world so they be design for slavery and that the reducing of they to such a situation be only the accomplishment of the will of heaven : while the rest consider they from the same circumstance as a totally distinct species of man conclude they to be a inferior link of the chain of nature and deduce the inference describe to answer these argument in the clearest and fullest manner we be under the necessity of make two supposition first that the scripture be true secondly that they be false if then the scripture be true it be evident that the posterity of cain be extinguish in the flood thus one of the argument be no more with respect to the curse of ham it appear also that it be limit that it do not extend to the posterity of all he son but only to the descendant of he who be call canaan -lrb- 074 -rrb- : by which it be foretell that the canaanite a part of the posterity of ham should serve the posterity of shem and japhet now how do it appear that these wretched african be the descendant of canaan -- by those mark it will be say which distinguish they from the rest of the world -- but where be these mark to be find in the divine writings in what page be it say that the canaanite be to be know by they _ color _ they _ feature _ they _ form _ or the very _ hair of they head _ which be bring into the account -- but alas so far be the divine writings from give any such account that they shew the assertion to be false they shew that the descendant of cush -lrb- 075 -rrb- be of the color to which the advocate for slavery allude and of course that there be no such limitation of color to the posterity of canaan or the inheritor of the curse suppose we should now shew upon the most undeniable evidence -lrb- 076 -rrb- that those of the wretched african who be single out as inherit the curse be the descendant of cush or phut and that we should shew farther that but a single remnant of canaan which be afterwards ruin be ever in africa at all -- here all be consternation -- but unfortunately again for the argument though wonderfully for the confirmation that the scripture be of divine original the whole prophecy have be complete a part of the descendant of canaan be hewer of wood and drawer of water and become tributary and subject to the israelite or the descendant of shem the greek afterwards as well as the roman who be both the descendant of japhet not only subdue those who be settle in syrium and palestine but pursued and conquer all such as be then remain these be the tyrian and carthaginian : the former of whom be ruin by alexander and the greek the latter by scipio and the roman it appear then that the second argument be wholly inapplicable and false : that it be false in its _ application _ because those who be the object of the curse be a totally distinct people : that it be false in its _ proof _ because no such distinguishing mark as have be specify be to be find in the divine writings : and that if the proof could be make out it would be now _ inapplicable _ as the curse have be long complete with respect to the third argument we must now suppose that the scripture be false that mankind do not all spring from the same original that there be different species of man now what must we justly conclude from such a supposition must we conclude that one species be inferior to another and that the inferiority depend upon they _ color _ or they _ feature _ or they _ form _ -- no -- we must now consult the analogy of nature and the conclusion will be this : that as she temper the body of the different species of man in a different degree to enable they to endure the respective climate of they habitation so she give they a variety of color and appearance with a like benevolent design to sum up the whole if the scripture be true it be evident that the posterity of _ cain _ be no more that the curse of _ ham _ have be accomplish and that as all man be derive from the same stock so this variety of appearance in man must either have proceed from some interposition of the deity or from a co-operation of certain cause which have a effect upon the human frame and have the power of change it more or less from its primitive appearance as they happen to be more or less numerous or powerful than those which act upon the frame of man in the first seat of he habitation if from the interposition of the deity then we must conclude that he who bringeth good out of evil produce it for they convenience if from the co-operation of the cause before related what argument may not be find against any society of man who should happen to differ in the point allude to from ourselves if on the other hand the scripture be false then it be evident that there be neither such a person as _ cain _ nor _ ham _ nor _ canaan _ and that nature bestow such color feature and form upon the different species of man as be best adapt to they situation thus on which ever supposition it be found the whole argument must fall and indeed it be impossible that it can stand even in the eye of common sense for if you admit the _ form _ of man as a justification of slavery you may subjugate you own brother : if _ feature _ then you must quarrel with all the world : if _ color _ where be you to stop it be evident that if you travel from the equator to the northern pole you will find a regular gradation of color from black to white now if you can justly take he for you slave who be of the deepest die what hinder you from take he also who only differ from the former but by a shade thus you may proceed take each in a regular succession to the pole but who be you that thus take into slavery so many people where do you live yourself do you live in _ spain _ or in _ france _ or in _ britain _ if in either of these country take care lest the _ whiter native of the north _ should have a claim upon yourself -- but the argument be too ridiculous to be farther noticed have now silence the whole argument we might immediately proceed to the discussion of other point without even declare we opinion as to which of the supposition may be right on which it have be refute but we do not think ourselves at liberty to do this the present age would rejoice to find that the scripture have no foundation and would anxiously catch at the writings of he who should mention they in a doubtful manner we shall therefore declare we sentiment by assert that they be true and that all mankind however various they appearance be derive from the same stock to prove this we shall not produce those innumerable argument by which the scripture have stand the test of age but advert to a single fact it be a universal law observable throughout the whole creation _ that if two animal of a different species propagate they offspring be unable to continue its own species _ by this admirable law the different species be preserved distinct every possibility of confusion be prevent and the world be forbid to be over-run by a race of monster now if we apply this law to those of the human kind who be say to be of a distinct species from each other it immediately fail the _ mulattoe _ be as capable of continue he own species as he father a clear and irrefragable proof that the scripture -lrb- 077 -rrb- account of the creation be true and that god who have make the world have make of one blood -lrb- 078 -rrb- all the nation of man that dwell on all the face of the earth but if this be the case it will be say that mankind be originally of one color and it will be ask at the same time what it be probable that the color be and how they come to assume so various a appearance to each of these we shall make that reply which we conceive to be the most rational as mankind be originally of the same stock so it be evident that they be originally of the same color but how shall we attempt to ascertain it shall we _ englishman _ say that it be the same as that which we now find to be peculiar to ourselves -- no -- this would be a vain and partial consideration and would betray we judgment to have arise from that false fondness which habituate we to suppose that every thing belong to ourselves be the perfectest and the best add to this that we should always be liable to a just reproof from every inhabitant of the globe whose color be different from we own because he would justly say that he have as good a right to imagine that he own be the primitive color as that of any other people how then shall we attempt to ascertain it shall we look into the various climate of the earth see the color that generally prevail in the inhabitant of each and apply the rule this will be certainly free from partiality and will afford we a better prospect of success : for as every particular district have its particular color so it be evident that the complexion of noah and he son from whom the rest of the world be descend be the same as that which be peculiar to the country which be the seat of they habitation this by such a mode of decision will be find a dark olive a beautiful color and a just medium between white and black that this be the primitive color be highly probable from the observation that have be make and if admit will afford a valuable lesson to the european to be cautious how they deride those of the opposite complexion as there be great reason to presume _ that the purest white -lrb- 079 -rrb- be as far remove from the primitive color as the deepest black _ we come now to the grand question which be that if mankind be originally of this or any other color how come it to pass that they should wear so various a appearance we reply as we have have occasion to say before either _ by the interposition of the deity _ or _ by a co-operation of certain cause which have a effect upon the human frame and have the power of change it more or less from its primitive appearance as they be more or less numerous or powerful than those which act upon the frame of man in the first seat of he habitation _ with respect to the divine interposition two epoch have be assign when this difference of color have be imagine to have be so produce the first be that which have be relate when the curse be pronounce on a branch of the posterity of _ ham _ but this argument have be already refute for if the particular color allude to be assign at this period it be assign to the descendant of _ canaan _ to distinguish they from those of he other brother and be therefore _ limited _ to the former but the descendant of _ cush _ -lrb- 080 -rrb- as we have shew before partook of the same color a clear proof that it be neither assign to they on this occasion nor at this period the second epoch be that when mankind be disperse on the building of _ babel _ it have be think that both _ national feature and color _ might probably have be give they at this time because these would have assist the confusion of language by cause they to disperse into tribe and would have unite more firmly the individual of each after the dispersion have take place but this be improbable : first because there be great reason to presume that mose who have mention the confusion of language would have mention these circumstance also if they have actually contribute to bring about so singular a event : secondly because the confusion of language be sufficient of itself to have accomplish this and we can not suppose that the deity could have do any thing in vain : and thirdly because if mankind have be disperse each tribe in its peculiar hue it be impossible to conceive that they could have wander and settle in such a manner as to exhibit that regular gradation of color from the equator to the pole so conspicuous at the present day these be the only period which there have be even the shadow of a probability for assign and we may therefore conclude that the precede observation together with such circumstance as will appear in the present chapter will amount to a demonstration that the difference of color be never cause by any interposition of the deity and that it must have proceed therefore from that _ incidental co-operation of cause _ which have be before related what these cause be it be out of the power of human wisdom positively to assert : there be fact however which if properly weigh and put together will throw considerable light upon the subject these we shall submit to the perusal of the reader and shall deduce from they such inference only as almost every person must make in he own mind on they recital the first point that occur to be ascertain be what part of the skin be the seat of color the old anatomist usually divide the skin into two part or lamina the exterior and thinnest call by the greek _ epidermi _ by the roman _ cuticulum _ and hence by we _ cuticle _ and the interior call by the former _ derma _ and by the latter _ cuti _ or _ true skin _ hence they must necessarily have suppose that as the _ true skin _ be in every respect the same in all human subject however various they external hue so the seat of color must have exist in the _ cuticle _ or upper surface malphigus a eminent italian physician of the last century be the first person who discover that the skin be divide into three lamina or part the _ cuticle _ the _ true skin _ and a certain coagulated substance situate between both which he distinguish by the title of _ mucosum corpus _ a title retain by anatomist to the present day : which coagulate substance adhere so firmly to the _ cuticle _ as in all former anatomical preparation to have come off with it and from this circumstance to have lead the ancient anatomist to believe that there be but two lamina or divisible portion in the human skin this discovery be sufficient to ascertain the point in question : for it appear afterwards that the _ cuticle _ when divide accord to this discovery from the other lamina be semi-transparent that the cuticle of the blackest negroe be of the same transparency and color as that of the purest white and hence the _ true skin _ of both be invariably the same that the _ mucosum corpus _ be the seat of color this have be farther confirm by all subsequent anatomical experiment by which it appear that whatever be the color of this intermediate coagulated substance nearly the same be the apparent color of the upper surface of the skin neither can it be otherwise for the _ cuticle _ from its transparency must necessarily transmit the color of the substance beneath it in the same manner though not in the same degree as the _ cornea _ transmit the color of the _ iri _ of the eye this transparency be a matter of ocular demonstration in white people it be conspicuous in every blush for no one can imagine that the cuticle become red as often as this happen : nor be it less discoverable in the vein which be so easy to be discern for no one can suppose that the blue streak which he constantly see in the fairest complexion be paint as it be on the surface of the upper skin from these and a variety of other observation -lrb- 081 -rrb- no maxim be more true in physiology than that _ on the mucosum corpus depend the color of the human body _ or in other word that the _ mucosum corpus _ be of a different color in different inhabitant of the globe and appear through the cuticle or upper surface of the skin give they that various appearance which strike we so forcibly in contemplate the human race as this can be incontrovertibly ascertain it be evident that whatever cause cooperate in produce this different appearance they produce it by act upon the _ mucosum corpus _ which from the almost incredible manner in which the cuticle -lrb- 082 -rrb- be perforated be as accessible as the cuticle itself these cause be probably those various quality of thing which combine with the influence of the sun contribute to form what we call _ climate _ for when any person consider that the mucous substance before-mentioned be find to vary in its color as the _ climate _ vary from the equator to the pole he mind must be instantly strike with the hypothesis and he must adopt it without any hesitation as the genuine cause of the phænomenon this fact -lrb- 083 -rrb- _ of the variation of the mucous substance accord to the situation of the place _ have be clearly ascertain in the numerous anatomical experiment that have be make in which subject of all nation have come under consideration the native of many of the kingdom and isle of _ asia _ be find to have they _ corpus mucosum _ black those of _ africa _ situate near the line of the same color those of the maritime part of the same continent of a dusky brown nearly approach to it and the color become lighter or darker in proportion as the distance from the equator be either greater or less the european be the fairest inhabitant of the world those situate in the most southern region of _ europe _ have in they _ corpus mucosum _ a tinge of the dark hue of they _ african _ neighbor : hence the epidemick complexion prevalent among they be nearly of the color of the pickled spanish olive while in this country and those situate nearer the north pole it appear to be nearly if not absolutely white these be fact -lrb- 084 -rrb- which anatomy have establish and we acknowledge they to be such that we can not divest ourselves of the idea that _ climate _ have a considerable share in produce a difference of color other we know have invent other hypothesis but all of they have be instantly refute as unable to explain the difficulty for which they be advance and as absolutely contrary to fact : and the inventor themselves have be oblige almost as soon as they have propose they to acknowledge they deficient the only objection of any consequence that have ever be make to the hypothesis of _ climate _ be this _ that people under the same parallel be not exactly of the same color _ but this be no objection in fact : for it do not follow that those country which be at a equal distance from the equator should have they climate the same indeed nothing be more contrary to experience than this climate depend upon a variety of accident high mountain in the neighborhood of a place make it cooler by chill the air that be carry over they by the wind large spread succulent plant if among the production of the soil have the same effect : they afford agreeable cooling shades and a moist atmosphere from they continual exhalation by which the ardor of the sun be considerably abate while the soil on the other hand if of a sandy nature retain the heat in a uncommon degree and make the summer considerably hotter than those which be find to exist in the same latitude where the soil be different to this proximity of what may be term _ burn sand _ and to the sulphurous and metallick particle which be continually exhale from the bowels of the earth be ascribe the different degree of blackness by which some _ african _ nation be distinguishable from each other though under the same parallel to these observation we may add that though the inhabitant of the same parallel be not exactly of the same hue yet they differ only by shades of the same color or to speak with more precision that there be no two people in such a situation one of whom be white and the other black to sum up the whole -- suppose we be to take a common globe to begin at the equator to paint every country along the meridian line in succession from thence to the pole and to paint they with the same color which prevail in the respective inhabitant of each we should see the black with which we have be oblige to begin insensibly change to a olive and the olive through as many intermediate color to a white : and if on the other hand we should complete any one of the parallel accord to the same plan we should see a difference perhaps in the appearance of some of the country through which it run though the difference would consist wholly in shades of the same color the argument therefore which be bring against the hypothesis be so far from be a objection that we shall consider it one of the first argument in its favor : for if _ climate _ have really a influence on the _ mucous substance _ of the body it be evident that we must not only expect to see a gradation of color in the inhabitant from the equator to the pole but also different -lrb- 085 -rrb- shades of the same color in the inhabitant of the same parallel to this argument we shall add one that be incontrovertible which be that when the _ black _ inhabitant of _ africa _ be transplant to _ colder _ or the _ white _ inhabitant of _ europe _ to _ hotter _ climate they child _ bear there _ be of a _ different color from themselves _ that be lighter in the first and darker in the second instance as a proof of the first we shall give the word of the abbé raynal -lrb- 086 -rrb- in he admire publication the child say he which they -lrb- the _ african _ -rrb- procreate in _ america _ be not so black as they parent be after each generation the difference become more palpable it be possible that after a numerous succession of generation the man come from _ africa _ would not be distinguish from those of the country into which they may have be transplant this circumstance we have have the pleasure of hearing confirm by a variety of person who have be witness of the fact but particularly by many intelligent -lrb- 087 -rrb- african who have be parent themselves in _ america _ and who have declare that the difference be so palpable in the _ northern province _ that not only they themselves have constantly observe it but that they have hear it observe by other neither be this variation in the child from the color of they parent improbable _ the child of the blackest african be bear white _ -lrb- 088 -rrb- in this state they continue for about a month when they change to a pale yellow in process of time they become brown they skin still continue to increase in darkness with they age till it become of a dirty sallow black and at length after a certain period of year glossy and shine now if climate have any influence on the _ mucous substance _ of the body this variation in the child from the color of they parent be a event which must be reasonably expect : for be bear white and not have equally powerful cause to act upon they in colder as they parent have in the hotter climate which they leave it must necessarily follow that the same affect can not possibly be produce hence also if the hypothesis be admit may be deduce the reason why even those child who have be bring from they country at a early age into colder region have be observe -lrb- 089 -rrb- to be of a lighter color than those who have remain at home till they arrive at a state of manhood for have undergo some of the change which we mention to have attend they countryman from infancy to a certain age and have be take away before the rest could be complete these farther change which would have take place have they remain at home seem either to have be check in they progress or weaken in they degree by a colder climate we come now to the second and opposite case for a proof of which we shall appeal to the word of dr mitchell -lrb- 090 -rrb- in the philosophical transaction the _ spaniard _ who have inhabit _ america _ under the torrid zone for any time be become as dark color as we native _ indian _ of _ virginium _ of which _ i myself have be a witness _ and be they not to intermarry with the _ european _ but lead the same rude and barbarous life with the _ indian _ it be very probable that in a succession of many generation they would become as dark in complexion to this instance we shall add one which be mention by a late writer -lrb- 091 -rrb- who describe the _ african _ coast and the _ european _ settlement there have the following passage there be several other small _ portuguese _ settlement and one of some note at _ mitomba _ a river in _ sierra leon _ the people here call _ portuguese _ be principally person breed from a mixture of the first _ portuguese discoverer _ with the native and now become in they _ complexion _ and _ woolly quality _ of they hair _ perfect negro _ retain however a smattering of the _ portuguese _ language these fact with respect to the colonist of the _ european _ be of the highest importance in the present case and deserve a serious attention for when we know to a certainty from whom they be descend when we know that they be at the time of they transplantation of the same color as those from whom they severally spring and when on the other hand we be credibly inform that they have change it for the native color of the place which they now inhabit the evidence in support of these fact be as great as if a person on the removal of two or three family into another climate have determine to ascertain the circumstance as if he have go with they and watch they child as if he have communicate he observation at he death to a successor as if he successor have prosecute the plan and thus a uninterrupted chain of evidence have be keep up from they first removal to any determined period of succeed time but though these fact seem sufficient of themselves to confirm we opinion they be not the only fact which can be adduce in its support it can be shewn that the member of the _ very same family _ when divide from each other and remove into different country have not only change they family complexion but that they have change it to _ as many different color _ as they have go into _ different region of the world _ we can not have perhaps a more striking instance of this than in the _ jew _ these people be scatter over the face of the whole earth they have preserve themselves distinct from the rest of the world by they religion and as they never intermarry with any but those of they own sect so they have no mixture of blood in they vein that they should differ from each other : and yet nothing be more true than that the _ english jew _ -lrb- 092 -rrb- be white the _ portuguese _ swarthy the _ armenian _ olive and the _ arabian _ copper in short that there appear to be as many different species of _ jew _ as there be country in which they reside to these fact we shall add the follow observation that if we can give credit to the ancient historian in general a change from the darkest black to the purest white must have actually be accomplish one instance perhaps may be think sufficient _ herodotus _ -lrb- 093 -rrb- relate that the _ colchus be black _ and that they have _ crisped hair _ these people be a detachment of the _ æthiopian _ army under _ sesostri _ who follow he in he expedition and settle in that part of the world where _ colchi _ be usually represent to have be situate have not the same author inform we of this circumstance we should have think it strange -lrb- 094 -rrb- that a people of this description should have be find in such a latitude now as they be undoubtedly settle there and as they be neither so totally destroy nor make any such rapid conquest as that history should notice the event there be great reason to presume that they descendant continue in the same or settle in the adjacent country from whence it will follow that they must have change they complexion to that which be observable in the inhabitant of this particular region at the present day or in other word that the _ black inhabitant of colchi _ must have be change into the _ fair circassian _ -lrb- 095 -rrb- as we have now shew it to be highly probable from the fact which have be advance that climate be the cause of the difference of color which prevail in the different inhabitant of the globe we shall now shew its probability from so similar a effect produce on the _ mucous substance _ before-mentioned by so similar a cause that though the fact do not absolutely prove we conjecture to be right yet it will give we a very lively conception of the manner in which the phænomenon may be cause this probability may be shewn in the case of _ freckle _ which be to be see in the face of child but of such only as have the thinnest and most transparent skin and be occasion by the ray of the sun striking forcibly on the _ mucous substance _ of the face and dry the accumulate fluid this accumulate fluid or perspirable matter be at first colourless but be expose to violent heat or dry become brown hence the _ mucosum corpus _ be tinge in various part by this brown coagulated fluid and the part so tinged appear through the _ cuticle _ or upper surface of the skin arise that spotted appearance observable in the case recite now if we be to conceive a black skin to be a _ universal freckle _ or the ray of the sun to act so universally on the _ mucous substance _ of a person 's face as to produce these spot so contiguous to each other that they should unite we should then see in imagination a face similar to those which be daily to be see among black people : and if we be to conceive he body to be expose or act upon in the same manner we should then see he body assume a similar appearance and thus we should see the whole man of a perfect black or resemble one of the naked inhabitant of the torrid zone now as the feat of freckle and of blackness be the same as they appearance be similar and as the cause of the first be the ardor of the sun it be therefore probable that the cause of the second be the same : hence if we substitute for the word _ sun _ what be analogous to it the word _ climate _ the same effect may be suppose to be produce and the conjecture to receive a sanction nor be it unlikely that the hypothesis which consider the cause of freckle and of blackness as the same may be right for if blackness be occasion by the ray of the sun striking forcibly and universally on the _ mucous substance _ of the body and dry the accumulate fluid we can account for the different degree of it to be find in the different inhabitant of the globe for as the quantity of perspirable fluid and the force of the solar ray be successively increase as the climate be successively warmer from any give parallel to the line it follow that the fluid with which the _ mucous substance _ will be stain will be successively thicker and deeper color and hence as it appear through the cuticle the complexion successively darker or what amount to the same thing there will be a difference of color in the inhabitant of every successive parallel from these and the whole of the precede observation on the subject we may conclude that as all the inhabitant of the earth can not be otherwise than the child of the same parent and as the difference of they appearance must have of course proceed from incidental cause these cause be a combination of those quality which we call _ climate _ that the blackness of the _ african _ be so far ingraft in they constitution in a course of many generation that they child wholly inherit it if bring up in the same spot but that it be not so absolutely interwoven in they nature that it can not be remove if they be bear and settle in another that _ noah _ and he son be probably of a _ olive _ complexion that those of they descendant who go farther to the south become of a deeper olive or _ copper _ while those who go still farther become of a deeper copper or _ black _ that those on the other hand who travel farther to the north become less olive or _ brown _ while those who go still farther than the former become less brown or _ white _ and that if any man be to point out any one of the color which prevail in the human complexion as likely to furnish a argument that the people of such a complexion be of a different species from the rest it be probable that he own descendant if remove to the climate to which this complexion be peculiar would in the course of a few generation degenerate into the same color have now reply to the argument that the african be a inferior link of the chain of nature as far as it depend on they _ capacity _ and _ color _ we shall now only take notice of a expression which the _ receiver _ before-mentioned be pleased to make use of that they be make for slavery have the african be _ make for slavery _ or to become the property of any society of man it be clear from the observation that have be make in the second part of this essay that they must have be create _ devoid of reason _ : but this be contrary to fact it be clear also that there must have be many and evident sign of the _ inferiority of they nature _ and that this society of man must have have a _ natural right _ to they dominion : but this be equally false no such sign of _ inferiority _ be to be find in the one and the right to dominion in the other be _ incidental _ : for in what volume of nature or religion be it write that one society of man should _ breed slave _ for the benefit of another nor be it less evident that they would have want many of those quality which they have and which brute have not : they would have want that _ spirit of liberty _ that _ sense of ignominy and shame _ -lrb- 096 -rrb- which so frequently drive they to the horrid extremity of finish they own existence nor would they have be endow with a _ contemplative power _ for such a power would have be unnecessary to people in such a situation or rather its only use could have be to increase they pain we can not suppose therefore that god have make a order of being with such mental quality and power for the sole purpose of be use as _ beast _ or _ instrument _ of labor and here what a dreadful argument present itself against you _ receiver _ for if they have no understanding as you confess then be you conduct impious because as they can not perceive the intention of you punishment you severity can not make they better but if on the other hand they have have understanding -lrb- which have evidently appear -rrb- then be you conduct equally impious who by destroy they faculty by the severity of you discipline have reduce man who have once the power of reason to a equality with the brute creation \* \* \* \* \* footnote -lrb- footnote 073 : genesis ch iv 15 -rrb- -lrb- footnote

there be a particular people among those transport from africa to the colony who immediately on receive punishment destroy themselves this be a fact which the _ receiver _ be unable to contradict -rrb- \* \* \* \* \* chap ix the reader may perhaps think that the _ receiver _ have by this time expend all they argument but they store be not so easily exhaust they be well aware that justice nature and religion will continue as they have ever uniformly do to oppose they conduct this have drive they to exert they ingenuity and have occasion that multiplicity of argument to be find in the present question these argument be of a different complexion from the former they consist in compare the state of _ slave _ with that of some of the class of _ free _ man and in certain scene of felicity which the former be say to enjoy it be affirm that the punishment which the african undergo be less severe than the military that they life be happier than that of the english peasant that they have the advantage of manumission that they have they little spot of ground they holy-day they dance in short that they life be a scene of festivity and mirth and that they be much happier in the colony than in they own country these representation which have be make out with much ingenuity and art may have have they weight with the unwary but they will never pass with man of consideration and sense who be accustom to estimate the probability of thing before they admit they to be true indeed the bare assertion that they situation be even comfortable contain its own refutation or at least lead we to suspect that the person who assert it have omit some important consideration in the account such we shall shew to have be actually the case and that the representation of the _ receiver _ when strip of they glossy ornament be but empty declamation it be say first of _ military punishment _ that they be more severe than those which the _ african _ undergo but this be a bare assertion without a proof it be not shewn even by those who assert it how the fact can be make out we be leave therefore to draw the comparison ourselves and to fill up those important consideration which we have just say that the _ receiver _ have omit that military punishment be severe we confess but we deny that they be severer than those with which they be compare where be the military man whose ear have be slit whose limb have be mutilate or whose eye have be beat out but let we even allow that they punishment be equal in the degree of they severity : still they must lose by comparison the soldier be never punish but after a fair and equitable trial and the decision of a military court the unhappy african at the discretion of he lord the one know what particular conduct will constitute a offence -lrb- 097 -rrb- the other have no such information as he be wholly at the disposal of passion and caprice which may impose upon any action however laudable the appellation of a crime the former have it of course in he power to avoid a punishment the latter be never safe the former be punish for a real the latter often for a imaginary fault now will any person assert on compare the whole of those circumstance together which relate to they respective punishment that there can be any doubt which of the two be in the worst situation as to they penal system with respect to the declaration that the life of a _ african _ in the colony be happier than that of a _ english _ peasant it be equally false indeed we can scarcely withhold we indignation when we consider how shamefully the situation of this latter class of man have be misrepresent to elevate the former to a state of fictitious happiness if the representation of the _ receiver _ be true it be evident that those of the most approved writer who have place a considerable share of happiness in the _ cottage _ have be mistake in they opinion and that those of the rich who have be hear to sigh and envy the felicity of the _ peasant _ have be treacherous to they own sensation but which be we to believe on the occasion those who endeavor to dress _ vice _ in the habit of _ virtue _ or those who derive they opinion from they own feeling the latter be surely to be believe and we may conclude therefore that the horrid picture which be give of the life of the _ peasant _ have not so just a foundation as the _ receiver _ would lead we to suppose for have he no pleasure in the thought that he live in he _ own country _ and among he relation and friend that he be actually _ free _ and that he child will be the same that he can never be _ sell _ as a beast that he can speak he mind _ without the fear of the lash _ that he can not even be strike _ with impunity _ and that he partake equally with he superior of the _ protection of the law _ -- now there be no one of these advantage which the _ african _ possess and no one which the defender of slavery take into they account of the other comparison that be usually make we may observe in general that as they consist in compare the iniquitous practice of slavery with other iniquitous practice in force among other nation they can neither raise it to the appearance of virtue nor extenuate its guilt the thing compare be in these instance both of they evil alike they call equally for redress -lrb- 098 -rrb- and be equally disgraceful to the government which suffer they if not encourage they to exist to attempt therefore to justify one species of iniquity by compare it with another be no justification at all and be so far from answer the purpose for which the comparison be intend as to give we reason to suspect that the _ comparer _ have but little notion either of equity or honor we come now to those scene of felicity which slave be say to enjoy the first advantage which they be say to experience be that of _ manumission _ but here the advocate for slavery conceal a important circumstance they expatiate indeed on the charm of freedom and contend that it must be a blessing in the eye of those upon whom it be confer we perfectly agree with they in this particular but they do not tell we that these advantage be _ confine _ that they be confine to some _ favorite domestick _ that not _ one in a hundred _ enjoy they and that they be _ never _ extend to those who be employ in the _ cultivation of the field _ as long as they can work these be they who be most to be pity who be destine to _ perpetual _ drudgery and of whom _ no one whatever _ have a chance of be free from he situation till death either release he at once or age render he incapable of continue he former labor and here let it be remark _ to the disgrace of the receiver _ that he be then make free not -- _ as a reward for he past service _ but as he labor be then of little or no value -- _ to save the tax _ -lrb- 099 -rrb- with the same artifice be mention also make of the little spot or _ garden _ as they be call which slave be say to possess from the _ liberality _ of _ the receiver _ but people must not be lead away by agreeable and pleasant sound they must not suppose that these garden be make for _ flower _ or that they be place of _ amusement _ in which they can spend they time in botanical research and delight alas they do not furnish they with a theme for such please pursuit and speculation they must be cultivate in those hour which ought to be appropriate to rest -lrb- 100 -rrb- and they must be cultivate not for a amusement but to make up _ if it be possible _ the great deficiency in they weekly allowance of provision hence it appear that the _ receiver _ have no merit whatever in such a appropriation of land to they unfortunate slave : for they be either under the necessity of do this or of _ lose _ they by the jaw of famine and it be a notorious fact that with they weekly allowance and the produce of they spot together it be often with the greatest difficulty that they preserve a wretched existence the third advantage which they be say to experience be that of _ holy-day _ or day of respite from they usual discipline and fatigue this be certainly a great indulgence and ought to be record to the immortal honor of the _ receiver _ we wish we could express they liberality in those handsome term in which it deserve to be represent or applaud they sufficiently for deviate for once from the rigor of servile discipline but we confess that we be unequal to the task and must therefore content ourselves with observe that while the horse have _ one _ day in _ seven _ to refresh he limb the happy _ african _ -lrb- 101 -rrb- have but _ one _ in _ fifty-two _ as a relaxation from he labor with respect to they _ dance _ on which such a particular stress have be generally lay we fear that people may have be as shamefully deceive as in the former instance for from the manner in which these be generally mention we should almost be lead to imagine that they have certain hour allow they for the purpose of join in the dance and that they have every comfort and convenience that people be generally suppose to enjoy on such convivial occasion but this be far from the case reason inform we that it can never be if they wish for such innocent recreation they must enjoy they in the time that be allot they for sleep and so far be these dance from proceed from any uncommon degree of happiness which excite they to convivial society that they proceed rather from a uncommon depression of spirit which make they even sacrifice they rest -lrb- 102 -rrb- for the sake of experience for a moment a more joyful oblivion of they care for suppose any one of the _ receiver _ in the middle of a dance be to address he slave in the follow manner : _ african _ i begin at last to feel for you situation and my conscience be severely hurt whenever i reflect that i have be reduce those to a state of misery and pain who have never give I offence you seem to be fond of these exercise but yet you be oblige to take they at such unseasonable hour that they impair you health which be sufficiently break by the intolerable share of labor which i have hitherto impose upon you i will therefore make you a proposal will you be content to live in the colony and you shall have the half of every week entirely to yourselve or will you choose to return to you miserable wretched country -- but what be that which strike they ear which make they motionless in a instant which interrupt the festive scene -- they country -- transport sound -- behold they be now fly from the dance : you may see they run to the shore and frantick as it be with joy demand with open arm a instantaneous passage to they beloved native plain such be the _ colonial delight _ by the representation of which the _ receiver _ would persuade we that the _ african _ be take from they country to a region of conviviality and mirth and that like those who leave they usual place of residence for a summer 's amusement they be convey to the colony -- _ to bathe _ -- _ to dance _ -- _ to keep holy-day _ -- _ to be jovial _ -- but there be something so truly ridiculous in the attempt to impose these scene of felicity on the publick as scene which fall to the lot of slave that the _ receiver _ must have be drive to great extremity to hazard they to the eye of censure the last point that remain to be consider be the shameful assertion that the _ african _ be much _ happier in the colony than in they own country _ but in what do this superior happiness consist in those real scene it must be reply which have be just mention for these by the confession of the receiver constitute the happiness they enjoy -- but it have be shewn that these have be unfairly represent and be they realize in the most extensive latitude they would not confirm the fact for if upon a recapitulation it consist in the pleasure of _ manumission _ they surely must have pass they life in a much more comfortable manner who like the _ african at home _ have have no occasion for such a benefit at all but the _ receiver _ we presume reason upon this principle that we never know the value of a blessing but by its loss this be generally true : but would any one of they make himself a _ slave _ for year that he might run the chance of the pleasure of _ manumission _ or that he might taste the charm of liberty with _ a greater relish _ nor be the assertion less false in every other consideration for if they happiness consist in the few _ holy-day _ which _ in the colony _ they be permit to enjoy what must be they situation _ in they own country _ where the whole year be but one continue holy-day or cessation from discipline and fatigue -- if in the possession of _ a mean and contract spot _ what must be they situation where a whole region be they own produce almost spontaneously the comfort of life and require for its cultivation none of those hour which should be appropriate to _ sleep _ -- if in the pleasure of the _ colonial dance _ what must it be in _ they own country _ where they may dance for ever where there be no stated hour to interrupt they felicity no intolerable labor immediately to succeed they recreation and no overseer to receive they under the discipline of the lash -- if these therefore be the only circumstance by which the assertion can be prove we may venture to say without fear of opposition that it can never be prove at all but these be not the only circumstance it be say that they be barbarous at home -- but do you _ receiver _ civilize they -- you unwillingness to convert they to christianity because you suppose you must use they more kindly when convert be but a bad argument in favor of the fact it be affirm again that they manner of life and they situation be such in they own country that to say they be happy be a jest but who be you who pretend to judge -lrb- 103 -rrb- of another man 's happiness that state which each man under the guidance of he maker form for himself and not one man for another to know what constitute mine or you happiness be the sole prerogative of he who create we and cast we in so various and different mould do you slave ever complain to you of they unhappiness amidst they native wood and desart or rather let I ask do they ever cease complain of they condition under you they lordly master where they see indeed the accommodation of civil life but see they all pass to other themselves unbenefited by they be so gracious then ye petty tyrant over human freedom to let you slave judge for themselves what it be which make they own happiness and then see whether they do not place it _ in the return to they own country _ rather than in the contemplation of you grandeur of which they misery make so large a part but since you speak with so much confidence on the subject let we ask you _ receiver _ again if you have ever be inform by you unfortunate slave that they have no connexion in the country from which they have forcibly be tear away : or if you will take upon you to assert that they never sigh when they be alone or that they never relate to each other they tale of misery and woe but you judge of they perhaps in a happy moment when you be deal out to they they provision for the week and be but little aware that though the countenance may be cheer with a momentary smile the heart may be exquisitely tortured be you to shew we indeed that there be law subject to no evasion by which you be oblige to clothe and feed they in a comfortable manner be you to shew we that they be protect -lrb- 104 -rrb- at all or that even _ one _ in a _ thousand _ of those master have suffer death -lrb- 105 -rrb- who have be guilty of _ premeditated _ murder to they slave you would have a better claim to we belief : but you can neither produce the instance nor the law the people of whom you speak be _ slave _ be you own _ property _ be wholly _ at you own disposal _ and this idea be sufficient to overturn you assertion of they happiness but we shall now mention a circumstance which in the present case will have more weight than all the argument which have hitherto be advance it be a opinion which the _ african _ universally entertain that as soon as death shall release they from the hand of they oppressor they shall immediately be waft back to they native plain there to exist again to enjoy the sight of they beloved countryman and to spend the whole of they new existence in scene of tranquillity and delight and so powerfully do this notion operate upon they as to drive they frequently to the horrid extremity of put a period to they life now if these suicide be frequent -lrb- which no person can deny -rrb- what be they but a proof that the situation of those who destroy themselves must have be insupportably wretched : and if the thought of return to they country after death _ when they have experience the colonial joy _ constitute they supreme felicity what be they but a proof that they think there be as much difference between the two situation as there be between misery and delight nor be the assertion of the _ receiver _ less liable to a refutation in the instance of those who terminate they own existence than of those whom nature release from they persecution they die with a smile upon they face and they funeral be attend by a vast concourse of they countryman with every possible demonstration of joy -lrb- 106 -rrb- but why this unusual mirth if they depart brother have leave a happy place or if he have be take from the care of a indulgent master who consult he pleasure and administer to he want but alas it arise from hence that _ he be go to he happy country _ : a circumstance sufficient of itself to silence a myriad of those specious argument which the imagination have be rack and will always be rack to produce in favor of a system of tyranny and oppression it remain only that we should now conclude the chapter with a fact which will shew that the account which we have give of the situation of slave be strictly true and will refute at the same time all the argument which have hitherto be and may yet be bring by the _ receiver _ to prove that they treatment be humane in one of the western colony of the european -lrb- 107 -rrb- six hundred and fifty thousand slave be import within a hundred year at the expiration of which time they whole posterity be find to amount to one hundred and forty thousand this fact will ascertain the treatment of itself for how shamefully must these unfortunate people have be oppress what a dreadful havock must famine fatigue and cruelty have make among they when we consider that the descendant of _ six hundred and fifty thousand _ people in the prime of life gradually import within a century be less numerous than those which only _ ten thousand _ -lrb- 108 -rrb- would have produce in the same period under common advantage and in a country congenial to they constitution but the _ receiver _ have probably great merit on the occasion let we therefore set it down to they humanity let we suppose for once that this incredible waste of the human species proceed from a benevolent design that sensible of the misery of a servile state they resolve to wear out as fast as they possibly can they unfortunate slave that they misery may the sooner end and that a wretched posterity may be prevent from share they parental condition now whether this be the plan of reasoning which the _ receiver _ adopt we can not take upon we to decide but true it be that the effect produce be exactly the same as if they have reason wholly on this _ benevolent _ principle \* \* \* \* \* footnote -lrb- footnote 097 : the article of war be frequently read at the head of

they master but such a holy-day that if they do not employ it in the cultivation of they little spot they must _ starve _ -rrb- -lrb- footnote 102 : these dance be usually in the middle of the night

favourable to they health as that of they own country the cause of the prodigious decrease in the one and increase in the other will be more conspicuous -rrb- \* \* \* \* \* chap x we have now take a survey of the treatment which the unfortunate _ african _ undergo when they be put into the hand of the _ receiver _ this treatment by the four first chapter of the present part of this essay appear to be wholly insupportable and to be such as no human being can apply to another without the imputation of such crime as should make he tremble but as many argument be usually advance by those who have any interest in the practice by which they would either exculpate the treatment or diminish its severity we allot the remain chapter for they discussion in these we consider the probability of such a treatment against the motive of interest the credit that be to be give to those disinterested writer on the subject who have record particular instance of barbarity the inferiority of the _ african _ to the human species the comparison that be generally make with respect to they situation the positive scene of felicity which they be say to enjoy and every other argument in short that we have find to have ever be advance in the defense of slavery these have be all consider and we may venture to pronounce that instead of answer the purpose for which they be intend they serve only to bring such circumstance to light as clearly shew that if ingenuity be rack to invent a situation that would be the most distressing and insupportable to the human race it could never invent one that would suit the description better than the -- _ colonial slavery _ if this then be the case and if slave notwithstanding all the argument to the contrary be exquisitely miserable we ask you _ receiver by what right _ you reduce they to so wretched a situation you reply that you _ buy they _ that you _ money _ constitute you _ right _ and that like all other thing which you purchase they be wholly at you own disposal upon this principle alone it be that we profess to view you treatment or examine you right when we say that the question -lrb- 109 -rrb- resolve itself into two separate part for discussion into the _ african _ commerce as explain in the history of slavery and the subsequent slavery in the colony _ as found on the equity of the commerce _ now since it appear that this commerce upon the fullest investigation be contrary to _ the principle -lrb- 110 -rrb- of law and government the dictate of reason the common maxim of equity the law of nature the admonition of conscience and in short the whole doctrine of natural religion _ it be evident that the _ right _ which be found upon it must be the same and that if those thing only be lawful in the sight of god which be either virtuous in themselves or proceed from virtuous principle you _ have no right over they at all _ you yourselve also confess this for when we ask you whether any human being have a right to sell you you immediately answer no as if nature revolt at the thought and as if it be so contradictory to you own feeling as not to require consideration but who be you that have this exclusive charter of trading in the liberty of mankind when do nature or rather the author of nature make so partial a distinction between you and they when do he say that you should have the privilege of sell other and that other should not have the privilege of sell you now since you confess that no person whatever have a right to dispose of you in this manner you must confess also that those thing be unlawful to be do to you which be usually do in consequence of the sale let we suppose then that in consequence of the _ commerce _ you be force into a ship that you be convey to another country that you be sell there that you be confine to incessant labor that you be pinch by continual hunger and thirst and subject to be whip cut and mangled at discretion and all this at the hand of those whom you have never offend would you not think that you have a right to resist they treatment would you not resist it with a safe conscience and would you not be surprize if you resistance should be term rebellion -- by the former premise you must answer yes -- such then be the case with the wretched _ african _ they have a right to resist you proceedings they can resist they and yet they can not justly be consider as rebellious for though we suppose they to have be guilty of crime to one another though we suppose they to have be the most abandon and execrable of man yet be they perfectly innocent with respect to you _ receiver _ you have no right to touch even the hair of they head without they own consent it be not you money that can invest you with a right human liberty can neither be buy nor sell every lash that you give they be unjust it be a lash against nature and religion and will surely stand record against you since they be all with respect to you _ impious _ self in a state of nature in a state of original dissociation perfectly free \* \* \* \* \* footnote -lrb- footnote 109 : see part ii chapter i second paragraph -rrb- -lrb- footnote 110 : see part ii chapter ix last paragraph -rrb- \* \* \* \* \* chap xi have now consider both the _ commerce _ and _ slavery _ it remain only to collect such argument as be scatter in different part of the work and to make such additional remark as present themselves on the subject and first let we ask you who have study the law of nature and you who be learn in the law of the land if all property must not be inferior in its nature to its possessor or in other word -lrb- for it be a case which every person must bring home to he own breast -rrb- if you suppose that any human being can have _ a property in yourselve _ let we ask you appraiser who scientifically know the value of thing if any human creature be equivalent only to any of the trinket that you wear or at most to any of the horse that you ride : or in other word if you have ever consider the most costly thing that you have value as _ equivalent to yourselve _ let we ask you rationalist if man as a reasonable being be not _ accountable _ for he action and let we put the same question to you who have study the divine writings let we ask you parent if ever you think that you possess a _ authority _ as such or if ever you expect a _ duty _ from you son and let we ask you son if ever you feel a impulse in you own breast to _ obey _ you parent now if you should all answer as we could wish if you should all answer consistently with reason nature and the reveal voice of god what a dreadful argument will present itself against the commerce and slavery of the human species when we reflect that no man whatever can be buy or reduce to the situation of a slave _ but he must instantly become a brute he must instantly be reduce to the value of those thing which be make for he own use and convenience he must instantly cease to be accountable for he action and he authority as a parent and he duty as a son must be instantly no more _ neither do it escape we notice when we be speak of the fatal wound which every social duty must receive how considerably christianity suffer by the conduct of you _ receiver _ for by prosecute this impious commerce you keep the _ african _ in a state of perpetual ferocity and barbarism and by prosecute it in such a manner as must represent you religion as a system of robbery and oppression you not only oppose the propagation of the gospel as far as you be able yourselve but throw the most certain impediment in the way of other who might attempt the glorious and important task such also be the effect which the subsequent slavery in the colony must produce for by you inhuman treatment of the unfortunate _ african _ there you create the same insuperable impediment to a conversion for how must they detest the very name of _ christian _ when you _ christian _ be deform by so many and dreadful vice how must they detest that system of religion which appear to resist the natural rights of man and to give a sanction to brutality and murder but as we be now mention christianity we must pause for a little time to make a few remark on the argument which be usually deduce from thence by the _ receiver _ in defense of they system of oppression for the reader may readily suppose that if they do not hesitate to bring the _ old _ testament in support of they barbarity they would hardly let the _ new _ escape they _ st paul _ have convert _ onesimus _ to the christian faith who be a fugitive slave of _ philemon _ send he back to he master this circumstance have furnish the _ receiver _ with a plea that christianity encourage slavery but they have not only strain the passage which they produce in support of they assertion but be ignorant of historical fact the benevolent apostle in the letter which he write to _ philemon _ the master of _ onesimus _ address he to the following effect : i send he back to you but not in he former capacity -lrb- 111 -rrb- _ not now as a servant but above a servant a brother beloved _ in this manner i beseech you to receive he for though i could _ enjoin _ you to do it yet i have rather it should be a matter of you _ own will _ than of _ necessity _ it appear that the same _ onesimus _ when he be send back be no longer _ a slave _ that he be a minister of the gospel that he be join with _ tychicus _ in a ecclesiastical commission to the church of the _ colossian _ and be afterwards bishop of _ ephesus _ if language therefore have any meaning and if history have record a fact which may be believe there be no case more opposite to the doctrine of the _ receiver _ than this which they produce in its support it be say again that christianity among the many important precept which it contain do not furnish we with one for the abolition of slavery but the reason be obvious slavery at the time of the introduction of the gospel be universally prevalent and if christianity have abruptly declare that the million of slave should have be make free who be then in the world it would have be universally reject as contain doctrine that be dangerous if not destructive to society in order therefore that it might be universally receive it never meddle by any positive precept with the civil institution of the time but though it do not expressly say that you shall neither buy nor sell nor possess a slave it be evident that in its general tenor it sufficiently militate against the custom the first doctrine which it inculcate be that of _ brotherly love _ it command good will towards man it enjoin we to love we neighbor as ourselves and to do unto all man as we would that they should do unto we and how can any man fulfil this scheme of universal benevolence who reduce a unfortunate person _ against he will _ to the _ most insupportable _ of all human condition who consider he as he _ private property _ and treat he not as a brother nor as one of the same parentage with himself but as a _ animal of the brute creation _ but the most important doctrine be that by which we be assure that mankind be to exist in a future state and to give a account of those action which they have severally do in the flesh this strike at the very root of slavery for how can any man be justly call to a account for he action whose action be not _ at he own disposal _ this be the case with the _ proper _ -lrb- 112 -rrb- slave he liberty be absolutely buy and _ appropriate _ and if the purchase be _ just and equitable _ he be _ under the necessity _ of perpetrate any crime which the purchaser may order he to commit or in other word of cease to be _ accountable for he action _ these doctrine therefore be sufficient to shew that slavery be incompatible with the christian system the _ european _ consider they as such when at the close of the twelfth century they resist they hereditary prejudice and occasion its abolition hence one among many other proof that christianity be the production of infinite wisdom that though it do not take such express cognizance of the wicked national institution of the time as should hinder its reception it should yet contain such doctrine as when it should be fully establish would be sufficient for the abolition of they all thus then be the argument of you _ receiver _ ineffectual and you conduct impious for by the prosecution of this wicked slavery and commerce you not only oppose the propagation of that gospel which be order to be preach unto every creature and bring it into contempt but you oppose its tenet also : first because you violate that law of _ universal benevolence _ which be to take away those hateful distinction of _ jew _ and _ gentile _ _ greek _ and _ barbarian bond _ and _ free _ which prevail when the gospel be introduce and secondly because as every man be to give a account of he action hereafter it be necessary that he should be _ free _ another argument yet remain which though nature will absolutely turn pale at the recital can not possibly be omit in those war which be make for the sake of procure slave it be evident that the contest must be generally obstinate and that great number must be slay on both side before the event can be determine this we may reasonably apprehend to be the case : and we have shewn -lrb- 113 -rrb- that there have not be want instance where the conqueror have be so incensed at the resistance they have find that they spirit of vengeance have entirely get the better of they avarice and they have murder in cool blood every individual without discrimination either of age or sex from these and other circumstance we think we have sufficient reason to conclude that where _ ten _ be suppose to be take a _ hundred _ include the victor and vanquish might be suppose to perish now as the annual exportation from _ africa _ consist of a hundred thousand man and as the two order of those who be privately kidnap by individual and of those who be publickly seize by virtue of the authority of they prince compose together at least nine-tenth of the _ african _ slave it follow that about ten thousand consist of convict and prisoner of war the last order be the most numerous let we suppose then that only six thousand of this order be annually send into servitude and it will immediately appear that no less than _ sixty-thousand _ people annually perish in those war which be make only for the purpose of procure slave but that this number which we believe to be by no means exaggerate may be free from all objection we will include those in the estimate who die as they be travel to the ship many of these unfortunate people have a journey of one thousand mile to perform on foot and be drive like sheep through inhospitable wood and desert where they frequently die in great number from fatigue and want now if to those who thus perish on the _ african _ continent by war and travel we subjoin those -lrb- 114 -rrb- who afterwards perish on the voyage and in the seasoning together it will appear that in every yearly attempt to supply the colony a _ hundred thousand _ must perish even before _ one _ useful individual can be obtain gracious god how wicked how beyond all example impious must be that servitude which can not be carry on without the continual murder of so many and innocent person what punishment be not to be expect for such monstrous and unparalleled barbarity for if the blood of one man unjustly shed cry with so loud a voice for the divine vengeance how shall the cry and groan of a _ hundred thousand _ man _ annually murder _ ascend the celestial mansion and bring down that punishment which such enormity deserve but do we mention punishment do we allude to that punishment which shall be inflict on man as individual in a future life do we allude to that awful day which shall surely come when the master shall behold he murder negroe face to face when a train of mutilate slave shall be bring against he when he shall stand confound and abashed or do we allude to that punishment which may be inflict on they here as member of a wicked community for as a body politick if its member be ever so numerous may be consider as a whole acting of itself and by itself in all affair in which it be concern so it be accountable as such for its conduct and as these kind of polity have only they existence here so it be only in this world that as such they can be punish now whether we consider the crime with respect to the individual immediately concern in this most barbarous and cruel traffick or whether we consider it as patronize -lrb- 115 -rrb- and encourage by the law of the land it present to we view a equal degree of enormity a crime found on a dreadful pre-eminence in wickedness -- a crime which be both of individual and the nation must sometime draw down upon we the heaviest judgment of almighty god who make of one blood all the son of man and who give to all equally a natural right to liberty and who rule all the kingdom of the earth with equal providential justice can not suffer such deliberate such monstrous iniquity to pass long unpunished -lrb- 116 -rrb- but alas he seem already to have interfere on the occasion the violent -lrb- 117 -rrb- and supernatural agitation of all the element which for a series of year have prevail in those european settlement where the unfortunate _ african _ be retain in a state of slavery and which have bring unspeakable calamity on the inhabitant and publick loss on the state to which they severally belong be so many awful visitation of god for this inhuman violation of he law and it be not perhaps unworthy of remark that as the subject of great-britain have two third of this impious commerce in they own hand so they have suffer -lrb- 118 -rrb- in the same proportion or more severely than the rest how far these misfortune may appear to be act of providence and to create a alarm to those who have be accustom to refer every effect to its apparent cause who have be habituate to stop there and to overlook the finger of god because it be slightly cover under the veil of secondary law we will not pretend to determine but this we will assert with confidence that the _ european _ have richly deserve they all that the fear of sympathy which can hardly be restrain on other melancholy occasion seem to forget to flow at the relation of these and that we can never with any shadow of justice with prosperity to the undertaker of those whose success must be at the expence of the happiness of million of they fellow-creature but this be sufficient for if liberty be only a adventitious right if man be by no means superior to brute if every social duty be a curse if cruelty be highly to be esteem if murder be strictly honorable and christianity be a lye then it be evident that the _ african _ slavery may be pursue without either the remorse of conscience or the imputation of a crime but if the contrary of this be true which reason must immediately evince it be evident that no custom establish among man be ever more impious since it be contrary to _ reason justice nature the principle of law and government the whole doctrine in short of natural religion and the reveal voice of god _ \* \* \* \* \* footnote -lrb- footnote 111 : epist to philemon -rrb- -lrb- footnote 112 : the _
