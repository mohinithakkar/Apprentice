case i : secret worship case ii : the camp of the dog case iii : a victim of higher space case i : secret worship harri the silk merchant be in south germany on he way home from a business trip when the idea come to he suddenly that he would take the mountain railway from strassbourg and run down to revisit he old school after a interval of something more than thirty year and it be to this chance impulse of the junior partner in harri brother of st paul 's churchyard that john silence owe one of the most curious case of he whole experience for at that very moment he happen to be tramp these same mountain with a holiday knapsack and from different point of the compass the two man be actually converge towards the same inn now deep down in the heart that for thirty year have be concern chiefly with the profitable buying and selling of silk this school have leave the imprint of its peculiar influence and though perhaps unknown to harri have strongly color the whole of he subsequent existence it belong to the deeply religious life of a small protestant community -lrb- which it be unnecessary to specify -rrb- and he father have send he there at the age of fifteen partly because he would learn the german requisite for the conduct of the silk business and partly because the discipline be strict and discipline be what he soul and body need just then more than anything else the life indeed have prove exceedingly severe and young harri benefit accordingly for though corporal punishment be unknown there be a system of mental and spiritual correction which somehow make the soul stand proudly erect to receive it while it strike at the very root of the fault and teach the boy that he character be be clean and strengthen and that he be not merely be tortured in a kind of personal revenge that be over thirty year ago when he be a dreamy and impressionable youth of fifteen and now as the train climb slowly up the wind mountain gorge he mind travel back somewhat lovingly over the intervene period and forget detail rise vividly again before he out of the shadow the life there have be very wonderful it seem to he in that remote mountain village protect from the tumult of the world by the love and worship of the devout brotherhood that minister to the need of some hundred boy from every country in europe sharply the scene come back to he he smell again the long stone corridor the hot pinewood room where the sultry hour of summer study be pass with bee drone through open window in the sunshine and german character struggle in the mind with dream of english lawn -- and then the sudden awful cry of the master in german -- harri stand up you sleep and he recall the dreadful standing motionless for a hour book in hand while the knee feel like wax and the head grow heavier than a cannon-ball the very smell of the cooking come back to he -- the daily _ sauerkraut _ the watery chocolate on sunday the flavor of the stringy meat serve twice a week at _ mittagessen _ and he smile to think again of the half-ration that be the punishment for speak english the very odour of the milk-bowl -- the hot sweet aroma that rise from the soak peasant-bread at the six-o'clock breakfast -- come back to he pungently and he see the huge _ speisesaal _ with the hundred boy in they school uniform all eat sleepily in silence gulp down the coarse bread and scalding milk in terror of the bell that would presently cut they short -- and at the far end where the master sit he see the narrow slit window with the vista of entice field and forest beyond and this in turn make he think of the great barnlike room on the top floor where all sleep together in wooden cot and he hear in memory the clamor of the cruel bell that wake they on winter morning at five o'clock and summon they to the stone-flagged _ waschkammer _ where boy and master alike after scanty and icy wash dress in complete silence from this he mind pass swiftly with vivid picture-thought to other thing and with a pass shiver he remember how the loneliness of never be alone have eat into he and how everything -- work meal sleep walk leisure -- be do with he division of twenty other boy and under the eye of at least two master the only solitude possible be by ask for half a hour 's practice in the cell-like music room and harri smile to himself as he recall the zeal of he violin study then as the train puff laboriously through the great pine forest that cover these mountain with a giant carpet of velvet he find the pleasanter layer of memory give up they dead and he recall with admiration the kindness of the master whom all address as brother and marvel afresh at they devotion in bury themselves for year in such a place only to leave it in most case for the still rougher life of missionary in the wild place of the world he think once more of the still religious atmosphere that hang over the little forest community like a veil bar the distressful world of the picturesque ceremony at easter christmas and new year of the numerous feast-day and charming little festival the _ beschehr-fest _ in particular come back to he -- the feast of gift at christmas -- when the entire community pair off and give present many of which have take week to make or the savings of many day to purchase and then he see the midnight ceremony in the church at new year with the shine face of the _ prediger _ in the pulpit -- the village preacher who on the last night of the old year see in the empty gallery beyond the organ loft the face of all who be to die in the ensue twelve month and who at last recognize himself among they and in the very middle of he sermon pass into a state of rapt ecstasy and burst into a torrent of praise thickly the memory crowd upon he the picture of the small village dream its unselfish life on the mountain-top clean wholesome simple search vigorously for its god and training hundred of boy in the grand way rise up in he mind with all the power of a obsession he feel once more the old mystical enthusiasm deeper than the sea and more wonderful than the star he hear again the wind sigh from league of forest over the red roof in the moonlight he hear the brother ' voice talk of the thing beyond this life as though they have actually experience they in the body and as he sit in the jolting train a spirit of unutterable longing pass over he seared and tired soul stir in the depths of he a sea of emotion that he think have long since freeze into immobility and the contrast pained he -- the idealistic dreamer then the man of business now -- so that a spirit of unworldly peace and beauty know only to the soul in meditation lay its feathered finger upon he heart move strangely the surface of the water harri shiver a little and look out of the window of he empty carriage the train have long pass hornberg and far below the stream tumble in white foam down the limestone rock in front of he dome upon dome of wooded mountain stand against the sky it be October and the air be cool and sharp woodsmoke and damp moss exquisitely mingled in it with the subtle odour of the pine overhead between the tip of the highest fir he see the first star peep and the sky be a clean pale amethyst that seem exactly the color all these memory clothe themselves with in he mind he lean back in he corner and sigh he be a heavy man and he have not know sentiment for year he be a big man and it take much to move he literally and figuratively he be a man in whom the dream of god that haunt the soul in youth though overlay by the scum that gather in the fight for money have not as with the majority utterly die the death he come back into this little neglect pocket of the year where so much fine gold have collect and lie undisturbed with all he semispiritual emotion aquiver and as he watch the mountain-top come nearer and smell the forget odour of he boyhood something melt on the surface of he soul and leave he sensitive to a degree he have not know since thirty year before he have live here with he dream he conflict and he youthful suffer a thrill run through he as the train stop with a jolt at a tiny station and he see the name in large black lettering on the gray stone building and below it the number of metre it stand above the level of the sea the highest point on the line he exclaim how well i remember it -- sommerau -- summer meadow the very next station be mine and as the train run downhill with brake on and steam shut off he put he head out of the window and one by one see the old familiar landmark in the dusk they stare at he like dead face in a dream queer sharp feeling half poignant half sweet stir in he heart there be the hot white road we walk along so often with the two brüder always at we heel he think and there by jove be the turn through the forest to ' _ die galgen _ ' the stone gallows where they hang the witch in olden day he smile a little as the train slide past and there be the copse where the lily of the valley powdered the ground in spring and i swear -- he put he head out with a sudden impulse -- if that be not the very clear where calame the french boy chase the swallow-tail with I and bruder pagel give we half-ration for leave the road without permission and for shout in we mother tongue and he laugh again as the memory come back with a rush flood he mind with vivid detail the train stop and he stand on the gray gravel platform like a man in a dream it seem half a century since he last wait there with cord wooden box and get into the train for strassbourg and home after the two year ' exile time drop from he like a old garment and he feel a boy again only thing look so much smaller than he memory of they shrink and dwindle they look and the distance seem on a curiously smaller scale he make he way across the road to the little gasthaus and as he go face and figure of former schoolfellow -- german swiss italian french russian -- slip out of the shadowy wood and silently accompany he they flit by he side raise they eye questioningly sadly to he but they name he have forget some of the brother too come with they and most of these he remember by name -- bruder röst bruder pagel bruder schliemann and the bearded face of the old preacher who have see himself in the haunt gallery of those about to die -- bruder gysin the dark forest lay all about he like a sea that any moment might rush with velvet wave upon the scene and sweep all the face away the air be cool and wonderfully fragrant but with every perfumed breath come also a pallid memory yet in spite of the underlie sadness inseparable from such a experience it be all very interesting and hold a pleasure peculiarly its own so that harri engage he room and order supper feeling well pleased with himself and intend to walk up to the old school that very evening it stand in the center of the community 's village some four mile distant through the forest and he now recollect for the first time that this little protestant settlement dwelt isolate in a section of the country that be otherwise catholic crucifix and shrine surround the clearing like the sentry of a beleaguer army once beyond the square of the village with its few acre of field and orchard the forest crowd up in solid phalanx and beyond the rim of tree begin the country that be rule by the priest of another faith he vaguely remember too that the catholic have show sometimes a certain hostility towards the little protestant oasis that flourish so quietly and benignly in they midst he have quite forget this how trumpery it all seem now with he wide experience of life and he knowledge of other country and the great outside world it be like step back not thirty year but three hundred there be only two other besides himself at supper one of they a bearded middle-aged man in tweeds sit by himself at the far end and harri keep out of he way because he be english he fear he might be in business possibly even in the silk business and that he would perhaps talk on the subject the other traveller however be a catholic priest he be a little man who eat he salad with a knife yet so gently that it be almost inoffensive and it be the sight of the cloth that recall he memory of the old antagonism harri mention by way of conversation the object of he sentimental journey and the priest look up sharply at he with raise eyebrow and a expression of surprise and suspicion that somehow pique he he ascribe it to he difference of belief yes go on the silk merchant pleased to talk of what he mind be so full and it be a curious experience for a english boy to be drop down into a school of a hundred foreigner i well remember the loneliness and intolerable heimweh of it at first he german be very fluent the priest opposite look up from he cold veal and potato salad and smile it be a nice face he explain quietly that he do not belong here but be make a tour of the parish of wurttemberg and baden it be a strict life add harri we english i remember use to call it _ gefängnisleben _ -- prison life the face of the other for some unaccountable reason darken after a slight pause and more by way of politeness than because he wish to continue the subject he say quietly -- it be a flourishing school in those day of course afterwards i have hear -- he shrug he shoulder slightly and the odd look -- it almost seem a look of alarm -- come back into he eye the sentence remain unfinished something in the tone of the man seem to he listener uncalled for -- in a sense reproachful singular harri bridle in spite of himself it have change he ask i can hardly believe -- you have not hear then observe the priest gently make a gesture as though to cross himself yet not actually complete it you have not hear what happen there before it be abandon -- it be very childish of course and perhaps he be overtire and overwrought in some way but the word and manner of the little priest seem to he so offensive -- so disproportionately offensive -- that he hardly notice the conclude sentence he recall the old bitterness and the old antagonism and for a moment he almost lose he temper nonsense he interrupt with a forced laugh _ unsinn _ you must forgive I sir for contradict you but i be a pupil there myself i be at school there there be no place like it i can not believe that anything serious could have happen to -- to take away its character the devotion of the brother would be difficult to equal anywhere -- he break off suddenly realize that he voice have be raise unduly and that the man at the far end of the table might understand german and at the same moment he look up and see that this individual 's eye be fix upon he face intently they be peculiarly bright also they be rather wonderful eye and the way they meet he own serve in some way he could not understand to convey both a reproach and a warn the whole face of the stranger indeed make a vivid impression upon he for it be a face he now notice for the first time in whose presence one would not willingly have say or do anything unworthy harri could not explain to himself how it be he have not become conscious sooner of its presence but he could have bite off he tongue for have so far forget himself the little priest lapse into silence only once he say look up and speak in a low voice that be not intend to be overhear but that evidently _ be _ overheard you will find it different presently he rise and leave the table with a polite bow that include both the other and after he from the far end rise also the figure in the tweed suit leave harri by himself he sit on for a bit in the darkening room sip he coffee and smoking he fifteen-pfennig cigar till the girl come in to light the oil lamp he feel vex with himself for he lapse from good manners yet hardly able to account for it most likely he reflect he have be annoyed because the priest have unintentionally change the pleasant character of he dream by introduce a jarring note later he must seek a opportunity to make amends at present however he be too impatient for he walk to the school and he take he stick and hat and pass out into the open air and as he cross before the gasthaus he notice that the priest and the man in the tweed suit be engage already in such deep conversation that they hardly notice he as he pass and raise he hat he start off briskly well remember the way and hope to reach the village in time to have a word with one of the brüder they might even ask he in for a cup of coffee he feel sure of he welcome and the old memory be in full possession once more the hour of return be a matter of no consequence whatever it be then just after seven o'clock and the October evening be draw in with chill air from the recess of the forest the road plunge straight from the railway clearing into its depths and in a very few minute the tree engulf he and the clack of he boot fall dead and echoless against the serried stem of a million fir it be very black one trunk be hardly distinguishable from another he walk smartly swing he holly stick once or twice he pass a peasant on he way to bed and the guttural gruss get unheard for so long emphasise the passage of time while yet make it seem as nothing a fresh group of picture crowd he mind again the figure of former schoolfellow flit out of the forest and keep pace by he side whispering of the doings of long ago one reverie step hard upon the heel of another every turn in the road every clearing of the forest he know and each in turn bring forget association to life he enjoy himself thoroughly he march on and on there be powdered gold in the sky till the moon rise and then a wind of faint silver spread silently between the earth and star he see the tip of the fir tree shimmer and hear they whisper as the breeze turn they needle towards the light the mountain air be indescribably sweet the road shine like the foam of a river through the gloom white moth flit here and there like silent thought across he path and a hundred smell greet he from the forest cavern across the year then when he least expect it the tree fall away abruptly on both side and he stand on the edge of the village clearing he walk faster there lay the familiar outline of the house sheet with silver there stand the tree in the little central square with the fountain and small green lawn there loom the shape of the church next to the gasthof der brüdergemeinde and just beyond dimly rise into the sky he see with a sudden thrill the mass of the huge school building block castlelike with deep shadow in the moonlight standing square and formidable to face he after the silence of more than a quarter of a century he pass quickly down the desert village street and stop close beneath its shadow stare up at the wall that have once hold he prisoner for two year -- two unbroken year of discipline and homesickness memory and emotion surge through he mind for the most vivid sensation of he youth have focus about this spot and it be here he have first begin to live and learn value not a single footstep break the silence though light glimmer here and there through cottage window but when he look up at the high wall of the school drape now in shadow he easily imagine that well-known face crowd to the window to greet he -- close window that really reflect only moonlight and the gleam of star this then be the old school building standing foursquare to the world with its shutter window its lofty tiled roof and the spike lightning-conductor point like black and taloned finger from the corner for a long time he stand and stare then presently he come to himself again and realize to he joy that a light still shine in the window of the bruderstube he turn from the road and pass through the iron railing then climb the twelve stone step and stand face the black wooden door with the heavy bar of iron a door he have once loathe and dread with the hatred and passion of a imprison soul but now look upon tenderly with a sort of boyish delight almost timorously he pull the rope and listen with a tremor of excitement to the clanging of the bell deep within the building and the long-forgotten sound bring the past before he with such a vivid sense of reality that he positively shiver it be like the magic bell in the fairy-tale that roll back the curtain of time and summons the figure from the shadow of the dead he have never feel so sentimental in he life it be like be young again and at the same time he begin to bulk rather large in he own eye with a certain spurious importance he be a big man from the world of strife and action in this little place of peaceful dream would he perhaps not cut something of a figure i 'll try once more he think after a long pause seize the iron bell-rope and be just about to pull it when a step sound on the stone passage within and the huge door slowly swing open a tall man with a rather severe cast of countenance stand face he in silence i must apologise -- it be somewhat late he begin a trifle pompously but the fact be i be a old pupil i have only just arrive and really could not restrain myself he german seem not quite so fluent as usual my interest be so great i be here in '70 the other open the door wider and at once bow he in with a smile of genuine welcome i be bruder kalkmann he say quietly in a deep voice i myself be a master here about that time it be a great pleasure always to welcome a former pupil he look at he very keenly for a few seconds and then add i think too it be splendid of you to come -- very splendid it be a very great pleasure harri reply delighted with he reception the dimly light corridor with its flooring of gray stone and the familiar sound of a german voice echo through it -- with the peculiar intonation the brother always use in speaking -- all combine to lift he bodily as it be into the dream-atmosphere of long-forgotten day he step gladly into the building and the door shut with the familiar thunder that complete the reconstruction of the past he almost feel the old sense of imprisonment of ache nostalgia of have lose he liberty harri sigh involuntarily and turn towards he host who return he smile faintly and then lead the way down the corridor the boy have retire he explain and as you remember we keep early hour here but at least you will join we for a little while in the _ bruderstube _ and enjoy a cup of coffee this be precisely what the silk merchant have hope and he accept with a alacrity that he intend to be temper by graciousness and to-morrow continue the bruder you must come and spend a whole day with we you may even find acquaintance for several pupil of you day have come back here as master for one brief second there pass into the man 's eye a look that make the visitor start but it vanish as quickly as it come it be impossible to define harri convinced himself it be the effect of a shadow cast by the lamp they have just pass on the wall he dismiss it from he mind you be very kind i be sure he say politely it be perhaps a greater pleasure to I than you can imagine to see the place again ah -- he stop short opposite a door with the upper half of glass and peer in -- surely there be one of the music room where i use to practice the violin how it come back to I after all these year bruder kalkmann stop indulgently smile to allow he guest a moment 's inspection you still have the boy ' orchestra i remember i use to play ` zweite geige ' in it bruder schliemann conduct at the piano dear I i can see he now with he long black hair and -- and -- he stop abruptly again the odd dark look pass over the stern face of he companion for a instant it seem curiously familiar we still keep up the pupil ' orchestra he say but bruder schliemann i be sorry to say -- he hesitate a instant and then add bruder schliemann be dead indeed indeed say harri quickly i be sorry to hear it he be conscious of a faint feeling of distress but whether it arise from the news of he old music teacher 's death or -- from something else -- he could not quite determine he gaze down the corridor that lose itself among shadow in the street and village everything have seem so much smaller than he remember but here inside the school building everything seem so much bigger the corridor be loftier and longer more spacious and vast than the mental picture he have preserve he thought wander dreamily for a instant he glance up and see the face of the bruder watch he with a smile of patient indulgence you memory possess you he observe gently and the stern look pass into something almost pity you be right return the man of silk they do this be the most wonderful period of my whole life in a sense at the time i hate it -- he hesitate not wish to hurt the brother 's feeling accord to english idea it seem strict of course the other say persuasively so that he go on -- yes partly that and partly the ceaseless nostalgia and the solitude which come from never be really alone in english school the boy enjoy peculiar freedom you know bruder kalkmann he see be listen intently but it produce one result that i have never wholly lose he continue self-consciously and be grateful for _ ach wie so denn _ the constant inner pain throw I headlong into you religious life so that the whole force of my be seem to project itself towards the search for a deeper satisfaction -- a real resting-place for the soul during my two year here i yearn for god in my boyish way as perhaps i have never yearn for anything since moreover i have never quite lose that sense of peace and inward joy which accompany the search i can never quite forget this school and the deep thing it teach I he pause at the end of he long speech and a brief silence fall between they he fear he have say too much or express himself clumsily in the foreign language and when bruder kalkmann lay a hand upon he shoulder he give a little involuntary start so that my memory perhaps do possess I rather strongly he add apologetically and this long corridor these room that bar and gloomy front door all touch chord that -- that -- he german fail he and he glance at he companion with a explanatory smile and gesture but the brother have remove the hand from he shoulder and be stand with he back to he look down the passage naturally naturally so he say hastily without turn round _ e ist doch selbstverständlich _ we shall all understand then he turn suddenly and harri see that he face have turn most oddly and disagreeably sinister it may only have be the shadow again play they trick with the wretched oil lamp on the wall for the dark expression pass instantly as they retrace they step down the corridor but the englishman somehow get the impression that he have say something to give offence something that be not quite to the other 's taste opposite the door of the _ bruderstube _ they stop harri realize that it be late and he have possibly stay talk too long he make a tentative effort to leave but he companion would not hear of it you must have a cup of coffee with we he say firmly as though he mean it and my colleague will be delighted to see you some of they will remember you perhaps the sound of voice come pleasantly through the door man 's voice talk together bruder kalkmann turn the handle and they enter a room ablaze with light and full of people ah -- but you name he whisper bend down to catch the reply you have not tell I you name yet harri say the englishman quickly as they go in he feel nervous as he cross the threshold but ascribe the momentary trepidation to the fact that he be break the strictest rule of the whole establishment which forbid a boy under severest penalty to come near this holy of holy where the master take they brief leisure ah yes of course -- harri repeat the other as though he remember it come in herr harri come in please you visit will be immensely appreciate it be really very fine very wonderful of you to have come in this way the door close behind they and in the sudden light which make he sight swim for a moment the exaggeration of the language escape he attention he hear the voice of bruder kalkmann introduce he he speak very loud indeed unnecessarily -- absurdly loud harri think brother he announce it be my pleasure and privilege to introduce to you herr harri from england he have just arrive to make we a little visit and i have already express to he on behalf of we all the satisfaction we feel that he be here he be as you remember a pupil in the year '70 it be a very formal a very german introduction but harri rather like it it make he feel important and he appreciate the tact that make it almost seem as though he have be expect the black form rise and bow harri bow kalkmann bow every one be very polite and very courtly the room swam with move figure the light dazzled he after the gloom of the corridor there be thick cigar smoke in the atmosphere he take the chair that be offer to he between two of the brother and sit down feeling vaguely that he perception be not quite as keen and accurate as usual he feel a trifle dazed perhaps and the spell of the past come strongly over he confuse the immediate present and make everything dwindle oddly to the dimension of long ago he seem to pass under the mastery of a great mood that be a composite reproduction of all the mood of he forget boyhood then he pull himself together with a sharp effort and enter into the conversation that have begin again to buzz round he moreover he enter into it with keen pleasure for the brother -- there be perhaps a dozen of they in the little room -- treated he with a charm of manner that speedily make he feel one of themselves this again be a very subtle delight to he he feel that he have step out of the greedy vulgar self-seeking world the world of silk and market and profit-making -- step into the cleaner atmosphere where spiritual ideal be paramount and life be simple and devoted it all charm he inexpressibly so that he realize -- yes in a sense -- the degradation of he twenty year ' absorption in business this keen atmosphere under the star where man think only of they soul and of the soul of other be too rarefy for the world he be now associate with he find himself make comparison to he own disadvantage -- comparison with the mystical little dreamer that have step thirty year before from the stern peace of this devout community and the man of the world that he have since become -- and the contrast make he shiver with a keen regret and something like self-contempt he glance round at the other face float towards he through tobacco smoke -- this acrid cigar smoke he remember so well : how keen they be how strong placid touch with the nobility of great aim and unselfish purpose at one or two he look particularly he hardly know why they rather fascinate he there be something so very stern and uncompromising about they and something too oddly subtly familiar that yet just elude he but whenever they eye meet he own they hold undeniable welcome in they and some hold more -- a kind of perplexed admiration he think something that be between esteem and deference this note of respect in all the face be very flattering to he vanity coffee be serve presently make by a black-haired brother who sit in the corner by the piano and bear a marked resemblance to bruder schliemann the musical director of thirty year ago harri exchange bow with he when he take the cup from he white hand which he notice be like the hand of a woman he light a cigar offer to he by he neighbor with whom he be chat delightfully and who in the glare of the light match remind he sharply for a moment of bruder pagel he former room-master _ e ist wirklich merkwürdig _ he say how many resemblance i see or imagine it be really _ very _ curious yes reply the other peer at he over he coffee cup the spell of the place be wonderfully strong i can well understand that the old face rise before you mind 's eye -- almost to the exclusion of ourselves perhaps they both laugh presently it be soothing to find he mood understand and appreciate and they pass on to talk of the mountain village its isolation its remoteness from worldly life its peculiar fitness for meditation and worship and for spiritual development -- of a certain kind and you come back in this way herr harri have please we all so much join in the bruder on he left we esteem you for it most highly we honor you for it harri make a deprecate gesture i fear for my part it be only a very selfish pleasure he say a trifle unctuously not all would have have the courage add the one who resemble bruder pagel you mean say harri a little puzzle the disturbing memory -- bruder pagel look at he steadily with unmistakable admiration and respect i mean that most man hold so strongly to life and can give up so little for they belief he say gravely the englishman feel slightly uncomfortable these worthy man really make too much of he sentimental journey besides the talk be get a little out of he depth he hardly follow it the worldly life still have _ some _ charm for I he reply smilingly as though to indicate that sainthood be not yet quite within he grasp all the more then must we honor you for so freely come say the brother on he leave so unconditionally a pause follow and the silk merchant feel relieved when the conversation take a more general turn although he note that it never travel very far from the subject of he visit and the wonderful situation of the lonely village for man who wish to develop they spiritual power and practice the rite of a high worship other join in compliment he on he knowledge of the language make he feel utterly at he ease yet at the same time a little uncomfortable by the excess of they admiration after all it be such a very small thing to do this sentimental journey the time pass along quickly the coffee be excellent the cigar soft and of the nutty flavor he love at length fear to outstay he welcome he rise reluctantly to take he leave but the other would not hear of it it be not often a former pupil return to visit they in this simple unaffected way the night be young if necessary they could even find he a corner in the great _ schlafzimmer _ upstairs he be easily persuade to stay a little longer somehow he have become the center of the little party he feel pleased flattered honor and perhaps bruder schliemann will play something for we -- now it be kalkmann speaking and harri start visibly as he hear the name and see the black-haired man by the piano turn with a smile for schliemann be the name of he old music director who be dead could this be he son they be so exactly alike if bruder meyer have not put he amatus to bed i will accompany he say the musician suggestively look across at a man whom harri have not yet notice and who he now see be the very image of a former master of that name meyer rise and excuse himself with a little bow and the englishman quickly observe that he have a peculiar gesture as though he neck have a false join on to the body just below the collar and fear it might break meyer of old have this trick of movement he remember how the boy use to copy it he glance sharply from face to face feeling as though some silent unseen process be change everything about he all the face seem oddly familiar pagel the brother he have be talk with be of course the image of pagel he former room-master and kalkmann he now realize for the first time be the very twin of another master whose name he have quite forget but whom he use to dislike intensely in the old day and through the smoke peer at he from the corner of the room he see that all the brother about he have the face he have know and live with long ago -- röst fluheim meinert rigel gysin he stare hard suddenly grow more alert and everywhere see or fancy he see strange likeness ghostly resemblance -- more the identical face of year ago there be something queer about it all something not quite right something that make he feel uneasy he shake himself mentally and actually blow the smoke from before he eye with a long breath and as he do so he notice to he dismay that every one be fixedly stare they be watch he this bring he to he sens as a englishman and a foreigner he do not wish to be rude or to do anything to make himself foolishly conspicuous and spoil the harmony of the evening he be a guest and a privileged guest at that besides the music have already begin bruder schliemann 's long white finger be caress the key to some purpose he subside into he chair and smoke with half-closed eye that yet see everything but the shudder have establish itself in he be and whether he would or not it keep repeat itself as a town far up some inland river feel the pressure of the distant sea so he become aware that mighty force from somewhere beyond he ken be urge themselves up against he soul in this smoky little room he begin to feel exceedingly ill at ease and as the music fill the air he mind begin to clear like a lift veil there rise up something that have hitherto obscure he vision the word of the priest at the railway inn flash across he brain unbidden : you will find it different and also though why he could not tell he see mentally the strong rather wonderful eye of that other guest at the supper-table the man who have overhear he conversation and have later get into earnest talk with the priest he take out he watch and steal a glance at it two hour have slip by it be already eleven o'clock schliemann meanwhile utterly absorb in he music be play a solemn measure the piano sing marvellously the power of a great conviction the simplicity of great art the vital spiritual message of a soul that have find itself -- all this and more be in the chord and yet somehow the music be what can only be describe as impure -- atrociously and diabolically impure and the piece itself although harri do not recognize it as anything familiar be surely the music of a mass -- huge majestic sombre it stalk through the smoky room with slow power like the passage of something that be mighty yet profoundly intimate and as it go there stir into each and every face about he the signature of the enormous force of which it be the audible symbol the countenance round he turn sinister but not idly negatively sinister : they grow dark with purpose he suddenly recall the face of bruder kalkmann in the corridor earlier in the evening the motive of they secret soul rise to the eye and mouth and forehead and hang there for all to see like the black banner of a assembly of ill-starred and fall creature demon -- be the horrible word that flash through he brain like a sheet of fire when this sudden discovery leap out upon he for a moment he lose he self-control without wait to think and weigh he extraordinary impression he do a very foolish but a very natural thing feel himself irresistibly drive by the sudden stress to some kind of action he spring to he foot -- and scream to he own utter amazement he stand up and shriek aloud but no one stir no one apparently take the slightest notice of he absurdly wild behavior it be almost as if no one but himself have hear the scream at all -- as though the music have drown it and swallow it up -- as though after all perhaps he have not really scream as loudly as he imagine or have not scream at all then as he glance at the motionless dark face before he something of utter cold pass into he be touch he very soul all emotion cool suddenly leave he like a recede tide he sit down again ashamed mortified angry with himself for behave like a fool and a boy and the music meanwhile continue to issue from the white and snakelike finger of bruder schliemann as poison wine might issue from the weirdly fashion neck of antique phial and with the rest of they harri drink it in force himself to believe that he have be the victim of some kind of illusory perception he vigorously restrain he feeling then the music presently cease and every one applaud and begin to talk at once laugh change seat compliment the player and behave naturally and easily as though nothing out of the way have happen the face appear normal once more the brother crowd round they visitor and he join in they talk and even hear himself thank the gifted musician but at the same time he find himself edge towards the door nearer and nearer change he chair when possible and join the group that stand closest to the way of escape i must thank you all _ tausendmal _ for my little reception and the great pleasure -- the very great honor you have do I he begin in decide tone at length but i fear i have trespass far too long already on you hospitality moreover i have some distance to walk to my inn a chorus of voice greet he word they would not hear of he go -- at least not without first partaking of refreshment they produce pumpernickel from one cupboard and rye-bread and sausage from another and all begin to talk again and eat more coffee be make fresh cigar light and bruder meyer take out he violin and begin to tune it softly there be always a bed upstairs if herr harri will accept it say one and it be difficult to find the way out now for all the door be lock laugh another loudly let we take we simple pleasure as they come cry a third bruder harri will understand how we appreciate the honor of this last visit of he they make a dozen excuse they all laugh as though the politeness of they word be but formal and veil thinly -- more and more thinly -- a very different meaning and the hour of midnight draw near add bruder kalkmann with a charming smile but in a voice that sound to the englishman like the grate of iron hinge they german seem to he more and more difficult to understand he note that they call he bruder too class he as one of themselves and then suddenly he have a flash of keener perception and realize with a creep of he flesh that he have all along misinterpret -- grossly misinterpret all they have be say they have talk about the beauty of the place its isolation and remoteness from the world its peculiar fitness for certain kind of spiritual development and worship -- yet hardly he now grasp in the sense in which he have take the word they have mean something different they spiritual power they desire for loneliness they passion for worship be not the power the solitude or the worship that _ he _ mean and understand he be play a part in some horrible masquerade he be among man who cloak they life with religion in order to follow they real purpose unseen of man what do it all mean how have he blunder into so equivocal a situation have he blunder into it at all have he not rather be lead into it deliberately lead he thought grow dreadfully confused and he confidence in himself begin to fade and why he suddenly think again be they so impressed by the mere fact of he come to revisit he old school what be it they so admire and wonder at in he simple act why do they set such store upon he have the courage to come to give himself so freely unconditionally as one of they have express it with such a mockery of exaggeration fear stir in he heart most horribly and he find no answer to any of he questioning only one thing he now understand quite clearly : it be they purpose to keep he here they do not intend that he should go and from this moment he realize that they be sinister formidable and in some way he have yet to discover inimical to himself inimical to he life and the phrase one of they have use a moment ago -- this _ last _ visit of he -- rise before he eye in letter of flame harri be not a man of action and have never know in all the course of he career what it mean to be in a situation of real danger he be not necessarily a coward though perhaps a man of untried nerve he realize at last plainly that he be in a very awkward predicament indeed and that he have to deal with man who be utterly in earnest what they intention be he only vaguely guess he mind indeed be too confuse for definite ratiocination and he be only able to follow blindly the strongest instinct that move in he it never occur to he that the brother might all be mad or that he himself might have temporarily lose he sens and be suffer under some terrible delusion in fact nothing occur to he -- he realize nothing -- except that he mean to escape -- and the quicker the better a tremendous revulsion of feeling set in and overpower he accordingly without further protest for the moment he eat he pumpernickel and drink he coffee talk meanwhile as naturally and pleasantly as he could and when a suitable interval have pass he rise to he foot and announce once more that he must now take he leave he speak very quietly but very decidedly no one hear he could doubt that he mean what he say he have get very close to the door by this time i regret he say use he best german and speak to a hushed room that we pleasant evening must come to a end but it be now time for I to wish you all good-night and then as no one say anything he add though with a trifle less assurance and i thank you all most sincerely for you hospitality on the contrary reply kalkmann instantly rise from he chair and ignore the hand the englishman have stretch out to he it be we who have to thank you and we do so most gratefully and sincerely and at the same moment at least half a dozen of the brother take up they position between himself and the door you be very good to say so harris reply as firmly as he could manage notice this movement out of the corner of he eye but really i have no conception that -- my little chance visit could have afford you so much pleasure he move another step nearer the door but bruder schliemann come across the room quickly and stand in front of he he attitude be uncompromise a dark and terrible expression have come into he face but it be _ not _ by chance that you come bruder harri he say so that all the room could hear surely we have not misunderstand you presence here he raise he black eyebrow no no the englishman hasten to reply i be -- i be delighted to be here i tell you what pleasure it give I to find myself among you do not misunderstand I i beg he voice falter a little and he have difficulty in find the word more and more too he have difficulty in understand _ they _ word of course interpose bruder kalkmann in he iron bass _ we _ have not misunderstand you have come back in the spirit of true and unselfish devotion you offer yourself freely and we all appreciate it it be you willingness and nobility that have so completely win we veneration and respect a faint murmur of applause run round the room what we all delight in -- what we great master will especially delight in -- be the value of you spontaneous and voluntary -- he use a word harri do not understand he say _ opfer _ the bewildered englishman search he brain for the translation and search in vain for the life of he he could not remember what it mean but the word for all he inability to translate it touch he soul with ice it be worse far worse than anything he have imagine he feel like a lose helpless creature and all power to fight sink out of he from that moment it be magnificent to be such a willing -- add schliemann sidle up to he with a dreadful leer on he face he make use of the same word -- _ opfer _ god what could it all mean offer himself true spirit of devotion willing unselfish magnificent _ opfer opfer opfer _ what in the name of heaven do it mean that strange mysterious word that strike such terror into he heart he make a valiant effort to keep he presence of mind and hold he nerve steady turn he see that kalkmann 's face be a dead white kalkmann he understand that well enough _ kalkmann _ mean man of chalk : he know that but what do _ opfer _ mean that be the real key to the situation word pour through he disorder mind in a endless stream -- unusual rare word he have perhaps hear but once in he life -- while _ opfer _ a word in common use entirely escape he what a extraordinary mockery it all be then kalkmann pale as death but he face hard as iron speak a few low word that he do not catch and the brother stand by the wall at once turn the lamp down so that the room become dim in the half light he could only just discern they face and movement it be time he hear kalkmann 's remorseless voice continue just behind he the hour of midnight be at hand let we prepare he come he come bruder asmodelius come he voice rise to a chant and the sound of that name for some extraordinary reason be terrible -- utterly terrible so that harri shake from head to foot as he hear it its utterance fill the air like soft thunder and a hush come over the whole room force rise all about he transform the normal into the horrible and the spirit of craven fear run through all he be bring he to the verge of collapse _ asmodelius asmodelius _ the name be appalling for he understand at last to whom it refer and the meaning that lay between its great syllable at the same instant too he suddenly understand the meaning of that unremembered word the import of the word _ opfer _ flash upon he soul like a message of death he think of make a wild effort to reach the door but the weakness of he tremble knee and the row of black figure that stand between dissuaded he at once he would have scream for help but remember the emptiness of the vast building and the loneliness of the situation he understand that no help could come that way and he keep he lip close he stand still and do nothing but he know now what be come two of the brother approach and take he gently by the arm bruder asmodelius accept you they whisper be you ready then he find he tongue and try to speak but what have i to do with this bruder asm -- asmo -- he stammer a desperate rush of word crowd vainly behind the halt tongue the name refuse to pass he lip he could not pronounce it as they do he could not pronounce it at all he sense of helplessness then enter the acute stage for this inability to speak the name produce a fresh sense of quite horrible confusion in he mind and he become extraordinarily agitate i come here for a friendly visit he try to say with a great effort but to he intense dismay he hear he voice say something quite different and actually make use of that very word they have all use : i come here as a willing _ opfer _ he hear he own voice say and _ i be quite ready _ he be lose beyond all recall now not alone he mind but the very muscle of he body have pass out of control he feel that he be hover on the confines of a phantom or demon-world -- a world in which the name they have speak constitute the master-name the word of ultimate power what follow he hear and see as in a nightmare in the half light that veil all truth let we prepare to worship and adore chant schliemann who have precede he to the end of the room in the mist that protect we face before the black throne let we make ready the willing victim echo kalkmann in he great bass they raise they face listen expectantly as a roar sound like the passing of mighty projectile fill the air far far away very wonderful very forbid the wall of the room tremble he come he come he come chant the brother in chorus the sound of roar die away and a atmosphere of still and utter cold establish itself over all then kalkmann dark and unutterably stern turn in the dim light and face the rest asmodelius we _ hauptbruder _ be about we he cry in a voice that even while it shake be yet a voice of iron asmodelius be about we make ready there follow a pause in which no one stir or speak a tall brother approach the englishman but kalkmann hold up he hand let the eye remain uncovered he say in honor of so freely give himself and to he horror harri then realize for the first time that he hand be already fasten to he side the brother retreat again silently and in the pause that follow all the figure about he drop to they knee leave he standing alone and as they drop in voice hush with mingled reverence and awe they cry softly odiously appallingly the name of the be whom they momentarily expect to appear then at the end of the room where the window seem to have disappear so that he see the star there rise into view far up against the night sky grand and terrible the outline of a man a kind of gray glory envelop it so that it resemble a steel-cased statue immense impose horrific in its distant splendor while at the same time the face be so spiritually mighty yet so proudly so austerely sad that harri feel as he stare that the sight be more than he eye could meet and that in another moment the power of vision would fail he altogether and he must sink into utter nothingness so remote and inaccessible hang this figure that it be impossible to gauge anything as to its size yet at the same time so strangely close that when the gray radiance from its mightily broken visage August and mournful beat down upon he soul pulse like some dark star with the power of spiritual evil he feel almost as though he be look into a face no farther remove from he in space than the face of any one of the brother who stand by he side and then the room fill and tremble with sound that harri understand full well be the fail voice of other who have precede he in a long series down the year there come first a plain sharp cry as of a man in the last anguish choke for he breath and yet with the very final expiration of it breathe the name of the worship -- of the dark be who rejoice to hear it the cry of the strangle the short run gasp of the suffocate and the smother gurgling of the tighten throat all these and more echo back and forth between the wall the very wall in which he now stand a prisoner a sacrificial victim the cry too not alone of the broken body but -- far worse -- of beat broken soul and as the ghastly chorus rise and fall there come also the face of the lose and unhappy creature to whom they belong and against that curtain of pale gray light he see float past he in the air a array of white and piteous human countenance that seem to beckon and gibber at he as though he be already one of themselves slowly too as the voice rise and the pallid crew sail past that giant form of gray descend from the sky and approach the room that contain the worshipper and they prisoner hand rise and sink about he in the darkness and he feel that he be be drape in other garment than he own a circlet of ice seem to run about he head while round the waist enclose the fasten arm he feel a girdle tightly draw at last about he very throat there run a soft and silken touch which better than if there have be full light and a mirror hold to he face he understand to be the cord of sacrifice -- and of death at this moment the brother still prostrate upon the floor begin again they mournful yet impassioned chanting and as they do so a strange thing happen for apparently without move or alter its position the huge figure seem at once and suddenly to be inside the room almost beside he and to fill the space around he to the exclusion of all else he be now beyond all ordinary sensation of fear only a drab feeling as of death -- the death of the soul -- stir in he heart he thought no longer even beat vainly for escape the end be near and he know it the dreadfully chant voice rise about he in a wave : we worship we adore we offer the sound fill he ear and hammer almost meaningless upon he brain then the majestic gray face turn slowly downwards upon he and he very soul pass outwards and seem to become absorb in the sea of those anguished eye at the same moment a dozen hand force he to he knee and in the air before he he see the arm of kalkmann upraised and feel the pressure about he throat grow strong it be in this awful moment when he have give up all hope and the help of god or man seem beyond question that a strange thing happen for before he fading and terrify vision there slide as in a dream of light -- yet without apparent rhyme or reason -- wholly unbidden and unexplained -- the face of that other man at the supper table of the railway inn and the sight even mentally of that strong wholesome vigorous english face inspire he suddenly with a new courage it be but a flash of fading vision before he sink into a dark and terrible death yet in some inexplicable way the sight of that face stir in he unconquerable hope and the certainty of deliverance it be a face of power a face he now realize of simple goodness such as might have be see by man of old on the shore of galilee a face by heaven that could conquer even the devil of outer space and in he despair and abandonment he call upon it and call with no uncertain accent he find he voice in this overwhelming moment to some purpose though the word he actually use and whether they be in german or english he could never remember they effect nevertheless be instantaneous the brother understand and that gray figure of evil understand for a second the confusion be terrific there come a great shatter sound it seem that the very earth tremble but all harri remember afterwards be that voice rise about he in the clamor of terrify alarm -- a man of power be among we a man of god the vast sound be repeat -- the rush through space as of huge projectile -- and he sink to the floor of the room unconscious the entire scene have vanish vanish like smoke over the roof of a cottage when the wind blow and by he side sit down a slight un-german figure -- the figure of the stranger at the inn -- the man who have the rather wonderful eye \* \* \* \* \* when harri come to himself he feel cold he be lie under the open sky and the cool air of field and forest be blow upon he face he sit up and look about he the memory of the late scene be still horribly in he mind but no vestige of it remain no wall or ceiling enclose he he be no longer in a room at all there be no lamp turn low no cigar smoke no black form of sinister worshipper no tremendous gray figure hover beyond the window open space be about he and he be lie on a pile of brick and mortar he clothes soak with dew and the kind star shine brightly overhead he be lie bruise and shake among the heaped-up débris of a ruin building he stand up and stare about he there in the shadowy distance lay the surrounding forest and here close at hand stand the outline of the village building but underfoot beyond question lay nothing but the broken heap of stone that betoken a building long since crumble to dust then he see that the stone be blacken and that great wooden beam half burnt half rotten make line through the general débris he stand then among the ruin of a burnt and shattered build the weed and nettle prove conclusively that it have lie thus for many year the moon have already set behind the encircle forest but the star that spangle the heaven throw enough light to enable he to make quite sure of what he see harri the silk merchant stand among these broken and burnt stone and shiver then he suddenly become aware that out of the gloom a figure have rise and stand beside he peer at he he think he recognize the face of the stranger at the railway inn be _ you _ real he ask in a voice he hardly recognize as he own more than real -- i be friendly reply the stranger i follow you up here from the inn harri stand and stare for several minute without add anything he tooth chatter the least sound make he start but the simple word in he own language and the tone in which they be utter comfort he inconceivably you be english too thank god he say inconsequently these german devil -- he break off and put a hand to he eye but what be become of they all -- and the room -- and -- and -- the hand travel down to he throat and move nervously round he neck he draw a long long breath of relief do i dream everything -- everything he say distractedly he stare wildly about he and the stranger move forward and take he arm come he say soothingly yet with a trace of command in the voice we will move away from here the high-road or even the wood will be more to you taste for we be stand now on one of the most haunt -- and most terribly haunt -- spot of the whole world he guide he companion 's stumble footstep over the broken masonry until they reach the path the nettle sting they hand and harri feeling he way like a man in a dream pass through the twisted iron railing they reach the path and thence make they way to the road shine white in the night once safely out of the ruin harri collect himself and turn to look back but how be it possible he exclaim he voice still shake how can it be possible when i come in here i see the building in the moonlight they open the door i see the figure and hear the voice and touch yes touch they very hand and see they damned black face see they far more plainly than i see you now he be deeply bewildered the glamour be still upon he eye with a degree of reality stronger than the reality even of normal life be i so utterly deluded then suddenly the word of the stranger which he have only half hear or understand return to he haunt he ask look hard at he haunt do you say he pause in the roadway and stare into the darkness where the building of the old school have first appear to he but the stranger hurry he forward we shall talk more safely farther on he say i follow you from the inn the moment i realize where you have go when i find you it be eleven o'clock -- eleven o'clock say harri remember with a shudder -- i see you drop i watch over you till you recover consciousness of you own accord and now -- now i be here to guide you safely back to the inn i have break the spell -- the glamour -- i owe you a great deal sir interrupted harri again begin to understand something of the stranger 's kindness but i do not understand it all i feel dazed and shake he tooth still chatter and spell of violent shiver pass over he from head to foot he find that he be cling to the other 's arm in this way they pass beyond the desert and crumble village and gain the high-road that lead homewards through the forest that school building have long be in ruin say the man at he side presently it be burn down by order of the elder of the community at least ten year ago the village have be uninhabited ever since but the simulacrum of certain ghastly event that take place under that roof in past day still continue and the ` shell ' of the chief participant still enact there the dreadful deed that lead to its final destruction and to the desertion of the whole settlement they be devil-worshippers harri listen with bead of perspiration on he forehead that do not come alone from they leisurely pace through the cool night although he have see this man but once before in he life and have never before exchange so much as a word with he he feel a degree of confidence and a subtle sense of safety and well-being in he presence that be the most healing influence he could possibly have wish after the experience he have be through for all that he still feel as if he be walk in a dream and though he hear every word that fall from he companion 's lip it be only the next day that the full import of all he say become fully clear to he the presence of this quiet stranger the man with the wonderful eye which he feel now rather than saw apply a soothing anodyne to he shattered spirit that heal he through and through and this healing influence distil from the dark figure at he side satisfy he first imperative need so that he almost forget to realize how strange and opportune it be that the man should be there at all it somehow never occur to he to ask he name or to feel any undue wonder that one pass tourist should take so much trouble on behalf of another he just walk by he side listen to he quiet word and allow himself to enjoy the very wonderful experience after he recent ordeal of be help strengthen bless only once remember vaguely something of he reading of year ago he turn to the man beside he after some more than usually remarkable word and hear himself almost involuntarily it seem put the question : then be you a rosicrucian sir perhaps but the stranger have ignore the word or possibly not hear they for he continue with he talk as though unconscious of any interruption and harri become aware that another somewhat unusual picture have take possession of he mind as they walk there side by side through the cool reach of the forest and that he have find he imagination suddenly charge with the childhood memory of jacob wrestling with a angel -- wrestle all night with a being of superior quality whose strength eventually become he own it be you abrupt conversation with the priest at supper that first put I upon the track of this remarkable occurrence he hear the man 's quiet voice beside he in the darkness and it be from he i learn after you leave the story of the devil-worship that become secretly establish in the heart of this simple and devout little community devil-worship here -- harri stammer aghast yes -- here -- conduct secretly for year by a group of brother before unexplained disappearance in the neighborhood lead to its discovery for where could they have find a safer place in the whole wide world for they ghastly traffic and perverted power than here in the very precinct -- under cover of the very shadow of saintliness and holy living awful awful whisper the silk merchant and when i tell you the word they use to I -- i know it all the stranger say quietly i saw and hear everything my plan first be to wait till the end and then to take step for they destruction but in the interest of you personal safety -- he speak with the utmost gravity and conviction -- in the interest of the safety of you soul i make my presence know when i do and before the conclusion have be reach -- my safety the danger then be real they be alive and -- word fail he he stop in the road and turn towards he companion the shine of whose eye he could just make out in the gloom it be a concourse of the shell of violent man spiritually develop but evil man seek after death -- the death of the body -- to prolong they vile and unnatural existence and have they accomplish they object you in turn at the death of you body would have pass into they power and help to swell they dreadful purpose harri make no reply he be try hard to concentrate he mind upon the sweet and common thing of life he even think of silk and st paul 's churchyard and the face of he partner in business for you come all prepare to be catch he hear the other 's voice like some one talk to he from a distance you deeply introspective mood have already reconstruct the past so vividly so intensely that you be _ en rapport _ at once with any force of those day that chance still to be linger and they sweep you up all unresistingly harri tighten he hold upon the stranger 's arm as he hear at the moment he have room for one emotion only it do not seem to he odd that this stranger should have such intimate knowledge of he mind it be alas chiefly the evil emotion that be able to leave they photograph upon surround scene and object the other add and who ever hear of a place haunt by a noble deed or of beautiful and lovely ghost revisit the glimpse of the moon it be unfortunate but the wicked passion of man 's heart alone seem strong enough to leave picture that persist the good be ever too lukewarm the stranger sigh as he speak but harri exhaust and shake as he be to the very core pace by he side only half listen he move as in a dream still it be very wonderful to he this walk home under the star in the early hour of the October morning the peaceful forest all about they mist rise here and there over the small clearing and the sound of water from a hundred little invisible stream fill in the pause of the talk in after life he always look back to it as something magical and impossible something that have seem too beautiful too curiously beautiful to have be quite true and though at the time he hear and understand but a quarter of what the stranger say it come back to he afterwards stay with he till the end of he day and always with a curious haunting sense of unreality as though he have enjoy a wonderful dream of which he could recall only faint and exquisite portion but the horror of the earlier experience be effectually dispel and when they reach the railway inn somewhere about three o'clock in the morning harri shake the stranger 's hand gratefully effusively meet the look of those rather wonderful eye with a full heart and go up to he room think in a hazy dream-like way of the word with which the stranger have bring they conversation to a end as they leave the confines of the forest -- and if think and emotion can persist in this way so long after the brain that send they forth have crumble into dust how vitally important it must be to control they very birth in the heart and guard they with the keenest possible restraint but harri the silk merchant sleep better than might have be expect and with a soundness that carry he half-way through the day and when he come downstairs and learn that the stranger have already take he departure he realize with keen regret that he have never once think of ask he name yes he sign the visitor ' book say the girl in reply to he question and he turn over the blot page and find there the last entry in a very delicate and individual handwriting -- _ john silence _ london case ii : the camp of the dog i island of all shape and size troop northward from stockholm by the hundred and the little steamer that thread they intricate maze in summer leave the traveller in a somewhat bewildered state as regard the point of the compass when it reach the end of its journey at waxholm but it be only after waxholm that the true island begin so to speak to run wild and start up the coast on they tangled course of a hundred mile of desert loveliness and it be in the very heart of this delightful confusion that we pitch we tent for a summer holiday a veritable wilderness of island lay about we : from the mere round button of a rock that bear a single fir to the mountainous stretch of a square mile densely wood and bound by precipitous cliff so close together often that a strip of water run between no wider than a country lane or again so far that a expanse stretch like the open sea for mile although the larger island boast farm and fishing station the majority be uninhabited carpet with moss and heather they coast-line show a series of ravine and cleft and little sandy bay with a growth of splendid pine-wood that come down to the water 's edge and lead the eye through unknown depths of shadow and mystery into the very heart of primitive forest the particular island to which we have camping rights by virtue of pay a nominal sum to a stockholm merchant lay together in a picturesque group far beyond the reach of the steamer one be a mere reef with a fringe of fairy-like birch and two other cliff-bound monster rise with wooded head out of the sea the fourth which we select because it enclose a little lagoon suitable for anchorage bathing night-line and what-not shall have what description be necessary as the story proceeds but so far as pay rent be concern we might equally well have pitch we tent on any one of a hundred other that cluster about we as thickly as a swarm of bee it be in the blaze of a evening in July the air clear as crystal the sea a cobalt blue when we leave the steamer on the border of civilisation and sail away with map compass and provision for the little group of dot in the skägård that be to be we home for the next two month the dinghy and my canadian canoe trail behind we with tent and dunnage carefully pile aboard and when the point of cliff intervene to hide the steamer and the waxholm hotel we realize for the first time that the horror of train and house be far behind we the fever of man and city the weariness of street and confine space the wilderness open up on all side into endless blue reach and the map and compass be so frequently call into requisition that we go astray more often than not and progress be enchantingly slow it take we for instance two whole day to find we crescent-shaped home and the camp we make on the way be so fascinating that we leave they with difficulty and regret for each island seem more desirable than the one before it and over all lay the spell of haunt peace remoteness from the turmoil of the world and the freedom of open and desolate space and so many of these spot of world-beauty have i seek out and dwelt in that in my mind remain only a composite memory of they face a true map of heaven as it be from which this particular one stand forth with unusual sharpness because of the strange thing that happen there and also i think because anything in which john silence play a part have a habit of fix itself in the mind with a living and lasting quality of vividness for the moment however dr silence be not of the party some private case in the interior of hungary claim he attention and it be not till later -- the 15th of August to be exact -- that i have arrange to meet he in berlin and then return to london together for we harvest of winter work all the member of we party however be know to he more or less well and on this third day as we sail through the narrow opening into the lagoon and see the circular ridge of tree in a gold and crimson sunset before we he last word to I when we part in london for some unaccountable reason come back very sharply to my memory and recall the curious impression of prophecy with which i have first hear they : enjoy you holiday and store up all the force you can he have say as the train slip out of victorium and we will meet in berlin on the 15th -- unless you should send for I sooner and now suddenly the word return to I so clearly that it seem i almost hear he voice in my ear : unless you should send for I sooner and return moreover with a significance i be wholly at a loss to understand that touch somewhere in the depths of my mind a vague sense of apprehension that they have all along be intend in the nature of a prophecy in the lagoon then the wind fail we this July evening as be only natural behind the shelter of the belt of wood and we take to the oar all breathless with the beauty of this first sight of we island home yet all talk in somewhat hushed voice of the best place to land the depth of water the safest place to anchor to put up the tent in the most sheltered spot for the camp-fire and a dozen thing of importance that crop up when a home in the wilderness have actually to be make and during this busy sunset hour of unload before the dark the soul of my companion adopt the trick of present themselves very vividly anew before my mind and introduce themselves afresh in reality i suppose we party be in no sense singular in the conventional life at home they certainly seem ordinary enough but suddenly as we pass through these gate of the wilderness i see they more sharply than before with character strip of the atmosphere of man and city a complete change of set often furnish a startlingly new view of people hitherto hold for well-known they present another facet of they personality i seem to see my own party almost as new people -- people i have not know properly hitherto people who would drop all disguise and henceforth reveal themselves as they really be and each one seem to say : now you will see I as i be you will see I here in this primitive life of the wilderness without clothes all my mask and veil i have leave behind in the abode of man so look out for surprise the reverend timothy maloney help I to put up the tent long practice make the process easy and while he drive in peg and tighten rope he coat off he flannel collar fly open without a tie it be impossible to avoid the conclusion that he be cut out for the life of a pioneer rather than the church he be fifty year of age muscular blue-eyed and hearty and he take he share of the work and more without shirk the way he handle the axe in cut down sapling for the tent-pole be a delight to see and he eye in judge the level be unfailing bully as a young man into a lucrative family living he have in turn bully he mind into some semblance of orthodox belief do the honor of the little country church with a energy that make one think of a coal-heaver tend china and it be only in the past few year that he have resign the living and take instead to cram young man for they examination this suit he better it enable he too to indulge he passion for spell of wild life and to spend the summer month of most year under canvas in one part of the world or another where he could take he young man with he and combine reading with open air he wife usually accompany he and there be no doubt she enjoy the trip for she possess though in less degree the same joy of the wilderness that be he own distinguishing characteristic the only difference be that while he regard it as the real life she regard it as a interlude while he camp out with he heart and mind she play at camp out with she clothes and body none the less she make a splendid companion and to watch she busy cooking dinner over the fire we have build among the stone be to understand that she heart be in the business for the moment and that she be happy even with the detail mr maloney at home knitting in the sun and believe that the world be make in six day be one woman but mr maloney standing with bare arm over the smoke of a wood fire under the pine tree be another and peter sangree the canadian pupil with he pale skin and he loose though not ungainly figure stand beside she in very unfavourable contrast as he scrape potato and sliced bacon with slender white finger that seem better suit to hold a pen than a knife she order he about like a slave and he obey too with willing pleasure for in spite of he general appearance of debility he be as happy to be in camp as any of they but more than any other member of the party joan maloney the daughter be the one who seem a natural and genuine part of the landscape who belong to it all just in the same way that the tree and the moss and the gray rock run out into the water belong to it for she be obviously in she right and natural set a creature of the wild a gipsy in she own home to any one with a discerning eye this would have be more or less apparent but to I who have know she during all the twenty-two year of she life and be familiar with the in and out of she primitive utterly un-modern type it be strikingly clear to see she there make it impossible to imagine she again in civilisation i lose all recollection of how she look in a town the memory somehow evaporate this slim creature before I flit to and fro with the grace of the woodland life swift supple adroit on she knee blow the fire or stir the frying-pan through a veil of smoke suddenly seem the only way i have ever really see she here she be at home in london she become some one conceal by clothes a artificial doll overdressed and move by clockwork only a portion of she alive here she be alive all over i forget altogether how she be dress just as i forget how any particular tree be dress or how the marking run on any one of the boulder that lay about the camp she look just as wild and natural and untame as everything else that go to make up the scene and more than that i can not say pretty she be decidedly not she be thin skinny dark-haired and possess of great physical strength in the form of endurance she have too something of the force and vigorous purpose of a man tempestuous sometimes and wild to passionate frightening she mother and puzzling she easy-going father with she storm of waywardness while at the same time she stir he admiration by she violence a pagan of the pagan she be besides and with some haunting suggestion of old-world pagan beauty about she dark face and eye altogether a odd and difficult character but with a generosity and high courage that make she very lovable in town life she always seem to I to feel cramped bore a devil in a cage in she eye a hunt expression as though any moment she dread to be catch but up in these spacious solitude all this disappear away from the limitation that plague and sting she she would show at she best and as i watch she move about the camp i repeatedly find myself think of a wild creature that have just obtain its freedom and be try its muscle peter sangree of course at once go down before she but she be so obviously beyond he reach and besides so well able to take care of herself that i think she parent give the matter but little thought and he himself worship at a respectful distance keep admirable control of he passion in all respects save one for at he age the eye be difficult to master and the yearning almost the devour expression often visible in they be probably there unknown even to himself he better than any one else understand that he have fall in love with something most hard of attainment something that draw he to the very edge of life and almost beyond it it no doubt be a secret and terrible joy to he this passionate worship from afar only i think he suffer more than any one guess and that he want of vitality be due in large measure to the constant stream of unsatisfied yearning that pour for ever from he soul and body moreover it seem to I who now see they for the first time together that there be a unnamable something -- a elusive quality of some kind -- that marked they as belong to the same world and that although the girl ignore he she be secretly and perhaps unknown to herself draw by some attribute very deep in she own nature to some quality equally deep in he this then be the party when we first settle down into we two month ' camp on the island in the baltic sea other figure flit from time to time across the scene and sometimes one read man sometimes another come to join we and spend he four hour a day in the clergyman 's tent but they come for short period only and they go without leave much trace in my memory and certainly they play no important part in what subsequently happen the weather favor we that night so that by sunset the tent be up the boat unloaded a store of wood collect and chop into length and the candle-lantern hang round ready for light on the tree sangree too have pick deep mattress of balsam bough for the woman 's bed and have clear little path of brushwood from they tent to the central fireplace all be prepare for bad weather it be a cosy supper and a well-cooked one that we sit down to and eat under the star and accord to the clergyman the only meal fit to eat we have see since we leave london a week before the deep stillness after that roar of steamer train and tourist hold something that thrill for as we lay round the fire there be no sound but the faint sighing of the pine and the soft lapping of the wave along the shore and against the side of the boat in the lagoon the ghostly outline of she white sail be just visible through the tree idly rock to and fro in she calm anchorage she sheet flap gently against the mast beyond lay the dim blue shape of other island float in the night and from all the great space about we come the murmur of the sea and the soft breathing of great wood the odour of the wilderness -- smell of wind and earth of tree and water clean vigorous and mighty -- be the true odour of a virgin world unspoilt by man more penetrate and more subtly intoxicate than any other perfume in the whole world oh -- and dangerously strong too no doubt for some nature ahhh breathe out the clergyman after supper with a indescribable gesture of satisfaction and relief here there be freedom and room for body and mind to turn in here one can work and rest and play here one can be alive and absorb something of the earth-force that never get within touch distance in the city by george i shall make a permanent camp here and come when it be time to die the good man be merely give vent to he delight at be under canvas he say the same thing every year and he say it often but it more or less express the superficial feeling of we all and when a little later he turn to compliment he wife on the fried potato and discover that she be snore with she back against a tree he grunt with content at the sight and put a ground-sheet over she foot as if it be the most natural thing in the world for she to fall asleep after dinner and then move back to he own corner smoking he pipe with great satisfaction and i smoking mine too lay and fight against the most delicious sleep imaginable while my eye wander from the fire to the star peep through the branch and then back again to the group about I the rev timothy soon let he pipe go out and succumb as he wife have do for he have work hard and eat well sangree also smoke lean against a tree with he gaze fix on the girl a depth of yearning in he face that he could not hide and that really distressed I for he and joan herself with wide stare eye alert full of the new force of the place evidently key up by the magic of find herself among all the thing she soul recognize as home sit rigid by the fire she thought roam through the space the blood stir about she heart she be as unconscious of the canadian 's gaze as she be that she parent both sleep she look to I more like a tree or something that have grow out of the island than a living girl of the century and when i speak across to she in a whisper and suggest a tour of investigation she start and look up at I as though she hear a voice in she dream sangree leap up and join we and without wake the other we three go over the ridge of the island and make we way down to the shore behind the water lay like a lake before we still color by the sunset the air be keen and scented waft the smell of the wooded island that hang about we in the darkening air very small wave tumble softly on the sand the sea be sow with star and everywhere breathe and pulse the beauty of the northern summer night i confess i speedily lose consciousness of the human presence beside I and i have little doubt joan do too only sangree feel otherwise i suppose for presently we hear he sigh and i can well imagine that he absorb the whole wonder and passion of the scene into he ache heart to swell the pain there that be more search even than the pain at the sight of such matchless and incomprehensible beauty the splash of a fish jump break the spell i wish we have the canoe now remark joan we could paddle out to the other island of course i say wait here and i 'll go across for it and be turn to feel my way back through the darkness when she stop I in a voice that mean what it say no mr sangree will get it we will wait here and cooee to guide he the canadian be off in a moment for she have only to hint of she wish and he obey keep out from shore in case of rock i cry out as he go and turn to the right out of the lagoon that be the shortest way round by the map my voice travel across the still water and wake echo in the distant island that come back to we like people call out of space it be only thirty or forty yard over the ridge and down the other side to the lagoon where the boat lay but it be a good mile to coast round the shore in the dark to where we stand and wait we hear he stumble away among the boulder and then the sound suddenly cease as he top the ridge and go down past the fire on the other side i do not want to be leave alone with he the girl say presently in a low voice i be always afraid he be go to say or do something -- she hesitate a moment look quickly over she shoulder towards the ridge where he have just disappear -- something that might lead to unpleasantness she stop abruptly _ you _ frightened joan i exclaimed with genuine surprise this be a new light on you wicked character i think the human being who could frighten you do not exist then i suddenly realize she be talk seriously -- look to I for help of some kind -- and at once i drop the teasing attitude he be very far go i think joan i add gravely you must be kind to he whatever else you may feel he be exceedingly fond of you i know but i can not help it she whisper lest she voice should carry in the stillness there be something about he that -- that make I feel creepy and half afraid but poor man it be not he fault if he be delicate and sometimes look like death i laugh gently by way of defend what i feel to be a very innocent member of my sex oh but it be not that i mean she answer quickly it be something i feel about he something in he soul something he hardly know himself but that may come out if we be much together it draw I i feel tremendously it stir what be wild in I -- deep down -- oh very deep down -- yet at the same time make I feel afraid i suppose he thought be always play about you i say but he be nice-minded and -- yes yes she interrupt impatiently i can trust myself absolutely with he he be gentle and singularly pure-minded but there be something else that -- she stop again sharply to listen then she come up close beside I in the darkness whispering -- you know mr hubbard sometimes my intuition warn I a little too strongly to be ignore oh yes you need not tell I again that it be difficult to distinguish between fancy and intuition i know all that but i also know that there be something deep down in that man 's soul that call to something deep down in mine and at present it frighten I because i can not make out what it be and i know i _ know _ he 'll do something some day that -- that will shake my life to the very bottom she laugh a little at the strangeness of she own description i turn to look at she more closely but the darkness be too great to show she face there be a intensity almost of suppress passion in she voice that take I completely by surprise nonsense joan i say a little severely you know he well he be be with you father for month now but that be in london and up here it be different -- i mean i feel that it may be different life in a place like this blow away the restraint of the artificial life at home i know oh i know what i be say i feel all untied in a place like this the rigidity of one 's nature begin to melt and flow surely _ you _ must understand what i mean of course i understand i reply yet not wish to encourage she in she present line of thought and it be a grand experience -- for a short time but you be overtire to-night joan like the rest of we a few day in this air will set you above all fear of the kind you mention then after a moment 's silence i add feeling i should estrange she confidence altogether if i blunder any more and treat she like a child -- i think perhaps the true explanation be that you pity he for love you and at the same time you feel the repulsion of the healthy vigorous animal for what be weak and timid if he come up boldly and take you by the throat and shout that he would force you to love he -- well then you would feel no fear at all you would know exactly how to deal with he be not it perhaps something of that kind the girl make no reply and when i take she hand i feel that it tremble a little and be cold it be not he love that i be afraid of she say hurriedly for at this moment we hear the dip of a paddle in the water it be something in he very soul that terrify I in a way i have never be terrify before -- yet fascinate I in town i be hardly conscious of he presence but the moment we get away from civilisation it begin to come he seem so -- so _ real _ up here i dread be alone with he it make I feel that something must burst and tear its way out -- that he would do something -- or i should do something -- i do not know exactly what i mean probably -- but that i should let myself go and scream -- joan do not be alarm she laugh shortly i sha not do anything silly but i want to tell you my feeling in case i need you help when i have intuition as strong as this they be never wrong only i do not know yet what it mean exactly you must hold out for the month at any rate i say in as matter-of-fact a voice as i could manage for she manner have somehow change my surprise to a subtle sense of alarm sangree only stay the month you know and anyhow you be such a odd creature yourself that you should feel generously towards other odd creature i end lamely with a forced laugh she give my hand a sudden pressure i be glad i have tell you at any rate she say quickly under she breath for the canoe be now glide up silently like a ghost to we foot and i be glad you be here too she add as we move down towards the water to meet it i make sangree change into the bow and get into the steer seat myself put the girl between we so that i could watch they both by keep they outline against the sea and star for the intuition of certain folk -- woman and child usually i confess -- i have always feel a great respect that have more often than not be justify by experience and now the curious emotion stir in I by the girl 's word remain somewhat vividly in my consciousness i explain it in some measure by the fact that the girl tire out by the fatigue of many day ' travel have suffer a vigorous reaction of some kind from the strong desolate scenery and further perhaps that she have be treat to my own experience of see the member of the party in a new light -- the canadian be partly a stranger more vividly than the rest of we but at the same time i feel it be quite possible that she have sense some subtle link between he personality and she own some quality that she have hitherto ignore and that the routine of town life have keep bury out of sight the only thing that seem difficult to explain be the fear she have speak of and this i hope the wholesome effect of camp-life and exercise would sweep away naturally in the course of time we make the tour of the island without speak it be all too beautiful for speech the tree crowd down to the shore to hear we pass we see they fine dark head bow low with splendid dignity to watch we forget for a moment that the star be catch in the needled network of they hair against the sky in the west where still linger the sunset gold we see the wild toss of the horizon shaggy with forest and cliff grip the heart like the motive in a symphony and send the sense of beauty all a-shiver through the mind -- all these surround island stand above the water like low cloud and like they seem to post along silently into the engulf night we hear the musical drip-drip of the paddle and the little wash of we wave on the shore and then suddenly we find ourselves at the opening of the lagoon again have make the complete circuit of we home the reverend timothy have awaken from sleep and be sing to himself and the sound of he voice as we glide down the fifty yard of enclosed water be pleasant to hear and undeniably wholesome we see the glow of the fire up among the tree on the ridge and he shadow move about as he throw on more wood there you be he call aloud good again be set the night-line eh capital and you mother 's still fast asleep joan he cheery laugh float across the water he have not be in the least disturb by we absence for old camper be not easily alarm now remember he go on after we have tell we little tale of travel by the fire and mr maloney have ask for the fourth time exactly where she tent be and whether the door face east or south every one take they turn at cooking breakfast and one of the man be always out at sunrise to catch it first hubbard i 'll toss you which you do in the morning and which i do he lose the toss then i 'll catch it i say laughing at he discomfiture for i know he loathe stir porridge and mind you do not burn it as you do every bless time last year on the volga i add by way of reminder mr maloney 's fifth interruption about the door of she tent and she further pointed observation that it be past nine o'clock set we light lantern and put the fire out for safety but before we separate for the night the clergyman have a time-honoured little ritual of he own to go through that no one have the heart to deny he he always do this it be a relic of he pulpit habit he glance briefly from one to the other of we he face grave and earnest he hand lift to the star and he eye all close and pucker up beneath a momentary frown then he offer up a short almost inaudible prayer thank heaven for we safe arrival beg for good weather no illness or accident plenty of fish and strong sailing wind and then unexpectedly -- no one know why exactly -- he end up with a abrupt request that nothing from the kingdom of darkness should be allow to afflict we peace and no evil thing come near to disturb we in the night-time and while he utter these last surprising word so strangely unlike he usual end it chance that i look up and let my eye wander round the group assemble about the die fire and it certainly seem to I that sangree 's face undergo a sudden and visible alteration he be stare at joan and as he stare the change run over it like a shadow and be go i start in spite of myself for something oddly concentrate potent collect have come into the expression usually so scattered and feeble but it be all swift as a pass meteor and when i look a second time he face be normal and he be look among the tree and joan luckily have not observe he she head be bow and she eye tightly close while she father pray the girl have a vivid imagination indeed i think half laughing as i light the lantern if she thought can put a glamour upon mine in this way and yet somehow when we say good-night i take occasion to give she a few vigorous word of encouragement and go to she tent to make sure i could find it quickly in the night in case anything happen in she quick way the girl understand and thank I and the last thing i hear as i move off to the man 's quarter be mrs maloney cry that there be beetle in she tent and joan 's laughter as she go to help she turn they out half a hour later the island be silent as the grave but for the mournful voice of the wind as it sigh up from the sea like white sentry stand the three tent of the man on one side of the ridge and on the other side half hide by some birch whose leave just shiver as the breeze catch they the woman 's tent patch of ghostly gray gather more closely together for mutual shelter and protection something like fifty yard of broken ground gray rock moss and lichen lay between and over all lay the curtain of the night and the great whispering wind from the forest of scandinavium and the very last thing just before float away on that mighty wave that carry one so softly off into the deep of forgetfulness i again hear the voice of john silence as the train move out of victorium station and by some subtle connection that meet I on the very threshold of consciousness there rise in my mind simultaneously the memory of the girl 's half-given confidence and of she distress as by some wizardry of approach dream they seem in that instant to be related but before i could analyze the why and the wherefore both sink away out of sight again and i be off beyond recall unless you should send for I sooner ii whether mr maloney 's tent door open south or east i think she never discover for it be quite certain she always sleep with the flap tightly fasten i only know that my own little five by seven all silk face due east because next morning the sun pour in as only the wilderness sun know how to pour wake I early and a moment later with a short run over soft moss and a fly dive from the granite ledge i be swim in the most sparkling water imaginable it be barely four o'clock and the sun come down a long vista of blue island that lead out to the open sea and finland nearer by rise the wooded dome of we own property still cap and wreathe with smoky trail of fast-melting mist and look as fresh as though it be the morning of mr maloney 's sixth day and they have just issue clean and brilliant from the hand of the great architect in the open space the ground be drench with dew and from the sea a cool salt wind steal in among the tree and set the branch tremble in a atmosphere of shimmering silver the tent shine white where the sun catch they in patch below lay the lagoon still dream of the summer night in the open the fish be jump busily send musical ripple towards the shore and in the air hang the magic of dawn -- silent incommunicable i light the fire so that a hour later the clergyman should find good ash to stir he porridge over and then set forth upon a examination of the island but hardly have i go a dozen yard when i see a figure stand a little in front of I where the sunlight fall in a pool among the tree it be joan she have already be up a hour she tell I and have bath before the last star have leave the sky i see at once that the new spirit of this solitary region have enter into she banish the fear of the night for she face be like the face of a happy denizen of the wilderness and she eye stainless and shine she foot be bare and drop of dew she have shake from the branch hang in she loose-flying hair obviously she have come into she own i have be all over the island she announce laughingly and there be two thing want you be a good judge joan what be they there be no animal life and there be no -- water they go together i say animal do not bother with a rock like this unless there be a spring on it and as she lead I from place to place happy and excited leap adroitly from rock to rock i be glad to note that my first impression be correct she make no reference to we conversation of the night before the new spirit have drive out the old there be no room in she heart for fear or anxiety and nature have everything she own way the island we find be some three-quarter of a mile from point to point build in a circle or wide horseshoe with a opening of twenty foot at the mouth of the lagoon pine-tree grow thickly all over but here and there be patch of silver birch scrub oak and considerable colony of wild raspberry and gooseberry bush the two end of the horseshoe form bare slab of smooth granite run into the sea and form dangerous reef just below the surface but the rest of the island rise in a forty-foot ridge and slope down steeply to the sea on either side be nowhere more than a hundred yard wide the outer shore-line be much indented with numberless cove and bay and sandy beach with here and there cave and precipitous little cliff against which the sea break in spray and thunder but the inner shore the shore of the lagoon be low and regular and so well protect by the wall of tree along the ridge that no storm could ever send more than a pass ripple along its sandy marge eternal shelter reign there on one of the other island a few hundred yard away -- for the rest of the party sleep late this first morning and we take to the canoe -- we discover a spring of fresh water untainted by the brackish flavor of the baltic and have thus solve the most important problem of the camp we next proceed to deal with the second -- fish and in half a hour we reel in and turn homewards for we have no means of storage and to clean more fish than may be store or eat in a day be no wise occupation for experienced camper and as we land towards six o'clock we hear the clergyman singing as usual and see he wife and sangree shake out they blanket in the sun and dress in a fashion that finally dispel all memory of street and civilisation the little people light the fire for I cry maloney look natural and at home in he ancient flannel suit and break off in the middle of he singing so i have get the porridge go -- and this time it be _ not _ burnt we report the discovery of water and hold up the fish good good again he cry we 'll have the first decent breakfast we have have this year sangree 'll clean 'em in no time and the bo ` sun 's mate -- will fry they to a turn laugh the voice of mr maloney appear on the scene in a tight blue jersey and sandal and catch up the frying-pan she husband always call she the bo ` sun 's mate in camp because it be she duty among other to pipe all hand to meal and as for you joan go on the happy man you look like the spirit of the island with moss in you hair and wind in you eye and sun and star mix in you face he look at she with delighted admiration here sangree take these twelve there be a good fellow they be the biggest and we 'll have 'em in butter in less time than you can say baltic island i watch the canadian as he slowly move off to the cleaning pail he eye be drink in the girl 's beauty and a wave of passionate almost feverish joy pass over he face expressive of the ecstasy of true worship more than anything else perhaps he be think that he still have three week to come with that vision always before he eye perhaps he be think of he dream in the night i can not say but i notice the curious mingling of yearning and happiness in he eye and the strength of the impression touch my curiosity something in he face hold my gaze for a second something to do with its intensity that so timid so gentle a personality should conceal so virile a passion almost seem to require explanation but the impression be momentary for that first breakfast in camp permit no divide attention and i dare swear that the porridge the tea the swedish flatbread and the fried fish flavor with point of frizzled bacon be better than any meal eat elsewhere that day in the whole world the first clear day in a new camp be always a furiously busy one and we soon drop into the routine upon which in large measure the real comfort of every one depend about the cooking-fire greatly improve with stone from the shore we build a high stockade consist of upright pole thickly twine with branch the roof line with moss and lichen and weight with rock and round the interior we make low wooden seat so that we could lie round the fire even in rain and eat we meal in peace path too outline themselves from tent to tent from the bathing place and the landing stage and a fair division of the island be decide upon between the quarter of the man and the woman wood be stack awkward tree and boulder remove hammock sling and tent strengthen in a word camp be establish and duty be assign and accept as though we expect to live on this baltic island for year to come and the smallest detail of the community life be important moreover as the camp come into be this sense of a community develop prove that we be a definite whole and not merely separate human being live for a while in tent upon a desert island each fall willingly into the routine sangree as by natural selection take upon himself the cleaning of the fish and the cutting of the wood into length sufficient for a day 's use and he do it well the pan of water be never without a fish clean and scale ready to fry for whoever be hungry the nightly fire never die down for lack of material to throw on without go farther afield to search and timothy once reverend catch the fish and chop down the tree he also assume responsibility for the condition of the boat and do it so thoroughly that nothing in the little cutter be ever find want and when for any reason he presence be in demand the first place to look for he be -- in the boat and there too he be usually find tinker away with sheet sail or rudder and singing as he tinker ` nor be the reading neglect for most morning there come a sound of drone voice form the white tent by the raspberry bush which signify that sangree the tutor and whatever other man chance to be in the party at the time be hard at it with history or the classic and while mr maloney also by natural selection take charge of the larder and the kitchen the mending and general supervision of the rough comfort she also make herself peculiarly mistress of the megaphone which summon to meal and carry she voice easily from one end of the island to the other and in she hour of leisure she daub the surround scenery on to a sketch block with all the honesty and devotion of she determine but unreceptive soul joan meanwhile joan elusive creature of the wild become i know not exactly what she do plenty of work in the camp yet seem to have no very precise duty she be everywhere and anywhere sometimes she sleep in she tent sometimes under the star with a blanket she know every inch of the island and keep turn up in place where she be least expect -- for ever wander about read she book in sheltered corner make little fire on sunless day to worship by to the god as she put it ever find new pool to dive and bathe in and swim day and night in the warm and waveless lagoon like a fish in a huge tank she go bare-legged and bare-footed with she hair down and she skirt catch up to the knee and if ever a human being turn into a jolly savage within the compass of a single week joan maloney be certainly that human be she run wild so completely too be she possess by the strong spirit of the place that the little human fear she have yield to so strangely on we arrival seem to have be utterly dispossessed as i hope and expect she make no reference to we conversation of the first evening sangree bother she with no special attention and after all they be very little together he behavior be perfect in that respect and i for my part hardly give the matter another thought joan be ever a prey to vivid fancy of one kind or another and this be one of they mercifully for the happiness of all concerned it have melt away before the spirit of busy active life and deep content that reign over the island every one be intensely alive and peace be upon all \* \* \* \* \* meanwhile the effect of the camp-life begin to tell always a search test of character its result sooner or later be infallible for it act upon the soul as swiftly and surely as the hypo bath upon the negative of a photograph a readjustment of the personal force take place quickly some part of the personality go to sleep other wake up : but the first sweeping change that the primitive life bring about be that the artificial portion of the character shed themselves one after another like dead skin attitude and pose that seem genuine in the city drop away the mind like the body grow quickly hard simple uncomplex and in a camp as primitive and close to nature as ours be these effect become speedily visible some folk of course who talk glibly about the simple life when it be safely out of reach betray themselves in camp by for ever peer about for the artificial excitement of civilisation which they miss some get bore at once some grow slovenly some reveal the animal in most unexpected fashion and some the select few find themselves in very short order and be happy and in we little party we could flatter ourselves that we all belong to the last category so far as the general effect be concern only there be certain other change as well vary with each individual and all interesting to note it be only after the first week or two that these change become marked although this be the proper place i think to speak of they for have myself no other duty than to enjoy a well-earned holiday i use to load my canoe with blanket and provision and journey forth on exploration trip among the island of several day together and it be on my return from the first of these -- when i rediscover the party so to speak -- that these change first present themselves vividly to I and in one particular instance produce a rather curious impression in a word then while every one have grow wilder naturally wilder sangree it seem to I have grow much wilder and what i can only call unnaturally wilder he make I think of a savage to begin with he have change immensely in mere physical appearance and the full brown cheek the brighter eye of absolute health and the general air of vigor and robustness that have come to replace he customary lassitude and timidity have work such a improvement that i hardly know he for the same man he voice too be deeper and he manner bespoke for the first time a greater measure of confidence in himself he now have some claim to be call nice-looking or at least to a certain air of virility that would not lessen he value in the eye of the opposite sex all this of course be natural enough and most welcome but altogether apart from this physical change which no doubt have also be go forward in the rest of we there be a subtle note in he personality that come to I with a degree of surprise that almost amount to shock and two thing -- as he come down to welcome I and pull up the canoe -- leap up in my mind unbidden as though connect in some way i could not at the moment divine -- first the curious judgment form of he by joan and secondly that fugitive expression i have catch in he face while maloney be offer up he strange prayer for special protection from heaven the delicacy of manner and feature -- to call it by no milder term -- which have always be a distinguishing characteristic of the man have be replace by something far more vigorous and decide that yet utterly elude analysis the change which impress I so oddly be not easy to name the other -- singing maloney the bustling bo ` sun 's mate and joan that fascinating half-breed of undine and salamander -- all show the effect of a life so close to nature but in they case the change be perfectly natural and what be to be expect whereas with peter sangree the canadian it be something unusual and unexpected it be impossible to explain how he manage gradually to convey to my mind the impression that something in he have turn savage yet this more or less be the impression that he do convey it be not that he seem really less civilised or that he character have undergo any definite alteration but rather that something in he hitherto dormant have awaken to life some quality latent till now -- so far at least as we be concern who after all know he but slightly -- have stir into activity and rise to the surface of he be and while for the moment this seem as far as i could get it be but natural that my mind should continue the intuitive process and acknowledge that john silence owe to he peculiar faculty and the girl owe to she singularly receptive temperament might each in a different way have divine this latent quality in he soul and fear its manifestation later on look back to this painful adventure too it now seem equally natural that the same process carry to its logical conclusion should have waken some deep instinct in I that wholly without direction from my will set itself sharply and persistently upon the watch from that very moment thenceforward the personality of sangree be never far from my thought and i be for ever analyze and search for the explanation that take so long in come i declare hubbard you be tan like a aboriginal and you look like one too laugh maloney and i can return the compliment be my reply as we all gather round a brew of tea to exchange news and compare note and later at supper it amuse I to observe that the distinguished tutor once clergyman do not eat he food quite as nicely as he do at home -- he devour it that mr maloney eat more and to say the least with less delay than be she custom in the select atmosphere of she english dining-room and that while joan attack she tin plateful with genuine avidity sangree the canadian bit and gnaw at he laughing and talk and compliment the cook all the while and make I think with secret amusement of a starve animal at its first meal while from they remark about myself i judge that i have change and grow wild as much as the rest of they in this and in a hundred other little way the change show way difficult to define in detail but all prove -- not the coarsening effect of lead the primitive life but let we say the more direct and unvarnished method that become prevalent for all day long we be in the bath of the element -- wind water sun -- and just as the body become insensible to cold and shed unnecessary clothing the mind grow straightforward and shed many of the disguise require by the convention of civilisation and in each accord to temperament and character there stir the life-instinct that be natural untame and in a sense -- savage iii so it come about that i stay with we island party put off my second explore trip from day to day and i think that this far-fetched instinct to watch sangree be really the cause of my postponement for another ten day the life of the camp pursue its even and delightful way bless by perfect summer weather a good harvest of fish fine wind for sailing and calm starry night maloney 's selfish prayer have be favourably receive nothing come to disturb or perplex there be not even the prowling of night animal to vex the rest of mr maloney for in previous camp it have often be she peculiar affliction that she hear the porcupine scratch against the canvas or the squirrel drop fir-cone in the early morning with a sound of miniature thunder upon the roof of she tent but on this island there be not even a squirrel or a mouse i think two toad and a small and harmless snake be the only living creature that have be discover during the whole of the first fortnight and these two toad in all probability be not two toad but one toad then suddenly come the terror that change the whole aspect of the place -- the devastating terror it come at first gently but from the very start it make I realize the unpleasant loneliness of we situation we remote isolation in this wilderness of sea and rock and how the island in this tideless baltic ocean lay about we like the advance guard of a vast besiege army its entry as i say be gentle hardly noticeable in fact to most of we : singularly undramatic it certainly be but then in actual life this be often the way the dreadful climax move upon we leave the heart undisturbed almost to the last minute and then overwhelming it with a sudden rush of horror for it be the custom at breakfast to listen patiently while each in turn related the trivial adventure of the night -- how they sleep whether the wind shake they tent whether the spider on the ridge pole have move whether they have hear the toad and so forth -- and on this particular morning joan in the middle of a little pause make a truly novel announcement : in the night i hear the howling of a dog she say and then flush up to the root of she hair when we burst out laugh for the idea of there be a dog on this forsake island that be only able to support a snake and two toad be distinctly ludicrous and i remember maloney half-way through he burnt porridge cap the announcement by declare that he have hear a baltic turtle in the lagoon and he wife 's expression of frantic alarm before the laughter undeceive she but the next morning joan repeat the story with additional and convincing detail sound of whine and growl wake I she say and i distinctly hear sniff under my tent and the scratch of paw oh timothy can it be a porcupine exclaim the bo ` sun 's mate with distress forget that sweden be not canada but the girl 's voice have sound to I in quite another key and look up i see that she father and sangree be stare at she hard they too understand that she be in earnest and have be strike by the serious note in she voice rubbish joan you be always dream something or other wild she father say a little impatiently there be not a animal of any size on the whole island add sangree with a puzzle expression he never take he eye from she face but there be nothing to prevent one swim over i put in briskly for somehow a sense of uneasiness that be not pleasant have weave itself into the talk and pause a deer for instance might easily land in the night and take a look round -- or a bear gasp the bo ` sun 's mate with a look so portentous that we all welcome the laugh but joan do not laugh instead she spring up and call to we to follow there she say point to the ground by she tent on the side farthest from she mother 's there be the mark close to my head you can see for yourselve we see plainly the moss and lichen -- for earth there be hardly any -- have be scratch up by paw a animal about the size of a large dog it must have be to judge by the mark we stand and stare in a row close to my head repeat the girl look round at we she face i notice be very pale and she lip seem to quiver for a instant then she give a sudden gulp -- and burst into a flood of tear the whole thing have come about in the brief space of a few minute and with a curious sense of inevitableness moreover as though it have all be carefully plan from all time and nothing could have stop it it have all be rehearse before -- have actually happen before as the strange feeling sometimes have it it seem like the opening movement in some ominous drama and that i know exactly what would happen next something of great moment be impend for this sinister sensation of come disaster make itself feel from the very begin and a atmosphere of gloom and dismay pervade the entire camp from that moment forward i draw sangree to one side and move away while maloney take the distressed girl into she tent and he wife follow they energetic and greatly fluster for thus in undramatic fashion it be that the terror i have speak of first attempt the invasion of we camp and trivial and unimportant though it seem every little detail of this opening scene be photograph upon my mind with merciless accuracy and precision it happen exactly as describe this be exactly the language use i see it write before I in black and white i see too the face of all concern with the sudden ugly signature of alarm where before have be peace the terror have stretch out so to speak a first tentative feeler toward we and have touch the heart of each with a horrid directness and from this moment the camp change sangree in particular be visibly upset he could not bear to see the girl distressed and to hear she actually cry be almost more than he could stand the feeling that he have no right to protect she hurt he keenly and i could see that he be itch to do something to help and like he for it he expression say plainly that he would tear in a thousand piece anything that dare to injure a hair of she head we light we pipe and stroll over in silence to the man 's quarter and it be he odd canadian expression gee whiz that draw my attention to a further discovery the brute 's be scratch round my tent too he cry as he point to similar mark by the door and i stoop down to examine they we both stare in amazement for several minute without speak only i sleep like the dead he add straighten up again and so hear nothing i suppose we trace the paw-mark from the mouth of he tent in a direct line across to the girl 's but nowhere else about the camp be there a sign of the strange visitor the deer dog or whatever it be that have twice favor we with a visit in the night have confine its attention to these two tent and after all there be really nothing out of the way about these visit of a unknown animal for although we own island be destitute of life we be in the heart of a wilderness and the mainland and larger island must be swarm with all kind of four-footed creature and no very prolonged swimming be necessary to reach we in any other country it would not have cause a moment 's interest -- interest of the kind we feel that be in we canadian camp the bear be for ever grunt about among the provision bag at night porcupine scratch unceasingly and chipmunk scuttle over everything my daughter be overtire and that be the truth of it explain maloney presently when he rejoin we and have examine in turn the other paw-mark she be be overdo it lately and camp-life you know always mean a great excitement to she it be natural enough if we take no notice she 'll be all right he pause to borrow my tobacco pouch and fill he pipe and the blunder way he fill it and spill the precious weed on the ground visibly belie the calm of he easy language you might take she out for a bit of fishing hubbard like a good chap she be hardly up to the long day in the cutter show she some of the other island in you canoe perhaps eh and by lunch-time the cloud have pass away as suddenly and as suspiciously as it have come but in the canoe on we way home have till then purposely ignore the subject uppermost in we mind she suddenly speak to I in a way that again touch the note of sinister alarm -- the note that keep on sound and sound until finally john silence come with he great vibrate presence and relieved it yes and even after he come too for a while i be ashamed to ask it she say abruptly as she steer I home she sleeve roll up she hair blow in the wind and ashamed of my silly tear too because i really can not make out what cause they but mr hubbard i want you to promise I not to go off for you long expedition -- just yet i beg it of you she be so in earnest that she forget the canoe and the wind catch it sideways and make we roll dangerously i have try hard not to ask this she add bring the canoe round again but i simply can not help myself it be a good deal to ask and i suppose my hesitation be plain for she go on before i could reply and she beseeching expression and intensity of manner impressed I very forcibly for another two week only -- mr sangree leave in a fortnight i say see at once what she be drive at but wonder if it be best to encourage she or not if i know you be to be on the island till then she say she face alternately pale and blushing and she voice tremble a little i should feel so much happier i look at she steadily wait for she to finish and safer she add almost in a whisper especially -- at night i mean safer joan i repeat think i have never see she eye so soft and tender she nod she head keep she gaze fix on my face it be really difficult to refuse whatever my thought and judgment may have be and somehow i understand that she speak with good reason though for the life of I i could not have put it into word happier -- and safer she say gravely the canoe give a dangerous lurch as she lean forward in she seat to catch my answer perhaps after all the wisest way be to grant she request and make light of it ease she anxiety without too much encourage its cause all right joan you queer creature i promise and the instant look of relief in she face and the smile that come back like sunlight to she eye make I feel that unknown to myself and the world i be capable of considerable sacrifice after all but you know there be nothing to be afraid of i add sharply and she look up in my face with the smile woman use when they know we be talk idly yet do not wish to tell we so _ you _ do not feel afraid i know she observe quietly of course not why should i so if you will just humor I this once i -- i will never ask anything foolish of you again as long as i live she say gratefully you have my promise be all i could find to say she head the nose of the canoe for the lagoon lie a quarter of a mile ahead and paddle swiftly but a minute or two later she pause again and stare hard at I with the drip paddle across the thwart you have not hear anything at night yourself have you she ask i never hear anything at night i reply shortly from the moment i lie down till the moment i get up that dismal howl for instance she go on determine to get it out far away at first and then get closer and stop just outside the camp certainly not because sometimes i think i almost dream it most likely you do be my unsympathetic response and you do not think father have hear it either then no he would have tell I if he have this seem to relieve she mind a little i know mother have not she add as if speak to herself for she hear nothing -- ever \* \* \* \* \* it be two night after this conversation that i wake out of deep sleep and hear sound of scream the voice be really horrible break the peace and silence with its shrill clamor in less than ten seconds i be half dress and out of my tent the scream have stop abruptly but i know the general direction and run as fast as the darkness would allow over to the woman 's quarter and on get close i hear sound of suppress weep it be joan 's voice and just as i come up i see mr maloney marvellously attire fumble with a lantern other voice become audible in the same moment behind I and timothy maloney arrive breathless less than half dress and carry another lantern that have go out on the way from be bang against a tree dawn be just break and a chill wind blow in from the sea heavy black cloud drive low overhead the scene of confusion may be better imagine than describe question in frightened voice fill the air against this background of suppress weep briefly -- joan 's silk tent have be tear and the girl be in a state border upon hysteric somewhat reassure by we noisy presence however -- for she be plucky at heart -- she pull herself together and try to explain what have happen and she broken word tell there on the edge of night and morning upon this wild island ridge be oddly thrilling and distressingly convincing something touch I and i wake she say simply but in a voice still hushed and break with the terror of it something push against the tent i feel it through the canvas there be the same sniff and scratch as before and i feel the tent give a little as when wind shake it i hear breathing -- very loud very heavy breathing -- and then come a sudden great tear blow and the canvas rip open close to my face she have instantly dash out through the open flap and scream at the top of she voice think the creature have actually get into the tent but nothing be visible she declare and she hear not the faintest sound of a animal make off under cover of the darkness the brief account seem to exercise a paralysing effect upon we all as we listen to it i can see the dishevelled group to this day the wind blow the woman 's hair and maloney crane he head forward to listen and he wife open-mouthed and gasping lean against a pine tree come over to the stockade and we 'll get the fire go i say that be the first thing for we be all shake with the cold in we scanty garment and at that moment sangree arrive wrap in a blanket and carry he gun he be still drunken with sleep the dog again maloney explain briefly forestall he question be at joan 's tent tear it by gad this time it be time we do something he go on mumble confusedly to himself sangree grip he gun and look about swiftly in the darkness i see he eye aflame in the glare of the flicker lantern he make a movement as though to start out and hunt -- and kill then he glance fall on the girl crouch on the ground she face hide in she hand and there leap into he feature a expression of savage anger that transform they he could have face a dozen lion with a walk stick at that moment and again i like he for the strength of he anger he self-control and he hopeless devotion but i stop he go off on a blind and useless chase come and help I start the fire sangree i say anxious also to relieve the girl of we presence and a few minute later the ash still grow from the night 's fire have kindle the fresh wood and there be a blaze that warm we well while it also light up the surround tree within a radius of twenty yard i hear nothing he whisper what in the world do you think it be it surely can not be only a dog we 'll find that out later i say as the other come up to the grateful warmth the first thing be to make as big a fire as we can joan be calmer now and she mother have put on some warmer and less miraculous garment and while they stand talk in low voice maloney and i slip off to examine the tent there be little enough to see but that little be unmistakable some animal have scratch up the ground at the head of the tent and with a great blow of a powerful paw -- a paw clearly provide with good claw -- have strike the silk and tear it open there be a hole large enough to pass a fist and arm through it can not be far away maloney say excitedly we 'll organise a hunt at once this very minute we hurry back to the fire maloney talk boisterously about he proposed hunt there be nothing like prompt action to dispel alarm he whisper in my ear and then turn to the rest of we we 'll hunt the island from end to end at once he say with excitement that be what we 'll do the beast can not be far away and the bo ` sun 's mate and joan must come too because they can not be leave alone hubbard you take the right shore and you sangree the left and i 'll go in the middle with the woman in this way we can stretch clean across the ridge and nothing bigger than a rabbit can possibly escape we he be extraordinarily excited i think anything affect joan of course stir he prodigiously get you gun and we 'll start the drive at once he cry he light another lantern and hand one each to he wife and joan and while i run to fetch my gun i hear he singing to himself with the excitement of it all meanwhile the dawn have come on quickly it make the flickering lantern look pale the wind too be rise and i hear the tree moan overhead and the wave break with increase clamor on the shore in the lagoon the boat dip and splash and the spark from the fire be carry aloft in a stream and scatter far and wide we make we way to the extreme end of the island measure we distance carefully and then begin to advance none of we speak sangree and i with cock gun watch the shore line and all within easy touch and speak distance it be a slow and blunder drive and there be many false alarm but after the best part of half a hour we stand on the farther end have make the complete tour and without put up so much as a squirrel certainly there be no living creature on that island but ourselves i know what it be cry maloney look out over the dim expanse of gray sea and speak with the air of a man make a discovery it be a dog from one of the farm on the larger island -- he point seaward where the archipelago thicken -- and it be escape and turn wild we fire and voice attract it and it be probably half starve as well as savage poor brute no one say anything in reply and he begin to sing again very low to himself the point where we stand -- a huddle shiver group -- face the wider channel that lead to the open sea and finland the gray dawn have break in earnest at last and we could see the racing wave with they angry crest of white the surround island show up as dark mass in the distance and in the east almost as maloney speak the sun come up with a rush in a stormy and magnificent sky of red and gold against this splash and gorgeous background black cloud shape like fantastic and legendary animal file past swiftly in a tear stream and to this day i have only to close my eye to see again that vivid and hurrying procession in the air all about we the pine make black splash against the sky it be a angry sunrise rain indeed have already begin to fall in big drop we turn as by a common instinct and without speech make we way back slowly to the stockade maloney hum snatch of he song sangree in front with he gun prepare to shoot at a moment 's notice and the woman flounder in the rear with myself and the extinguish lantern yet it be only a dog really it be most singular when one come to reflect soberly upon it all event say the occultist have soul or at least that agglomerate life due to the emotion and thought of all concern in they so that city and even whole country have great astral shape which may become visible to the eye of vision and certainly here the soul of this drive -- this vain blundering futile drive -- stand somewhere between ourselves and -- laugh all of we hear that laugh and all of we try hard to smother the sound or at least to ignore it every one talk at once loudly and with exaggerated decision obviously try to say something plausible against heavy odds strive to explain naturally that a animal might so easily conceal itself from we or swim away before we have time to light upon its trail for we all speak of that trail as though it really exist and we have more to go upon than the mere mark of paw about the tent of joan and the canadian indeed but for these and the tear tent i think it would of course have be possible to ignore the existence of this beast intruder altogether and it be here under this angry dawn as we stand in the shelter of the stockade from the pour rain weary yet so strangely excite -- it be here out of this confusion of voice and explanation that -- very stealthily -- the ghost of something horrible slip in and stand among we it make all we explanation seem childish and untrue the false relation be instantly expose eye exchange quick anxious glance question expressive of dismay there be a sense of wonder of poignant distress and of trepidation alarm stand wait at we elbow we shiver then suddenly as we look into each other 's face come the long unwelcome pause in which this new arrival establish itself in we heart and without further speech or attempt at explanation maloney move off abruptly to mix the porridge for a early breakfast sangree to clean the fish myself to chop wood and tend the fire joan and she mother to change they wet garment and most significant of all to prepare she mother 's tent for its future complement of two each go to he duty but hurriedly awkwardly silently and this new arrival this shape of terror and distress stalk viewless by the side of each if only i could have trace that dog i think be the think in the mind of all but in camp where every one realize how important the individual contribution be to the comfort and well-being of all the mind speedily recover tone and pull itself together during the day a day of heavy and ceaseless rain we keep more or less to we tent and though there be sign of mysterious conference between the three member of the maloney family i think that most of we sleep a good deal and stay alone with he thought certainly i do because when maloney come to say that he wife invite we all to a special tea in she tent he have to shake I awake before i realize that he be there at all and by supper-time we be more or less even-minded again and almost jolly i only notice that there be a undercurrent of what be best describe as jumpiness and that the merest snap of a twig or plop of a fish in the lagoon be sufficient to make we start and look over we shoulder pause be rare in we talk and the fire be never for one instant allow to get low the wind and rain have cease but the drip of the branch still keep up a excellent imitation of a downpour in particular maloney be vigilant and alert tell we a series of tale in which the wholesome humorous element be especially strong he linger too behind with I after sangree have go to bed and while i mixed myself a glass of hot swedish punch he do a thing i have never know he do before -- he mix one for himself and then ask I to light he over to he tent we say nothing on the way but i feel that he be glad of my companionship i return alone to the stockade and for a long time after that keep the fire blaze and sit up smoking and think i hardly know why but sleep be far from I for one thing and for another a idea be take form in my mind that require the comfort of tobacco and a bright fire for its growth i lay against a corner of the stockade seat listen to the wind whispering and to the ceaseless drip-drip of the tree the night otherwise be very still and the sea quiet as a lake i remember that i be conscious peculiarly conscious of this host of desolate island crowd about we in the darkness and that we be the one little spot of humanity in a rather wonderful kind of wilderness but this i think be the only symptom that come to warn I of highly strung nerve and it certainly be not sufficiently alarming to destroy my peace of mind one thing however do come to disturb my peace for just as i finally make ready to go and have kick the ember of the fire into a last effort i fancied i saw peer at I round the farther end of the stockade wall a dark and shadowy mass that might have be -- that strongly resemble in fact -- the body of a large animal two glowing eye shine for a instant in the middle of it but the next second i see that it be merely a project mass of moss and lichen in the wall of we stockade and the eye be a couple of wander spark from the die ash i have kick it be easy enough too to imagine i see a animal move here and there between the tree as i pick my way stealthily to my tent of course the shadow trick I and though it be after one o'clock maloney 's light be still burn for i see he tent shine white among the pine it be however in the short space between consciousness and sleep -- that time when the body be low and the voice of the submerge region tell sometimes true -- that the idea which have be all this while mature reach the point of a actual decision and i suddenly realize that i have resolve to send word to dr silence for with a sudden wonder that i have hitherto be so blind the unwelcome conviction dawn upon I all at once that some dreadful thing be lurk about we on this island and that the safety of at least one of we be threaten by something monstrous and unclean that be too horrible to contemplate and again remember those last word of he as the train move out of the platform i understand that dr silence would hold himself in readiness to come unless you should send for I sooner he have say \* \* \* \* \* i find myself suddenly wide awake it be impossible to say what wake I but it be no gradual process see that i jump from deep sleep to absolute alertness in a single instant i have evidently sleep for a hour and more for the night have clear star crowd the sky and a pallid half-moon just sink into the sea throw a spectral light between the tree i go outside to sniff the air and stand upright a curious impression that something be astir in the camp come over I and when i glance across at sangree 's tent some twenty foot away i see that it be move he too then be awake and restless for i see the canvas side bulge this way and that as he move within the flap push forward he be come out like myself to sniff the air and i be not surprise for its sweetness after the rain be intoxicating and he come on all fours just as i have do i see a head thrust round the edge of the tent and then i see that it be not sangree at all it be a animal and the same instant i realize something else too -- it be _ the _ animal and its whole presentment for some unaccountable reason be unutterably malefic a cry i be quite unable to suppress escape I and the creature turn on the instant and stare at I with baleful eye i could have drop on the spot for the strength all run out of my body with a rush something about it touch in I the living terror that grip and paralysis if the mind require but the tenth of a second to form a impression i must have stand there stockstill for several seconds while i seize the rope for support and stare many and vivid impression flash through my mind but not one of they result in action because i be in instant dread that the beast any moment would leap in my direction and be upon I instead however after what seem a vast period it slowly turn its eye from my face utter a low whining sound and come out altogether into the open then for the first time i see it in its entirety and note two thing : it be about the size of a large dog but at the same time it be utterly unlike any animal that i have ever see also that the quality that have impressed I first as be malefic be really only its singular and original strangeness foolish as it may sound and impossible as it be for I to adduce proof i can only say that the animal seem to I then to be -- not real but all this pass through my mind in a flash almost subconsciously and before i have time to check my impression or even properly verify they i make a involuntary movement catch the tight rope in my hand so that it twang like a banjo string and in that instant the creature turn the corner of sangree 's tent and be go into the darkness then of course my sens in some measure return to I and i realize only one thing : it have be inside he tent i dash out reach the door in half a dozen stride and look in the canadian thank god lay upon he bed of branch he arm be stretch outside across the blanket the fist tightly clench and the body have a appearance of unusual rigidity that be alarming on he face there be a expression of effort almost of painful effort so far as the uncertain light permit I to see and he sleep seem to be very profound he look i think so stiff so unnaturally stiff and in some indefinable way too he look smaller -- shrunken i call to he to wake but call many time in vain then i decide to shake he and have already move forward to do so vigorously when there come a sound of footstep pad softly behind I and i feel a stream of hot breath burn my neck as i stooped i turn sharply the tent door be darken and something silently sweep in i feel a rough and shaggy body push past I and know that the animal have return it seem to leap forward between I and sangree -- in fact to leap upon sangree for its dark body hide he momentarily from view and in that moment my soul turn sick and coward with a horror that rise from the very dregs and depths of life and grip my existence at its central source the creature seem somehow to melt away into he almost as though it belong to he and be a part of himself but in the same instant -- that instant of extraordinary confusion and terror in my mind -- it seem to pass over and behind he and in some utterly unaccountable fashion it be go and the canadian wake and sit up with a start quick you fool i cry in my excitement the beast have be in you tent here at you very throat while you sleep like the dead up man get you gun only this second it disappear over there behind you head quick or joan -- and somehow the fact that he be there wide-awake now to corroborate I bring the additional conviction to my own mind that this be no animal but some perplexing and dreadful form of life that draw upon my deeper knowledge that much reading have perhaps assent to but that have never yet come within actual range of my sens he be up in a flash and out he be tremble and very white we search hurriedly feverishly but find only the trace of paw-mark pass from the door of he own tent across the moss to the woman 's and the sight of the track about mr maloney 's tent where joan now sleep set he in a perfect fury do you know what it be hubbard this beast he hiss under he breath at I it be a damned wolf that be what it be -- a wolf lose among the island and starve to death -- desperate so help I god i believe it be that he talk a lot of rubbish in he excitement he declare he would sleep by day and sit up every night until he kill it again he rage touch my admiration but i get he away before he make enough noise to wake the whole camp i have a better plan than that i say watch he face closely i do not think this be anything we can deal with i be go to send for the only man i know who can help we 'll go to waxholm this very morning and get a telegram through sangree stare at I with a curious expression as the fury die out of he face and a new look of alarm take its place john silence i say will know -- you think it be something -- of that sort he stammer i be sure of it there be a moment 's pause that be worse far worse than anything material he say turn visibly paler he look from my face to the sky and then add with sudden resolution come the wind 's rise let 's get off at once from there you can telephone to stockholm and get a telegram send without delay i send he down to get the boat ready and seize the opportunity myself to run and wake maloney he be sleep very lightly and spring up the moment i put my head inside he tent i tell he briefly what i have see and he show so little surprise that i catch myself wonder for the first time whether he himself have see more go on than he have deem wise to communicate to the rest of we he agree to my plan without a moment 's hesitation and my last word to he be to let he wife and daughter think that the great psychic doctor be come merely as a chance visitor and not with any professional interest so with frying-pan provision and blanket aboard sangree and i sail out of the lagoon fifteen minute later and head with a good breeze for the direction of waxholm and the border of civilisation iv although nothing john silence do ever take I properly speak by surprise it be certainly unexpected to find a letter from stockholm wait for I i have finish my hungary business he write and be here for ten day do not hesitate to send if you need I if you telephone any morning from waxholm i can catch the afternoon steamer my year of intercourse with he be full of coincidence of this description and although he never seek to explain they by claim any magical system of communication with my mind i have never doubt that there actually exist some secret telepathic method by which he know my circumstance and gauge the degree of my need and that this power be independent of time in the sense that it see into the future always seem to I equally apparent sangree be as much relieved as i be and within a hour of sunset that very evening we meet he on the arrival of the little coast steamer and carry he off in the dinghy to the camp we have prepare on a neighbouring island mean to start for home early next morning now he say when supper be over and we be smoke round the fire let I hear you story he glance from one to the other smile you tell it mr hubbard sangree interrupted abruptly and go off a little way to wash the dish yet not so far as to be out of earshot and while he splash with the hot water and scrape the tin plate with sand and moss my voice unbroken by a single question from dr silence run on for the next half-hour with the best account i could give of what have happen my listener lay on the other side of the fire he face half hide by a big sombrero sometimes he glance up questioningly when a point need elaboration but he utter no single word till i have reach the end and he manner all through the recital be grave and attentive overhead the wash of the wind in the pine branch fill in the pause the darkness settle down over the sea and the star come out in thousand and by the time i finish the moon have rise to flood the scene with silver yet by he face and eye i know quite well that the doctor be listen to something he have expect to hear even if he have not actually anticipate all the detail you do well to send for I he say very low with a significant glance at I when i finish very well -- and for one swift second he eye take in sangree -- for what we have to deal with here be nothing more than a werewolf -- rare enough i be glad to say but often very sad and sometimes very terrible i jump as though i have be shoot but the next second be heartily ashamed of my want of control for this brief remark confirm as it do my own worst suspicion do more to convince I of the gravity of the adventure than any number of question or explanation it seem to draw close the circle about we shut a door somewhere that lock we in with the animal and the horror and turn the key whatever it be have now to be face and deal with no one have be actually injure so far he ask aloud but in a matter-of-fact tone that lend reality to grim possibility good heaven no cry the canadian throw down he dishcloth and come forward into the circle of firelight surely there can be no question of this poor starve beast injure anybody can there he hair straggle untidily over he forehead and there be a gleam in he eye that be not all reflection from the fire he word make I turn sharply we all laugh a little short forced laugh i trust not indeed dr silence say quietly but what make you think the creature be starve he ask the question with he eye straight on the other 's face the prompt question explain to I why i have start and i wait with just a tremor of excitement for the reply sangree hesitate a moment as though the question take he by surprise but he meet the doctor 's gaze unflinchingly across the fire and with complete honesty really he falter with a little shrug of the shoulder i can hardly tell you the phrase seem to come out of its own accord i have feel from the beginning that it be in pain and -- starve though why i feel this never occur to I till you ask you really know very little about it then say the other with a sudden gentleness in he voice no more than that sangree reply look at he with a puzzle expression that be unmistakably genuine in fact nothing at all really he add by way of further explanation i be glad of that i hear the doctor murmur under he breath but so low that i only just catch the word and sangree miss they altogether as evidently he be mean to do and now he cry get on he foot and shake himself with a characteristic gesture as though to shake out the horror and the mystery let we leave the problem till to-morrow and enjoy this wind and sea and star i have be live lately in the atmosphere of many people and feel that i want to wash and be clean i propose a swim and then bed who 'll second I and two minute later we be all diving from the boat into cool deep water that reflect a thousand moon as the wave break away from we in countless ripple we sleep in blanket under the open sky sangree and i take the outside place and be up before sunrise to catch the dawn wind help by this early start we be half-way home by noon and then the wind shift to a few point behind we so that we fairly run in and out among a thousand island down narrow channel where we lose the wind out into open space where we have to take in a reef racing along under a hot and cloudless sky we fly through the very heart of the bewildering and lonely scenery a real wilderness cry dr silence from he seat in the bow where he hold the jib sheet he hat be off he hair tumble in the wind and he lean brown face give he the touch of a oriental presently he change place with sangree and come down to talk with I by the tiller a wonderful region all this world of island he say wave he hand to the scenery rush past we but do not it strike you there be something lack it be -- hard i answer after a moment 's reflection it have a superficial glittering prettiness without -- i hesitate to find the word i want john silence nod he head with approval exactly he say the picturesqueness of stage scenery that be not real not alive it be like a landscape by a clever painter yet without true imagination soulless -- that be the word you want something like that i answer watch the gust of wind on the sail not dead so much as without soul that be it of course he go on in a voice calculate it seem to I not to reach we companion in the bow to live long in a place like this -- long and alone -- might bring about a strange result in some man i suddenly realize he be talk with a purpose and prick up my ear there be no life here these island be mere dead rock push up from below the sea -- not live land and there be nothing really alive on they even the sea this tideless brackish sea neither salt water nor fresh be dead it be all a pretty image of life without the real heart and soul of life to a man with too strong desire who come here and live close to nature strange thing might happen let she out a bit i shout to sangree who be come aft the wind 's gusty and we have get hardly any ballast he go back to the bow and dr silence continue -- here i mean a long sojourn would lead to deterioration to degeneration the place be utterly unsoftened by human influence by any humanise association of history good or bad this landscape have never awaken into life it be still dream in its primitive sleep in time i put in you mean a man living here might become brutal the passion would run wild selfishness become supreme the instinct coarsen and turn savage probably but -- in other place just as wild part of italy for instance where there be other moderate influence it could not happen the character might grow wild savage too in a sense but with a human wildness one could understand and deal with but here in a hard place like this it might be otherwise he speak slowly weigh he word carefully i look at he with many question in my eye and a precautionary cry to sangree to stay in the fore part of the boat out of earshot first of all there would come callousness to pain and indifference to the rights of other then the soul would turn savage not from passionate human cause or with enthusiasm but by deaden down into a kind of cold primitive emotionless savagery -- by turn like the landscape soulless and a man with strong desire you say might change without be aware of it yes he might turn savage he instinct and desire turn animal and if -- he lower he voice and turn for a moment towards the bow and then continue in he most weighty manner -- owe to delicate health or other predispose cause he double -- you know what i mean of course -- he etheric body of desire or astral body as some term it -- that part in which the emotion passion and desire reside -- if this i say be for some constitutional reason loosely join to he physical organism there might well take place a occasional projection -- sangree come aft with a sudden rush he face aflame but whether with wind or sun or with what he have hear i can not say in my surprise i let the tiller slip and the cutter give a great plunge as she come sharply into the wind and fling we all together in a heap on the bottom sangree say nothing but while he scramble up and make the jib sheet fast my companion find a moment to add to he unfinished sentence the word too low for any ear but mine -- entirely unknown to himself however we right the boat and laugh and then sangree produce the map and explain exactly where we be far away on the horizon across a open stretch of water lay a blue cluster of island with we crescent-shaped home among they and the safe anchorage of the lagoon a hour with this wind would get we there comfortably and while dr silence and sangree fall into conversation i sit and ponder over the strange suggestion that have just be put into my mind concern the double and the possible form it might assume when dissociate temporarily from the physical body the whole way home these two chat and john silence be as gentle and sympathetic as a woman i do not hear much of they talk for the wind grow occasionally to the force of a hurricane and the sail and tiller absorb my attention but i could see that sangree be pleased and happy and be pour out intimate revelation to he companion in the way that most people do -- when john silence wish they to do so but it be quite suddenly while i sit all intent upon wind and sail that the true meaning of sangree 's remark about the animal flare up in I with its full import for he admission that he know it be in pain and starve be in reality nothing more or less than a revelation of he deeper self it be in the nature of a confession he be speak of something that he know positively something that be beyond question or argument something that have to do directly with himself poor starve beast he have call it in word that have come out of they own accord and there have not be the slightest evidence of any desire to conceal or explain away he have speak instinctively -- from he heart and as though about he own self and half a hour before sunset we race through the narrow opening of the lagoon and see the smoke of the dinner-fire blowing here and there among the tree and the figure of joan and the bo ` sun 's mate run down to meet we at the landing-stage v everything change from the moment john silence set foot on that island it be like the effect produce by call in some big doctor some great arbiter of life and death for consultation the sense of gravity increase a hundredfold even inanimate object take upon themselves a subtle alteration for the setting of the adventure -- this desert bit of sea with its hundred of uninhabited island -- somehow turn sombre a element that be mysterious and in a sense disheartening creep unbidden into the severity of gray rock and dark pine forest and take the sparkle from the sunshine and the sea i at least be keenly aware of the change for my whole be shift as it be a degree higher become key up and alert the figure from the background of the stage move forward a little into the light -- nearer to the inevitable action in a word this man 's arrival intensify the whole affair and look back down the year to the time when all this happen it be clear to I that he have a pretty sharp idea of the meaning of it from the very begin how much he know beforehand by he strange divine power it be impossible to say but from the moment he come upon the scene and catch within himself the note of what be go on amongst we he undoubtedly hold the true solution of the puzzle and have no need to ask question and this certitude it be that set he in such a atmosphere of power and make we all look to he instinctively for he take no tentative step make no false move and while the rest of we flounder he move straight to the climax he be indeed a true diviner of soul i can now read into he behavior a good deal that puzzle I at the time for though i have dimly guess the solution i have no idea how he would deal with it and the conversation i can reproduce almost verbatim for accord to my invariable habit i keep full note of all he say to mr maloney foolish and daze to joan alarmed yet plucky and to the clergyman move by he daughter 's distress below he usual shallow emotion he give the best possible treatment in the best possible way yet all so easily and simply as to make it appear naturally spontaneous for he dominate the bo ` sun 's mate take the measure of she ignorance with infinite patience he key up joan stir she courage and interest to the highest point for she own safety and the reverend timothy he soothe and comfort while obtain he implicit obedience by take he into he confidence and lead he gradually to a comprehension of the issue that be bind to follow and sangree -- here he wisdom be most wisely calculate -- he neglect outwardly because inwardly he be the object of he unceasing and most concentrated attention under the guise of apparent indifference he mind keep the canadian under constant observation there be a restless feeling in the camp that evening and none of we linger round the fire after supper as usual sangree and i busied ourselves with patch up the tear tent for we guest and with find heavy stone to hold the rope for dr silence insist on have it pitch on the highest point of the island ridge just where it be most rocky and there be no earth for peg the place moreover be midway between the man 's and woman 's tent and of course command the most comprehensive view of the camp so that if you dog come he say simply i may be able to catch he as he pass across the wind have go down with the sun and a unusual warmth lay over the island that make sleep heavy and in the morning we assemble at a late breakfast rub we eye and yawn the cool north wind have give way to the warm southern air that sometimes come up with haze and moisture across the baltic bring with it the relaxing sensation that produce enervation and listlessness and this may have be the reason why at first i fail to notice that anything unusual be about and why i be less alert than normally for it be not till after breakfast that the silence of we little party strike I and i discover that joan have not yet put in a appearance and then in a flash the last heaviness of sleep vanish and i see that maloney be white and troubled and he wife could not hold a plate without tremble a desire to ask question be stop in I by a swift glance from dr silence and i suddenly understand in some vague way that they be wait till sangree should have go how this idea come to I i can not determine but the soundness of the intuition be soon prove for the moment he move off to he tent maloney look up at I and begin to speak in a low voice you sleep through it all he half whisper through what i ask suddenly thrill with the knowledge that something dreadful have happen we do not wake you for fear of get the whole camp up he go on meaning by the camp i suppose sangree it be just before dawn when the scream wake I the dog again i ask with a curious sinking of the heart get right into the tent he go on speak passionately but very low and wake my wife by scramble all over she then she realize that joan be struggle beside she and by god the beast have tear she arm scratch all down the arm she be and bleed joan injured i gasp merely scratch -- this time put in john silence speak for the first time suffer more from shock and fright than actual wound be not it a mercy the doctor be here say mr maloney look as if she would never know calmness again i think we should both have be kill it have be a most merciful escape maloney say he pulpit voice struggle with he emotion but of course we can not risk another -- we must strike camp and get away at once -- only poor mr sangree must not know what have happen he be so attach to joan and would be so terribly upset add the bo ` sun 's mate distractedly look all about in she terror it be perhaps advisable that mr sangree should not know what have occur dr silence say with quiet authority but i think for the safety of all concerned it will be better not to leave the island just now he speak with great decision and maloney look up and follow he word closely if you will agree to stay here a few day longer i have no doubt we can put a end to the attention of you strange visitor and incidentally have the opportunity of observe a most singular and interesting phenomenon -- what gasp mr maloney a phenomenon -- you mean that you know what it be i be quite certain i know what it be he reply very low for we hear the footstep of sangree approach though i be not so certain yet as to the best means of deal with it but in any case it be not wise to leave precipitately -- oh timothy do he think it be a devil -- cry the bo ` sun 's mate in a voice that even the canadian must have hear in my opinion continue john silence look across at I and the clergyman it be a case of modern lycanthropy with other complication that may -- he leave the sentence unfinished for mr maloney get up with a jump and flee to she tent fearful she might hear a worse thing and at that moment sangree turn the corner of the stockade and come into view there be footmark all round the mouth of my tent he say with excitement the animal have be here again in the night dr silence you really must come and see they for yourself they be as plain on the moss as track in snow but later in the day while sangree go off in the canoe to fish the pool near the larger island and joan still lay bandage and rest in she tent dr silence call I and the tutor and propose a walk to the granite slab at the far end mr maloney sit on a stump near she daughter and busy herself energetically with alternate nursing and painting we 'll leave you in charge the doctor say with a smile that be mean to be encouraging and when you want we for lunch or anything the megaphone will always bring we back in time for though the very air be charge with strange emotion every one talk quietly and naturally as with a definite desire to counteract unnecessary excitement i 'll keep watch say the plucky bo ` sun 's mate and meanwhile i find comfort in my work she be busy with the sketch she have begin on the day after we arrival for even a tree she add proudly point to she little easel be a symbol of the divine and the thought make I feel safer we glance for a moment at a daub which be more like the symptom of a disease than a symbol of the divine -- and then take the path round the lagoon at the far end we make a little fire and lay round it in the shadow of a big boulder maloney stop he humming suddenly and turn to he companion and what do you make of it all he ask abruptly in the first place reply john silence make himself comfortable against the rock it be of human origin this animal it be undoubted lycanthropy he word have the effect precisely of a bombshell maloney listen as though he have be strike you puzzle I utterly he say sit up closer and stare at he perhaps reply the other but if you 'll listen to I for a few moment you may be less puzzle at the end -- or more it depend how much you know let I go further and say that you have underestimate or miscalculate the effect of this primitive wild life upon all of you in what way ask the clergyman bristle a trifle it be strong medicine for any town-dweller and for some of you it have be too strong one of you have go wild he utter these last word with great emphasis go savage he add look from one to the other neither of we find anything to reply to say that the brute have awaken in a man be not a mere metaphor always he go on presently of course not but in the sense i mean may have a very literal and terrible significance pursue dr silence ancient instinct that no one dream of least of all they possessor may leap forth -- atavism can hardly explain a roaming animal with tooth and claw and sanguinary instinct interrupted maloney with impatience the term be of you own choice continue the doctor equably not mine and it be a good example of a word that indicate a result while it conceal the process but the explanation of this beast that haunt you island and attack you daughter be of far deeper significance than mere atavistic tendency or throw back to animal origin which i suppose be the thought in you mind you speak just now of lycanthropy say maloney look bewildered and anxious to keep to plain fact evidently i think i have come across the word but really -- really -- it can have no actual significance to-day can it these superstition of mediaeval time can hardly -- he look round at I with he jolly red face and the expression of astonishment and dismay on it would have make I shout with laughter at any other time laughter however be never farther from my mind than at this moment when i listen to dr silence as he carefully suggest to the clergyman the very explanation that have gradually be force itself upon my own mind however mediaeval idea may have exaggerate the idea be not of much importance to we now he say quietly when we be face to face with a modern example of what i take it have always be a profound fact for the moment let we leave the name of any one in particular out of the matter and consider certain possibility we all agree with that at any rate there be no need to speak of sangree or of any one else until we know a little more the fundamental fact in this most curious case he go on be that the ` double ' of a man -- you mean the astral body i have hear of that of course break in maloney with a snort of triumph no doubt say the other smile no doubt you have -- that this double or fluidic body of a man as i be say have the power under certain condition of project itself and become visible to other certain training will accomplish this and certain drug likewise illness too that ravage the body may produce temporarily the result that death produce permanently and let loose this counterpart of a human being and render it visible to the sight of other every one of course know this more or less to-day but it be not so generally know and probably believe by none who have not witness it that this fluidic body can under certain condition assume other form than human and that such other form may be determine by the dominate thought and wish of the owner for this double or astral body as you call it be really the seat of the passion emotion and desire in the psychical economy it be the passion body and in project itself it can often assume a form that give expression to the overmastering desire that mould it for it be compose of such tenuous matter that it lend itself readily to the moulding by thought and wish i follow you perfectly say maloney look as if he would much rather be chop firewood elsewhere and singing and there be some person so constitute the doctor go on with increase seriousness that the fluid body in they be but loosely associate with the physical person of poor health as a rule yet often of strong desire and passion and in these person it be easy for the double to dissociate itself during deep sleep from they system and drive forth by some consuming desire to assume a animal form and seek the fulfilment of that desire there in broad daylight i see maloney deliberately creep closer to the fire and heap the wood on we gather in to the heat and to each other and listen to dr silence 's voice as it mingle with the swish and whirr of the wind about we and the fall of the little wave for instance to take a concrete example he resume suppose some young man with the delicate constitution i have speak of form a overpowering attachment to a young woman yet perceive that it be not welcome and be man enough to repress its outward manifestation in such a case suppose he double be easily project the very repression of he love in the daytime would add to the intense force of he desire when release in deep sleep from the control of he will and he fluidic body might issue forth in monstrous or animal shape and become actually visible to other and if he devotion be dog-like in its fidelity yet conceal the fire of a fierce passion beneath it might well assume the form of a creature that seem to be half dog half wolf -- a werewolf you mean cry maloney pale to the lip as he listen john silence hold up a restrain hand a werewolf he say be a true psychical fact of profound significance however absurdly it may have be exaggerate by the imagination of a superstitious peasantry in the day of unenlightenment for a werewolf be nothing but the savage and possibly sanguinary instinct of a passionate man scour the world in he fluidic body he passion body he body of desire as in the case at hand he may not know it -- it be not necessarily deliberate then maloney put in quickly with relief -- it be hardly ever deliberate it be the desire release in sleep from the control of the will find a vent in all savage race it have be recognize and dread this phenomenon style ` wehr wolf ' but to-day it be rare and it be become rarer still for the world grow tame and civilised emotion have become refined desire lukewarm and few man have savagery enough leave in they to generate impulse of such intense force and certainly not to project they in animal form by gad exclaim the clergyman breathlessly and with increase excitement then i feel i must tell you -- what have be give to I in confidence -- that sangree have in he a admixture of savage blood -- of red indian ancestry -- let we stick to we supposition of a man as describe the doctor stop he calmly and let we imagine that he have in he this admixture of savage blood and further that he be wholly unaware of he dreadful physical and psychical infirmity and that he suddenly find himself lead the primitive life together with the object of he desire with the result that the strain of the untame wild-man in he blood -- red indian for instance from maloney red indian perfectly agree the doctor the result i say that this savage strain in he be awaken and leap into passionate life what then he look hard at timothy maloney and the clergyman look hard at he the wild life such as you lead here on this island for instance might quickly awaken he savage instinct -- he bury instinct -- and with profoundly disquieting result you mean he subtle body as you call it might issue forth automatically in deep sleep and seek the object of its desire i say come to maloney 's aid who be find it more and more difficult to get word precisely -- yet the desire of the man remain utterly unmalefic -- pure and wholesome in every sense -- ah i hear the clergyman gasp the lover 's desire for union run wild run savage tear its way out in primitive untame fashion i mean continue the doctor strive to make himself clear to a mind bound by conventional thought and knowledge for the desire to possess remember may easily become importunate and embody in this animal form of the subtle body which act as its vehicle may go forth to tear in piece all that obstruct to reach to the very heart of the loved object and seize it _ au fond _ it be nothing more than the aspiration for union as i say -- the splendid and perfectly clean desire to absorb utterly into itself -- he pause a moment and look into maloney 's eye to bathe in the very heart 's blood of the one desire he add with grave emphasis the fire spurt and crackle and make I start but maloney find relief in a genuine shudder and i see he turn he head and look about he from the sea to the tree the wind drop just at that moment and the doctor 's word ring sharply through the stillness then it might even kill stammer the clergyman presently in a hushed voice and with a little forced laugh by way of protest that sound quite ghastly in the last resort it might kill repeat dr silence then after another pause during which he be clearly debate how much or how little it be wise to give to he audience he continue : and if the double do not succeed in get back to its physical body that physical body would wake a imbecile -- a idiot -- or perhaps never wake at all maloney sit up and find he tongue you mean that if this fluid animal thing or whatever it be should be prevent get back the man might never wake again he ask with shake voice he might be dead reply the other calmly the tremor of a positive sensation shiver in the air about we then be not that the best way to cure the fool -- the brute -- thunder the clergyman half rise to he foot certainly it would be a easy and undiscoverable form of murder be the stern reply speak as calmly as though it be a remark about the weather maloney collapse visibly and i gather the wood over the fire and coax up a blaze the greater part of the man 's life -- of he vital force -- go out with this double dr silence resume after a moment 's consideration and a considerable portion of the actual material of he physical body so the physical body that remain behind be deplete not only of force but of matter you would see it small shrunken drop together just like the body of a materialise medium at a seance moreover any mark or injury inflict upon this double will be find exactly reproduce by the phenomenon of repercussion upon the shrunken physical body lie in its trance -- a injury inflict upon the one you say would be reproduce also on the other repeat maloney he excitement grow again undoubtedly reply the other quietly for there exist all the time a continuous connection between the physical body and the double -- a connection of matter though of exceedingly attenuate possibly of etheric matter the wound _ travel _ so to speak from one to the other and if this connection be break the result would be death death repeat maloney to himself death he look anxiously at we face he thought evidently begin to clear and this solidity he ask presently after a general pause this tear of tent and flesh this howling and the mark of paw you mean that the double -- have sufficient material draw from the deplete body to produce physical result certainly the doctor take he up although to explain at this moment such problem as the passage of matter through matter would be as difficult as to explain how the thought of a mother can actually break the bone of the child unborn dr silence point out to sea and maloney look wildly about he turn with a violent start i see a canoe with sangree in the stern-seat slowly come into view round the farther point he hat be off and he tan face for the first time appear to I -- to we all i think -- as though it be the face of some one else he look like a wild man then he stand up in the canoe to make a cast with the rod and he look for all the world like a indian i recall the expression of he face as i have see it once or twice notably on that occasion of the evening prayer and a involuntary shudder run down my spine at that very instant he turn and see we where we lay and he face break into a smile so that he tooth show white in the sun he look in he element and exceedingly attractive he call out something about he fish and soon after pass out of sight into the lagoon for a time none of we say a word and the cure venture maloney at length be not to quench this savage force reply dr silence but to steer it better and to provide other outlet this be the solution of all these problem of accumulate force for this force be the raw material of usefulness and should be increase and cherish not by separate it from the body by death but by raise it to higher channel the best and quickest cure of all he go on speak very gently and with a hand upon the clergyman 's arm be to lead it towards its object provide that object be not unalterably hostile -- to let it find rest where -- he stop abruptly and the eye of the two man meet in a single glance of comprehension joan maloney exclaim under he breath joan reply john silence \* \* \* \* \* we all go to bed early the day have be unusually warm and after sunset a curious hush descend on the island nothing be audible but that faint ghostly singing which be inseparable from a pinewood even on the stillest day -- a low search sound as though the wind have hair and trail it o'er the world with the sudden cooling of the atmosphere a sea fog begin to form it appear in isolate patch over the water and then these patch slide together and a white wall advance upon we not a breath of air stir the fir stand like flat metal outline the sea become as oil the whole scene lay as though hold motionless by some huge weight in the air and the flame from we fire -- the largest we have ever make -- rise upward straight as a church steeple as i follow the rest of we party tent-ward have kick the ember of the fire into safety the advance guard of the fog be creep slowly among the tree like white arm feel they way mingle with the smoke be the odour of moss and soil and bark and the peculiar flavor of the baltic half salt half brackish like the smell of a estuary at low water it be difficult to say why it seem to I that this deep stillness mask a intense activity perhaps in every mood lie the suggestion of its opposite so that i become aware of the contrast of furious energy for it be like move through the deep pause before a thunderstorm and i trod gently lest by break a twig or move a stone i might set the whole scene into some sort of tumultuous movement actually no doubt it be nothing more than a result of overstrung nerve there be no more question of undress and go to bed than there be of undress and go to bathe some sense in I be alert and expectant i sit in my tent and wait and at the end of half a hour or so my waiting be justified for the canvas suddenly shiver and some one trip over the rope that hold it to the earth john silence come in the effect of he quiet entry be singular and prophetic : it be just as though the energy lie behind all this stillness have press forward to the edge of action this no doubt be merely the quicken of my own mind and have no other justification for the presence of john silence always suggest the near possibility of vigorous action and as a matter of fact he come in with nothing more than a nod and a significant gesture he sit down on a corner of my ground-sheet and i push the blanket over so that he could cover he leg he draw the flap of the tent after he and settle down but hardly have he do so when the canvas shake a second time and in blunder maloney sit in the dark he say self-consciously push he head inside and hang up he lantern on the ridge-pole nail i just look in for a smoke i suppose -- he glance round catch the eye of dr silence and stop he put he pipe back into he pocket and begin to hum softly -- that underbreath humming of a nondescript melody i know so well and have come to hate dr silence lean forward open the lantern and blow the light out speak low he say and do not strike match listen for sound and movement about the camp and be ready to follow I at a moment 's notice there be light enough to distinguish we face easily and i see maloney glance again hurriedly at both of we be the camp asleep the doctor ask presently whisper sangree be reply the clergyman in a voice equally low i can not answer for the woman i think they be sit up that be for the best and then he add : i wish the fog would thin a bit and let the moon through later -- we may want it it be lift now i think maloney whisper back it be over the top of the tree already i can not say what it be in this commonplace exchange of remark that thrill probably maloney 's swift acquiescence in the doctor 's mood have something to do with it for he quick obedience certainly impress I a good deal but even without that slight evidence it be clear that each recognize the gravity of the occasion and understand that sleep be impossible and sentry duty be the order of the night report to I repeat john silence once again the least sound and do nothing precipitately he shift across to the mouth of the tent and raise the flap fasten it against the pole so that he could see out maloney stop hum and begin to force the breath through he tooth with a kind of faint hissing treat we to a medley of church hymn and popular song of the day then the tent tremble as though some one have touch it that be the wind rise whisper the clergyman and pull the flap open as far as it would go a waft of cold damp air enter and make we shiver and with it come a sound of the sea as the first wave wash its way softly along the shore it be get round to the north he add and follow he voice come a long-drawn whisper that rise from the whole island as the tree send forth a sigh response the fog 'll move a bit now i can make out a lane across the sea already hush say dr silence for maloney 's voice have rise above a whisper and we settle down again to another long period of watch and wait break only by the occasional rubbing of shoulder against the canvas as we shift we position and the increase noise of wave on the outer coast-line of the island and over all whir the murmur of wind sweep the top of the tree like a great harp and the faint tap on the tent as drop fall from the branch with a sharp ping sound we have sit for something over a hour in this way and maloney and i be find it increasingly hard to keep awake when suddenly dr silence rise to he foot and peer out the next minute he be go relieved of the dominate presence the clergyman thrust he face close into mine i do not much care for this wait game he whisper but silence would not hear of my sit up with the other he say it would prevent anything happen if i do he know i answer shortly no doubt in the world about that he whisper back it be this ` double ' business as he call it or else it be obsession as the bible describe it but it be bad whichever it be and i have get my winchester outside ready cock and i bring this too he shove a pocket bible under my nose at one time in he life it have be he inseparable companion one 's useless and the other 's dangerous i reply under my breath conscious of a keen desire to laugh and leave he to choose safety lie in follow we leader -- i be not think of myself he interrupt sharply only if anything happen to joan to-night i be go to shoot first -- and pray afterwards maloney put the book back into he hip-pocket and peer out of the doorway what be he up to now in the devil 's name i wonder he add go round sangree 's tent and make gesture how weird he look disappear in and out of the fog just trust he and wait i say quickly for the doctor be already on he way back remember he have the knowledge and know what he be about i have be with he through worse case than this maloney move back as dr silence darken the doorway and stoop to enter he sleep be very deep he whisper seat himself by the door again he be in a cataleptic condition and the double may be release any minute now but i have take step to imprison it in the tent and it can not get out till i permit it be on the watch for sign of movement then he look hard at maloney but no violence or shooting remember mr maloney unless you want a murder on you hand anything do to the double act by repercussion upon the physical body you have better take out the cartridge at once he voice be stern the clergyman go out and i hear he empty the magazine of he rifle when he return he sit nearer the door than before and from that moment until we leave the tent he never once take he eye from the figure of dr silence silhouette there against sky and canvas and meanwhile the wind come steadily over the sea and open the mist into lane and clearing drive it about like a living thing it must have be well after midnight when a low booming sound draw my attention but at first the sense of hearing be so strained that it be impossible exactly to locate it and i imagine it be the thunder of big gun far out at sea carry to we by the rise wind then maloney catch hold of my arm and lean forward somehow bring the true relation and i realize the next second that it be only a few foot away sangree 's tent he exclaim in a loud and startled whisper i craned my head round the corner but at first the effect of the fog be so confusing that every patch of white drive about before the wind look like a move tent and it be some seconds before i discover the one patch that hold steady then i see that it be shake all over and the side flap as much as the tightness of the rope allow be the cause of the booming sound we have hear something alive be tear frantically about inside bang against the stretch canvas in a way that make I think of a great moth dash against the wall and ceiling of a room the tent bulge and rock it be try to get out by jupiter mutter the clergyman rise to he foot and turn to the side where the unloaded rifle lay i spring up too hardly know what purpose be in my mind but anxious to be prepare for anything john silence however be before we both and he figure slip past and block the doorway of the tent and there be some quality in he voice next minute when he begin to speak that bring we mind instantly to a state of calm obedience first -- the woman 's tent he say low look sharply at maloney and if i need you help i 'll call the clergyman need no second bidding he dive past I and be out in a moment he be labor evidently under intense excitement i watch he pick he way silently over the slippery ground give the move tent a wide berth and presently disappear among the float shape of fog dr silence turn to I you hear those footstep about half a hour ago he ask significantly i hear nothing they be extraordinarily soft -- almost the soundless tread of a wild creature but now follow I closely he add for we must waste no time if i be to save this poor man from he affliction and lead he werewolf double to its rest and unless i be much mistaken -- he peer at I through the darkness whisper with the utmost distinctness -- joan and sangree be absolutely make for one another and i think she know it too -- just as well as he do my head swim a little as i listen but at the same time something clear in my brain and i see that he be right yet it be all so weird and incredible so remote from the commonplace fact of life as commonplace people know they and more than once it flash upon I that the whole scene -- people word tent and all the rest of it -- be delusion create by the intense excitement of my own mind somehow and that suddenly the sea-fog would clear off and the world become normal again the cold air from the sea sting we cheek sharply as we leave the close atmosphere of the little crowded tent the sighing of the tree the wave break below on the rock and the line and patch of mist drive about we seem to create the momentary illusion that the whole island have break loose and be float out to sea like a mighty raft the doctor move just ahead of I quickly and silently he be make straight for the canadian 's tent where the side still boom and shake as the creature of sinister life race and tear about impatiently within a little distance from the door he pause and hold up a hand to stop I we be perhaps a dozen foot away before i release it you shall see for yourself he say that the reality of the werewolf be beyond all question the matter of which it be compose be of course exceedingly attenuate but you be partially clairvoyant -- and even if it be not dense enough for normal sight you will see something he add a little more i could not catch the fact be that the curiously strong vibrate atmosphere surround he person somewhat confused my sens it be the result of course of he intense concentration of mind and force and pervade the entire camp and all the person in it and as i watch the canvas shake and hear it boom and flap i heartily welcome it for it be also protective at the back of sangree 's tent stand a thin group of pine tree but in front and at the side the ground be comparatively clear the flap be wide open and any ordinary animal would have be out and away without the least trouble dr silence lead I up to within a few foot evidently careful not to advance beyond a certain limit and then stoop down and signal to I to do the same and look over he shoulder i see the interior light faintly by the spectral light reflect from the fog and the dim blot upon the balsam bough and blanket signify sangree while over he and round he and up and down he fly the dark mass of something on four leg with pointed muzzle and sharp ear plainly visible against the tent side and the occasional gleam of fiery eye and white fang i hold my breath and keep utterly still inwardly and outwardly for fear i suppose that the creature would become conscious of my presence but the distress i feel go far deeper than the mere sense of personal safety or the fact of watch something so incredibly active and real i become keenly aware of the dreadful psychic calamity it involve the realisation that sangree lay confine in that narrow space with this species of monstrous projection of himself -- that he be wrap there in the cataleptic sleep all unconscious that this thing be masquerade with he own life and energy -- add a distressing touch of horror to the scene in all the case of john silence -- and they be many and often terrible -- no other psychic affliction have ever before or since impressed I so convincingly with the pathetic impermanence of the human personality with its fluid nature and with the alarming possibility of its transformation come he whisper after we have watch for some minute the frantic effort to escape from the circle of thought and will that hold it prisoner come a little farther away while i release it we move back a dozen yard or so it be like a scene in some impossible play or in some ghastly and oppressive nightmare from which i should presently awake to find the blanket all heap up upon my chest by some method undoubtedly mental but which in my confusion and excitement i fail to understand the doctor accomplish he purpose and the next minute i hear he say sharply under he breath it be out now watch at this very moment a sudden gust from the sea blow aside the mist so that a lane open to the sky and the moon ghastly and unnatural as the effect of stage limelight drop down in a momentary gleam upon the door of sangree 's tent and i perceive that something have move forward from the interior darkness and stand clearly define upon the threshold and at the same moment the tent cease its shuddering and hold still there in the doorway stand a animal with neck and muzzle thrust forward its head poke into the night its whole body poise in that attitude of intense rigidity that precede the spring into freedom the run leap of attack it seem to be about the size of a calf leaner than a mastiff yet more squat than a wolf and i can swear that i see the fur ridged sharply upon its back then its upper lip slowly lift and i see the whiteness of its tooth surely no human being ever stare as hard as i do in those next few minute yet the harder i stare the clearer appear the amazing and monstrous apparition for after all it be sangree -- and yet it be not sangree it be the head and face of a animal and yet it be the face of sangree : the face of a wild dog a wolf and yet he face the eye be sharper narrower more fiery yet they be he eye -- he eye run wild the tooth be longer whiter more pointed -- yet they be he tooth he tooth grow cruel the expression be flame terrible exultant -- yet it be he expression carry to the border of savagery -- he expression as i have already surprise it more than once only dominant now fully release from human constraint with the mad yearning of a hungry and importunate soul it be the soul of sangree the long suppress deeply loving sangree express in its single and intense desire -- pure utterly and utterly wonderful yet at the same time come the feeling that it be all a illusion i suddenly remember the extraordinary change the human face can undergo in circular insanity when it change from melancholia to elation and i recall the effect of hascheesh which show the human countenance in the form of the bird or animal to which in character it most approximate and for a moment i attribute this mingling of sangree 's face with a wolf to some kind of similar delusion of the sens i be mad deluded dream the excitement of the day and this dim light of star and bewildering mist combine to trick I i have be amazingly impose upon by some false wizardry of the sens it be all absurd and fantastic it would pass and then sound across this sea of mental confusion like a bell through a fog come the voice of john silence bring I back to a consciousness of the reality of it all -- sangree -- in he double and when i look again more calmly i plainly see that it be indeed the face of the canadian but he face turn animal yet mingle with the brute expression a curiously pathetic look like the soul see sometimes in the yearning eye of a dog -- the face of a animal shot with vivid streak of the human the doctor call to he softly under he breath -- sangree sangree you poor afflict creature do you know I can you understand what it be you be do in you ` body of desire ' for the first time since its appearance the creature move its ear twitch and it shift the weight of its body on to the hind leg then lift its head and muzzle to the sky it open its long jaw and give vent to a dismal and prolonged howling but when i hear that howl rise to heaven the breath catch and strangle in my throat and it seem that my heart miss a beat for though the sound be entirely animal it be at the same time entirely human but more than that it be the cry i have so often hear in the western state of america where the indian still fight and hunt and struggle -- it be the cry of the redskin the indian blood whisper john silence when i catch he arm for support the ancestral cry and that poignant beseeching cry that break human voice mingle with the savage howl of the brute beast pierce straight to my very heart and touch there something that no music no voice passionate or tender of man woman or child have ever stir before or since for one second into life it echo away among the fog and the tree and lose itself somewhere out over the hidden sea and some part of myself -- something that be far more than the mere act of intense listening -- go out with it and for several minute i lose consciousness of my surroundings and feel utterly absorb in the pain of another stricken fellow-creature again the voice of john silence recall I to myself hark he say aloud hark he tone galvanise I afresh we stand listen side by side far across the island faintly sound through the tree and brushwood come a similar answering cry shrill yet wonderfully musical shake the heart with a singular wild sweetness that defy description we hear it rise and fall upon the night air it be across the lagoon dr silence cry but this time in full tone that pay no tribute to caution it be joan she be answer he again the wonderful cry rise and fall and that same instant the animal lower its head and muzzle to earth set off on a swift easy canter that take it off into the mist and out of we sight like a thing of wind and vision the doctor make a quick dash to the door of sangree 's tent and follow close at he heel i peered in and catch a momentary glimpse of the small shrunken body lie upon the branch but half cover by the blanket -- the cage from which most of the life and not a little of the actual corporeal substance have escape into that other form of life and energy the body of passion and desire by another of those swift incalculable process which at this stage of my apprenticeship i fail often to grasp dr silence reclose the circle about the tent and body now it can not return till i permit it he say and the next second be off at full speed into the wood with myself close behind he i have already have some experience of my companion 's ability to run swiftly through a dense wood and i now have the further proof of he power almost to see in the dark for once we leave the open space about the tent the tree seem to absorb all the remain vestige of light and i understand that special sensibility that be say to develop in the blind -- the sense of obstacle and twice as we run we hear the sound of that dismal howling drawing nearer and nearer to the answering faint cry from the point of the island whither we be go then suddenly the tree fall away and we emerge hot and breathless upon the rocky point where the granite slab run bare into the sea it be like pass into the clearness of open day and there sharply define against sea and sky stand the figure of a human be it be joan i at once see that there be something about she appearance that be singular and unusual but it be only when we have move quite close that i recognize what cause it for while the lip wear a smile that light the whole face with a happiness i have never see there before the eye themselves be fix in a steady sightless stare as though they be lifeless and make of glass i make a impulsive forward movement but dr silence instantly drag I back no he cry do not wake she what do you mean i reply aloud struggle in he grasp she be asleep it be somnambulistic the shock might injure she permanently i turn and peer closely into he face he be absolutely calm i begin to understand a little more catch i suppose something of he strong thinking walk in she sleep you mean he nod she be on she way to meet he from the very begin he must have draw she -- irresistibly but the tear tent and the wounded flesh when she do not sleep deep enough to enter the somnambulistic trance he miss she -- he go instinctively and in all innocence to seek she out -- with the result of course that she wake and be terrify -- then in they heart of heart they love i ask finally john silence smile he inscrutable smile profoundly he answer and as simply as only primitive soul can love if only they both come to realize it in they normal waking state he double will cease these nocturnal excursion he will be cure and at rest the word have hardly leave he lip when there be a sound of rustling branch on we left and the very next instant the dense brushwood part where it be darkest and out rush the swift form of a animal at full gallop the noise of foot be scarcely audible but in that utter stillness i hear the heavy panting breath and catch the swish of the low bush against its side it go straight towards joan -- and as it go the girl lift she head and turn to meet it and the same instant a canoe that have be creep silently and unobserved round the inner shore of the lagoon emerge from the shadow and define itself upon the water with a figure at the middle thwart it be maloney it be only afterwards i realize that we be invisible to he where we stand against the dark background of tree the figure of joan and the animal he see plainly but not dr silence and myself stand just beyond they he stand up in the canoe and point with he right arm i see something gleam in he hand stand aside joan girl or you 'll get hit he shout he voice ring horribly through the deep stillness and the same instant a pistol-shot crack out with a burst of flame and smoke and the figure of the animal with one tremendous leap into the air fall back in the shadow and disappear like a shape of night and fog instantly then joan open she eye look in a dazed fashion about she and press both hand against she heart fall with a sharp cry into my arm that be just in time to catch she and a answering cry sound across the lagoon -- thin wail piteous it come from sangree 's tent fool cry dr silence you have wound he and before we could move or realize quite what it mean he be in the canoe and half-way across the lagoon some kind of similar abuse come in a torrent from my lip too -- though i can not remember the actual word -- as i curse the man for he disobedience and try to make the girl comfortable on the ground but the clergyman be more practical he be spread he coat over she and dash water on she face it be not joan i have kill at any rate i hear he mutter as she turn and open she eye and smile faintly up in he face i swear the bullet go straight joan stare at he she be still daze and bewilder and still imagine herself with the companion of she trance the strange lucidity of the somnambulist still hang over she brain and mind though outwardly she appear troubled and confused where have he go to he disappear so suddenly cry that he be hurt she ask look at she father as though she do not recognize he and if they have do anything to he -- they have do it to I too -- for he be more to I than -- she word grow vaguer and vaguer as she return slowly to she normal waking state and now she stop altogether as though suddenly aware that she have be surprise into tell secret but all the way back as we carry she carefully through the tree the girl smile and murmur sangree 's name and ask if he be injure until it finally become clear to I that the wild soul of the one have call to the wild soul of the other and in the secret depths of they being the call have be hear and understand john silence be right in the abyss of she heart too deep at first for recognition the girl love he and have love he from the very begin once she normal waking consciousness recognize the fact they would leap together like twin flame and he affliction would be at a end he intense desire would be satisfy he would be cure and in sangree 's tent dr silence and i sit up for the remainder of the night -- this wonderful and haunted night that have show we such strange glimpse of a new heaven and a new hell -- for the canadian toss upon he balsam bough with high fever in he blood and upon each cheek a dark and curious contusion show throb with severe pain although the skin be not break and there be no outward and visible sign of blood maloney shot straight you see whisper dr silence to I after the clergyman have go to he tent and have put joan to sleep beside she mother who by the way have never once awaken the bullet must have pass clean through the face for both cheek be stain he 'll wear these mark all he life -- smaller but always there they be the most curious scar in the world these scar transfer by repercussion from a injured double they 'll remain visible until just before he death and then with the withdrawal of the subtle body they will disappear finally he word mingle in my dazed mind with the sigh of the troubled sleeper and the cry of the wind about the tent nothing seem to paralyse my power of realisation so much as these twin stain of mysterious significance upon the face before I it be odd too how speedily and easily the camp resign itself again to sleep and quietness as though a stage curtain have suddenly drop down upon the action and conceal it and nothing contribute so vividly to the feeling that i have be a spectator of some kind of visionary drama as the dramatic nature of the change in the girl 's attitude yet as a matter of fact the change have not be so sudden and revolutionary as appear underneath in those remoter region of consciousness where the emotion unknown to they owner do secretly mature and owe thence they abrupt revelation to some abrupt psychological climax there can be no doubt that joan 's love for the canadian have be grow steadily and irresistibly all the time it have now rush to the surface so that she recognize it that be all and it have always seem to I that the presence of john silence so potent so quietly efficacious produce a effect if one may say so of a psychic forcing-house and hasten incalculably the bring together of these two wild lover in that sudden awakening have occur the very psychological climax require to reveal the passionate emotion accumulate below the deeper knowledge have leap across and transfer itself to she ordinary consciousness and in that shock the collision of the personality have shake they to the depths and show she the truth beyond all possibility of doubt he be sleep quietly now the doctor say interrupt my reflection if you will watch alone for a bit i 'll go to maloney 's tent and help he to arrange he thought he smile in anticipation of that arrangement he 'll never quite understand how a wound on the double can transfer itself to the physical body but at least i can persuade he that the less he talk and ` explain ' to-morrow the sooner the force will run they natural course now to peace and quietness he go away softly and with the removal of he presence sangree sleep heavily turn over and groan with the pain of he broken head and it be in the still hour just before the dawn when all the island be hush the wind and sea still dream and the star visible through clear mist that a figure creep silently over the ridge and reach the door of the tent where i doze beside the sufferer before i be aware of its presence the flap be cautiously lift a few inch and in look -- joan that same instant sangree wake and sit up on he bed of branch he recognize she before i could say a word and utter a low cry it be pain and joy mingled and this time all human and the girl too be no longer walk in she sleep but fully aware of what she be do i be only just able to prevent he spring from he blanket joan joan he cry and in a flash she answer he i be here -- i be with you always now and have push past I into the tent and fling herself upon he breast i know you would come to I in the end i hear he whisper it be all too big for I to understand at first she murmur and for a long time i be frighten -- but not now he cry louder you do not feel afraid now of -- of anything that be in I -- i fear nothing she cry nothing nothing i lead she outside again she look steadily into my face with eye shine and she whole be transform in some intuitive way survive probably from the somnambulism she know or guess as much as i know you must talk to-morrow with john silence i say gently lead she towards she own tent he understand everything i leave she at the door and as i go back softly to take up my place of sentry again with the canadian i see the first streak of dawn lighting up the far rim of the sea behind the distant island and as though to emphasise the eternal closeness of comedy to tragedy two small detail rise out of the scene and impressed I so vividly that i remember they to this very day for in the tent where i have just leave joan all aquiver with she new happiness there rise plainly to my ear the grotesque sound of the bo ` sun 's mate heavily snore oblivious of all thing in heaven or hell and from maloney 's tent so still be the night where i look across and see the lantern 's glow there come to I through the tree the monotonous rise and fall of a human voice that be beyond question the sound of a man pray to he god case iii : a victim of higher space there be a hextraordinary gentleman to see you sir say the new man why ` extraordinary ' ask dr silence draw the tip of he thin finger through he brown beard he eye twinkle pleasantly why ` extraordinary ' barker he repeat encouragingly notice the perplexed expression in the man 's eye he be so -- so thin sir i could hardly see ` im at all -- at first he be inside the house before i could ask the name he add remember strict order and who bring he here he come alone sir in a closed cab he push by I before i could say a word -- make no noise not what i could hear he seem to move so soft like -- the man stop short with obvious embarrassment as though he have already say enough to jeopardise he new situation but try hard to show that he remember the instruction and warning he have receive with regard to the admission of stranger not properly accredit and where be the gentleman now ask dr silence turn away to conceal he amusement i really could not exactly say sir i leave he stand in the ` all -- the doctor look up sharply but why in the hall barker why not in the waiting-room he fix he pierce though kindly eye on the man 's face do he frighten you he ask quickly i think he do sir if i may say so i seem to lose sight of he as it be -- the man stammer evidently convince by now that he have earn he dismissal he come in so funny just like a cold wind he add boldly set he heel at attention and look he master full in the face the doctor make a internal note of the man 's halt description he be please that the slight sign of psychic intuition which have induce he to engage barker have not entirely fail at the first trial dr silence seek for this qualification in all he assistant from secretary to serve man and if it surround he with a somewhat singular crew the drawback be more than compensate for on the whole by they occasional flash of insight so the gentleman make you feel queer do he that be it i think sir repeat the man stolidly and he bring no kind of introduction to I -- no letter or anything ask the doctor with feigned surprise as though he know what be come the man fumble both in mind and pocket and finally produce a envelope i beg pardon sir he say greatly fluster the gentleman hand I this for you it be a note from a discerning friend who have never yet send he a case that be not vitally interesting from one point or another please see the bearer of this note the brief message run though i doubt if even you can do much to help he john silence pause a moment so as to gather from the mind of the writer all that lay behind the brief word of the letter then he look up at he servant with a graver expression than he have yet worn go back and find this gentleman he say and show he into the green study do not reply to he question or speak more than actually necessary but think kind helpful sympathetic thought as strongly as you can barker you remember what i tell you about the importance of _ think _ when i engage you put curiosity out of you mind and think gently sympathetically affectionately if you can he smile and barker who have recover he composure in the doctor 's presence bow silently and go out there be two different reception-room in dr silence 's house one -lrb- intend for person who imagine they need spiritual assistance when really they be only candidate for the asylum -rrb- have pad wall and be well supply with various conceal contrivance by means of which sudden violence could be instantly meet and overcome it be however rarely use the other intend for the reception of genuine case of spiritual distress and out-of-the-way affliction of a psychic nature be entirely drape and furnish in a soothing deep green calculate to induce calmness and repose of mind and this room be the one in which dr silence interview the majority of he queer case and the one into which he have direct barker to show he present caller to begin with the arm-chair in which the patient be always direct to sit be nail to the floor since its immovability tend to impart this same excellent characteristic to the occupant patient invariably grow excite when talk about themselves and they excitement tend to confuse they thought and to exaggerate they language the inflexibility of the chair help to counteract this after repeat endeavor to drag it forward or push it back they end by resign themselves to sit quietly and with the futility of fidget there follow a calmer state of mind upon the floor and at interval in the wall immediately behind be certain tiny green button practically unnoticeable which on be press permit a soothing and persuasive narcotic to rise invisibly about the occupant of the chair the effect upon the excitable patient be rapid admirable and harmless the green study be further provide with a secret spy-hole for john silence like when possible to observe he patient 's face before it have assume that mask the feature of the human countenance invariably wear in the presence of another person a man sit alone wear a psychic expression and this expression be the man himself it disappear the moment another person join he and dr silence often learn more from a few moment ' secret observation of a face than from hour of conversation with its owner afterwards a very light almost a dancing step follow barker 's heavy tread towards the green room and a moment afterwards the man come in and announce that the gentleman be wait he be still pale and he manner nervous never mind barker the doctor say kindly if you be not psychic the man would have have no effect upon you at all you only need training and development and when you have learn to interpret these feeling and sensation better you will feel no fear but only a great sympathy yes sir thank you sir and barker bow and make he escape while dr silence a amuse smile lurk about the corner of he mouth make he way noiselessly down the passage and put he eye to the spy-hole in the door of the green study this spy-hole be so place that it command a view of almost the entire room and look through it the doctor see a hat glove and umbrella lie on a chair by the table but search at first in vain for they owner the window be both closed and a brisk fire burn in the grate there be various sign -- sign intelligible at least to a keenly intuitive soul -- that the room be occupy yet so far as human being be concern it be empty utterly empty no one sit in the chair no one stand on the mat before the fire there be no sign even that a patient be anywhere close against the wall examine the bocklin reproduction -- as patient so often do when they think they be alone -- and therefore rather difficult to see from the spy-hole ordinarily speak there be no one in the room it be undeniable yet dr silence be quite well aware that a human be _ be _ in the room he psychic apparatus never fail in let he know the proximity of a incarnate or discarnate be even in the dark he could tell that and he now know positively that he patient -- the patient who have alarm barker and have then trip down the corridor with that dancing footstep -- be somewhere conceal within the four wall command by he spy-hole he also realize -- and this be most unusual -- that this individual whom he desire to watch know that he be be watch and further that the stranger himself be also watch in fact that it be he the doctor who be be observe -- and by a observer as keen and trained as himself a inkling of the true state of the case begin to dawn upon he and he be on the verge of enter -- indeed he hand already touch the door-knob -- when he eye still glue to the spy-hole detect a slight movement directly opposite between he and the fireplace something stir he watch very attentively and make certain that he be not mistake a object on the mantelpiece -- it be a blue vase -- disappear from view it pass out of sight together with the portion of the marble mantelpiece on which it rest next that part of the fire and grate and brass fender immediately below it vanish entirely as though a slice have be take clean out of they dr silence then understand that something between he and these object be slowly come into be something that conceal they and obstruct he vision by insert itself in the line of sight between they and himself he quietly await further result before go in first he see a thin perpendicular line trace itself from just above the height of the clock and continue downward till it reach the woolly fire-mat this line grow wider broaden grow solid it be no shadow it be something substantial it define itself more and more then suddenly at the top of the line and about on a level with the face of the clock he see a round luminous disc gaze steadily at he it be a human eye look straight into he own press there against the spy-hole and it be bright with intelligence dr silence hold he breath for a moment -- and stare back at it then like some one move out of deep shadow into light he see the figure of a man come slide sideways into view a whitish face follow the eye and the perpendicular line he have first observe broaden out and develop into the complete figure of a human be it be the patient he have apparently be stand there in front of the fire all the time a second eye have follow the first and both of they stare steadily at the spy-hole sharply concentrated yet with a sly twinkle of humor and amusement that make it impossible for the doctor to maintain he position any longer he open the door and go in quickly as he do so he notice for the first time the sound of a german band come in gaily through the open ventilator in some intuitive unaccountable fashion the music connect itself with the patient he be about to interview this sort of prevision be not unfamiliar to he it always explain itself later the man he see be of middle age and of very ordinary appearance so ordinary in fact that he be difficult to describe -- he only peculiarity be he extreme thinness pleasant -- that be good -- vibration issue from he atmosphere and meet dr silence as he advance to greet he yet vibration alive with current and discharge betray the perturb and disorder condition of he mind and brain there be evidently something wholly out of the usual in the state of he thought yet though strange it be not altogether distressing it be not the impression that the broken and violent atmosphere of the insane produce upon the mind dr silence realize in a flash that here be a case of absorb interest that might require all he power to handle properly i be watch you through my little peep-hole -- as you see he begin with a pleasant smile advance to shake hand i find it of the greatest assistance sometimes -- but the patient interrupt he at once he voice be hurry and have odd shrill change in it break from high to low in unexpected fashion one moment it thunder the next it almost squeak i understand without explanation he break in rapidly you get the true note of a man in this way -- when he think himself unobserved i quite agree only in my case i fear you see very little my case as you of course grasp dr silence be extremely peculiar uncomfortably peculiar indeed unless sir william have positively assure I -- my friend have send you to I the doctor interrupted gravely with a gentle note of authority and that be quite sufficient pray be seat mr -- mudge -- racine mudge return the other take this comfortable one mr mudge lead he to the fix chair and tell I you condition in you own way and at you own pace my whole day be at you service if you require it mr mudge move towards the chair in question and then hesitate you will promise I not to use the narcotic button he say before sit down i do not need they also i ought to mention that anything you think of vividly will reach my mind that be apparently part of my peculiar case he sit down with a sigh and arrange he thin leg and body into a position of comfort evidently he be very sensitive to the thought of other for the picture of the green button have only enter the doctor 's mind for a second yet the other have instantly snap it up dr silence notice too that mr mudge hold on tightly with both hand to the arm of the chair i be rather glad the chair be nail to the floor he remark as he settle himself more comfortably it suit I admirably the fact be -- and this be my case in a nutshell -- which be all that a doctor of you marvellous development require -- the fact be dr silence i be a victim of higher space that be what be the matter with I -- higher space the two look at each other for a space in silence the little patient hold tightly to the arm of the chair which suit he admirably and look up with stare eye he atmosphere positively tremble with the wave of some unknown activity while the doctor smile kindly and sympathetically and put he whole person as far as possible into the mental condition of the other higher space repeat mr mudge that be what it be now do you think you can help I with _ that _ there be a pause during which the man 's eye steadily search down below the surface of they respective personality then dr silence speak i be quite sure i can help he answer quietly sympathy must always help and suffer always own my sympathy i see you have suffer cruelly you must tell I all about you case and when i hear the gradual step by which you reach this strange condition i have no doubt i can be of assistance to you he draw a chair up beside he interlocutor and lay a hand on he shoulder for a moment he whole be radiate kindness intelligence desire to help for instance he go on i feel sure it be the result of no mere chance that you become familiar with the terror of what you term higher space for higher space be no mere external measurement it be of course a spiritual state a spiritual condition a inner development and one that we must recognize as abnormal since it be beyond the reach of the world at the present stage of evolution higher space be a mythical state oh cry the other rub he birdlike hand with pleasure the relief it be to be able to talk to some one who can understand of course what you say be the utter truth and you be right that no mere chance lead I to my present condition but on the other hand prolonged and deliberate study yet chance in a sense now govern it i mean my enter the condition of higher space seem to depend upon the chance of this and that circumstance for instance the mere sound of that german band send I off not that all music will do so but certain sound certain vibration at once key I up to the requisite pitch and off i go wagner 's music always do it and that band must have be play a stray bit of wagner but i 'll come to all that later only first i must ask you to send away you man from the spy-hole john silence look up with a start for mr mudge 's back be to the door and there be no mirror he see the brown eye of barker glue to the little circle of glass and he cross the room without a word and snap down the black shutter provide for the purpose and then hear barker snuffle away along the passage now continue the little man in the chair i can begin you have manage to put I completely at my ease and i feel i may tell you my whole case without shame or reserve you will understand but you must be patient with I if i go into detail that be already familiar to you -- detail of higher space i mean -- and if i seem stupid when i have to describe thing that transcend the power of language and be really therefore indescribable my dear friend put in the other calmly that go without say to know higher space be a experience that defy description and one be oblige to make use of more or less intelligible symbol but pray proceed you vivid thought will tell I more than you halt word a immense sigh of relief proceed from the little figure half lose in the depths of the chair such intelligent sympathy meeting he half-way be a new experience to he and it touch he heart at once he lean back relax he tight hold of the arm and begin in he thin scale-like voice my mother be a frenchwoman and my father a essex bargeman he say abruptly hence my name -- racine and mudge my father die before i ever see he my mother inherit money from she bordeaux relation and when she die soon after i be leave alone with wealth and a strange freedom i have no guardian trustee sister brother or any connection in the world to look after I i grow up therefore utterly without education this much be to my advantage i learn none of that deceitful rubbish teach in school and so have nothing to unlearn when i awaken to my true love -- mathematics higher mathematics and higher geometry these however i seem to know instinctively it be like the memory of what i have deeply study before the principle be in my blood and i simply race through the ordinary stage and beyond and then do the same with geometry afterwards when i read the book on these subject i understand how swift and undeviate the knowledge have come back to I it be simply memory it be simply _ re-collecting _ the memory of what i have know before in a previous existence and require no book to teach I in he grow excitement mr mudge attempt to drag the chair forward a little nearer to he listener and then smile faintly as he resign himself instantly again to its immovability and plunge anew into the recital of he singular disease the audacious speculation of bolyaus the amazing theory of gauss -- that through a point more than one line could be draw parallel to a give line the possibility that the angle of a triangle be together _ greater _ than two right angle if draw upon immense curvature -- the breathless intuition of beltramus and lobatchewsky -- all these i hurry through and emerge panting but unsatisfied upon the verge of my -- my new world my higher space possibility -- in a word my disease how i get there he resume after a brief pause during which he appear to be listen intently for a approach sound be more than i can put intelligibly into word i can only hope to leave you mind with a intuitive comprehension of the possibility of what i say here however come a change at this point i be no longer absorb the fruit of study i have make before it be the beginning of new effort to learn for the first time and i have to go slowly and laboriously through terrible work here i seek for the theory and speculation of other but book be few and far between and with the exception of one man -- a ` dreamer ' the world call he -- whose audacity and pierce intuition amaze and delight I beyond description i find no one to guide or help you of course dr silence understand something of what i be drive at with these stammer word though you can not perhaps yet guess what depths of pain my new knowledge bring I to nor why a acquaintance with a new development of space should prove a source of misery and terror mr racine mudge remember that the chair would not move do the next best thing he could in he desire to draw nearer to the attentive man face he and sit forward upon the very edge of the cushion cross he leg and gesticulate with both hand as though he see into this region of new space he be attempt to describe and might any moment tumble into it bodily from the edge of the chair and disappear form view john silence separate from he by three pace sit with he eye fix upon the thin white face opposite note every word and every gesture with deep attention this room we now sit in dr silence have one side open to space -- to higher space a closed box only _ seem _ close there be a way in and out of a soap bubble without break the skin you tell I no new thing the doctor interpose gently hence if higher space exist and we world border upon it and lie partially in it it follow necessarily that we see only portion of all object we never see they true and complete shape we see they three measurement but not they fourth the new direction be conceal from we and when i hold this book and move my hand all round it i have not really make a complete circuit we only perceive those portion of any object which exist in we three dimension the rest escape we but once we learn to see in higher space object will appear as they actually be only they will thus be hardly recognisable now you may begin to grasp something of what i be come to i be begin to understand something of what you must have suffer observe the doctor soothingly for i have make similar experiment myself and only stop just in time -- you be the one man in all the world who can hear and understand _ and _ sympathise exclaim mr mudge grasp he hand and hold it tightly while he speak the nail chair prevent further excitability well he resume after a moment 's pause i procure the implement and the color block for practical experiment and i follow the instruction carefully till i have arrive at a work conception of four-dimensional space the tessaract the figure whose boundary be cube i know by heart that be to say i know it and see it mentally for my eye of course could never take in a new measurement or my hand and foot handle it so at least i think he add make a wry face i have reach the stage you see when i could imagine in a new dimension i be able to conceive the shape of that new figure which be intrinsically different to all we know -- the shape of the tessaract i could perceive in four dimension when therefore i look at a cube i could see all its side at once its top be not foreshorten nor its farther side and base invisible i see the whole thing out flat so to speak and this tessaract be bound by cube moreover i also see its content -- its inside you be not yourself able to enter this new world interrupted dr silence not then i be only able to conceive intuitively what it be like and how exactly it must look later when i slip in there and see object in they entirety unlimited by the paucity of we poor three measurement i very nearly lose my life for you see space do not stop at a single new dimension a fourth it extend in all possible new one and we must conceive it as contain any number of new dimension in other word there be no space at all but only a spiritual condition but meanwhile i have come to grasp the strange fact that the object in we normal world appear to we only partially mr mudge move farther forward till he be balanced dangerously on the very edge of the chair from this start point he resume i begin my study and experiment and continue they for year i have money and i be without friend i live in solitude and experiment my intellect of course have little part in the work for intellectually it be all unthinkable never be the limitation of mere reason more plainly demonstrate it be mystically intuitively spiritually that i begin to advance and what i learn and know and do be all impossible to put into language since it all describe experience transcend the experience of man it be only some of the result -- what you would call the symptom of my disease -- that i can give you and even these must often appear absurd contradiction and impossible paradox i can only tell you dr silence -- he manner become exceedingly impressive -- that i reach sometimes a point of view whence all the great puzzle of the world become plain to I and i understand what they call in the yoga book ` the great heresy of separateness ' why all great teacher have urge the necessity of man loving he neighbor as himself how man be all really one and why the utter loss of self be necessary to salvation and the discovery of the true life of the soul he pause a moment and draw breath you speculation have be my own long ago the doctor say quietly i fully realize the force of you word man be doubtless not separate at all -- in the sense they imagine -- all this about the very much higher space i only dimly very dimly conceive of course the other go on raise he voice again by jerk but what do happen to I be the humbler accident of -- the simpler disaster -- oh dear how shall i put it -- he stammer and show visible sign of distress it be simply this he resume with a sudden rush of word that accidentally as the result of my year of experiment i one day slip bodily into the next world the world of four dimension yet without know precisely how i get there or how i could get back again i discover that be that my ordinary three-dimensional body be but a expression -- a projection -- of my higher four-dimensional body now you understand what i mean much earlier in we talk when i speak of chance i can not control my entrance or exit certain people certain human atmosphere certain wander force thought desire even -- the radiation of certain combination of color and above all the vibration of certain kind of music will suddenly throw I into a state of what i can only describe as a intense and terrific inner vibration -- and behold i be off off in the direction at right angle to all we known direction off in the direction the cube take when it begin to trace the outline of the new figure off into my breathless and semi-divine higher space off _ inside myself _ into the world of four dimension he gasp and drop back into the depths of the immovable chair and there he whisper he voice issue from among the cushion there i have to stay until these vibration subside or until they do something which i can not find word to describe properly or intelligibly to you -- and then behold i be back again first that be i disappear then i reappear just so exclaimed dr silence and that be why a few -- why a few moment ago interrupted mr mudge take the word out of he mouth you find I go and then see I return the music of that wretched german band send I off you intense think about I bring I back -- when the band have stop its wagner i see you approach the peep-hole and i see barker 's intention of do so later for I no interior be hide i see inside when in that state the content of you mind as of you body be open to I as the day oh dear oh dear oh dear mr mudge stop and again mop he brow a light tremble run over the surface of he small body like wind over grass he still hold tightly to the arm of the chair at first he presently resume my new experience be so vividly interesting that i feel no alarm there be no room for it the alarm come a little later then you actually penetrate far enough into that state to experience yourself as a normal portion of it ask the doctor lean forward deeply interested mr mudge nod a perspire face in reply i do he whisper undoubtedly i do i be come to all that it begin first at night when i realize that sleep bring no loss of consciousness -- the spirit of course can never sleep only the body become unconscious interpose john silence yes we know that -- theoretically at night of course the spirit be active elsewhere and we have no memory of where and how simply because the brain stay behind and receive no record but i find that while remain conscious i also retain memory i have attain to the state of continuous consciousness for at night i regularly with the first approach of drowsiness enter _ nolen volen _ the four-dimensional world for a time this happen regularly and i could not control it though later i find a way to regulate it better apparently sleep be unnecessary in the higher -- the four-dimensional -- body yes perhaps but i should infinitely have prefer dull sleep to the knowledge for unable to control my movement i wander to and fro attract owe to my partial development and premature arrival to part of this new world that alarm I more and more it be the awful waste and drift of a monstrous world so utterly different to all we know and see that i can not even hint at the nature of the sight and object and being in it more than that i can not even remember they i can not now picture they to myself even but can recall only the _ memory of the impression _ they make upon I the horror and devastate terror of it all to be in several place at once for instance -- perfectly interrupted john silence notice the increase of the other 's excitement i understand exactly but now please tell I a little more of this alarm you experience and how it affect you it be not the disappear and reappear _ per se _ that i mind continue mr mudge so much as certain other thing it be see people and object in they weird entirety in they true and complete shape that be so distressing it introduce I to a world of monster horse dog cat all of which i love people tree child all that i have consider beautiful in life -- everything from a human face to a cathedral -- appear to I in a different shape and aspect to all i have know before i can not perhaps convince you why this should be terrible but i assure you that it be so to hear the human voice proceeding from this novel appearance which i scarcely recognize as a human body be ghastly simply ghastly to see inside everything and everybody be a form of insight peculiarly distressing to be so confuse in geography as to find myself one moment at the north pole and the next at clapham junction -- or possibly at both place simultaneously -- be absurdly terrifying you imagination will readily furnish other detail without my multiply my experience now but you have no idea what it all means and how i suffer mr mudge pause in he panting account and lay back in he chair he still hold tightly to the arm as though they could keep he in the world of sanity and three measurement and only now and again release he left hand in order to mop he face he look very thin and white and oddly unsubstantial and he stare about he as though he see into this other space he have be talk about john silence too feel warm he have listen to every word and have make many note the presence of this man have a exhilarating effect upon he it seem as if mr racine mudge still carry about with he something of that breathless higher-space condition he have be describe at any rate dr silence have himself advance sufficiently far along the legitimate path of spiritual and psychic transformation to realize that the vision of this extraordinary little person have a basis of truth for they origin after a pause that prolong itself into minute he cross the room and unlock a drawer in a bookcase take out a small book with a red cover it have a lock to it and he produce a key out of he pocket and proceed to open the cover the bright eye of mr mudge never leave he for a single second it almost seem a pity he say at length to cure you mr mudge you be on the way to discovery of great thing though you may lose you life in the process -- that be you life here in the world of three dimension -- you would lose thereby nothing of great value -- you will pardon my apparent rudeness i know -- and you might gain what be infinitely greater you suffering of course lie in the fact that you alternate between the two world and be never wholly in one or the other also i rather imagine though i can not be certain of this from any personal experiment that you have here and there penetrate even into space of more than four dimension and have hence experience the terror you speak of the perspire son of the essex bargeman and the woman of normandy bent he head several time in assent but utter no word in reply some strange psychic predisposition date no doubt from one of you former life have favor the development of you ` disease ' and the fact that you have no normal training at school or college no lead by the poor intellect into the culs-de-sac falsely call knowledge have further cause you exceedingly rapid movement along the line of direct inner experience none of the knowledge you have foreshadow have come to you through the sens of course mr mudge sit in he immovable chair begin to tremble slightly a wind again seem to pass over he surface and again to set it curiously in motion like a field of grass you be merely talk to gain time he say hurriedly in a shake voice this think aloud delay we i see ahead what you be come to only please be quick for something be go to happen a band be again come down the street and if it play -- if it play wagner -- i shall be off in a twinkling precisely i will be quick i be lead up to the point of how to effect you cure the way be this : you must simply learn to _ block the entrance _ true true utterly true exclaim the little man dodge about nervously in the depths of the chair but how in the name of space be that to be do by concentration they be all within you these entrance although outer case such as color music and other thing lead you towards they these external thing you can not hope to destroy but once the entrance be block they will lead you only to brick wall and close channel you will no longer be able to find the way quick quick cry the bob figure in the chair how be this concentration to be effect this little book continue dr silence calmly will explain to you the way he tap the cover let I now read out to you certain simple instruction compose as i see you divine entirely from my own personal experience in the same direction follow these instruction and you will no longer enter the state of higher space the entrance will be block effectively mr mudge sit bolt upright in he chair to listen and john silence clear he throat and begin to read slowly in a very distinct voice but before he have utter a dozen word something happen a sound of street music enter the room through the open ventilator for a band have begin to play in the stable mew at the back of the house -- the march from _ tannhäuser _ odd as it may seem that a german band should twice within the space of a hour enter the same mew and play wagner it be nevertheless the fact mr racine mudge hear it he utter a sharp squeak cry and twist he arm with nervous energy round the chair a piteous look that be not far from tear spread over he white face gray shadow follow it -- the gray of fear he begin to struggle convulsively hold I fast catch I for god 's sake keep I here i be on the rush already oh it be frightful he cry in tone of anguish he voice as thin as a reed dr silence make a plunge forward to seize he but in a flash before he could cover the space between they mr racine mudge scream and struggle seem to shoot past he into invisibility he disappear like a arrow from a bow propel at infinite speed and he voice no longer sound in the external air but seem in some curious way to make itself hear somewhere within the depths of the doctor 's own be it be almost like a faint singing cry in he head like a voice of dream a voice of vision and unreality alcohol alcohol it cry give I alcohol it be the quickest way alcohol before i be out of reach the doctor accustom to rapid decision and even more rapid action remember that a brandy flask stand upon the mantelpiece and in less than a second he have seize it and be hold it out towards the space above the chair recently occupy by the visible mudge then before he very eye and long ere he could unscrew the metal stopper he see the contents of the closed glass phial sink and lessen as though some one be drink violently and greedily of the liquor within thanks enough it deaden the vibration cry the faint voice in he interior as he withdraw the flask and set it back upon the mantelpiece he understand that in mudge 's present condition one side of the flask be open to space and he could drink without remove the stopper he could hardly have have a more interesting proof of what he have be hear describe at such length but the next moment -- the very same moment it almost seem -- the german band stop midway in its tune -- and there be mr mudge back in he chair again gasp and pant quick he shriek stop that band send it away catch hold of I block the entrance block the entrance give I the red book oh oh oh-h-h-h the music have begin again it be merely a temporary interruption the _ tannhäuser _ march start again this time at a tremendous pace that make it sound like a rapid two-step as though the instrument play against time but the brief interruption give dr silence a moment in which to collect he scattering thought and before the band have get through half a bar he have fling forward upon the chair and hold mr racine mudge the struggle little victim of higher space in a grip of iron he arm go all round he diminutive person take in a good part of the chair at the same time he be not a big man yet he seem to smother mudge completely yet even as he do so and feel the wriggle form underneath he it begin to melt and slip away like air or water the wood of the arm-chair somehow disentangle itself from between he own arm and those of mudge the phenomenon know as the passage of matter through matter take place the little man seem actually to get mix up in he own be dr silence could just see he face beneath he it pucker and grow dark as though from some great internal effort he hear the thin reedy voice cry in he ear to block the entrance block the entrance and then -- but how in the world describe what be indescribable john silence half rise up to watch racine mudge he face distorted beyond all recognition be make a marvellous inward movement as though double back upon himself he turn funnel-wise like water in a whirling vortex and then appear to break up somewhat as a reflection break up and divide in a distort convex mirror he go neither forward nor backwards neither to the right nor the left neither up nor down but he go he go utterly he simply flash away out of sight like a vanish projectile all but one leg dr silence just have the time and the presence of mind to seize upon the left ankle and boot as it disappear and to this he hold on for several seconds like grim death yet all the time he know it be a foolish and useless thing to do the foot be in he grasp one moment and the next it seem -- this be the only way he could describe it -- inside he own skin and bone and at the same time outside he hand and all round it it seem mix up in some amazing way with he own flesh and blood then it be go and he be tightly grasp a draught of heated air go go go cry a thick whisper voice somewhere deep within he own consciousness lose lose lose it repeat grow fainter and fainter till at length it vanish into nothing and the last sign of mr racine mudge vanish with it john silence lock he red book and replace it in the cabinet which he fasten with a click and when barker answer the bell he inquire if mr mudge have leave a card upon the table it appear that he have and when the servant return with it dr silence read the address and make a note of it it be in north london mr mudge have go he say quietly to barker notice he expression of alarm he be not take he ` at with he sir mr mudge require no hat where he be now continue the doctor stoop to poke the fire but he may return for it -- and the humbrellum sir and the umbrella he do not go out _ my _ way sir if you please stutter the amaze servant he curiosity overcome he nervousness mr mudge have he own way of come and go and prefer it if he return by the door at any time remember to bring he instantly to I and be kind and gentle with he and ask no question also remember barker to think pleasantly sympathetically affectionately of he while he be away mr mudge be a very suffer gentleman barker bow and go out of the room backwards gasp and feel round the inside of he collar with three very hot finger of one hand it be two day later when he bring in a telegram to the study dr silence open it and read as follow : bombay just slip out again all safe have block entrance thousand thanks address cook london -- mudge dr silence look up and see barker stare at he bewilderingly it occur to he that somehow he know the contents of the telegram make a parcel of mr mudge 's thing he say briefly and address they thoma cook & son ludgate circus and send they there exactly a month from to-day and marked ` to be call for ' yes sir say barker leave the room with a deep sigh and a hurry glance at the waste-paper basket where he master have drop the pink paper end of the project gutenberg ebook of three more john silence
