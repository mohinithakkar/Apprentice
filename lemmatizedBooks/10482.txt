evil produce bodily punishment strike the head of child very injurious beating across the middle of the body anecdote of a teacher conclude advice to mother \* \* \* \* \* preface there be a prejudice abroad to some extent against agitate the question -- what shall we eat what shall we drink and wherewithal shall we be clothe -- not so much because the scripture have charge we not to be over anxious on the subject as because those who pay the least attention to what they eat and drink be suppose to be after all the most healthy it be not difficult to ascertain how this opinion originate there be a few individual who be perpetually think and talk on this subject and who would fain comply with appropriate rule if they know what they be and if a certain definite course pursue a few day only would change they whole condition and completely restore a shatter or ruin constitution but they ignorance of the law which govern the human frame both in sickness and in health and they indisposition to pursue any propose plan for they improvement long enough to receive much permanent benefit from it keep they notwithstanding all they say or do always deteriorate then on the other hand there be a few who in consequence of possess by nature very strong constitution and labor at some active and peculiarly healthy employment be able for a few and perhaps even for many year to set all the rule of health at defiance now strange as it may seem these case though they be only exception -lrb- and those more apparent than real -rrb- to the general rule be always dwell upon by those who be determine to live as they please and to put no restraint either upon themselves or they appetite for nothing can be plainer -- so it seem to I -- than that take mankind by family or what be still better by larger portion they be most free from pain and disease as well as most healthy and happy who pay the most attention to the law of human health that be those law or rule by whose observance alone that health can be certainly and permanently secure but these family and community be most healthy and happy not because they live in a proper manner by fit and start but because they have from some cause or other adopt and persevere in habit which compare with the habit of other family or other community be preferable that be more in obedience to the law which govern the human constitution not that even _ they _ be without sin or error on this subject -- gross error too -- but because they error be fewer or less destructive than those of they neighbor now be it possible that any intelligent father or mother of a family whose diet clothing exercise & c be thus comparatively well regulate would derive no benefit from the perusal of work which treat candidly rationally and dispassionately on these point be there a mother in the community who be so destitute of reason and common sense as not to desire the light of a broader experience in regard to the tendency of thing than she have have or possibly can have in she own family be there one who will not be aid by understand not only that a certain thing or course be better than another but also why it be so it be by no mean the object of this little work to set people to watch they stomach from meal to meal in regard to the effect of food drink & c for nothing in the world be better calculate to make dyspeptic than this it be true indeed that some thing may be obviously and greatly injurious take only once and when they be so they should be avoid but in general it be the effect of a habitual use of certain thing for a long time together -- and the longer the experiment the better -- which we be to observe a book to guide mother in the formation of early good habit in they offspring should be the result of long observation and much experiment on these point but more especially of a thorough understanding of human physiology it should not consist so much of the conceit of a single brain -- perhaps half turn -- as of the logical deduction of severe science and fact glean from the world 's history here be a nation or tribe of man bring up child to certain habit from generation to generation -- and such and such be they character here again be another large portion of we race who under similar circumstance of climate & c & c have for several hundred year educate they child very differently and with different result a comparison of thing on a large scale together with a close attention to the constitution and relation of the human system afford ground for draw conclusion which be or may be useful if this book shall not afford light derive from such source it be far better that it have never be write if it only set people to watch over the effect of thing take or use only for a single day instead of lead they from early infancy to form in they child such habit as will preclude in a great measure the necessity of watch ourselves daily then let the day perish from the memory of the writer in which the plan of bring it forth to the world be conceive but he be confident of better thing he do not believe that a work which to such a extent give the reason why will be productive of more evil than good on the contrary it must if read have the opposite effect i do not deny that even after the formation of the best habit there will be a necessity of pay some attention to what we eat and what we drink from day to day and from hour to hour but only that the tendency of this work be not to increase this necessity but on the contrary to diminish it in my own view these occasion of inquiry in regard to what be right _ physically _ as well as _ morally _ be one part of we trial in this world -- one means of form we character we be constantly tempt to excess and to error in spite of the most firm habit of self-denial which can be form if we resist temptation we character be improve and it be by self-denial and self-government in these smaller matter that we be to hope for nearly all the progress we can ever make in the great work of self-education great trial of character come but seldom and when they come we be often arm against they but these little trial and temptation come upon we every hour -- these it be after all that give shape to we character and make we constantly grow either better or worse both in the sight of god and man but as i have repeatedly say the object of this work be to diminish rather than to increase the frequency of these trial useful though they may be if duly improve in the formation of virtuous and even of holy character there be a sense in which every infant may be say to be bear healthy so that we may not only adopt the language of the poet bowring and say -- a child be bear take it and make it a bud of _ moral _ beauty but we may also add -- take it and make it beautiful _ physically _ for though a hereditary predisposition undoubtedly render some individual more susceptible than other to particular disease yet when the bodily organization of a infant be complete and the degree of vitality which nature give it be sufficient to propel the machinery of the frame it can scarcely be regard as in any other state than that of health now if it be the intention of divine providence -lrb- and who will doubt that it be -rrb- that the animal body should be capable of resist with impunity the impression of heat cold light air and the various external influence to which at birth it be subject it may be properly ask why this primitive state of health can not be maintain and disease and medicine and even preventive wholly avoid but the reason be obvious civilized society have place the human race in artificial circumstance instead of listen to the dictate of reason make ourselves acquaint with the nature of the human constitution and study to preserve it in health and vigor we yield to the government of ignorance and presumption the first moment even in which we draw breath see we place under the control of individual who be totally inadequate to the important charge of preserve the infant constitution in its original state and aid its progress to maturity and thus it be that though infant as a general rule may be say to be bear healthy few actually remain so seldom indeed do we find a person who have arrive at maturity wholly free from disease even in those part of we country which be reckon to have the most healthy climate it be indeed commonly say that a large proportion both of child and adult among the agricultural portion of we population be healthy but it be not so there be room for doubt whether on the whole the farmer of this country be healthier than the mechanic or much more so than the manufacturer or the whole mass of the country population healthier than that of the crowded city the cause of disease be sufficiently numerous in all place and condition and this will continue to be the fact not merely until parent and teacher shall become more enlighten but until many generation have be train under they enlighten influence if the child and adult among we agricultural population derive from they employment in the open air a more ruddy appearance than those either of the city or country who be confine more to they room or to a vitiated atmosphere and to numerous other source of disease and if they _ appear _ more favor with health i have learn by accurate observation that these appearance be somewhat deceptive they active sport and employment in the open air give they a stronger appetite than any other class of people and the indulgence of this appetite not only with article which be heat or indigestible in they nature but with a unreasonable quantity even of those which be consider highly proper be almost in a exact proportion and it be hence scarcely possible for the cause of disease and premature death to be more operative in factory and in city than in farm house and the country indeed it may be question whether the abuse of the animal part of man -- more common in some of they form in country than in city -- though they may be less conspicuous be not more certainly and even more immediately destructive than those abuse which in city life and bustle and competition affect more the moral nature be that as it may however -- for this be not the place for the grave discussion of so broad a question -- one thing to my mind be perfectly clear namely that until physical education shall receive more attention from all those who hold the sacred office of instructor of the young humanity can neither be much elevated nor improved mother and schoolmaster especially -- they who as dr rush say plant the seed of nearly all the good or evil in the world -- must understand most deeply and thoroughly the law which regulate the various province of the little world in which the soul reside and which like so many state of a great confederacy have not only they separate interest and rights but certain common and general one as well as those law by which the human constitution be relate to and connect with the object which everywhere surround and influence and limit and extend it this book contain little if anything new to those who be already familiar with anatomy and physiology indeed whatever may be its claim its merit or its demerit it disclaim novelty it be indeed in one point of view _ original _ -- i mean in its form manner and arrangement what i have write be chiefly from my own resource -- the result of patient study and observation and careful reflection but that study and observation of human nature and this reflection have be greatly aid by read the writings of other in the prosecution of the task which i have assign myself no work have be of more service to I than a octavo volume of 548 page by dr wm p dewee of philadelphium entitle a treatise on the physical and medical treatment of child it be one of the most valuable work on physical education in the english language as be evident from the fact that notwithstanding its expense -- three or four dollar -- it have in nine year go through five edition if it be write in such a style and publish at such a price as would bring it within reach of the mind and purse of the mass of the community its sale would have be i think much greater still and the good which it have accomplish would have be increase ten-fold if the young mother should be favorably receive by the american community and prove extensively useful it will undoubtedly be owe to the fact that it present so large a collection of fact and principle on the great subject of physical education in a manner so practical and at a price which be very low to accomplish a object so desirable be by no mean a easy task it be once say by the author of a huge volume that he write so large a work because he have not time to prepare a smaller one and however unaccountable it may be to those who have not make the trial it may be safely assert that to present within limit so small anything like a system of physical education for the guidance of young mother require much more time and labor and patience than to prepare a work on the same subject twice as large nor be it to be expect after all that the work be in all respects perfect i have indeed do what i could to render it so but be conscious that future inquiry may lead to the discovery of error should such discovery be make they will be cheerfully acknowledge and correct truth be as it should be the lead object \* \* \* \* \* the young mother chapter i the nursery general remark importance of a nursery -- generally overlook its wall -- ceiling -- window -- chimney two apartment slide partition reason for this arrangement objection to carpet furniture & c feather bed hole or crevice current of air cat and dog suck the child 's breath brilliant object squint cause of blindness it be far from be in the power of every young mother to procure a suitable room for a nursery in the present state of society the majority must be contented with such place as they can get still there be various reason for say what a nursery should be 1 it may be of service to those who _ have _ the power of selection 2 information can not injure those who _ have not _ 3 it may lead those who have wealth to extend the hand of charity in this important direction for there be not a few who have little sympathy with the want and distress of the adult poor who will yet open they heart and unfold they hand for the relief of suffer _ infancy _ among those who have what be call a nursery few select for this purpose the most appropriate part of the building it be not unfrequently the one that can best be spare be most retire or most convenient whether it be most favorable to the health and happiness of its occupant be usually at best a secondary consideration but this ought not so to be a nursery should never for example be on a ground floor or in a shaded situation or in any circumstance which expose it to dampness or hinder the occasional approach of the light of the sun it should be spacious with dry wall high ceiling and tight window the latter should always be so construct that the upper sash can be lower when we wish to admit or exclude air it should have a chimney if possible but if not there should be suitable hole in the ceiling for the purpose of ventilation the window should have shutter so that the room when necessary can be darken -- and green curtain some writer say that the window should have cross bar before they but if they do not descend within three foot of the floor such a arrangement can hardly be require it be highly desirable that every nursery should consist of two room open into each other or what be still better of one large room with a slide or swing partition in the middle the use of this be that the mother and child may retire to one while the other be be sweep or ventilate they would thus avoid damp air current and dust such a arrangement would also give the occupant a room fresh clean and sweet in the morning -lrb- which be a very great advantage -rrb- after have render the air of the other foul by sleep in it in winter and while there be a infant in the nursery just begin to walk it be recommend by many to cover the floor with a carpet the only advantage which they mention be that it secure the child from injury if it fall but i have seldom see lasting injury inflict by simple fall on the hard floor and there be so many objection to carpeting a nursery since it favor a accumulation of dust bad air damp grease and other impurity that it seem to I preferable to omit it many physician i must own recommend carpet during winter though not in summer and in no case unless they be well shake and air at least once a week no furniture should be admissible except the bed for the mother and child a table and a few chair with the best writer and highest authority on the subject i be decidedly of opinion that all feather bed ought effectually and forever to be exclude from nursery the reason for this prohibition will appear hereafter every nursery should if possible be free from hole or crevice otherwise the occupant will be expose to current of air and they sometimes terrible and always injurious consequence the room may in this way be keep at a lower medium temperature -- a point of very great importance cat and dog i believe be usually exclude from the nursery if not they ought to be for though the apprehension of cat suck the child 's breath be wholly groundless yet they may be provoke by the rude attack of a child to inflict upon it a lasting injury besides they assist by respiration in contaminate the air like all other animal if there be in the nursery object which from the vivacity or brilliancy of they color attract the attention of the child they should never be present to they sideways or immediately over they head the reason for this caution be that child seek and pursue almost instinctively bright object and be thus liable to contract a habit of move they eye in a oblique direction which _ may _ terminate in squint many parent seem to take great pleasure in indulge the young infant in look at these bright object especially a lamp or a candle if the child be naturally strong and vigorous no immediate perceptible injury may arise but i be confident in the opinion that the result be often quite otherwise for many week if not many month of they early existence they should not be permit to sit or lie and gaze at any bright object be it ever so weak or distant unless place exactly before they eye and even in the latter case it be better to avoid it heat be also injurious to the eye of all and of course not less so to child than to adult but when a strong light and heat be conjoin as be the case of sit around a large blaze fire -- the former custom of new england -- it be no wonder if the infantile eye become early injured no wonder that the generation now on the stage early subject to these abuse should be find almost universally in the use of spectacles this may be the most proper place for observe that great care ought to be take at the birth of the child to prevent a too sudden exposure of the tender organ of vision to the light we believe this caution be generally omit by the american physician though it be one which accord with the plainest dictate of common sense who of we have not experience the pain of emerge suddenly from the darkness of a cellar to the ordinary light of day the strongest eye of the adult be scarcely able to bear the transition how much more painful to the tender organ of the new-born infant must be the change to which it be so frequently subject and how easy it be to prevent the pain and danger of the change by more effectually darken the room into which it be introduce but we have testimony on this point a distinguished german physician state that he have know many case of permanent blindness from this very cause to which we have refer the principal of the institution for the blind at vienna say he be confident that most child who appear to be bear blind be actually make blind by neglect this same precaution chapter ii temperature general principle -- keep cool we own sensation not always to be trust thermometer why infant require more external heat than adult mean of warmth air heat in other apartment clothes take fire stove -- railing around it excess of heat -- its danger there be one general principle on this subject which be alike applicable to all person and circumstance it be to keep a little too cool rather than in the slightest degree too warm in other word the lowest temperature which be compatible with comfort be in all case best adapt to health and a slight degree of coldness provide it amount not to a chill and be not long continue be more safe than the smallest unnecessary degree of warmth but the application of this rule to those over whom we have control be not without its difficulty we own sensation be so variable independently of external and obvious cause that we can not at all time judge for other especially for infant the absolute and real state of temperature in a room can only be ascertain by the aid of a thermometer and no nursery should ever be without one it should be place however in such a situation as to indicate the real temperature of the atmosphere and not where it will give a false result no mother should forget that the infant at birth have not the power of generate heat internally to the extent which it possess afterward the lung have as yet but a feeble inefficient action the purification of the blood through they agency be not only incomplete but the heat evolve be as yet inconsiderable in the absence of internal heat then there be a increase demand externally if 60º be deem suitable for most other person the new-born infant may for a few day require 65º or even 70º much may and should be do in preserve the child in a proper temperature by means of its clothing on this point i shall speak at length in another part of this work my present purpose be simply to treat of the temperature of the nursery the best way of warm a nursery -- or indeed any other room where mere warmth be demand -- be by means of air heat in other apartment and admit through opening in the floor or fire-place the air be not only thus make more pure but every possibility of accident such as have the clothes take fire be preclude this last consideration be one of very great importance and i hope will not be much longer overlook in infantile education next to that in point of usefulness and safety be a stove place near or in the fire-place and defend by a iron railing most people prefer a open stove and on some account it be indeed preferable especially where it be desirable to burn coal still i think that the direct ray of the heat and the glare of light from open stove and fire-place particularly for the young form a very serious objection to they use one of the strongest objection to open stove and fire-place in the nursery be the increase exposure to accident i know it be say that this evil may be avoid by lay aside the use of cotton and wear nothing but worst or flannel this be indeed true but i do not like the idea of be compel to dress child in flannel or worst at all time when the least particle of fire be demand for this would be to wear this stimulate kind of clothing in we climate the greater part of the year besides i write for many mother who be compel to use cotton on account of the expense of flannel and if the stove be a close one and well defend by a railing cotton will seldom expose to danger still as have be already say the introduction of heated air from another apartment whenever it can possibly be afford be incomparably better than either stove or fire-place dr dewee be fully persuade that the excessive heat of nursery have occasion a great mortality among very young child in the first place he say it over-stimulate they and in the second it render they so susceptible of cold that any draught of cold air endanger they life they be in a constant perspiration which be frequently check by a exposure to even a atmosphere of moderate temperature if this be but to repeat what have be already say the importance of the subject seem to be a sufficient apology chapter iii ventilation general ignorance of the constitution of the atmosphere the subject briefly explain oxygen gas nitrogen carbonic acid fire candle and breathing dependent on oxygen danger from carbonic acid how it destroy people impurity of the air by means of lamp and candle other source of impurity experiment of put the candle under the bed-clothes cover the head of infant while sleep -- its danger proportion of oxygen and nitrogen in pure and impure air no wonder child become sickly particular means of ventilate room caution in regard to lamp wash iron cooking & c in a nursery they evil tendency fumigation -- camphor vinegar few people take sufficient pain to preserve the air in any of they apartment pure for few know what the constitution of we atmosphere be and in how many way and with what ease it be render impure it be not my purpose to go into a learn scientific account in this place or even in this work of the constitution of the atmosphere a few plain statement be all that be indispensable the atmosphere which we breathe be compose of two different air or gas one of these be call oxygen -lrb- footnote : oxygen gas be the chief supporter of combustion as well as of respiration it be the vital part as it be of the air no animal or vegetable could long exist without it and yet if alone unmixed it be too pure and too refine for animal to breathe nitrogen gas on the contrary while alone will not support either respiration or combustion mixed however with oxygen it dilute it and in the most happy manner fit it for reception into the lung -rrb- and the other nitrogen there be another gas usually find with these two in smaller quantity call carbonic acid gas but whether it be necessary in a very small quantity to health chemist i believe be not agree one thing however be certain -- that if any portion of it be healthful it must be very little -- not more certainly than one-fiftieth or one-hundredth of the whole mass it be by means of the oxygen it contain that air sustain life and combustion be it not for this neither fire nor candle would burn and no animal could breathe a single moment breathing consume this oxygen of the air very rapidly when the oxygen be present in about a certain proportion combustion and respiration go on well but when its natural proportion be diminish the fire do not burn so well neither do the candle and no one can breathe so freely not only be breathe and combustion impede or disturb by the diminution of oxygen in the atmosphere but just in proportion as oxygen be diminish by these two process or either of they carbonic acid be form which be not only bad for combustion but much worse for health if any considerable quantity of it be inhale it appear to be a absolute poison to the human system and if in _ very large quantity _ will often cause immediate death it be this gas accumulate in large quantity that destroy so many people in close room where there be no chimney nor any other place for the bad air to escape but it not only kill people outright -- it partly kill that be it poison more or less hundred of thousand in a nursery there be the mother and child and perhaps the nurse to render the air impure by breathe the fire and the lamp or candle to contribute to the same result besides several other cause not yet mention one of these be nearly related to the former i allude to the fact that we skin by perspiration and by other means be a source of much impurity to the atmosphere a fact which will be more fully explain and illustrate in the chapter on bathing and cleanliness it be only necessary to say in this place that it be not the matter of perspiration alone which issue from the skin render the air impure there be other exhalation more or less constantly go off from every living body especially from the lung and carbonic acid gas be even form all over the surface of the skin as well as by means of the lung one need no better proof that carbonic acid be form on the surface of the body than the fact that after the body have be closely cover all night if you introduce a candle under the bed-clothes into this confine air it will be quickly extinguish because there be too much carbonic acid gas there and too little oxygen we may hence see at once the evil of cover the head of infant when they lie down -- a very common practice the air when pure contain a little more than 20 part of oxygen and a little less than 80 of nitrogen breathing this air as i have already show consume the oxygen which be so necessary to life and health and leave in its place a increase of nitrogen and carbonic acid gas which be not necessary to health and the latter of which be even positively injurious but when the oxygen instead of form 20 or more part in 100 of the atmosphere of the nursery be reduce to 15 or 18 part only and the carbonic acid gas be increase from 1 or 2 part in 100 to 5 6 8 or 10 -- when to this be add the other noxious exhalation from the body and from the lamp or candle fire-place feather bed stagnant fluid in the room & c & c -- be it any wonder that child in the end become sickly what else could be expect but that the seed of disease thus early sown should in due time spring up and produce they appropriate fruit it be sometimes say that fire in a room purify it it undoubtedly do so to a certain extent if fresh air be often admit but not otherwise i have class feather bed among the common cause of impurity dr dewee also condemn they most decidedly and give substantial reason for drive they out of the nursery in speaking of the structure of the room use for a nursery i have advert to the importance of have a large or double room with slide door between in order that the occupant may go into one of they while the other be be ventilate but whatever may be the structure of the room the circumstance of the occupant or the state of the weather every nursery ought to be most thoroughly ventilate once a day at least and when the weather be tolerable twice a day if there be but one apartment and fear be entertain of the dampness of the fresh air introduce or of current and if the mother and babe can not retire there be a last resort which be for they to get into bed and cover themselves a short time with the clothing for though i have prohibit the covering of the face with the bed-clothes for any considerable length of time together yet to do so for some fifteen or twenty minute be a evil of far less magnitude than to suffer a apartment to remain without be ventilate for twenty-four hour together -- a very common occurrence when a lamp be keep burn in a nursery during the night it should always be place at the door of the stove or in the chimney place that its smoke and the bad air or gas which be form may escape but it be better in general to avoid burn lamp or candle during the night by means of common match a light may be produce when necessary almost instantly especially if you have a spirit lamp in the nursery or what be still better one of spirit gas -- that be a mixture of alcohol and turpentine it be highly desirable that all wash ironing and cooking should be avoid in the nursery they load the air with noxious effluvium or vapor or with particle of dust none of which ought ever to enter the delicate lung of a infant fumigation with camphor vinegar and other similar substance have long be in reputation as a means of purify the air in sick-room and nursery but they be of very little consequence fresh air if it can be have be always better chapter iv the child 's dress general

11 dress of girl -- should be loose temperature exposure to the night air dress serve three important purpose : -- 1 to cover we 2 to defend we against cold 3 to defend we body and limb from injury there be one more purpose of dress in case of deformity it seem to improve the appearance in all we arrangement in regard to dress whether of child or of adult we should ever keep in mind the above principle the form fashion material application and quantity of all clothing especially for infant ought to be regulate by these three or four rule the subject of this chapter be one of so much importance and embrace such a variety of item that it will be more convenient both to the reader and myself to consider it under several minor head sec 1 _ swathe the body _ buffon in he natural history say that in france a infant have hardly enjoy the liberty of move and stretch its limb before it be put into confinement it be swathe say he its head be fix its leg be stretch out at full length and its arm place straight down by the side of its body in this manner it be bind tight with cloth and bandage so that it can not stir a limb indeed it be fortunate that the poor thing be not muffle up so as to be unable to breathe all swathe except with a single bandage around the abdomen be decidedly unreasonable injurious and cruel i do not pretend that the remark of m buffon be fully applicable to the condition of infant in the united state the good sense of the community nowhere permit we to transform a beautiful babe quite into a egyptian mummy still there be many considerable error on the subject of infantile dress which in the progress of my remark i shall find it necessary to expose the use of a simple band can not be object to it afford a general support to the abdomen and a particular one to the _ umbilicus _ the last point be one of great importance where there be any tendency to a rupture at this part of the body -- a tendency which very often exist in feeble child and without some support of this kind cry cough sneeze and strain in any way might greatly aggravate the evil if not produce serious consequence but in order to afford a support to the abdomen in the best manner it be by no means necessary that the bandage should be draw very tight two third of the nurse in this country greatly err in this respect and suppose that the more tightly a bandage be draw the better it should be firm but yet gently yield and therefore a piece of flannel cut bias as it be term or obliquely with respect to the thread of which it be compose be the most appropriate material if the attention of the mother be necessary nowhere else it would be indispensable in the application of this article if she do not take special pain to prevent it the err though well mean nurse may so compress the body with the bandage as to produce pain and uneasiness and sometimes severe colic nay worse evil than even this have be know to arise when a child sneeze or cough or cry the abdomen should naturally yield gently but if it be so confine that it can not yield where the band be apply it will yield in a unnatural proportion below to the great danger of produce a species of rupture no less troublesome than the one which such tight swathing be design to prevent but besides the bandage already mention no other restraint of the body and limb of a child be at all admissible the creator have kindly ordain that the human body and limb and especially its muscle or move power shall be develop by exercise confine a arm or a leg even in a child of ten year of age and the limb will not increase either in strength or size as it otherwise would because its muscle be not exercise and the fact be still more obvious in infancy there be a still deeper evil on all the limb be fix two set of muscle one to extend the other to draw up or bend the limb if you keep a limb extend for a considerable time you weaken the one set of muscle if you keep it bent you weaken the other this weakness may become so great that the limb will be render useless there be case on record -- well authenticate -- where child by be oblige to sit in one place on a hard floor have be make cripple for life hundred of other be injure though they may not become absolutely cripple i repeat it therefore they dress should be so free and loose that they may use they little limb they neck and they body as much as they please and in every desire direction the practice of confine they arm while they lie down for fear they should scratch themselves with they nail and of pin the clothes round they foot be therefore highly reprehensible better that they should even occasionally scratch themselves with they nail than that they should be make the victim of injurious restraint who would think of tie up or muffle the young lamb or kid and even the young plant -- what think you would be the effect if its leaf and branch could not move gently with the soft breeze would the fluid circulate and health be promote : or would they stagnate and a morbid sickly and dwarfish state be the consequence those whose object be to make infancy as well as any other period of existence a season of happiness will not fail to find a additional motive for give the little stranger entire freedom in the land whither he have so recently arrive especially when he seem to enjoy it so much who can be so harden as to confine he unless compel by the most pressing necessity sec 2 _ form of the dress _ on this subject a writer in the london literary gazette of some eight or ten year ago lay down the follow general direction to which in cold weather there can be but one possible objection which be they be not _ alamode _ and be not therefore likely to be follow all that a child require so far as regard clothing in the first month of its existence be a simple cover for the trunk and extremity of the body make of a material soft and agreeable to the skin and which can retain in a equable degree the animal temperature these quality be to be find in perfection in fine flannel and i recommend that the only clothing for the first month or six week be a square piece of flannel large enough to involve fully and overlap the whole of the babe with the exception of the head which should be leave totally uncover this wrapper should be fix by a button near the breast and leave so loose as to permit the arm and leg to be freely stretch and move in every direction it should be succeed by a loose flannel gown with sleeve which should be worn till the end of the second month after which it may be change to the common clothing use by child of this age the advantage of such a dress be that the movement of the infant will be as we have already see free and unrestrained and we shall escape the misery of hear the scream which now so frequently accompany the dress and undress of almost every child no chafing from friction moreover can occur and as the insensible perspiration be in this way promote over the whole surface of the body the sympathy between the stomach and skin be happily maintain a healthy sympathy of this kind duly keep up do much towards preserve the stomach in a good state and the skin from eruption and sore but as i apprehend that christianity be not yet very deeply root in the mind and heart of parent i have already express my doubt whether they be prepare to receive and profit by advice at once rational and physiological still i can not help hope that i shall succeed in persuade mother to have every part of a child 's dress perfectly loose except the band already refer to and that should be but moderately tight common humanity ought to teach we better than to put the body of a helpless infant into a _ vise _ and press it to death as the first mark of we attention who have not be strike with a strange inconsistency in the conduct of mother and nurse who while they be so exceedingly tender towards the infant in some point as to injure it by they kindness be yet almost insensible to its cry of distress while dress it so far indeed be they from feel emotion of pity that they often make light of its cry regard they as sign of health and vigor there can be no doubt i confess that the first cry of a infant if strong both indicate and promote a healthy state of the lung to a certain extent but there will always be unavoidable occasion enough for cry to promote health even after we have do all we can in the way of avoid pain they who only draw the child 's dress the tighter the more it cry be guilty of a crime of little less enormity than murder think say dr buchan of the immense number of child that die of convulsion soon after birth and be assure that these -lrb- its cry -rrb- be much oftener owe to galling pressure or some external injury than to any inward cause this same writer add that he have know a child which be seize with convulsion fit soon after be swaddle immediately relieve by take off the roller and bandage and he say that a loose dress prevent the return of the disease i think it be obvious that the utmost extent to which we ought to go in yield to the fashion as it regard form be to use three piece of clothing -- the shirt the petticoat and the frock all of which must be as loose as possible and before the infant begin to crawl about much the latter should be long for the salve of cover the foot and leg at four or five year of age loose trowser with boy may be substitute for the petticoat but it be a question whether something like the frock might not with every individual be usefully retain through life i wish it be unnecessary in a book like this to join in the general complaint against tight lace any part of the body but especially the chest but as this work of torture be sometimes begin almost from the cradle and as prevention be better than cure the hope of prevent that for which no cure appear yet to have be find lead I to make a few remark on the subject as it have long be my opinion that one reason why mother continue to overlook the subject be that they do not understand the structure and motion of the chest i have attempt the follow explanation and illustration i have already say that if we bandage tightly for a considerable time any part of the human frame it be apt to become weaker the more a portion of the frame which be furnish with muscle those curious instrument of motion be use provide it be not _ over _ - exert the more vigorous it be bind up a arm or a hand or a foot and keep it bind for twelve hour of the day for many year and think you it will be as strong as it otherwise would have be fact prove the contrary the chinese swathe the foot of they infant female and they be not only small but weak i have say they foot be smaller for be bandage so be a hand or a arm action -- healthy constant action -- be indispensable to the perfect development of the body and limb why it be so be another thing but so it be and it be a principle or law of the great creator which can not be evade more than this if you bind some part of the body tightly so as to compress they as much as you can without produce actual pain you will find that the part not only cease to grow but actually dwindle away i have see this try again and again even the solid part perish under pressure when a person first wear a false head of hair the clasp which rest upon the head at the upper part of the forehead be new and elastic and press rather closely will in a few month often make quite a indentation in the cranium or bone of the head now be it probable -- nay be it possible -- that the lung especially those of young person can expand and come to they full and natural size under pressure even though the pressure should be slight must they not be weaken and if the pressure be strong as it sometimes be must they not dwindle away we know too from the nature and structure of the lung themselves that tight lacing must injure they many mother have very imperfect notion of what physician mean when they say that corset impede the circulation by prevent the full and undisturbed action of the lung they get no higher idea of the _ motion _ of the _ chest _ than what be connect with bend the body forward and backward from right to left & c they know that if dress too tightly _ this _ motion be not so free as it otherwise would be but if they be not so closely lace as to prevent that free bend of the body of which i have be speak they think there can be no danger or at least none of consequence now it happen that this sort of motion be not that to which physician refer when they complain of corset strictly speak this bend of the whole body be perform by the muscle of the back and not those of the chest the latter have very little to do with it it be true that even _ this _ motion ought not to be hinder but if it be the evil be one of little comparative magnitude every time we breathe naturally all the rib together with the breast bone have motion the rib rise and spread a little outward especially towards the fore part the breast bone not only rise but swing forward a little like a pendulum but the moment the chest be swathe or bandage this motion must be hinder and the more in proportion to the tightness on this point those person make a sad mistake who say that a busk not too wide nor too rigid seem to correspond to the support spine and to assist rather than impede the effort of nature to keep the body erect can we seriously compare the office of the spine with those of the rib and suppose that because the former be fix like a post at the back part of the lung therefore a artificial post in front would be useful why we might just as well argue in favor of hang weight to a door or a clog to a pendulum in order to make it swing backwards and forwards more easily we might almost as well say that the elbow ought to be make firm to correspond with the shoulder and thus become advocate for let the stay or bandage enclose the arm above the elbow and fasten it firmly to the side indeed the consequence in the latter case aside from a little inconvenience would not be half so destructive to health as in the former the rib where they join to the back bone form hinge and hinge be make for motion but if you fasten they to a post in front of what value be the hinge if mother ask of what use this motion of the lung be it be only necessary to refer they to the chapter on ventilation in which i trust the subject be make intelligible and a satisfactory answer afford but i might appeal to fact let we look at female around we generally do they countenance indicate that they enjoy as good health as they do when dress be wear more loosely have they not oftener a leaden hue as if the blood in they be darker be they not oftener short-breathed than formerly as they advance in life have they not more chronic disease be not they chest smaller and weaker and as the doctrine that if one member suffer all the other member suffer with it be not less true in physiology than in moral do we not find other organ besides the lung weaken surgeon and physician who like faithful sentinel have watch at they post half a century tell we moreover that if these foolish and injurious practice to which i refer be tolerate two century longer every female will be deform and the whole race greatly degenerate physically and morally those with whom no argument will avail be recommend to read the follow remark from the first volume of the library of health p 119 : it be relate on the authority of macgill that in tuni after a girl be engage or betroth she be then _ fatten _ for this purpose she be coop up in a small room and shackle of gold and silver be place upon she ancle and wrist as a piece of dress if she be to be marry to a man who have discharge despatch or lose a former wife the shackle which the former wife wear be put on the new bride 's limb and she be feed till they be fill up to a proper thickness the food use for this custom worthy of the barbarian be call _ drough _ which be of a extraordinary fattening quality and also famous for render the milk of the nurse rich and abundant with this and they national dish _ cuscasoo _ the bride be literally cram and many actually die under the spoon we laugh at all this and well we may but there be custom not very far from home no less ridiculous there be a country four or five thousand mile westward of tuni where the female to a very great extent be emaciate for marriage instead be fatten this process be begin in part by shackle -- not of gold and silver perhaps but of wood -- but instead of be put on loosely and cause the body or limb to fill they they be make to compress the body in the outset and as the size of the latter diminish the shackle be contract or tighten as with the eastern so with the western female many of they die under the process though a far greater number die at a remote period as the consequence of it sec 3 _ material _ i have already commit myself to the reader as favor the use of soft flannel in cold weather especially for child who be not yet able to run about freely in the open air the advantage of a early use of this material at least for under-clothes be numerous the follow be a few of they 1 flannel next to the skin be a pleasant flesh brush keep up a gentle and equable irritation and promote perspiration and every other function which it be the office of the skin to perform or assist in perform 2 it guard the body against the cooling effect of evaporation when in a state of profuse perspiration 3 by prevent the heat of the body from escape too rapidly it keep up a steadier temperature on the surface than any other known substance the importance of the last consideration be greater in a climate like we own than elsewhere but there be limit to the use of this article of clothing whenever the temperature of the atmosphere be so great even without artificial heat that we no longer wish to retain the heat of the body by the clothing then all flannel should be remove at once and linen should be substitute take care to replace the flannel whenever the temperature of the atmosphere as indicate by the thermometer or by the child 's feeling may seem to require it it should also be keep clean there be a very general mistake abroad on this subject many suppose that flannel can be worn longer without wash than other kind of cloth on the contrary it should be change oftener than cotton or even linen because it will absorb a great deal of fluid especially the matter of perspiration which if long retain be believe to ferment and produce unhealthy if not poisonous gas for this reason too flannel for child 's clothing should be white that it may show dirt the more readily and obtain the more frequent wash although it be for this very reason -- its liability to exhibit the least particle of dirt -- that it be commonly reject one caution more in regard to the use of flannel may be necessary with some child owe to a peculiarity of constitution flannel will produce eruption on the skin which be very troublesome whenever this be the case the flannel should be immediately lay aside upon which the eruption usually disappear if parent would take proper pain to get the lighter softer kind of flannel for this purpose and be particular about its looseness and quantity i should prefer as i have already intimate to have very young child in we climate wear this material the greater part of the year except perhaps July and August my reason for this course would be first that i like the stimulus of soft flannel on the skin if change sufficiently often better than that of any other kind of clothing secondly cotton be so liable to take fire that its use in the nursery and among little child seem very hazardous thirdly silk be not quite the appropriate material as a general thing besides be too expensive and fourthly linen be not warm enough except in mid-summer except therefore in July and August and in case of idiosyncracy such as have just be allude to i would use flannel for the under-clothes of young child throughout the year but whenever they acquire sufficient strength to walk and run and play much in the open air i would gradually lay aside the use of all flannel even in winter great attention however must be pay to the _ quantity _ the parent who guide by this rule should keep on she child the same amount of flannel and of the same thickness from January to June 30th and then on the first of July should suddenly exchange it for thin linen in moderate quantity might find trouble from it it be better to make the change more gradually otherwise whatever may be the material of the dress the child will be likely to suffer sec 4 _ quantity _ the quantity of clothing use by different individual of the same age in the same climate possess constitution nearly alike and follow similar occupation be so different as to strike we with surprise when we first observe the fact one will wear nothing but a coarse linen or cotton shirt coarse coat waistcoat and pantaloons and boot in the coldest weather he never unless it be on the sabbath put on even a cravat and never in any case stocking or mitten another in similar circumstance in all respects constantly wear he thick stocking flannel wrapper and drawer and cravat and seldom go out in cold weather without mitten and a overcoat he be not a whit warmer : indeed he often suffer more from the cold than he neighbor who dress in the manner just describe why all this difference it be no doubt the result of habit any individual may accustom himself to much or little clothing and the earlier the habit be begin the greater be its influence some person observe how little clothing one may accustom himself to use and yet be comfortable have tell we that so far as mere temperature be concern we need no clothing at all they relate the story of the scythian and alexander alexander ask the former how he could go without clothes in such a cold climate he reply by ask alexander how he could go with he face naked habit reconcile we to this be the reply think I then _ all _ face say the scythian but admit that certain individual and even a few rude tribe have go without clothing do they therefore follow in this respect the intention of nature the greatest stickler for adhering to nature 's plan can not prove this analogy be against it most of the other animal even in hot climate be furnish with a hairy cover from the first and in cold climate the author of they being have even provide they with a increase of clothing for the winter they fur on the approach of cold weather not only become whiter and therefore conduct the heat away from the body more slowly but as every dealer in fur well understand it become softer and thicker and yet the blood of the furred animal of cold country be as warm as ours if not warmer the inference which it seem to I we ought to make from this be that if other animal require clothing and even a change of clothing so do man and that as the creator have leave he to provide by he own ingenuity for a great many of he want instead of furnish he with instinct to direct he so in relation to dress and even if it could be prove that dress be naturally unnecessary with reference to temperature i should still defend its use on other principle the few speculative mind therefore that in the vagary of they fancy but never in they practice reject it be not to be regard the principle lay down in the commencement of the chapter on temperature be the great principle which should guide we in regard to dress but although we should always keep a little too cool rather than a little too warm it be by no means desirable to be cold any degree of chilliness long continue interrupt the function which the skin ought to perform and thus produce mischief the same rule in this respect apply to eat as well as to dress it be better to eat a little less than nature require than a little more it be a generally receive opinion however that mankind frequently at least in this country eat about twice as much as health require this be owe to habit and perhaps the power of the latter be as great in this respect as in regard to dress the great point in regard to food or dress be to _ begin _ right and observe what nature require -- study at the same time the testimony of other -- to endeavor to keep within the bound she have assign it have already be more than intimate that if the nursery be keep in a proper temperature a single loose piece of dress be for some time all that be require in pursuance of this principle through life i believe few person would be find who would need more at one time than a single suit of woollen clothes even in the severest winter of we northern climate i have always observe that they who wear the greatest amount of clothing be most subject to cold there be obvious reason why it should be so this then if a fact be one of the strongest reason in favor of acquire a habit of go as thinly clothe as we possibly can and not at the same time feel any inconvenience but after all whether it be winter or summer we must vary we clothing with the variation of the weather as indicate by the thermometer and we own feeling sometimes in we ever-changing and ever-changeable climate it may be necessary to vary we dress three or four time a day some cry out against this practice as dangerous but i have never find it so i have know person who make it a constant practice and i never find that they sustain any injury from it except the loss of a little time and the increase of comfort be more than enough to compensate for that there be one thing to be avoid however whether we change we clothing -- we linen especially -- twice a day or only twice a week -- which be _ dampness _ sec 5 _ cap _ the practice of put cap on infant be happily go by and perhaps it may be think unnecessary for I to dwell a single moment on the subject but as the practice still prevail in some part of the country it may be well to bestow upon it a few pass remark many mother have not consider that the circulation of the blood in young infant be peculiarly active that a large amount of blood be at that period carry to the head that in consequence of this the head be proportionably hotter than in adult and that from this source arise the tendency of very young child to brain-fever dropsy in the head and other disease of this part of the system but these be most undoubted fact hence one reason why the head of infant should be keep as cool as possible and though a thin cap confines less heat than a thick head of hair do when they be older yet they be less able to bear it the truth be that nature furnish a cover for the head just about as fast as a cover be require and the child 's safety will permit at the present day few person will probably be find who will defend the utility of cap any longer than till the hair be grow the general apology for they use after this period and indeed in most instance before be that they look pretty what would people say to see my darling without a cap but when the head be keep from the first totally uncover the hair grow more rapidly dandruff and other scurfy disease rarely attack the scalp catarrh snuffle and other similar complaint and above all dropsy in the head seldom show themselves and the period of cut tooth that most dangerous period in the life of a infant be pass over with much more safety nothing but custom say a foreign writer can reconcile we to the cap with all its lace and trumpery ornament on the beautiful head of a child and i would ask any one to say candidly whether he think the child in the picture of titian and raffaelle would be improve by have they head cover with cap instead of the silken curl -- the adornment of nature -- which cluster round they smile face if there be no other reason for disuse cap for infant but the improvement which it produce in the _ appearance _ of the child i would maintain that this be a sufficient inducement and i concur with he fully as to the notion -- now i hope nearly explode -- that it be necessary to cover up the open of the head as it be call nothing can be more idle this part of the head require no more cover than any other part and if it do all the dress in the world could not affect it in the least except to retard the growth of the bone which in due time ought to close up the space and this effect anything which keep the head too hot might help to produce of the folly of wet the head with spirit or any other medicated lotion and of make daily effort to bring it into shape it be unnecessary to speak in the present chapter sec 6 _ hat and bonnet _ the hat wear in this country be almost universally too warm but if it be a great mistake in adult to wear thick heavy hat it be much more so in the case of child the infant in the nursery as we have already see need no covering of the kind it be absolutely necessary that the head should be keep as cool as possible and absolutely dangerous to cover it too warmly at a later period however the danger greatly diminish because the circulation of the blood become more equal and do not tend so much towards the brain still however the head be hotter than the limb especially the hand and foot and i can not help think that the hair be the only cover which be perfectly safe either in childhood or age except in the sunshine or in the storm there may be -- there probably be -- some danger in go without hat or bonnet in the hot sun though i have know many child and some grown person who be constantly expose in this way and yet appear not to suffer from it but this may be the proper place to state that we be ever in great danger of deceive ourselves on this subject if the individual who follow practice usually regard as pernicious while they habit in other respects be just like those of other person around they who have similar strength & c of constitution -- if these individual i say be wholly to escape disease through life or if they be to be so much more free from it and live to a age so much greater than other as to constitute a striking and obvious difference in they favor we might then safely argue that the practice which they follow be at least without danger if not of obvious advantage but when we see they beset with ill like other people it be not safe to pronounce they habit favorable to health since it be impossible to know whether some of the ill which they suffer be not produce by they these remark be applicable to the disuse of any cover for the head in the sun and in the rain for you will find those who adopt this practice from early infancy -lrb- footnote : i say from early infancy because we may adopt the best habit in mature year after we constitution have be break up by error and vice without effect anything more than to keep we from actually sink at once indeed in most case we ought not to expect more -rrb- subject to as many disease as those around they with similar constitution but with habit somewhat different and as we disease be generally the consequence of we error in one way or another it be impossible to say with certainty that some of they might not have arise from exposure of the head i should not hesitate therefore to advise all mother to put a light hat or bonnet on the head of they child whenever they be to be expose to the direct ray of the summer sun or to the rain and as we can not always foresee when and where these exposure will arise and as it be believe that these covering if light will never be productive of much injury while we be abroad in the open air it will follow that it be better to wear than to omit they but while i contend for they use as consistent with health and sound philosophy i must not be understand as admit the use of such hat as be wear at present even by child they be as i have say before too hot what should be substitute i be unable to determine but until something can be supply which would not be half so oppressive as we common wool hat i should regard it as the lesser evil to omit they entirely the danger of go bare-headed if the practice be commence early we know from the custom of some savage nation can never be very great sec 7 _ cover for the foot _ the same reason for avoid the use of any cover for the head in early infancy be a sufficient reason for cover the foot well for just in proportion as the blood be send to the head in superabundance and keep up in it a undue degree of heat just in the same proportion be it send to the foot in too _ small _ a quantity leave these part liable to cold now it be a fundamental law with medical man that the foot ought to be keep warmer than the head if possible especially while the child be very young and expose to brain disease so long therefore as child be young and unable to exercise they foot stocking ought to be use both in summer and winter but i prefer to have they short unless long one can be use without garter everything in the shape of a garter or ligature round the limb body or neck of a child except a single body-band already mention in another chapter ought forever to be banish it have often be object i know that stocking will make the foot tender but as no child be ever harden by _ continue _ and severe cold apply to any part of the body but the contrary so no one be ever make more tender by be keep moderately warm excess of heat like excess of cold will alike weaken either child or adult but there be little danger of heat the foot and leg of infant too much during the first year of infancy it be also say that stocking be apt to receive and retain wet but as i shall show in another place that wet clothes should be frequently change this objection would be equally strong against wear coat and diaper as to shoe there be some variety of opinion among medical man a few hold that they cramp the foot and prevent child from learn to walk as early as they otherwise would if it be best for child that they should learn to walk as early as possible the last objection might have weight but it seem to I not at all desirable to be in haste about they walk indeed i greatly prefer to retard they progress in this respect rather than to hasten it as to the first objection that shoe cramp the foot too much nearly its whole force turn upon the question whether they be make of proper material or not there be no need of make they of cow-hide or any other thick leather the sole be the most important part these will defend the foot against pin needle and such other sharp substance as be usually find on the floor and the upper part of the shoe so long as the wearer remain in the nursery may be make of the softest and most yielding material -- even of cloth infant ' shoe should always be make on two last one for each foot the philosopher locke hold that in order to harden the young they shoe ought to be so that they might leak and let in water whenever they come near it there may be and probably be no harm in have a child wet he foot occasionally provide he be soon supply with dry stocking again but it be hazardous for either child or adult to go too long in wet stocking and especially to sit long in they after they have be use much active exercise i be in favor of good substantial shoe and stocking for people of all age and condition and at all season and believe it entirely in accordance with sound economy and the law of the human constitution sec 8 _ pin _ the custom of use ten or a dozen pin in the dress of child ought by all means to be set aside they not only often wind the skin but they have occasionally be know to penetrate the body and the joint of the limb so many of these dreadful accident occur and where no accident happen so much pain be occasionally give by they sharp point to the little sufferer who can not tell what the matter be that it be quite time the practice be abolish do you ask what can be substitute -- the follow mode be adopt by dr dewee in he own family as mention in he work on the physical and medical treatment of child at page 86 the belly-band and the petticoat have string and not a single pin be use in they adjustment the little shirt which be always make much larger than the infant 's body be fold on the back and bosom and these fold keep in they place by properly adjust the body of the petticoat : so far not a pin be use the diaper require one but this should be of a large size and make to serve the double purpose of hold the fold of this article as well as keep the belly-band in its proper place the latter have a small tag of double linen depend from its lower margin by which it be secure to the diaper by the same pin should a extraordinary display of best ` bib and tucker ' be require upon any special occasion a third pin may be admit to ensure the well-sitting of the ` frock ' waist in front -- this last pin however be apply externally so that the risk of its get into the child 's body be very small even if it should become displaced the writer from whom the last two paragraph be take say be have see needle substitute for pin and relate a long story of a child whose life be well nigh destroy in this manner it undergo month of ill health and many moment of excruciating agony before the cause of its trouble be suspect sometimes its distress be so great that nothing but large dose of laudanum sufficient to stupify it could afford the least relief at last a tumor be discover by the attend physician near one of the bone on which we sit and a needle be extract two inch long the needle have be put in its clothes and by slip into the fold of the skin have insinuate itself unperceived into the child 's body it be please to add that although the little sufferer have now be ill seven or eight month and have endure almost everything but death -- fever diarrhoea and the most excruciating pain -- it soon recover this shocking circumstance be enough one would think to deter every mother or nurse who become acquaint with it from use needle in infant ' clothes happy would it be if in banish needle they would contrive to banish pin also and adopt either the plan of dr dewee or one still more rational sec 9 _ remain wet _ on the subject of change the wet clothing of a child there be a strange and monstrous error abroad which be that by suffer they to remain wet and cold we harden the constitution the filthiness of this practice be enough to condemn it be there nothing else to be say against it it be insist on by many i know that as water which be salt when it be apply to the skin and suffer to remain long while it secure the point of harden the child prevent all possibility of its take cold it hence follow that wet diaper be not injurious but this be a mistake every time a infant be allow to remain wet we not only endanger its take cold but expose it to excoriation of the skin if not to serious and dangerous inflammation in short if frequent change be not make whatever some mother and nurse may think they may rest assure that the health of the child must sooner or later suffer as the consequence nor be it enough to hang up a diaper by the fire and as soon as it be dry apply it again it should be clean as well as dry let we not be tell that it be troublesome to wash so often everything be in a certain sense troublesome everything in this world which be worth have be the result of toil nothing but absolute poverty afford the shadow of a excuse for neglect anything which will promote the health or even the comfort of the tender infant of the impropriety and danger of suffer wet clothes to dry upon we i shall speak elsewhere as well as of the evil of suffer child to remain dirty -- they skin or they clothing sec 10 _ remark on the dress of boy _ whatever tend to disturb the growth of the body or hinder the free exercise of the limb during the infancy and childhood of both sex be injurious and as every mother have the control of these thing i have think it desirable to append to this chapter a few thought on the particular dress of each sex i begin with that of boy nothing can be more injurious to health say a foreign writer than the tight jacket button up to the throat the well-fitted boot and the stiff stock and he remark be nearly as applicable to this country as to england the consequence of this preposterous method of dress boy be diminutive manhood deformity of person and a constitution either already imbue with disease or highly susceptible of its impression no part of the modern dress of boy be more absurd than the stiff stock or thick cravat it be not only injurious by press on the _ jugular _ vein and prevent the blood from freely pass out of the head but by constantly press on the numerous and complex muscle of the neck at this period of life it prevent they development because whatever hinder the action of the muscular part hinder they growth and make they even appear as if waste it would be a great improvement if this part of dress be wholly discard and when be there so appropriate a time for set it aside as _ before we begin to use it _ or rather while we be under the more immediate care of we mother the use of jacket button up to the throat except in cold weather be objectionable but this be very fortunately go out of fashion boot if use at all should fit well to this there can be no possible objection what the writer whom i have quote refer to be probably the tight boot wear to prevent the foot from be large and unseemly but produce as tight boot inevitably do a injurious effect upon the muscle a constrain walk and corn what can be more painful than to see little boy -- yes _ little _ boy -- boy neither fifteen nor twenty nor twenty-five walk as if they be fetter and truss up for the spit unable to look down or turn they head on account of a thick stock or two or three cravat pile on the top of each other -- and only capable of use they arm to dangle a cane or carry a umbrella as they hobble along perhaps on a hot sun-shiny day in July or August but this evil you who be mother have it very generally in you power to prevent if you be only wise enough to secure that ascendancy over you child 's mind which the author of they nature design at the least you can prevent it for a time -- the most important period too -- by you own authority this you will not need any urge to induce you to do if you ever become thoroughly convince of its pre-eminent folly sec 11 _ on the dress of girl _ the same general principle which should guide the young mother in regard to the dress of boy be equally important and applicable in the management of girl the whole dress should as much as possible hang loosely from the shoulder without press on the body or any part of it this i say be the grand point to be aim at and this be the only great principle whatever some mother may think which will lead to true beauty of person and gracefulness of gesture there be however a slight difference to be make between the dress of girl and that of boy the greater delicacy of the female frame require that the surface of the body should be keep rather warmer as well as better protect from the vicissitude of the atmosphere but be this the fact be not the contrary true while boy in the winter be clothe in warm woollen vestment cover every part of they trunk many portion of the female frame and especially many part of they limb be leave so much expose that in cold weather you scarcely find a girl abroad who appear to be comfortable nay they be not only uncomfortable abroad but at home and if i be to present to mother in detail a tenth of the evil which they daughter suffer from not adopt a warmer method of clothing i should probably be stare at by some and laugh at by other all this too without speaking of go out of warm concert room theater ball room and lecture room into the night air or out of school room and church to walk home with measure and stiffen pace lest the sin unpardonable of walk swiftly or run -- that active exercise which health require which youthful feeling prompt and which duty ought to inspire -- should unwarily be commit the tremendous evil of confine the lung have be advert to at sufficient length in reference to that general subject i need only add that if the chest be not duly exercise and expand the liver the lung the stomach digestion absorption circulation and perspiration be all hinder and even so far as the various internal organ of the body _ be _ active they act at a great disadvantage the blood which they work up be bad blood and must be so as long as the lung do not have free play hence may and do arise all sort of disease especially disease of obstruction and such as be often very difficult of removal what can be a more pitiable sight than some modern girl go home from school or church in winter thinly clothe the blood be all drive from the surface upon the internal organ and what remain be so load with carbon which the lung ought but can not discharge that she skin have a leaden hue she tooth chatter she very heart be chill in she panting frozen bosom she can not run and if she could she must not for it would be vulgar every mother should shrink from the sight of such a picture chapter v cleanliness physiology of the human skin of check perspiration disease thus produce dirt not healthy how the mistake originate smell of the earth effect of uncleanliness on the moral filthiness produce bowel complaint change dress for the sake of cleanliness no mother will ever pay that attention to cleanliness which its importance to health and happiness demand till she perceive its necessity and she will never perceive that necessity till she have study attentively the machinery of the human frame -- and especially its wonderful cover the skin be pierce with little opening or _ pore _ so numerous that some have reckon they at a million to every square inch at all event they be so small that the naked eye can neither distinguish nor count they and so numerous that we can not pierce the skin with the finest needle without hit one or more of they when we be in perfect health and the skin clean a gentle moisture or mist continually ooze through these pore this process be call _ perspiration _ and the moisture which thus escape the _ matter _ of perspiration perspiration may be check in two way 1 by filth on the skin 2 by what be commonly call take cold -- for take cold essentially consist in chill the skin to such a degree as to stop for some time the escape of this moisture most person have doubtless observe that in the first stage of a cold they frequently have a very dry skin whereas when we be in health the skin usually feel moist we health be not only endanger and a foundation lay for fever rheumatism and consumption by stop the pore of the skin with dirt or anything else but there be also danger from another and a very different source the blood in its circulation through the body be constantly become impure and as it thus come back impure to the heart be as constantly send to the lung where it come in close contact with the air which we breathe and be purify but this same purifying process which go on in the lung go on too if the skin be in a pure free healthy condition all over the surface of the body if it be not -- if the skin can not do this part of the work -- a additional burden be thus lay on the lung which in this way soon become so overworked that they can not perform they own proportion of the labor and whenever this happen the health must soon suffer the strange belief that dirt be healthy have much influence on the daily practice of thousand of those who be ignorant of the human structure and the law which govern and regulate the animal economy it have probably originate in the well-known fact that those child who be allow to play in the dirt be often as healthy -- and even _ more _ healthy -- than those who be confine to the nursery or the parlor now while it be admit that this be a very common case it be yet believe that the former class of child would be still more vigorous than they now be if they be keep more cleanly or be at least frequently wash it be not the dirt which promote they health but they active exercise in the open air the advantage of which be more than sufficient to compensate for the injury which they sustain from the dirt that be to say they retain in spite of the dirt better health than those who be deny the blessing of pure air and abundant exercise and subject to the opposite extreme of almost constant confinement there be something deceitful after all in the ruddy bloom appearance of those child who be leave by the busy parent to play in the road or field without attention to cleanliness if this be not so how come it to pass that they suffer much more not only from chronic but from acute disease than child whose parent be in better circumstance i be the more solicitous to combat a belief in the salutary tendency of a unclean skin because i know it prevail to some extent and because i know also both from reason and from fact that it be a gross error it be however true that year sometimes intervene before the evil consequence of dirtiness appear the office of the vessel of the skin be interrupt a increase of action be impose on other part especially on those internal organ commonly call gland which action be apt to settle into obstinate disease hence at least when aid by other cause often arise in later life after the source of the evil be forget if it be ever suspect rheumatism scrofula jaundice and even consumption there be a strange notion abroad that the _ smell _ of the earth be beneficial especially to consumptive person i honestly believe however that it be more likely to create consumption than to cure it besides in what do this smell consist do the silex the alumine and the other earth with they compound emit any odor rarely i believe unless when mix with vegetable matter but no gas necessary to health be evolve during the decomposition of vegetable matter on the contrary it be well know that many of they tend to induce disease i be thoroughly persuade that too much attention can not be pay to cleanliness and the demand for such attention be equally imperious in the case of those who cultivate the earth or labor in it or on stone during the interval of they useful avocation as in the case of those individual who follow other employment i must also protest against the doctrine that the smell or taste of the earth much less a coat of it spread over the surface and close up for hour and day together thousand and million of those little pore with which the author of this wondrous frame have pierce the skin can have a salutary tendency the opinion have be even maintain that uncleanly habit be not only unfavorable to health but to morality there can be no doubt that he who neglect he person and dress will be find lower in the scale of moral other thing be equal than he who pay a due regard to cleanliness some have suppose that a disposition to neglect personal cleanliness be indicative of genius but this opinion be grossly erroneous and have well nigh ruin many a young man i be far from recommend any degree of fastidiousness on this subject truth and correct practice usually lie between extreme but i do and must insist that the connection between cleanliness of body and purity of moral character be much more close and direct than have usually be suppose but to return to the more immediate effect of cleanliness on health there be one class of disease in particular which in a eminent degree owe they origin to a neglect of cleanliness i refer to the bowel complaint so common among child during summer and autumn except in case of teethe the use of unripe fruit or the _ abuse _ of those which be in themselves excellent it be probable that more than half of the bowel complaint of the young be either produce or greatly aggravate by a foul skin the importance of wash the whole body in water will be insist on in the chapter on bathing it be therefore unnecessary to say anything farther on that subject in this place except to observe that whether the washing of the body be partial or general they should be thorough so far as they be carry there be thousand of child who in pretend to wash they hand and face will do little more than wet the inside of they hand and the tip of they nose and ear unless great care be take few thing be more important than suitable change of dress there be those who from principle never wear the same under-garment but one day without wash either in summer or winter and there be other who though they may wear a article without wash two or three successive day take care to change they dress at night -- never sleep in a garment which they have worn during the day it be a very common objection to suggestion like these that they will do very well for those who have wealth but not for the poor -- that _ they _ have neither the time nor the means of attend to they how can they change they clothes every day we be ask and how can they afford to have a separate dress for the night there must be retrenchment in some other matter it be admit in order to find time for more wash or money to pay other for the labor the poor must deny themselves a few thing which they now suppose if they have ever think at all on the subject be conducive to they happiness -- but which be in reality either useless or injurious something may be save by a reasonable dress as i have already show other item of expense which might be spare with great advantage to health and happiness and apply to the purpose in question will be mention in the chapter on food and drink chapter vi on bathing danger of savage practice rousseau cold water at birth first wash of the child rule temperature bathing vessel unreasonable fear whim view of dr dewee harden rule for the cold bath secure a glow come out of the bath local bath shower bath vapor bath sponge neglect of bathing the roman treatment of child compare with that of domestic animal some of the hardy nation of antiquity as well as a few savage tribe of modern time have be accustom to plunge they new-born infant into cold water this be do for the two-fold purpose of wash and harden they to all who reason but for a moment on this subject the danger of such a practice must be obvious so sudden a change from a temperature of nearly 100º of fahrenheit to one quite low perhaps scarcely 40º must and do have a powerful effect on the nervous system even of a adult but how much more on that of a tender infant we may form some idea of this by the suddenness and violence of its cry by the sudden contraction and relaxation of its limb and body and by its palpitating heart and difficult breathing every one 's experience may also remind he that what produce at best a momentary pain to himself can not otherwise than be painful to the infant in make a comparison between adult and infant however in this respect we should remember that the lung of the infant do not get into full and vigorous action until some time after birth and that on this account the hold they have on life be so feeble that any powerful shock and especially that give by the cold bath be ten time more dangerous to they than to adult or even to infant themselves after a few month have elapse it be surprising to I that so sensible a writer as rousseau generally be on education should have encourage this dangerous practice and still more so that many father even now blind by theory should persist in it notwithstanding the pleading of the mother or the nurse and the plainest dictate of common sense and common prudence -lrb- footnote : nothing be intend to be say here which shall encourage unthinking nurse or mother in set themselves against measure which have be prescribe by higher authority -- i mean the physician there be case of this kind where it require all the resolution which a father uninterrupted can summon to he aid to administer a dose or perform a task on which he know the existence of he child may be depend : but when the thoughtless entreaty of the mother or nurse be interpose it make he condition most distressing mother in such case ought to encourage rather than remonstrate they who _ do not _ be guilty of cruelty and -- perhaps -- of infanticide -rrb- a child plunge into cold water at birth by those whose theory carry they so far as to do it even in the coldest weather have sometimes be twenty-four hour in recover notwithstanding the most active and judicious effort to restore it in other instance the result have be still more distressing dr dewee be persuade that he have know death itself to follow the use of cold water in this way -- i believe he mean _ immediate _ death -- and add with great confidence that he have repeatedly see it require the lapse of several hour before reaction could establish itself during which time the pale and sunken cheek and livid lip declare the almost exhaust state of the infant 's excitability -lrb- footnote : dewee on child p 72 -rrb- we need not hesitate to put very great confidence in the opinion here express for besides be a close and just observer of human nature dr d have have the direction and management in a greater or less degree of several thousand of new-born infant nothing indeed in the whole range of physical education seem better prove than that while some few infant whose constitution be naturally very strong be invigorate by the practice in question other in the proportion of hundred for one who be _ less _ robust be injure for life some of they seriously nor will spirit add to the water make any material difference i be aware that there be a very general notion abroad that the injurious effect of cold water in its application both internally and externally be greatly diminish by the addition of a little spirit but it be not so do the addition of such a small quantity of spirit as be generally use in these case materially alter the temperature be it not the application of a cold liquid to a heated surface still can we make anything else of it either more or less i do not undertake to say that the cold bath may not be so manage in the progress of infancy as to make it beneficial especially to strong constitution it be its indiscriminate application to all new-born child without regard to strength of constitution or any other circumstance that i most strenuously oppose of its occasional use under the eye of a physician and by parent who will discriminate i shall say more presently we first duty on receive a new inhabitant of the world be to see that it be gently but thoroughly wash in moderately warm soft water with fine soap special attention should be pay to the fold of the joint the neck the arm pit & c for rub the body in order to disengage anything which might obstruct the pore or irritate or fret the skin nothing can be preferable to a piece of soft sponge or flannel though the operation should be thorough and also as rapid as the nature of circumstance will permit all harshness should be avoid when finish the child should be wipe perfectly dry with soft flannel while the wash be perform the temperature of the room should be but a few degree lower than that of the water and the child should not be expose to current of cold air if the weather be severe or if current of air in the room can not otherwise be avoid the dress undress wash & c may be do near the fire and i repeat the rule it should always be do with as much rapidity as be compatible with safety here will be see one great advantage of simplicity in the form of dress if the more rational suggestion of we chapter on that subject be attend to it will greatly facilitate the process of wash and the subsequent daily process of bathing which i be about to recommend to my reader this wash process be also a introduction to bathing for it should be repeat every day but with less and less attention to the wash and more and more reference to the bathing how long the child should stay in the bath must be leave to experience if he be quiet fifteen minute can never be too long and i should not object to twenty if otherwise and you be oblige to remove he in five minute or even in three still the bathing will be of too much service to be dispense with nothing should be mix with the water if the infant be healthy except a little soap as already mention some be fond of use salt but it be by no means necessary and may do harm the proper hour for bathing be the early part of the day or about the middle of the forenoon this season be select because the process manage it as carefully as we may be at first a little exhausting as the child grow older however and not only become stronger but appear to be actually refresh and invigorate by the bath it will be advisable to defer it to a later and later hour by the time the babe be three month old particularly in the warm season the hour of bathing may be at sunset the degree of heat must be determine in part by observe its effect on the child and in part by a thermometer for this and for other purpose a thermometer as i have already more than hint be indispensable in every nursery we own sensation be often at best a very unsafe guide there be one rule which should always be observe -- never to have the temperature of the bath below that of the air of the room if the thermometer show the latter to be 70º the bath should be something like 80º perhaps with feeble child rather more great care ought always to be take to proportion the air of the room and the water of the bath to each other if for example the temperature of the room have be for some time unusually warm that of the water must not be so low as if it have be otherwise on the contrary if the room have be for a considerable time rather cool the bath may be make several degree cooler than in other circumstance but in no case and in no circumstance must a _ warm _ bath -- intend as such simply -- be so warm or so cold as to make the child uncomfortable whether the temperature be 70º 80º or 90º it be hardly necessary to add that in bathing a young child the vessel use for the purpose should be large enough to give free scope to all the motion of its extremity most child be delighted to play and scramble about in the water i know indeed that the contrary sometimes happen but when it do it be usually -- i do not say _ always _ -- because the countenance of those who be around express fear or apprehension for it be surprising how early these little being learn to decipher we feeling by we very countenance some of we reader may be surprise at the intimation that there be mother and nurse who have fear or apprehension in regard to the effect of the warm bath but other -- and it be for such that i write this paragraph -- will fully understand I i have be often surprise at the fact but it be undoubted that there be a strong prejudice against warm bathing in many part of the country in endeavor to trace the cause i have usually find that it arise from have see or hear of some child who die soon after its application i have have many a parent remonstrate with I on the danger of the warm bath and this too in circumstance when it appear to I that the child 's existence depend under god on that very measure perhaps it be useless in such case however to reason with parent on the subject the medical practitioner must do he duty boldly and fearlessly and risk the consequence but as i be write not for person under immediate excitement but for those that may be reason with it be proper to say that in medicine the warm bath be so often use in extreme case and as a last resort even when death have already grasp or be about to fix he grasp on the sufferer that it would be very strange if many person _ do not _ die just after bathing but that the bathing itself ever produce this result in one case in a thousand there be not the slightest reason for believe -lrb- footnote : let I not be understand as intimate that the general neglect of bathing of which i complain so loudly be _ chiefly _ owe to this unreasonable prejudice though this no doubt have its sway on the contrary i believe it be much oftener owe to ignorance indolence and parsimony -rrb- there be many more whim connect with bathing as with almost everything else which it be equally desirable to remove some nurse and mother think that if the child 's skin be wipe dry after bathing it will impair if not destroy the good effect of the operation other still shocking to relate will even put it to bed in its wet clothes this too from principle not unlike this be the belief very common among adult that if we get we clothes wet -- even we stocking -- we must by all means suffer they to dry on we a belief which in its result have send thousand to a premature grave -- and what be still worse make invalid for life of a still greater number i be aware that in reject the indiscriminate cold bathing of infant i be tread on ground which be rather unpopular even with medical man a large proportion of whom seem to believe that the practice may be useful but i be not _ wholly _ alone dr dewee -- of whose large experience i have already speak -- and some other do not hesitate to avow similar sentiment the objection of dr dewee to cold bathing be the follow 1 there often exist a predisposition to disease which cold bathing be sure to rouse to action or if the disease have already begin to affect the system the bath be sure to aggravate it 2 some child have such feeble constitution that they be sure to be permanently weaken by it rather than invigorated 3 to those in whom there be the tendency of a large quantity of blood to the head lung liver & c it be injurious 4 in some the shock produce a species of syncope or catalepsy 5 the _ reaction _ as show by the heat which follow the cold bath be in some case so great as to produce a degree of fever and consequent debility 6 it never answer the purpose of cleanliness -- one great object of bathing -- so well as the warm bath 7 it be always unpleasant or painful to the child especially at first 8 it sometimes produce severe pain in the bowels this be a very formidable list of objection and certainly deserve consideration there be one statement make by dr d in the progress of he remark on this subject in which i do not concur he say -- the object of all bathing be to remove impurity arise from dust perspiration & c from the surface that the skin may not be obstruct in the performance of its proper office but the object of cold bathing with many be to _ harden _ consequently it be not true that cleanliness be the _ only object _ if he mean even that cleanliness be the only _ legitimate _ object of all bathing i shall still be compel to dissent if the cold bath could be use always by and with the direction of a skilful physician i believe its occasional use might be render salutary and although as it be now commonly use i believe its effect be almost anything but salutary i do not deny that if its use be cautiously and gradually begin and judiciously conduct it might be the means of make child who be already robust still more hardy and healthy than before and better able to resist those sudden change of temperature so common in we climate and so apt to produce cold fever and consumption cold bathing in the hand of those who be ignorant of the law of the human frame -- and such unfortunately and unaccountably most father and mother be -- i can not help regard as a highly dangerous weapon and therefore it be that in view of the whole subject i can not recommend its general and indiscriminate use if there be individual however who be determine to employ it in the case of they more vigorous child and without the advice or direction of they family physician i beg they to attend to the follow rule or principle express as briefly as possible in no ordinary case whatever be the cold bath useful unless it be succeed by that degree of warmth on the surface of the body which be usually call a _ glow _ this be a lead and important principle the contrary that be the injurious effect of cold bathing -- its _ immediate _ bad effect i mean -- be show by the skin remain pale and shrivel after come out of the bath by its blue appearance and by its coldness as well as by a sunken state of the eye and much general languor to secure this point -- i mean the glow -- it be indispensably important to begin the use of cold water gradually that be to use it at first of so high a temperature as to produce only a slight sensation of cold and to take special care that the skin be immediately wipe very dry and the temperature of the room be quite as high as usual afterward the water may be cool gradually from week to week though never more than a degree or two at once it will probably be unsafe to commence this practice of cold bathing -- even in the case of the most robust child -- until they be at least six month of age the appropriate season will be the middle of the forenoon the hour when the system be usually the most vigorous and at which we shall be most likely to secure a reaction at first twice or three time a week be as often as it will be safe to repeat it some writer recommend it twice a day but once be enough under any ordinary circumstance the method at first be to give the infant a single plunge afterward when he become older and more inure to it he may be plunge several time in succession on take he out of the bath the skin should be wipe perfectly dry as in the case of the warm bath and with the same or a increase degree of attention to other circumstance -- the temperature of the room the avoid current of air & c he should next be put in a soft warm blanket and be keep for some time in a state of gentle motion and after a little time should be dress i have already mention the importance of avoid the manifestation of fear when we bathe a child and the caution be particularly necessary in the administration of the cold bath some writer even recommend that during the whole process of undress bathing exercise and dress singing should be employ there be philosophy in this advice and it be easily try but i can not speak of it from experience there be one thing which may serve to calm we apprehension -- if we have any -- of danger which be that though the child 's lung be feeble at first from they not have be like the heart accustom to previous action yet when they get fairly into motion and action and the child be a few month old they be probably as strong if not stronger in proportion than those of adult bathing in cold water should never be perform immediately after a full meal neither be it desirable to go to the contrary extreme and bathe when the stomach have be long empty nor when the child 's mental or bodily power be more than usually exhaust by fatigue although i have give these rule for those who be determine to use the cold bath with they child yet for fear i shall be misunderstand i must be suffer to repeat in this place that uninformed as people generally be in regard to physiology i can not advise even its moderate use on the contrary i would gladly dissuade from it as most likely in the way it would inevitably be use to do more harm than good there be no sort of objection to what might be call local bathing with cold water if the child 's head be hot at any time the temple and indeed the whole upper part of the head may be very properly wet with moderately cold water -- take care to avoid wet the clothes but avoid by all mean the common but foolish practice of put spirit in the water a tea-spoonful of cold water can not be too early put into the mouth of the infant the object be to cleanse or rinse the mouth and the process may be aid by wipe it out with a piece of soft linen rag if a part or all of the water should be swallow no harm will be do this practice commence almost as soon as child be bear have save many a sore mouth there be other form of bathing besides those already mention among which be the shower bath the vapor bath and the medicated bath the shower bath -- for which purpose the water be commonly use cold -- be but poorly adapt to the want of infant the shock be much greater than the common cold bath and more apt to frighten and fear be unfavorable to reaction or the production of a genial glow the vapor bath be much better and probably have quite as good a effect as the common warm bath the trouble and expense of procure the necessary apparatus be somewhat greater however as a mere bathing tub cost but little and can be make by every father who possess common ingenuity but whatever may be the expense it be indispensable in every family and whenever the pore of the skin be obstruct a vapor bathing apparatus be equally desirable the medicated vapor bath be sometimes use but i be not now treat of infant who be sick but of those who be in a state of health the common warm bath be sometimes medicate by put in salt this of course render the water more stimulate to the skin but except when the perspiration be check or the skin peculiarly inactive from some other cause -- in other word unless we be sick -- it be seldom expedient to use it there be one substitute for the bathing tub in the case of the cold bath i refer to the use of a wet cloth or sponge apply rapidly to the whole surface of the body when this be do the skin should be wipe thoroughly dry immediately afterwards as in the case of complete immersion the application of either a cloth or a sponge fill with warm water to the skin in this manner even if continue for several minute together be less efficacious than a continuous immersion i repeat it -- no family ought to be without convenience for bathing in warm water daily i speak now of every member of the family young and old as well as the infant and i refer particularly to the summer season : though i do not think the practice ought to be wholly discontinue during the winter it will still be object that this care of and attention to the young in reference to health -- this provision for bathing daily and care to see that it be perform -- can never be afford by the labor portion of the community but i shall as strenuously insist on the contrary and trust i shall in the sequel produce reason which will be satisfactory the great difficulty be to convince parent that these thing be vastly more productive of health and happiness to they child -- more truly necessaries -- than a great many thing for which they now expend they time and money there be and always have be -- except perhaps among the jew in the earliest period of the history of that wonderful nation -- a strange disposition to overlook the happiness of the young it be not necessary to represent this dereliction as peculiar to modern time for we find trace of the same thing thousand of year ago the roman emperor -- dioclesian in particular -- could make provision for bathing to a extent which now astonish we but for whom for whom i repeat it be incur the enormous expense of fitting up and keep in repair accommodation for bathing at once 18000 people for adult and for adult alone i do not say that child be not admit in any case but i say they be not contemplate in these arrangement nothing be do -- not a single thing -- that would not have be do have there be no child under ten year of age in the whole empire and what better than this do we now we make provision for the happiness of the adult the most indigent person will find time and money to spend for the gratification of he own sens he pride or he curiosity but he child -- they may be overlook or if he have a eye to the future happiness of he child he conceive that he be promote it in the best possible degree by endeavor to lay up a few dollar for he use after he character be form -- at a period as it too often happen when money will do he little good since it can neither purchase health peace of mind nor reputation far be it from I to say that the poor -- ground into the dust as they be by the force of circumstance operate with they own concurrence to make they ignorant vicious or miserable -- can do for they child all that be desirable by no means but they have it in they power to do much more than they be at present do they have it in they power at least to use the same good sense in the management of the human be that they do in that of a pig a calf or a colt or even a young vegetable no parent let he be ever so poor be find in the habit of neglect either of these in proportion to its infancy and of exert himself only in proportion as it grow older common sense tell he that the contrary be the true course that however poor he may be he will be still poorer if he do not take special pain with the young animal to rear it and with the young vegetable to give it the right direction by keep down the weed and pruning and water it and i say again that however deserving of censure the wealthy of a christian community may be in not direct the ignorant and vicious into the right path and in not expend more of they wealth on those who be poor in elevate they mind and they manners and promote they health still the latter be inexcusable for they present neglect of they infant offspring while they would not think of neglect on the same principle the

month of its existence that it seem almost unnecessary to repeat the fact and yet the violation of this rule be so numerous and constant as to require a few pass remark there be some mother who seem to have a perfect hatred of child and if they can find any plausible apology for neglect to nurse they they will few indeed will publicly acknowledge a state of feeling so unnatural but there be some even of such on the latter all argument would i fear be utterly lose of the former there may be hope they tell we -- and they be often sustain by those around they -- that it be very inconvenient to be so confine to a child that they can not leave home for a little while can it be they duty -- for in these day when virtue and religion and everything good be so highly compliment no people be more ready to talk of _ duty _ than they who have the least regard to it -- can it be they duty they ask to exclude themselves from the pleasure and comfort of social life for half or two third of they most active and happy year ought they not to go abroad at least occasionally but if so and they child have no other source of dependence must they not suffer be it not better therefore that they should be early accustomed to other food for a part of the time besides they may be sick and then the child must rely on other and will it not be useful to accustom it early to do so perhaps few mother be conscious that this train of reasoning pass through they mind but that something like it be often make the occasion of substitute food which be less proper for that furnish by divine providence there can not be a doubt and the mischief be that she who have go so far will not scruple ere long to go farther and strange and unnatural as it may seem that mother should turn over they child to be nurse wholly by other in order to get rid of the inconvenience of nurse they at they own bosom it be only carry out to its fullest extent and reduce to practice the train of reasoning mention above nor be it necessary that i should stop here to denounce a course of conduct so unchristian and savage i know it be very common in some country and those american mother who ape the other eastern fashion or countenance they son and daughter in do it will not be slow to imitate this also -- especially as it be a very _ convenient _ fashion and i question whether i shall succeed in reasoning they out of it habit both of thought and action be exceedingly powerful i will therefore confine myself chiefly to those effort at prevention from which much more be to be hope in the present state of society than from direct attempt at cure it will be soon enough to leave a child with another person when the mother be actually sick or unavoidably absent or when some other adequate cause be know to exist we be to be govern in these and similar case by general rule and not by exception the general rule in the present case be that mother can nurse they own child and if they have the proper disposition that they can do it uninterruptedly but those who be so ready to become counsellor on these occasion will tell we perhaps that the child must be feed to spare the mother that be to say nursing weaken the mother and the child must be take away a part of the time to save she strength now it may safely be doubt whether the process of nursing in itself consider do weaken at all the author of nature have make provision for the secretion -lrb- formation -rrb- of the milk whether the child receive it or not if it be not take by the child or draw off in some other way one of two thing must follow -- either it must be take up by what be call absorbent vessel and carry into the circulation and chiefly throw out of the system as waste matter or it will prove a source of irritation if not of inflammation to the organ themselves which secrete it in both case the strength of the mother be quite as likely to be tax as if the child receive the milk in the way that nature intend besides on this very principle the plan of save a mother 's strength by require another to nurse for she be but say that we will weaken one person to save another or if we feed the child to spare its mother what be this in practice but to say that the work of the creator be very imperfect and that he have throw upon the mass of mankind a task to which they be not equal for the mass of mankind be poor and the poor have neither the means nor the time to escape the duty in question must submit to they while they more wealthy neighbor escape but it be idle to defend custom so monstrous they admit of no defense that have the slightest claim to solidity the general rule then be that mother should nurse they own child sec 2 _ conduct of the mother _ originally it be not my intention to give direction in this volume in regard to the food drink & c of the mother while nursing but repeat solicitation on this point have lead I to the conclusion that a few general principle may be very properly introduce the future health and even the moral well-being of the child depend much more on the proper management of the mother herself than be usually suppose how indeed can it be other wise how can the mother 's blood be constantly irritated with improper food and drink without render the milk so and how can a child draw daily and hourly from this feverish fountain without be affect not only in he physical frame but in he very temper and feeling it be not enough that we adopt the principle already insist on by some of we wisest medical man and even by one or two medical society -lrb- footnote : those of connecticut and new hampshire -rrb- that child in this way often acquire a propensity for exciting drink that may end in they downright intemperance what if it should not in every case proceed quite so far as to make the child a drunkard if it but lay the foundation of a constitutional fondness for _ excitement _ it tend to disease indeed that in itself be a disease and one too which be destroy more person every year than the cholera or even the consumption consumption have at most only slay she ten of thousand -lrb- footnote : about 40000 a year in the united state as nearly as it can be estimate -rrb- a year but a fondness for exciting food and drink -- innocent and harmless as it be often suppose to be and therefore only the more dangerous a foe -- do not fail to slay every year directly or indirectly its hundred of thousand at least this be my own opinion why where can you find the individual who be not a slave to this perpetual rage within -- this perpetual cry who will show we any physical good who in this land of abundance will eat or drink plain thing who will eat simple bread meat potato rice pudding apple & c or drink simple water a few instance may be find of late in which people confine themselves to simple water for drink but they be rather rare and no wonder they _ must _ be rare so long as a unnatural thirst be keep up everywhere by the most exciting and most strange mixture of food where i again ask be the person who will eat and relish plain bread plain meat plain pudding & c certainly not in the nursery no young mother -- scarcely one i mean -- will for a single meal confine herself to a piece of bread the sweetest and best food in the whole world unless it be hot or toast or soak or butter a natural healthy appetite be as rare a thing on we planet almost as a inhabitant of the sun or moon i have see more than one mother make sick by use while nurse improper food and drink i have know milk punch take by stealth -- -lrb- because how could the mother it be say ever have a supply of food for she poor child without it -rrb- -- to kindle a fever that come very near burning up the mother and child both and yet if i have once or twice succeed in convince the mother that she be only suffer the natural punishment of she own transgression i have never so far as i now recollect succeed in make she believe that she iniquity be visit upon she unoffending infant there be everywhere the most painful apathy on this most painful subject we see little child of all age everywhere the victim of debility and pain and suffering and disease and death and yet we very seldom seem to search for one moment for the cause of this premature destruction in fact most parent -- even many intelligent mother -- at once stare if you attempt to inquire into the cause of they child 's death as if it be either a kind of sacrilege or a impeachment of they own parental affection disease even at this day with the sun of science blaze in meridian splendor they seem to regard as the judgment of heaven and to think of trace out the cause of the early death of half we race be in they estimation not only idle but wicked yet this be obviously one of the first step every where which philanthropy demand to say nothing of the demand of christianity it be the first step for the physician the first step for the educator the first step for the parent and above all the mother nay more -- we must not suppress so great and important a truth -- it be the first step for the legislator and the minister what sense be there in continue century after century and age after age to expend all we effort in merely _ mend _ the diseased half of mankind when those same effort be amply sufficient if early and properly apply not only to continue the life of the whole but to make they _ whole being _ instead of pass through life mere _ fragment _ of humanity but i must not forget that this be merely a small manual not intend for those who make it they profession to teach the law of god and man but simply for young mother for the sake of err humanity would that i could but for one moment divest myself of the idea that in write for the young mother i be not write for legislator and minister would that i could banish from my mind the deep conviction that the mother be everywhere far more the law-giver to she infant -- far more the arbiter of the present and eternal destiny of she child -- than he who be more commonly regard as such every mother owe it not only to herself -- for on this part she be not _ wholly _ forgetful -- but to she offspring to abstain during the period of nursing at least from all cause which tend to produce a feverish state of she fluid among these be every form of premature exertion whether in sit up labor conversing or even think it be of very great importance that both the body and the mind should be keep quiet and the more so the better among the particular cause of fever to the young mother dr dewee enumerate spirit wine and other fermented liquor a room too much heat closed curtain confine air too much exposure and too much company and during the early period of confinement broth and animal food there be nothing which he insist on more strongly than the importance of fresh air indeed the practice of confine a nursing woman in a space scarcely six foot square and exclude the air surround she by curtain and close window and subject she to the necessity of breathing twenty time the air that have already be as often discharge fill with poison from she lung be not too strongly reprobate by dr dewee or anybody else but i have speak of these thing in the chapter which treat on the nursery i would only observe on this point that if i be ask what one thing be most indispensable to the health of the nursing woman i would reply fresh air and if ask what be the second and third most important thing i would still repeat -- in imitation of the orator of old in regard to another subject -- fresh air fresh air this important ingredient in human happiness and especially in the happiness of the young mother and she tender infant can usually be have within door if pain enough be take but if the weather be fine and in every respect favorable a woman who be in tolerable health may venture abroad a little in about three week after she confinement and sometimes even in two whether she exercise be without or within door however she should be effectually protect against chill and against the influence of current of cold air it have be incidentally state that dr dewee object to the mother 's use during she early period of nursing of broth and animal food this be about as much as we could reasonably expect from one who belong to a profession whose member be almost without exception enslave to the practice of flesh-eating but even this advice of he if duly follow would be a great advance upon the practice which generally prevail there be so universal a belief among female that they demand at this period of they existence not only a larger quantity of food than usual but also that which be more stimulating in its quality as almost to forbid the hope of make much impression upon they mind many young mother seem to consider themselves as license during a part of they life not only to eat immoderately and even to gluttony but also to swallow almost every species of vile trash which a vile world afford how long will it be ere the mother can be induce to take as much pain to select the most appropriate and most healthy aliment for herself and she child as she now do that which be demand by a capricious appetite without the smallest reference to fitness or digestibility how long will it be ere the mother can be bring to believe and feel that in every step she take she be form the habitation of a immortal spirit -- a spirit too whose character and destiny both present and eternal must depend in no small degree upon the character of the dwelling it occupy while pass through this stage of earthly existence how long will it be before mother can be make to believe even these two simple truth that the nourishment which the human be actually receive be not always in exact proportion to the quantity of nutritious food which he throw into he stomach and that the diet be always best for both mother and child which be least exciting the charleston board of health during the existence of cholera in that city in 1836 publicly announce that the best food be the least exciting and this great truth be just as true in all other place and circumstance on the globe as it be then in south carolina and though i be far from believe that health depend more on food and drink than on all other thing put together as many seem to suppose yet i be entirely of opinion that he who should devote himself successfully to the work of apply this truth in all its bearing to the dietetic practice of all mankind would do more for they reformation -- yes and they salvation too -- than have yet be do by any merely _ human _ be since the first day of the creation sec 3 _ nursing -- how often _ many lay it down as a invariable rule that no system can be pursue with a child till it be six month old and it must be admit by all that for several month after birth there be serious difficulty in the way of determine with any degree of precision how often a child should be nurse or feed still there be a few rule of universal application some of which be here present 1 a child should never be nurse merely to quiet it for if this be do it will soon learn to cry whenever it feel the slightest uneasiness not only from hunger but from other cause merely to be gratify with nursing besides if its cry should happen to be from illness it be ten to one but the reception of anything into the stomach will do harm instead of good 2 the stomach like every other organ in the body which be muscular must have time for rest and this in the case of child as well as adult but to nurse they too frequently be in opposition to this rule and therefore of evil tendency 3 for reason which may be see by the last rule there should be regular season for nursing and these should be adhere to especially by night when very young once in three hour may not be too frequent i believe that it be seldom proper to nurse a child more frequently than this but whenever three hour become a suitable period by day once in four hour will be often enough by night i will not undertake to say at what precise age child should be nurse at interval of three and four hour each because some child be older _ constitutionally _ at three month than other be at four there be one grand mistake however against which i must caution young mother which be not to indulge the vain expectation that feeble infant will become robust in proportion to they indulgence on the contrary it be the more necessary to be strict with feeble child _ because _ they be feeble to keep they hang at the breast to invigorate they be the very way to counteract we own intention and defeat we own purpose season of entire rest be even more important to they stomach than to those of other person 4 but in order to secure interval of rest both to the strong and the feeble we must avoid the pernicious habit of give infant pap and other delicacy between meal many a child 's health be ruin by this practice nothing should be put into they stomach for many month -- if they be in health -- but the mother 's milk this say dr dunglison be the sole food of the infant and be consequently sufficiently nutrient to maintain life and to minister to the growth during the earliest period of existence -lrb- footnote : element of hygiene page 271 -rrb- in another place he say milk be a appropriate nourishment at all age and be more so the nearer to birth sec 4 _ quantity of food _ we all know say dr dewee how easily the stomach may be make to demand more food than be absolutely require first by the repetition of aliment and secondly by its variety -- therefore both of these cause must be avoid the stomach like every other part can and unfortunately do acquire habit highly injurious to itself and that of demand a unnecessary quantity of aliment be not one of the least it should therefore be constantly bear in mind that it be not the quantity of food take into the stomach that be available to the proper purpose of the system but the quantity which can be digest and convert into nourishment fit to be apply to such purpose there be a great deal of truth in these remark and especially in the close one that not all which be take into the stomach be digest it be highly probable that the least quantity which be usually give to a infant be more than sufficient for the purpose of digestion and that nearly every child in the arm of its mother be over-fed i know it have be say by some physician -- and by those who be sensible man in other respects too -- that the child 's stomach be a pretty correct guide in regard to quantity if we give it too much say they it will reject it -- as if that be a end of the matter but it be not so it be by no means harmless to fill the child 's stomach as full as be possible without overflow such a process though it should not create disease directly would produce a gluttonous habit the stomach be muscular may be increase in size by use like all other muscular organ the hand the arm the leg the foot the fleshy portion of the face even may be disproportionally enlarged by constant use thus a sailor who use he hand and arm much more than he leg and foot have the former unusually large one who be much accustomed to walk have large foot and in a tailor who from childhood use he lower limb comparatively little they be both small and slender on the same principle the stomach by inordinate use and by carry unreasonable load may be make nearly twice as large as nature intend and may demand twice as much food and i have no doubt that the bulk of mankind young and old eat about twice as much as nature unperverted would require if the suggestion of we last section be duly attend to one of the cause which lead the stomach to demand a unreasonable quantity of food will be avoid -- i mean the too frequent repetition of aliment and if we never depart from the general rule already lay down not to give the infant anything but its mother 's milk we shall escape the evil incident to variety sec 5 _ how long should milk be the only food _ on this point there be a great diversity of opinion perhaps the most approve role of universal application be that the first change should be make in the child 's diet when the tooth begin to appear this period it be well know can not be fix to any particular age but vary from the fifth to the twelfth month some mother who have bear with I patiently to this place will probably here object what child they will ask would ever have any strength bring up so not only a little pap and gruel be in they estimation necessary long before this period but even many choice bit of meat now i be very sure that these choice bit -- whatever they may be -- give to a child before it have tooth not only do no good but actually do mischief indeed that which do no good in the stomach must do harm of course since it be not only in the way but act like a foreign body there produce more or less of irritation i ought to state in this place that many people -- mother among the rest -- have very inadequate idea of digestion they appear to have no farther notion of the digestive process than that it consist in reduce to a pulp the substance which be swallow and hence whatever be reduce to a pulp they regard as be digest whereas nothing be better know to the anatomist and physiologist than that this -- the formation of _ chyme _ in the stomach -- constitute only a very small part of the digestive process the chyme must pass into the duodenum and other portion of intestine beyond the stomach and be retain there for some time before it will form perfect chyle this be a more important part of the work of digestion than even the former for suppose the chyme to be perfect though even this may be mere pulp rather than chyme and suppose it pass quietly along into the duodenum and other small intestine all this process thus far may go on naturally enough and yet the chyle may not be well form and the chymous mass may find its way out of the system without answer any of the purpose of nutrition for no matter how well the food be dissolve in the stomach if it do not become good and proper chyle the blood which be form will not be good and perfect blood or lastly if it _ seem _ to make good blood it may still be faulty so that the particle which should be apply to build up or repair the system be either not use or if use answer the purpose but imperfectly we hence see how little prepared a large proportion of the community be to judge of the digestibility or fitness of a substance for infant by they own observation and experience merely and how much more wisely they act in content themselves with give they -- at least until they have tooth -- such food only as the author of nature seem to have assign they especially when thus course be precisely that which be recommend or sanction by nearly every judicious physician as well as by almost all we writer on health sec 6 _ on feeding before teethe _ have lay down the general rule that until the appearance of tooth the sole food of a infant should be the milk of its own mother i proceed to speak of some of the more common exception to it exception 1 -- the first of these be when the supply furnish by the mother be scanty there may be two cause of the scantiness of this supply 1st the want of suitable nourishment by the mother and 2dly a feeble constitution or bad health in the former case it should be she first object as it undoubtedly will be that of she physician to improve the quality of she diet and in the latter to restore she health or at least invigorate she constitution in regard to the proper diet of a _ mother _ as such as well as the general management which she case require a volume might be write without exhaust the subject but i have already say as much on this subject in another place as my limit will permit but we can not wait for the mother 's health to improve and allow the infant to suffer in the mean time for a due supply of food the appropriate question now be how shall such a supply be furnish this should be do by means of a article resemble in its property as closely as possible the mother 's milk for this purpose we have only to mix with a suitable quantity of new cow 's milk one third of water and sweeten it a little with loaf sugar this be to be give to the child at suitable interval and in proper quantity by means of a common sucking bottle it be indeed sometimes give with the spoon but the bottle be better to the question whether the child should be confine to this till the period of wean dr dewee answer no i be surprise at this and my surprise be increase when i find he almost in the very next breath urge with all he might numerous reason against the very common notion that child in early life require a variety of food he even insist on the importance of confine the child to a single article of food when it be practicable yet he have not give we so much as one reason why it be not practicable in the case before we but have go on to speak of barley water gum arabic water rice water arrowroot & c i venture therefore to dissent from he and to answer the foregoing question in the affirmative when one good and substantial reason can be give for _ change _ the decision will however be reconsider i have already state the general rule for prepare this substitute for the mother 's milk but there be several minor direction which may be useful to those who be wholly without experience on the subject if possible the milk use should not only be just take from the cow but should always be from the _ same _ cow for it be well know that the quality of milk often differ very materially even among cow feed in the same pasture or from the same pile of hay and the stomach become most easily reconcile to the mixture when it be uniform in its quality great care should also be take to see that the cow whose milk be use be young and healthy the mixture should not be prepare any faster than it be wanted and should always be prepare in vessel perfectly clean and sweet and give as soon as possible after it be prepare to prevent any degree of fermentation it be never so well to heat it by the fire if take from the cow just before it be use and if the water to be add be warm enough the temperature will hardly need to be raise any higher when it be impracticable in all case to take milk for this purpose immediately from the cow it should be keep in winter where it will not freeze and in summer where there will be no tendency to acidity some mother and nurse be addict to the practice of pass the food through they own mouth before they give it to the child -- with a view no doubt to see that it be at a proper temperature this practice be not only wholly unnecessary but altogether disgusting and even ridiculous a thermometer would answer every purpose and save even the trouble of another disgusting practice -- that of blow it with the breath the most proper season for give the child this preparation be immediately after it have be nurse it be better for both mother and child that the latter should nurse just as often as though the supply of food be adequate to he want and when he first supply be exhaust then let he make up he meal from the suck bottle the great advantage of this plan be that he will not be so likely in this way to be over-fed if he be really needy he will accept the bottle even if he do not like it quite so well if he refuse it let he go without till he be hungry enough to receive it in regard to the water use in the preparation only one thing need to be say which be that it should be pure if it be not it should by all means be boil the sugar use should be of the very best kind and the quantity not large since if the preparation be too sweet it readily become acid in the stomach there have be and still be a controversy go on among medical man whether sugar be or be not hurtful to the young who shall decide when doctor disagree have often be ask without undertake the task myself i may perhaps be permit to say that i can not see any reason why a substance so pure and so highly nutritious as sugar -- if give in very small quantity only -- should prove injurious : though i do not regard the reasoning of dr dewee as very conclusive on the subject when in reply to dr cadogan he have the follow language -- if sugar be improper why do it so largely enter into the composition of the early food of all animal it be in vain that physician declaim against this article since it form between seven and eight per cent of the mother 's milk -- now with I the fact that milk and almost all other kind of food be furnish with a measure of this substance be the strongest reason i be acquaint with for make no addition i believe however that they may sometimes be make but not for these reason exception 2 -- the second striking exception to the general rule that have be lay down be when the mother be unable to nurse she own child from positive ill health or when circumstance exist which render it obviously improper that she should do it the follow be some of the circumstance which render such a departure from nature indispensable 1 when the mother be affect strongly with a hereditary disease such as consumption or scrofula or when she constitution be taint as it be with venereal disease or other permanent affection 2 when nurse produce uniformly some very troublesome or dangerous disease in the mother as cough colic & c 3 there be a few instance in which the milk of the mother owe to a unknown cause have be find by experience to disagree with the child in these circumstance it be the unquestionable duty of the mother to resort wholly to feed 4 sometimes the milk at first abundant fail suddenly owe to some accidental or constitutional defect and this failure become habitual in all these circumstance the proper resort be to a suck bottle or a hire nurse i generally prefer the latter the case which seem to I to admit of the former will be point out in the next section when the bottle be use say dr dewee much care be requisite to preserve it sweet and free from all impurity or the remains of the former food by which the present may be render impure or sour for which purpose a great deal of caution must be observe the business of feed a child whether by the bottle or the spoon should never be hurry : the slower it be the better we should stop from time to time during the process nor should the nourishment be give while lie down it be much more pleasant as well as more safe to sit up a few thought more on the character and condition of the milk which we give to the young will conclude the second division of this section some be fond of boil milk for infant but to this i be decidedly oppose so long as they be in health boil take away or appear to take away some of the best property of the milk it be true that milk which be boil do not turn sour so readily in hot weather but it be quite unnecessary to boil milk in the common manner in order to present its change since such a result can be prevent by another process you have only to put you milk in a kettle cover it closely and heat it quickly to the boiling point and then remove and cool it as speedily as possible this plan prevent the rise to the surface of that coat or pellicle which contain some of the most valuable property of the milk i have already say that it be as necessary that the stomach should have rest as any other muscular organ some writer say that the infant should be keep perfectly quiet at least half a hour after each meal this be certainly necessary with feeble child but i question its necessity in the case of those who be strong and robust i would not recommend however nor even tolerate for one moment the absurd practice of _ jolting _ so common with a few ignorant nurse and mother as if they could jolt down the food in the stomach with just as much safety as they can shake down the contents of a farmer 's bag of produce such mother as these should go and reside among the native tribe of indian in guiana in south america where they make it a point not only to stuff they child 's stomach as long as they will hold but actually to shake it down little less absurd than jolting be the custom of toss a child high in quick succession which be practice not only after meal but at other time but on this point i have treat elsewhere some give the suck bottle to child as a plaything this be just about as wise a practice as that of give they book as plaything both be do usually to save the time and trouble of those whose office it be to devote they time to the very purpose of managing and educate they offspring the evil however of suffer the child to have the bottle when it please be that he will thus be tasting food so often as to interfere with and disturb the process of digestion to he great and lasting injury for in this way a part of the food will pass from the stomach into the bowels unchanged or at least but imperfectly digest where it be liable to become sour and cause disease it be not to be doubt that many diarrhoea as well as other bowel affection be produce in this way child that be always eat be seldom healthy and we may hence see the reason in speaking of the importance of keep the bottle from which a child take he food perfectly clean and sweet i ought to have extend the injunction much farther there be a degree of slovenliness sometimes observable in those who manage child both when they be sick and when they be in health which even common sense can not and ought not to tolerate every vessel which be use in prepare or administer anything for child ought after we have use it to be immediately and effectually cleansed how shocking be it to see dirty vessel stand in the nursery from hour to hour become sour or impure how much more so still to see food in copper vessel or in the red earthen one glaze with a poisonous oxyd i speak now more particularly of vessel in which food be give for with the administration of medicine and nurse the sick i do not intend in this volume to interfere exception 3 -- we come now to the consideration of those case -- for such it will not be doubt there be -- where a hire nurse be to be prefer to feed by the hand before proceed farther however it be important to say that if a nurse could always be procure whose health and temper and habit be good who have no infant of she own and who would do as well for the infant in every respect as he own mother it would be preferable to have no feeding by the hand at all but such nurse be very scarce they temper or habit or general health will often be such as no genuine parent would desire and such as they ought to be sorry to see engraft in any degree on the child for even admit what be claim by some that the temper of the nurse do _ not _ affect the property of the milk and thus injure the child both physically and morally still much injury may and inevitably will result from the influence of she constant presence and example other have infant of they own in which case either they own child or the adopt one will suffer and in a majority of case it can scarcely be doubt _ which _ it will be and i doubt the morality of require a nurse in these case to give up she own child wholly if _ one _ must be feed why not we own as well as that of another the only case then which seem to I to justify the employment of a nurse be where she possess at least the qualification above mention and as these be rare not many nurse of course would on this principle be employ but when employ it be highly desirable that the follow rule should be observe : 1 : the nurse should suckle the child at both breast otherwise he be liable to acquire a degree of crookedness in he form there be another evil which sometimes result from the too common neglect of this rule which be that it endanger the deterioration of the quality of the milk 2 the milk which be thus substitute for that of the mother should be as nearly as possible of the same age as the child who be to receive it it should be remembered however that the milk be not so good after the twelfth or thirteenth month nor _ quite _ so good under the third 3 when the parent or some trusty and confidential friend can without the aid of interested spy and emissary have a eye to the general treatment and especially to the moral management it should be do for even the best nurse may so differ in they principle manners and habit from the parent that the latter would deem it preferable to withdraw the child and resort at once to feed sec 7 _ from teethe to wean _ this period will of course be longer or shorter accord as the tooth begin to appear earlier or later and accord to the time when it be think proper to wean on few point perhaps have there exist a greater diversity of opinion than in regard to the age most proper for wean the limit of this work do not permit a thorough discussion of the question and i shall therefore be very brief in my remark on the subject dr cullen whose opinion on topic of this kind be certainly entitle to much respect think that less than seven or more than eleven month of nursing be injurious yet in some country and even in some part of we own the period be extend by the mother from choice to two year and although the milk be not so good after the thirteenth or fourteenth month i have never either know or hear that any evil consequence follow from the practice dr loudon a recent writer observe that the period of nursing have a great influence over the number of mankind in various country as be evince by numerous fact he adduce proof of this position thus he say in china where the population be excessive and the inhuman practice of infanticide be common they wean a child as soon as it can put its hand to its mouth on the other hand the indian of north america do not wean they child until they be old and strong enough to run about : generally they be suckle for a period of more than two year he then enter into a physiological inquiry why it be that british mother do not usually suckle they child longer than ten month he seem -- though he do not give we he precise opinion -- to think that in all ordinary case the period of nursing ought to be protracted to two or three year and that perhaps it would be better still to extend it to four or five he remark be so excellent and withal so curious and they tendency so humane that we venture to insert one or two of he paragraph entire certain it be that the milk do not diminish particularly at that time -lrb- ten month -rrb- so far as regard quantity and from the health of child rear without spoon-meat beyond this time it as certainly undergo no change in its quality child be sometimes so old before wean as to be able to ask for the breast and it have not be remark that the health of mother thus suckle be in any way worse than that of they neighbor altogether then it may be assert that a mother be likely to enjoy better health and to be less liable to sickness and death during lactation than during pregnancy many woman believe or affect to believe that the weakness they labor under arise from some latent moral or physical cause but this weakness be not attribute to lactation in the earlier month of suckling because the mother then consider herself fulfil a necessary duty which she constitution for so long be well able to bear so soon however as the period of lactation have pass over as it be establish by custom or fashion she imagine she be exceed the intention of nature and she forthwith conclude that the continuance of suckling be the cause of she uncomfortable sensation this whim be entertain the child be wean and too often become the victim of a most reprehensible delusion since nature have furnish the mother with milk for a longer period than custom demand it be evident that some good purpose for the mother and child be intend in this arrangement have it be otherwise the secretion of milk would stop at a definite time in like manner as the period of gestation be definite that a child in comparison with the young of the lower animal be so long unable to provide for itself strongly tend to corroborate the proof already advance -- that nature originally have in view a more protracted period for lactation than be now allow some writer follow the law of nature as they interpret they fix the period of wean at fifteen month when the infant have get its eight incisor and four canine tooth there be well-authenticated instance of mother have suckle they child for three four five and even seven consecutive year we ourselves have know case of lactation be prolong far three and for four year with the happiest result it appear to I better therefore that the child should be nurse in all ordinary case from twelve to fifteen month and when there be no special objection about two year as the change whenever it be make and however gradual it may be be a important one in its effect on the stomach and bowels it be better to wean a little earlier or a little later than to do so just at the close of summer or beginning of autumn at which season bowel complaint be most common most severe and most dangerous it be sufficiently unfortunate that teethe should commence just at this period but when we add another cause of irregular action which we can control to one which we _ can not _ we act very unwisely i have already observe that we may begin to feed child when the tooth begin to appear by this be not mean that we should do so while the system be under the irritation to which teethe usually or at least often subject it but when this be over and a few tooth have appear it be usually a proper time to commence we operation the first food give should be precisely of the kind which have be recommend for those child who be feed by the hand the rule and restriction by which we be to be guide be the same except in one point which be that in the case we be now consider the child should be feed _ between nursing _ let not parent be anxious about they healthy child under two year who have a supply of good milk either from the mother or from the cow for those that be feeble a physician may and ought to prescribe -- not medicine but appropriate food drink & c when the grind tooth have cut through if we have any doubt in regard to the nutritive quality of the food we be give we may improve it by add instead of the one third of pure water a similar quantity of gum arabic water barley water or rice water some use a little weak animal broth but this be unnecessary and i think on the whole injurious except for purpose strictly medicinal this course be so simple and so far remove from that which be generally adopt that few mother will probably be willing to pursue it with perseverance especially when the tooth appear very late those who be however will be richly reward in the end in the advantage which will accrue to the child 's health and the vigor it will ensure to he constitution sec 8 _ during the process of wean _ it have already be show that in wean some regard should be have to the season of the year and that the end of summer and beginning of fall be of all period the most unfavorable the best time on every account be in the spring -- in march April may or June and the next best be during the month of October and November but December January and February be better than July August and September wean should never be sudden we may safely and properly call upon those who be addict to snuff or opium take tobacco chew rum drinking and other habit which be purely artificial to break off -- _ to wean themselves _ -- suddenly since _ they _ can do so with considerable safety and will seldom have the courage or the perseverance to do it otherwise but with the child in regard to he food such a course will not be advisable if we regard he future health or happiness he must be wean gradually the first proper step will be to give the child a little larger quantity of the cow 's milk and gum arabic mixture between nursing at the same time increase very gradually the interval of nursing when the interval become six hour distant from each other it will be best to add a little good bread to the milk with which it be feed about two or three time a day arrowroot jelly if he can be make to relish it will be highly useful but if not some boil rice into which a little arrowroot have be sprinkle while boil may be add to he milk it may be worth the attempt to excite a aversion in the child to nurse he mother so that be will refuse to nurse if possible of he own accord this aversion may be excite by such a application of aloe or some other offensive substance as will cause he to withdraw himself from the breast as soon as he taste it a serious mistake be often make in connection with wean in give the child not only too much food but that which be too solid or too rich this mistake have undoubtedly grow out of the belief that he feeble condition _ require _ it whereas the truth be that he neither need food at this period nor be capable of digest it for let we be as judicious in the process of wean as we may the tone of the child 's stomach will be somewhat reduce or in other word its power of digestion will be weaken by it and to give it strong food or overload it with that which be weaker be not only unreasonable and unphilosophical but cruel and if there should be a tendency in the child 's constitution to rickets scrofula consumption and other waste disease such a course would be likely to bring they on and destroy life when milk will agree say dr dewee there be no food so proper it may be employ in any of its combination with good wheaten bread rice sago & c only remember that when either of these article be find to agree it should be continue perseveringly until it may become offensive in this case some new combination may be require i do not see the necessity of continue one kind of food till it _ offend _ besides i do not believe that these simple article of food be apt to become offensive to stomach that have not already be spoil but whether a single dish should or should not come to be offensive i greatly prefer a occasional change buchan in he advice to mother have recommend it to they to boil bread for they infant in water it should not for this purpose -- nor indeed for any other -- be new it be best at one or two day old it may be boil in a small quantity of water or what be still better of milk or it may be steam till it become soft and light almost like new bread but without any of the objectionable property of that which be wholly new to bread thus prepare be to be add a suitable quantity of milk fresh from the cow and a little diluted with water but not boil but as there may be here and there at any age a stomach with which milk with bread or rice or sago will not agree -- though i think they must be very rare case -- we may be allow to substitute for it a solution of gum arabic in the proportion of a ounce to a pint of water to which may be add a little sugar and if the child be old enough to observe the color just milk enough to change the appearance another preparation for the same purpose consist of rennet whey a little sweetened and disguise if necessary as just state the health of the mother too during the period of wean often need great attention let she avoid medicine however if possible a due regard to food drink exercise and rest of body and mind & c will usually be find more effective as well as more permanently efficacious sec 9 _ food subsequently to wean _ you will allow I to introduce in this place some of the sentiment of dr cadogan a english physician from a little work on the management of child -lrb- footnote : though dr c 's remark will apply more closely to england in 1750 they be by no means inapplicable to the united state in 1837 -rrb- i do it with the more pleasure because though he write almost a century ago he urge the same general principle on which i have all along be insist : hence it will be see that mine be no new-fangled notion he remark refer to the young of every age but chiefly to early infancy and childhood it will be find necessary in some instance to abridge but i shall endeavor not to misrepresent the doctor 's view \* \* \* \* \* look over the bill of mortality almost half of those who fill up that black list die under five year of age so that half the people that come into the world go out of it again before they become of the least use to it or to themselves to I this seem to deserve serious consideration it be ridiculous to charge it upon nature and to suppose that infant be more subject to disease and death than grow person on the contrary they bear pain and disease much better -- fever especially and for the same reason that a twig be less hurt by a storm than a oak in all the other production of nature we see the greatest vigor and luxuriancy of health the nearer they be to the egg or bud when be there a lamb a bird or a tree that die because it be young these be under the immediate nursing of unerring nature and they thrive accordingly ought it not therefore to be the care of every nurse and every parent not only to protect they nursling from injury but to be well assure that they own officious service be not the greatest evil the helpless creature can suffer in the lower class of mankind especially in the country disease and mortality be not so frequent either among adult or they child health and posterity be the portion of the poor -- i mean the laborious the want of superfluity confines they more within the limit of nature hence they enjoy the blessing they feel not and be ignorant of they cause in the course of my practice i have have frequent occasion to be fully satisfy of this and have often hear a mother anxiously say ` the child have not be well ever since it have do puke and cry ' these complaint though not attend to point very plainly to the cause be it not very evident that when a child rid its stomach of its contents several time a day it have be overload while the natural strength last -lrb- for every child be bear with more health and strength than be generally imagine -rrb- it cry at or reject the superfluous load and _ thrive apace _ that be grow very fat bloated and distended beyond measure like a house lamb but in time the same oppressive cause continue the natural power be overcome be no longer able to throw off the unequal weight the child now unable to cry any more languish and be quiet the misfortune be that these complaint be not understand the child be swaddle and cram on till after gripe purge & c it sink under both burden into a convulsion fit and escape farther torture this would be the case with the lamb be it not kill when full fat that the present mode of nursing be wrong one would think need no other proof than the frequent miscarriage attend it the death of many and the ill health of those that survive but what i be go to complain of be that child in general be over-clothed and over-fed and fed and clothe improperly to these cause i attribute almost all they disease but the feeding of child be much more important to they than they clothing let we consider what nature direct in the case if we follow nature instead of lead or drive she we can not err in the business of nursing as well as physic art if it do not exactly copy this original be ever destructive if i could prevail no child should ever be cram with any unnatural mixture till the provision of nature be ready for it nor afterwards feed with any ungenial diet whatever at least for the _ first three month _ for it be not well able to digest and assimilate other element sooner i have see very healthy child that never eat or drink anything whatever but they mother 's milk for the first ten or twelve month nature seem to direct to this by give they no tooth till about that time the call of nature should be wait for to feed they with anything more substantial and the appetite ought ever to precede the food -- not only with regard to the daily meal but those change of diet which open increase life require but this be never do in either case which be one of the greatest mistake of all nurse when the child require more solid sustenance we be to inquire what and how much be most proper to give it we may be well assure there be a great mistake either in the quantity or quality of child 's food or both as it be usually give they because they be make sick by it for to this mistake i can not help impute nine in ten of all they disease as to quantity there be a most ridiculous error in the common practice for it be generally suppose that whenever a child cry it want victuals : it be accordingly feed ten or twelve or more time in a day and night this be so obvious a misapprehension that i be surprised it should ever prevail if a child 's want and motion be diligently and judiciously attend to it will be find that it never cry but from pain now the first sensation of hunger be not attend with pain accordingly a very young child that be hungry will make a hundred other sign of its want before it will cry for food if it be healthy and quite easy in its dress it will hardly ever cry at all indeed these sign and motion i speak of be but rarely observe because it seldom happen that child be ever suffer to be hungry -lrb- footnote : that which we commonly observe in they in such case and call by the name of hunger the doctor i suppose would regard as morbid or unnatural feeling wholly unworthy of the name of hunger -rrb- in a few very few whom i have have the pleasure to see reasonably nurse that be not feed above two or three time in twenty-four hour and yet be perfectly healthy active and happy i have see these signal which be as intelligible as if they have speak there be many fault in the quality of child 's food 1 it be not simple enough they pap panada gruel & c be generally enrich with sugar spice and other nice thing and sometimes a drop of wine -- none of which they ought ever to take we body never want they they be what luxury only have introduce to the destruction of the health of mankind 2 it be not enough that they food should be simple it should also be light many people i find be mistake in they notion of what be light and fancy that most kind of pastry pudding custard & c be light that be light of digestion but there be nothing heavier in this sense than unfermented flour and egg boil hard which be the chief ingredient in some of these preparation what i mean by light food -- to give the best idea i can of it -- be any substance that be easily separate and soluble in warm water good bread be the lightest thing i know and the fittest food for young child cow ' milk be also simple and light and very good for they but it be often injudiciously prepare it should never be boil for boil alter the taste and property of it destroy its sweetness and make it thicker heavier and less fit to mix and assimilate with the blood \* \* \* \* \* it be hardly necessary for I to repeat that in these general view of dr c with a few exception i entirely concur indeed some of they have already be present but i have express my doubt of the soundness of he conclusion in regard to sugar use with food in very small quantity by person whose stomach be already in a good condition both sugar and molasses especially the former appear to I not only harmless but wholesome and useful on the subject of simplicity in child 's food i should be glad to enlarge there be nothing more important in diet than simplicity and yet i think there be nothing more rare to suit the fashion everything must be mixed and vary i have no objection to variety at different meal both for child and adult indeed i be dispose to recommend it as will be see hereafter but i be utterly oppose to any considerable variety at the same meal and above all in a single dish the simpler a dish can be the better but let we look for a moment at the dish of food which be often present even at what be call plain table meat can not be eat -- so many person think -- without be cover with mustard or pepper or gravy -- or soak in vinegar and not a few regard they as insipid unless several of these be combined few people think a piece of plain boil or broil muscle -lrb- lean flesh -rrb- with nothing on it but a little salt be fit to be eat everything it be think must be render more stimulating or acrid or must be swim in gravy or melt fat or butter bread though proverbially the staff of life can scarcely be eat in its simple state it must be butter or honey or toast or soak in milk or dip in gravy pudding must have cherry or fruit of some sort or spice in they and must be sweeten largely or perhaps -- more ridiculous still -- they must have suet in they and after all this be do who can eat they without the addition of sauce or butter or molasses or cream potato boil steam or roasted delightful as they be to a unperverted appetite be yet think by many people hardly palatable till they be mash and butter or gravy or perhaps soak in vinegar in short the plainest and simplest article for the table be deem nearly unfit for the stomach till it have be butter and pepper and spice and perhaps _ pearlash _ even bread and milk must be fill with berry or fruit where can you find many adult who would relish a meal which should consist entirely of plain bread without any addition of plain potato without anything on they except a little salt of a plain rice pudding and nothing with it or of plain baked or boiled apple or pear and _ could _ such person be find how many of they would bring up they child to live on such plain dish it need not be wonder at that a palate which have be so long tickle by variety and by so many stimulate mixture of food should come to regard cold water for drink as insipid and should feel dissatisfied with it and desirous of boil some narcotic or poisonous herb in it or brewing it with something which will impart to it more or less of alcohol the wonder be not that some of we epicure become drunkard but that all of they do not dr cadogan allude to a sad mistake everywhere make about _ light _ food and condemn very justly hard-boiled custard pastry & c it be very strange that these substance -- for these be among the injurious article which i call mixture -- should ever have obtain currency in the world to the exclusion of bread which as the same writer justly say be among the lightest article of food which be know it be strange in particular what view people have about bread judge from what i see i be compel to believe that there be few who regard it in any other light than as a kind of necessary evil they appear to eat it not because they be fond of it by itself but because they _ must _ eat it or rather because it be a fashionable article and not to make believe they eat it at the least would be unfashionable they will get rid of it however when they can and when they must eat it they soak it or cover it with butter or milk or something else which will render it tolerable -- or toast it and use it as they may it must be hot from the oven after it be once cold very few will eat it the idea above all of make a full meal of simple cold bread twenty-four hour old would be reject by ninety-nine person in a hundred and by some with abhorrence people not only dislike bread but regard it as unnutritious i have hear many a fond parent say to the child who eat no meat and seem to depend almost wholly on bread -- why my dear child you will starve if you eat no meat do at least put some butter on you bread or you potato a thousand time have i be admonish when eat my vegetable dinner during the hot and fatiguing day of summer -- for i be breed to the farm and eat little or no meat till i be fourteen year of age -- to eat more butter or cheese or something that would give I strength for i could not work they say without something more nourishing than bread and the other vegetable and yet few if any boy of my age do more work or perform it better or with more ease than myself and i early observe the same thing in other vegetable eater the truth be there be nothing in the world better adapt to the daily want of the human stomach than good bread and few thing more nutritious there may be a little more nutriment in egg or jelly but if the former be hard-boiled the stomach can not digest they and fat meat of any kind be digest with great difficulty indeed it be doubtful whether stomach in temperate climate digest fat at all they may dissolve it but that be not make good chyle of it they may even reduce it to chyle _ but chyle be not blood _ fat may slip through the system without much of it _ adhering _ and i think it pretty evident that it usually do so the muscle -- the lean part of animal -- may be nearly as nutritious as good bread and be more easily digest but it be very far from be prove that for the healthy those thing be always best which be most easily digest nobody will pretend that potato be better for we than bread and yet the experiment of dr beaumont seem to prove that boil or roasted potato be much more quick and easy of digestion than bread of the first and best quality even over-boiled egg and raw cabbage bad as they be be dissolve in the stomach and appear to be digest as quick if not quicker than good wheat bread but nobody in the world will pretend they form more wholesome food neither be meat -- even _ lean _ meat -- necessarily more wholesome or better calculate to give strength than bread simply be cause it be more quickly and easily digest it would be nearer the truth to say that those substance which digest slowest -lrb- provide they do not irritate -rrb- be best adapt to the want of the human stomach the philosopher locke -- perhaps from he knowledge of medicine -- give some excellent direction on this subject great care should be use be say that the child eat bread plentifully both alone and with everything else and whatever he eat that be solid make he chew it well this writer by the way suppose that the tooth be make to be use in beat we food and that we ought neither to swallow it without chew as be customary in we busy new england nor to mash or soak it in order to save the labor of mastication -- a practice almost equally universal but let we hear he own word as for he diet it ought to be very plain and simple and if i might advise flesh should be forborne at least till he be two or three year old but of whatever advantage this may be to he future health and strength i fear it will hardly be consent to by parent mislead by the custom of eat too much flesh themselves who will be apt to think they child -- as they do themselves -- in danger to be starve if they have not flesh at least twice a day this i be sure child would breed they tooth with much less danger be freer from disease while they be little and lay the foundation of a healthy and strong constitution much surer if they be not cram so much as they be by fond mother and foolish servant and be keep wholly from flesh the first three or four year of they life be locke still live i should like to interrogate he at this place he first speak of give child no meat till they be two or three year old and then afterwards extend the period to three or four the question i would put be this : if the child be healthier without meat till he be three or four year old why not till he be thirteen or fourteen or even till thirty or forty or seventy and be not professor stuart of andover -- a meat eater himself and a advocate for its moderate use by those who have already be train to the use of it -- be not the professor i say more than half right when he assert as i have hear he that it may be well to train all child from the first to the exclusive use of vegetable food i have a few more extract from locke particularly on the subject of bread i should think that a good piece of well make and well baked brown bread would be often the best breakfast for my young master i be sure it be as wholesome and will make he as strong a man as greater delicacy and if he be use to it it will be as pleasant to he if he at any time call for victuals between meal use he to nothing but dry bread if he be hungry more than wanton bread will go down and if he be not hungry it be not fit that he should eat by this you will obtain two good effect first that by custom he will come to be in love with bread for as i say we palate and stomach too be pleased with the thing we be use to another good you will gain hereby be that you will not teach he to eat more nor oftener than nature require i do not think that all people 's appetite be alike some have naturally stronger and some weaker stomach but this i think that many be make gormand and glutton by custom that be not so by nature and i see in some country man as lusty and strong that eat but two meal a day as those that have set they stomach by a constant usage to call on they for four or five the roman usually fast till supper the only set meal even of those who eat more than once in a day and those who use breakfast as some do at eight same at ten other at twelve of the clock and some later neither eat flesh nor have anything make ready for they augustus when the greatest monarch on the earth tell we he take a piece of dry bread in he chariot and seneca in he 83d epistle give a account how be manage himself when he be old and he age permit indulgence say that he use to eat a piece of dry bread for he dinner without the formality of sit to it yet seneca as it be well know be wealthy the master of the world be bring up with this spare diet and the young gentleman of rome feel no want of strength or spirit because they eat but once a day or if it happen by chance that any one could not fast so long as till supper they only set meal he take nothing but a bit of dry bread or at most a few raisin or some such slight thing with it to stay he stomach and more than one set meal a day be think so monstrous that it be a reproach as low as caesar 's time to make a entertainment or sit down to a table till towards sunset therefore i judge it most convenient that my young master should have nothing but bread for breakfast i impute a great part of we disease in england to we eat too much flesh and too little bread dry bread though the best nourishment have the least temptation i shall not undertake to defend all the sentiment of mr locke in these extract but in regard to the main point -- the nutritive property and wholesome tendency of bread and the importance of make it a principal article of diet for child -- i think he view be just in short they do not differ substantially from those of a large proportion of the best writer on this subject in every country during the last three hundred year as if with one voice they dissuade from the use of too much animal food for the young and encourage the use of a larger proportion of vegetable food -- bread plain pudding rice potato turnip beet apple pear & c and milk yet they all or nearly all seem to write just as if they do not expect to be believe or if believe to be follow they seem to regard mankind as so inveterately attach to old habit and so much addict to flesh eating that there be little hope of reclaim they now though my opinion be no more entitle to respect than many of theirs i hope for greater success than they appear to do i expect that many young mother who read this work will be lead to think and inquire further on the subject and if they find that the view here advance be in accordance with reason and common sense and higher authority i be not without hope that they will reform and do what they can to reform they neighbor i have dwell the longer in this section on the _ general _ principle of diet because i be of opinion that whatever be true on this subject in regard to the diet of child soon after wean be equally or nearly equally applicable to the whole of childhood youth manhood and age it be not true that one period of life and one mode of employment demand a diet essentially different from that which be demand at another period and in other circumstance provide always that the individual be in health occasional instance of the kind there may be but they be not numerous the digestive power of the young be more nearly as strong as those of the adult than be usually admit and they be much more active they require a less quantity of food undoubtedly and they should be feed at shorter interval but as a general rule what be best for they as regard its quality at three year old be best for they at thirty or should they live so long at ninety i repeat it there be very little difference in the nature of the food require ever after teethe let I not be understand as say that the strong and the robust and the active can not digest food which the weak and enervated and indolent can not undoubtedly they can but this do not prove that they _ ought _ to do it it do not prove that they strength and vigor be not give they for other purpose than to be expend on the poorer substance for food when they might have better nor be it true as often pretend that the hard laborer need either more food or that which be of a stronger quality just in proportion to the severity of he labor the man or the child who labor moderately just sufficient for the purpose of health and labor with he hand in the open air need rather _ more _ food than the indolent or the sedentary or those who labor to excess but not that which be of a stronger quality it be he who labor to excess -- if any difference of quality be require at all -- who should eat milder food as well as less in quantity some physician there be who tell we that all mankind would live longer as well as be more healthful if they eat nothing but bread and drink nothing but water it may be so but i do not believe it water as i shall show hereafter be indeed the only appropriate drink but i do not believe that bread even after the second year be in all case and circumstance the best food besides that the experiment of majendie and other physiologist go a little way -- though not far i confess -- to prove that animal generally -lrb- and if so why not man as well as the rest -rrb- thrive best with some degree of variety in they food it seem to I more in accordance with the general intention of the creator so far as we can discover what they be while therefore i deny that either milk or bread be better in all case for human sustenance than any other article of food i must at the same time be permit to regard they as among the best and as deserving more general attention every infant after leave the breast should as it seem to I make bread in some of its form a chief article of food this article so justly and emphatically call the staff of life may be find in almost every country common sense seem to have dictate the propriety of its use though fashion have often lead we to overlook or despise it -- like air and fire and water and nearly every other common but indispensable blessing the best kind of bread be make from wheat the worst from bark saw-dust & c wood and bark afford so little nutriment that it be only in such country as norway sweden lapland iceland greenland and siberium that the inhabitant can be induce to make use of they here they be often useful either because people can not get food which be better or to blend with they fat or oily animal food for it should never be forget that healthy digestion require a large proportion of innutritious matter along with the pure nutriment in order to make bread from wheat the meal should not be bolt if it seem to contain particle which be too coarse it may be well to pass it through a coarse family sieve but the best bread i have ever eat as well as the cleanest and neatest be not sift at all i know there be a almost universal prejudice against this sort of bread some complain that it scratch they throat other that it be tasteless and other still that it do not agree with they with other there be another objection -- which be that bread of this sort have sometimes be call _ dyspepsia _ bread and with other still that it have be call _ graham _ bread either of these appellation seem sufficient to condemn it now as to the harshness this be owe to its be make of bad material or to its be baked too hard or keep too long much of what they call dyspepsia bread in we city be evidently make by mix the bran and flour of wheat after they have be once separate besides which in not a few case the finest of the flour appear to be take away now bread make of such material thus combine will always be darker color as well as harsher than when make from the wheat simply ground without any bolting and wet up in the usual manner such bread be best two or three day old after four day it become dry and somewhat harsh they who complain that such bread be insipid be person whose appetite have be injure by food which be high-seasoned and who if they eat bread at all must eat it hot or soaked in butter no wonder such person do not like plain bread and say it be tasteless but it must not be deny that baker often suffer this kind of bread to be over-risen in order to make it sufficiently light and porous this render it less tasteful and from the saleratus they use less wholesome no child who have be accustom from the first to good wheaten bread make of unbolted meal and not less than one day old will ever prefer any other until he have be render capricious on this subject and wish to change for the sake of change or until he have be mislead by surround example i speak from observation when i say that infant whose habit have not be deprave will not prefer hot bread of any kind it be hot mother i have hear they say as a apology for refuse a piece of bread but never it be cold or it be too old it be the epicurean -- it be he with whom it be a sufficient objection to any kind of food whatever that he have use it for several successive meal or day -- that be most ready to complain of good bread he whose habit be correct and who be the more unwilling to change any of he article of diet the longer he have be in the use of they and who only change they or use variety from principle -- he i say will never complain of harshness or want of taste in good wheat bread nor will it be a objection of weight with he that _ mr graham _ have recommend it or that it have either prevent or cure _ dyspepsia _ nor will the epicurean himself complain that bread be insipid after be confine to it for a month or six week he will then find a sweetness in it for which he have long seek in vain in the more delicate and costly viand of a luxurious and expensive and unchristian modern table it be they only who observe simplicity and confine themselves to very plain food who truly enjoy pleasure in eat the bulk of mankind benumb they sense of taste by they high-seasoned over-stimulating food and drink and by such constant variety and strange mixture and thus in they eager cry who will show we any good they actually enjoy less than he who eat plain food and be contented with it bread of all kind be greatly improve in whiteness and pleasantness by be wet with milk though even when wet with nothing but water there be a solid and rational sweetness to it of which the despiser of bread and devourer of much flesh and condiment never dream and never will dream till they reform they habit if child be furnish with good bread on the plan of mr locke there be no doubt that they will relish it most keenly that they attachment to it will strengthen and that unless we give they other food occasionally from principle or seduce they by deprave they taste they will continue it through life train up a child in the way he should go and when he be old he will not depart from it be a general rule and have as few exception when apply to the diet of a child as when it be apply to he moral taste and preference with those parent who though convince of the justness of the view here advance have already train they child in the way they should _ not _ go but be anxious to retrace they step as far as possible there will here be a difficulty we child they will say do not at present _ relish _ the kind of bread you speak of and how shall we bring they to do so or be the thing indeed possible the answer to these inquiry be easy such parent have only to confine they child to the kind of food which they deem proper for they a few week or a few month and they will soon relish they if those who be old enough to be convince can be bring to unite heartily in the change and to endeavor to be please with it the work of reformation will be more pleasant and probably more speedy i have never find any difficulty of bring myself to relish in a very short time a article of food for which i have no relish before and to which i have even a dislike provide i be thoroughly convince it be best for I and be earnest in the desire of change -- except sweet oil to which i be about six month in become reconcile it be with physical as with moral habit in they formation we should fix on what we believe from experience observation and divine and human testimony be best for we and habit will soon render it agreeable it be important even to health that food should be agreeable but as i have already say what we know to be best for we will soon become agreeable if we confine ourselves to it and to we child also if we confine they to it in like manner next to bread make of wheat -- when that can not be procure -- be a mixture of wheat and indian meal but the proportion of the latter should be the smallest wheat rye and indian in the proportion of one third of each make excellent bread sometimes call _ third _ bread rye and indian make a tolerable bread rye alone be not so good the want in the latter of the vegetable principle call gluten make its general use of very questionable propriety indian meal alone baked in cake by the fire if eat only in small quantity be a very nutritious and by no means unwholesome bread but its sweetness and the general fondness which people who be accustom to its use have for it lead they to eat it in too large proportion if they use it while it be warm in these circumstance it prove itself too active for the stomach and bowels if warm six ounce be as much as a hearty adult ought to eat of it at once and child should of course take much less it be less active on the bowels and scarcely less agreeable as soon as we become accustomed to it if eat when it be cold -- even if baked in loaf in the oven potato add to unbolted wheat flour make excellent bread and so as i be inform do rice of the latter however i have never eat oats and barley and many other grain and substance will make bread but it be of a inferior kind the question may again recur after this extended series of remark whether i intend to confine the young almost exclusively to bread in one or another of its form we shall see how this be presently while bread therefore should constitute a part at least and sometimes the whole of a meal a great variety of other article be not only admissible but desirable among these may be mention plain pudding one of the most wholesome pudding be make of indian meal enclose in a bag and boil nearly ally to this be the common hasty pudding but the last be less wholesome because it require less chewing and it ought to have be observe before now that after wean any food be digest better which have undergo the process of thorough mastication boil rice though hardly to be regard as a pudding be very nutritious and very easy of digestion i be not without doubt however in regard to the utility of a large proportion of rice as food a dinner of it two or three time a week i believe to be wholesome but use too frequently it seem to I not active enough for the stomach and bowels have in this respect precisely a contrary effect to that of warm indian cake the common notion that rice have a tendency to make people blind be entirely unfounded its worst effect be when eat without be boil through in such case i have know it to do mischief perhaps because it be swallow without much chew some grind it and use the flour but i can not recommend it to be use in this manner the best pudding in the world be a loaf of bread -lrb- what -- you will say -- bread again -rrb- three or four or five day old boil or rather _ steamed _ in milk all kind of bread be excellent for this purpose but wheat and indian be the best they be excellent even without milk -- that be simply steamed pudding make of the flour of wheat rye buckwheat & c be less wholesome than those which have be already mention and all sort of pudding be less wholesome when eat as hot as we unreasonable fashion require than when they temperature be quite below that of we body i would not have they so cold as to chill we for this would be to go to the other though less dangerous extreme but they ought to be cool too much heat be a unnatural stimulus likely to leave more or less debility behind it in addition to this those who eat hot food be more expose to take cold in consequence of it with none of these pudding ought we to mix any fruit green or dry -- not even raisin some of the more important property of nearly every kind of fruit or berry be lose by boil unless we eat the water in which they be boil and save the vapor which would otherwise escape i be not in favor of boil fruit generally especially if boil in pudding pudding like most other kind of food -- even bread -- may be slightly salt : not that this be indispensable but because the balance of human testimony be in its favor the argument that we evidently need salt because the other animal require it be without much weight the other animal do not _ generally _ require or use it -lrb- footnote : some considerable savage nation use no salt and a few have a strong aversion to it -rrb- the case so often triumphantly mention where animal appear to thrive better from the use of it be only exception to the general rule nor be they very numerous in comparison with the whole race of animal still i have no objection to its moderate use it may be useful in prevent worm though there be doubt even of that in large quantity it be unquestionably hurtful but neither fruit nor berry -- permit I to repeat the sentiment -- no nor any such thing as cinnamon or spice nor even sugar or molasses in any considerable quantity should go into the composition of any sort of pudding if the pudding be not sweet enough without it be better to add a little sugar or molasses on you plate nor should sauce or cream or butter or suet be use in or upon they though of all these substance cream be least injurious nutmeg grate cheese & c be unnecessary and hurtful cheese should never be eat in any way there be one thing however which may be eat in moderate quantity with all sort of pudding and with bread i mean milk i say eat _ with _ for it be better never to put these substance nor indeed any other _ into _ the milk the bread pudding & c should be eat by itself and the milk by itself also in this way we shall not be liable to cheat the tooth out of what be justly they due and then make the deranged stomach and general system pay for it potato be a good article of diet -- to be use once a day -- though they be not very nutritious they be best either steam or roasted in the ash they be also excellent when boil turnip be also good onion be not so useful as be generally suppose except for the purpose of medicine beet in small quantity and carrot and asparagus and above all bean and pea -- but not they pod -- be tolerable food once a day during most of the year except it be the middle of the winter but neither these nor potato nor any other vegetable ought to be cook in any way with fat or fat meat or butter or be mash after they be cook or eat with oil or butter if there be a exception to this general rule -- which may seem to be rather sweeping -- it should be in favor of a little sweet oil on rice or on bread pudding but the common practice found upon the apparent belief that we can scarcely eat anything until it be well cover with lard or butter be quite objectionable -- nay it be even disgusting no pure stomach would ever prefer oily bread or pudding or bean or pea and most people would abhor the sight of such a strange combination be not habit in its power to change we very nature almost omnipotent sec 10 _ remark on fruit _ there be a very great diversity of opinion on the subject of fruit some maintain that all fruit even in the most ripe and perfect state be of doubtful utility especially for child other say none be hurtful if ripe and eat in moderate quantity some require care in make a proper selection but here again in regard to what constitute a proper selection there be a difference of opinion some consider fruit easy of digestion other believe they be digest only with very great difficulty when the cholera prevail in the large city of the united state a majority of the physician believe all fruit even those which be ripe to be injurious in they tendency but it be insist by the minority -- i think very justly -- that whenever fruit appear to be injurious it be accidental -- that be the disease be prepare to make its attack just at that time happen to do so immediately after the use of fruit rather than something else and especially in the _ season _ of fruit -- or on account of excess or -lrb- which be certainly the case in some instance -rrb- because the quality of the fruit be bad at present the _ weight _ of testimony on this subject -- estimate accord to talent and not accord to number -- be in favor of good fruit use with moderation -- even in the face of the cholera dr dunglison -- one of the last to adopt such a opinion -- appear to be in its favor on several point in regard to fruit i believe that among medical man there be no essential difference of opinion as i always prefer in controversy to see in how many thing antagonist agree before proceed to the point in which they differ i will here endeavor to enumerate they 1 all unripe fruit especially if eat raw and uncooked -- let the season or prevalent disease or individual be what or who it may -- be unwholesome 2 excess in the use of the most wholesome fruit under any circumstance be also injurious 3 fruit eat immediately after a full meal when the stomach be in a improper condition for receive anything more contribute to overtask the digestive power and must hence produce more or less of injury 4 the skin and kernel of the larger fruit be unwholesome because indigestible the skin of fruit if beat or masticate finely may appear to be digest because dissolve but i have already endeavor to show that solution be not always digestion 5 fruit of all kind be most wholesome in they own country and in they own appropriate season 6 dry fruit be less wholesome than fresh 7 fruit of all kind should be withhold from infant until they have tooth thus far as i have already say all agree at least so far as i know there be several other point on which medical man be generally agree though not universally one of these be that fruit if eat at all should usually form a part of a regular meal another be that it be better not to eat they immediately before go to bed there be contradictory opinion among the mass of the community physician as well as other on the general intention of we summer fruit from the fact that child 's disease prevail more at the season of the year when fruit be more abundant many think the fruit be the immediate cause of they other and with better reason suppose that the latter be intend by the author of nature to check or prevent the bowel disease of summer nothing certainly be more unnatural than to suppose that at the very season of the year when so many other influence combine to awaken a tendency to disease in the human system the creator should place before we eye a abundance of fruit invite we by all they cooling and tempting property only to do we mischief on the contrary it seem to I much more probable that many of they be design for we moderate use in what quantity under what circumstance and which be best it be leave to human experience to determine some say that fruit should never be eat in the morning before breakfast now everything i know of the human constitution together with what i have learn from experience and observation have be for year lead I to the contrary opinion indeed i be most fully convince that of all period for eat fruit whether we use it alone or make it a part of we regular meal the morning soon after we rise be the most favorable -lrb- footnote : i ought to remark that as the morning be the best time for eat _ good _ fruit so it be the very worst time for eat it if _ not _ good and as a large proportion of that which be eat be unripe or otherwise bad this may account for the general prejudice against eat it at this period -rrb- my reason be as follow : 1 the rest and sleep of the precede night have restore we general vigor and consequently have invigorate the stomach so that digestion will be more easily and perfectly accomplish 2 we have be at we rise so long without food on we stomach that they be not likely to be oppress by a moderate quantity of good ripe wholesome fruit in the course of we wake hour meal follow each other in such quick succession and there be so much variety even at the plainest table to tempt we to excess that there be more danger of injury from the addition of fruit than at we first rise 3 i have never know any one to receive injury from the use of fruit in this way provide no other circumstance in relation to quantity quality & c have be disregard in my own case the practice have on the contrary seem beneficial 4 there be one reason in favor of this practice which perhaps would have less weight if people rise as early in the morning as they ought or in the language of dr franklin to the inhabitant of pari if they know that the sun give light as soon as he rise i allude to the demand which i conceive that the stomach make for something after so long fasting and the pernicious custom of late breakfast i be persuade that it be advisable to eat something nearly as soon as we rise be it never so early and if we can get nothing else for breakfast and have not accustomed ourselves to relish a piece of good bread or some other simple thing which require no labor of preparation i think it perfectly proper to eat a small quantity of fruit we come now to the particular consideration of some of those fruit which universal experience have show to be the most salutary of all these none be more wholesome than the apple there be indeed a great diversity in the quality even of this single article sweet apple be the most nutritious but perhaps those which be gently acid and at the same time mealy be rather more cooling and when eat raw and in the heat of summer not less wholesome apple which come to maturity very early in the season appear as a general rule to be less rich and even less perfect than those which ripen later in view of this fact some writer have endeavor to dissuade we from they use and among other mr locke we may judge a little what he opinion be from he conclude remark on the subject : -- i never know apple hurt anybody say he after October but although neither apple nor any other fruit which ripen uncommonly early be quite so good as those which come in a little later yet i do not think they be to be wholly reject unless they have be raise in hot house fruit and indeed vegetable in general whose maturity be hasten by artificial process must be less wholesome than when bring to perfection in nature 's own appropriate time and manner i ought to say however very distinctly that of the fruit of any particular tree those which first ripen be always the worst for they be usually wormy or otherwise defective most of the fruit as well as other vegetable bring to we city market in this country be utterly unfit to be eat sometimes it be immature sometimes it have a hot house maturity sometimes it have be pick so long that it have begin to decay many fruit -- berry especially -- be in perfection for a very short period only mulberry for example -- one kind especially -- be not in perfection long enough to carry to the market house even though the distance be very small luckily however very few mulberry be eat but the raspberry and strawberry if perfect when gather have usually begin to decay before they be purchase that this appear to be rather unfrequent be because they be gather before they be ripe dr dewee regard most fruit as difficult of digestion i do not think they be so if perfect and ripe the experiment of dr beaumont so far as they prove any general principle show conclusively that mellow sweet apple be more quickly digest than any kind of vegetable food whatever except rice and sago but even admit they be slow of digestion i do not think -- as i have already show in another place -- that they ought on that account to be exclude besides my opinion differ from that of dr d in regard to the strength of the digestive power of child after teethe they seem to I to be able to digest any substance which adult can and with as little difficulty but to return : -- no fruit be in perfection longer than the apple besides no fruit appear to be less injure in its nature and property by pick it a little before it be ripe and preserve it during the winter it be on this account more perhaps than any other that i value it more highly than all other fruit unite apple may be use either raw or cook in either case the skin and seed should be avoid as have be before suggest i be not ignorant that willich in he lecture on diet and regimen -- a excellent work in the main -- say that the seed ought to be eat but i believe few physiologist would comply with he injunction especially when it be consider that he recommend in the same connection that we swallow the stone of cherry and plum strange how far we theory will sometimes carry we the apple be excellent when roasted or baked especially the sweet apple it be very common in some place to eat baked sweet apple with milk and the practice be by no mean a bad one indeed baked or raw apple might be advantageously make a part of at least one of we meal every day there be say to be a miserly farmer -- a single gentleman -- in the western part of the state of massachusett who have live on nothing but apple for he food and water for he drink about forty year and yet he be say to enjoy the most perfect health i do not propose this as a example worthy of imitation but it show that apple maybe make to subserve a important purpose in diet and though i have more than once express a opinion highly unfavorable to the exclusive use of any one article of diet yet if i be to confine myself to any one thing i know of nothing except bread that i should prefer to good apple still however i prefer a variety -- sweet sour early late & c and i should use they raw roasted baked make into sauce with new or unfermented cider and boil good apple eat raw with bread form not only a very wholesome but to a unperverted appetite a most delicious dinner much have be say about cut down orchard but the whole seem to I idle -- for if the fruit be of a good quality it may be use as food either for man or beast and if not good the tree ought either to be destroy or replace by those that will produce fruit which be better -- even if the object be to make it into cider i have say that apple may be use both by man and beast it be well know that most domestic animal thrive well on good apple especially sweet one very tolerable molasses be also sometimes make from sweet apple nearly everything which have be say above in regard to apple will apply to pear the best variety of this excellent fruit be quite as nutritious and as wholesome as the apple and as much improve for the table by bake i believe however that no cheap process have yet be devise for keep they as long in the winter they may be preserve in the form of sauce prepare in the same way with common apple sauce the skin of many kind of pear be less injurious than those of apple but even the skin of pear need not be eat some kind of peach be tolerably wholesome but the stringy character of they pulp appear to I to render they less so than apple and pear though i be not confident on this point but if use at all they should be use in less quantity at one time tempting as they flavor be i seldom eat they when i can get apple and pear hold myself in duty bind to use the _ best _ even of the fruit fruit say mr locke make one of the most difficult chapter in the government of health especially that of child we first parent venture paradise for it and it be no wonder we child can not stand the temptation though it cost they they health the regulation of this can not come under any one general rule for i be by no means of they mind who would keep child wholly from fruit as a thing totally unwholesome for they by which strict way they make they but the more ravenous after it to eat good or bad ripe or unripe all that they can get whenever they come at it melon peach most sort of plum and all sort of grape in _ england _ i think child should be wholly keep from as have a very tempting taste in a very unwholesome juice so that if it be possible they should never so much as see they or know that there be any such thing but strawberry cherry gooseberry and currant when thoroughly ripe i think may be pretty safely allow they excellent as these remark be in general i do not like he entire interdiction of the use of melon peach plum and grape even in england peach to be sure as they come at a season when apple or pear or both of they -- which be more wholesome than peach -- be abundant may be better omit delicious as they be to the taste and i do not think very highly of plum but melon in very moderate quantity and grape if we eat nothing but the ripe pulp reject both the husk and the interior hard part include the seed be i think useful and wholesome on the other hand i should never place cherry and gooseberry in the same list with strawberry for the latter be if i may use the expression infinitely the most wholesome many seem to think that not to eat all sort of fruit be to despise or at least to treat with neglect the gift of god intend for we reception by which they mean if they mean anything that the use of all sort of fruit be already find out even in the present comparative infancy of the world now i do not suppose that god have make anything in vain -- absolutely so -- though i do not think we have find out the true use of half the thing which he have make and give we and among those thing of which we be yet ignorant be some of the fruit i do not believe it follow necessarily that because fruit be create we be oblige to use they all besides if this be a rule it be one which nobody follow every one use more of some sort and fewer of other and a large proportion of the community entirely reject some kind now if the statement commonly make that all fruit be the gift of god and ought therefore to be use by all person be correct those who make the statement ought to conform to it as a rule of they life and to eat all kind of fruit which the season and country afford and not only eat all kind but see that the whole of every kind be consume since to waste any portion be to slight the good gift of god the result then be that we can not obey such a rule but be drive back to the mode which common sense dictate which be to make a selection use some and reject other and the value of study the nature of these fruit by examine the experience of mankind in regard to they consist in the aid thus afford we in make we selection wisely there be one very common error in the use of the smaller summer fruit such as strawberry whortleberry currant & c which be that of mix cream wine spice sugar & c with they we be thus tempt to eat too great a quantity at once besides -- which be a worse evil -- we change the proportion of the saccharine part and thus do all in we power by increase a similarity in all fruit to destroy that agreeable variety which god have establish and which be probably salutary sec 11 _ confectionary _ by confectionary we here mean the substance usually sell at those shop in we city distinguish by the general name of confectionary and which consist either wholly of sugar or of sugar and some other substance combine as to the use of a moderate quantity of pure sugar at we meal whether it be procure at a confectioner 's shop or elsewhere i do not know that there be any strong objection to it though i believe that it can not be regard as indispensable to health -- for be that the fact it seem to I to imply something short of infinite wisdom in the creation of article destine for we sustenance but i have speak on this subject elsewhere a part however of the contents of the confectionary shop be actually poisonous i refer to those thing which be either frost as it be call or color the substance apply to the sugar for this purpose be usually some mineral or vegetable poison although the fact of its be a poison may not always be know to the manufacturer the most unhappy consequence have occasionally follow the use of confectionary when poison in this manner a family of four person in new york be make sick in this way in march of year before last and some of they come very near lose they life the frosting which cause the mischief be pronounce by eminent chemist to be one fifth rank poison -lrb- footnote : it be to be remember that those who eat confectionary so slightly poison that it do not make they sick at once may nevertheless be as much injure in they constitution as they who be poison outright in the latter case the poison be in part throw out of the body in the former it remain in it much longer -- and therefore more surely though more slowly accomplish the work of destruction -rrb- the color substance use be sometimes poisonous as well as the frost some of the article sell at these shop consist of sugar mix with paste other be call sweetmeat that be fruit or rind of fruit preserve in sugar all these substance i believe without exception be injurious the great evil of confectionary yet remain to be mention these be of three kind physical mental and moral some of the _ physical _ evil have it be true just be mention but there be another evil of still greater magnitude young people who eat confectionary commonly eat it between meal this produce mischief in two way first it keep the stomach at work when it ought to rest for this like every other muscular organ require its season of repose secondly it destroy gradually the appetite so that when the regular meal arrive the accustomed keenness of appetite do not come with it and the consequence be not so much that we do not eat enough as that we be fastidious and eat a little of this then a little of that and usually select the worst thing we be not hungry enough to make a meal of a single article of plain food and this evil go on increase as long as we have access to the confectionary shop these statement describe the case of thousand of pupil of both sex at we school and seminary the _ intellectual _ evil result from the use of confectionary consist in the fondness for excitement which be produce you will seldom find a person who depend daily and almost hourly on some excitement to he appetite and stomach and be not satisfy with plain food who will content himself to _ study _ without unnatural excitement of the mind duty to himself or to other will not move he he must have before he the hope of reward or the fear of punishment he must be move by emulation or ambition or some other questionable or wicked motive or passion but the _ moral _ result to the young of use confectionary be still more dreadful i do not here refer to the danger of meeting with bad company at the shop themselves or of go from these place of pollution _ directly _ to the grog-shop the gambling-house or the brothel though there be danger enough even here but i allude to the tendency which a habit of not rest satisfied with plain food but of depend on exciting thing have to make we dissatisfy with plain moral enjoyment -- the society of friend and the quiet discharge of we duty to god and we neighbor just in proportion as we gratify we propensity for excitement at the confectioner 's shop just in the same proportion do we expose ourselves to the danger of yield to temptation should other gratification present themselves the young of both sex who be in the use of confectionary be on the high road to gluttony drunkenness or debauchery perhaps to all three i do not say they will certainly arrive there for circumstance not quite miraculous may pluck they as brand from the burning but i do not hesitate to say that such be the inevitable tendency and i call on every mother and teacher who read this section to beware of confectionary and see if possible that the young never set foot in they they be a road through which thousand pass to the chamber of death -- death to the immortal spirit as well as to the body its vehicle more might be add -- for this be a important subject -- but i trust i have say enough those who have read and believe what i have write if they remain wholly unaffected and unmoved would not be rouse to effort be anything to be add sec 12 _ pastry _ dr pari a distinguished british writer on diet say that all pastry be a abomination and yet go where we will we find it often on the table hardly any one whether old or young attempt to do without it there be indeed some who will not eat pie-crust or high-seasoned cake form of paste but yet will not hesitate to eat hot bread or roll or biscuit make of wheat flour bolt now what be this but paste if we could see the contents of the stomach a hour after the mass be swallow we should find it to be paste and _ mere _ paste and yet the evil be increase everywhere so generally be this true that a person who refuse to eat hot bread or cake or biscuit be deem singular he who venture to lift he voice against it be deem a ascetic or a visionary but such a voice must be raise and hear too whether its monition be or be not regard pastry be less objectionable however when use in the form of hot bread & c than when butter or fat be mix with it then it become one of the most indigestible substance in the world besides it not only try the patience of the stomach but accord to willich whose authority rank high it tend to produce disease of the skin especially a disease which he call copper in the face and which he pronounce incurable i know not whether the eruption so common on the face of young people in this country and especially of young man be in every instance either produce or aggravate by pastry but i be very sure of one thing viz that those who be in the use of pastry and have eruption of the skin of any kind will not be apt to get well as long as they continue the use of this objectionable substance physician be often consult about eruption on the face when they assign the real cause which be undoubtedly connect with the improper gratification of some of the appetite in one way or another it be seldom that the patient have self-command enough to follow he prescription of temperance or abstinence mother it be yours to prevent this mischief -- first by establish correct physical habit secondly by teach you child the great duty of self-denial -- not only by precept but by you own good example sec 13 _ crude or raw substance _ i have reserve this section for remark on certain article use at we fashionable modern table of which i could not well find it convenient to speak elsewhere and first of salad and herb use in cooking such as asparagus artichoke spinage plantain cabbage dock lettuce water-cress chive & c several of these substance be often eat raw in which state they be exceedingly indigestible at the best and they be render still more beyond the reach of the power of the stomach by the oil or vinegar which be add to they boil they be more tolerable especially asparagus in the midst however of such a abundance of excellent food as this country afford it be most surprising that anybody should ever take it into they head to eat such crude substance and above all that they should fill child 's stomach with they what child with a unperverted appetite would not prefer a good ripe apple or peach or pear to the most approved raw salad -- and a good baked one to the best boil asparagus nut in general be probably make for other animal rather than man though of this we can not in the present infancy of human knowledge be quite certain but if any of they be intend by the creator for man it be the chesnut and this should be boil boil chesnut be use as food in many part of southern europe and to a very considerable extent spice as they be sometimes call such as nutmeg mace pepper pimento cubeb cardamom juniper berry ginger calamus clove cinnamon caraway coriander fennel parsley dill sage marjoram thyme pennyroyal lavender hyssop peppermint & c be unfit for the human stomach -- above all in infancy -- except as medicine there be several other vegetable equally objectionable with the last though they can not be class under the same head such be mustard horseradish raw onion garlic cucumber and pickle no appetite which have not be accustom to these substance in early infancy will ever require they not that they may not sometimes be useful in enable the stomach -- at every age -- to get rid of certain substance with which it have be improperly or unreasonably load -- this be undoubtedly the fact ardent spirit would do the same and it be with a view to some such effect generally that medical writer have speak in they favor some of they stimulate the stomach to get rid of a load of _ green _ fruit other of a load of _ fat _ or _ salt _ food other again of too large a _ quantity _ of food which be naturally wholesome but in all these case they should be consider not as food but as medicine and we ought to call they by they right name and if we withhold the cause of the disease there will be no need of the medicine chapter viii drink infant need little drink adult even generally drink to cool themselves simple water the best drink opinion of dr oliver and dr dewee animal food increase thirst only one real drink in the world the true object of all drink tea coffee chocolate beer & c milk and water molasses and water & c cider wine and ardent spirit bad food and drink the most prolific source of disease child naturally prefer water danger of hot drink cold drink mischief they produce caution to mother extract drink cold water while hot child need little if any drink so long as they food be nothing but milk nor indeed for some time afterward unless they be indulge in the use of animal food adult even very seldom drink merely to quench natural thirst in the summer people usually drink either to cool themselves or to gratify a thirst which be wholly artificial tea coffee beer cider and most other common drink when not use for the sake of they coolness be drink both in winter and summer for this purpose that this be the fact we have the most abundant and unequivocal evidence i know that much be say of the demand which a profuse perspiration create among hard laborer in the summer such a sudden abstraction of a large amount of fluid require it be say a proportional supply or life would soon become extinct yet there be many old man who have perspire profusely at they labor all they day and yet have drink nothing at all except they tea morning and evening and perhaps have eat for one or two of they meal daily in summer a bowl of bread and milk and some of they be among the most remarkable instance of longevity which the country afford how the system acquire a sufficient supply of moisture to keep up good health in these case i do not pretend to determine : perhaps it be through the medium of the lung but at any rate it can obtain it without we drinking for that sole purpose to the great danger of exciting liver complaint diarrhoea dyspepsia cold rheumatism and fever but if adult who perspire freely do not require much drink child certainly do not and above all young child and if they do require any thing it be only simple water the follow remark of dr oliver of hanover nh be extract from dr mussey 's late prize essay on ardent spirit : who have not observe the extreme satisfaction which child derive from quench they thirst with pure water and who that have pervert he appetite for drink by stimulate he palate with bitter beer sour cider rum and water and other beverage of human invention but would be a gainer even on the score of mere animal gratification without any reference to health if he could bring back he vitiated taste to the simple relish of nature child drink because they be dry grown people drink whether dry or not because they have discover a way of make drink pleasant child drink water because this be a beverage of nature 's own brewing which she have make for the purpose of quench a natural thirst grow people drink anything but water because this fluid be intend to quench only a natural thirst and natural thirst be a thing which they seldom feel there be a great deal of truth as well as of sound philosophy in these two paragraph and little less of truth in the follow paragraph from dr dewee : we have witness very often with sorrow parent give to they young child wine or other stimulate liquor nature never intend anything stronger than water to be the drink for child this they enjoy greatly and much advantage be occasionally experience from its use especially after they have commence the use of animal food two thing be to be observe in the last remark which be that child demand drink of any kind but seldom and that even this occasional demand be often the special result of the use of animal food here come out a important secret it be the use of animal food to a very great degree in adult and child both that create so much of that unnatural thirst which prevail in the community when we shall come to lay aside animal food in childhood youth manhood and age much that be now _ call _ thirst will be banish and much of the intemperance and other kind of sensuality which follow in its train it have be sometimes say that there be but one kind of drink in the world -- and that be water this be strictly or rather _ physiologically _ true for though many mixture be _ call _ drink it be only the water which they contain that answer any of the legitimate purpose for which drink be intend by the creator the object of drink besides quench we thirst or rather _ while _ it quench it be not to be digest like food but to pass directly from the stomach into the blood-vessel and dilute and temper the blood render it more fit to answer the great purpose of sustain life and health now there be nothing that can do this but water alcohol can not do it nor can turpentine oil quicksilver melt lead or any other liquid tea coffee chocolate small beer soda water lemonade & c which be nearly all water quench the thirst very well it be true but not quite so well as water alone would the narcotic principle of the first two the alcoholic principle of the fourth and the mucilage nutriment acid and alkali of the rest be in the way for thirst would be quench still better without they even when it be of a unnatural kind indeed the same or similar remark may be make in regard to all other mixture which be usually propose as drink even milk and water molasses and water & c in favor of which so much be say be objectionable as mere drink not that they contain anything poisonous but they evidently contain nutriment and even this except as a part or the whole of a regular meal do harm for it set the stomach at work when it need repose mere drink as i have already say be never digest but if the drink above mention and even milk and water be objectionable what shall we say of cider wine and ardent spirit -- substance which contain the latter one half and the two former from one twentieth to one fourth alcohol surely nobody will deny that these substance ought at all event to be banish from the nursery and yet we occasionally find they there not only for the use of the mother to the ruin of the child indirectly -- but also in some of they smoother form for the use of the child itself i would not lay too much stress on food and drink for as i have already observe more than once the cause of infantile ill health and mortality be numerous still i must insist that of all the source of disease these be the most prolific much be do towards ruin the health of child by the improper food and drink of the mother but when in addition to all this the child themselves be early feed with animal food and with stimulate drink -- punch coffee tea & c -- and a artificial thirst be early excited and render habitual they destruction for time and eternity be almost inevitable very few child relish any drink but water or sweeten water at first and where they do it be probably hereditary i have be strike with they taste and preference nor less with the folly of those around they in endeavor to change they by require they -- almost always against they will -- to sip a little coffee or a little tea or a little lemonade or it may be a little toddy such child _ may _ escape the death of the drunkard or the debauchee but if they do it will not be through the instrumentality of the parent i be very much oppose to give child hot drink of any kind if they be to drink substance which be injurious as tea or coffee let they be cool i do not say _ cold _ for that would be go to the other extreme but no drink in any ordinary case should be above the heat of we body that be about 98 degree of fahrenheit 's thermometer yet the precaution of this paragraph will be almost unnecessary if child be confine -- as they ought to be and would be do we not go out of we way to teach they otherwise -- to water as they only drink cold water be almost always prefer not one child in a thousand would ever prefer it hot until he taste have be pervert no writer have inveigh more against hot drink of every kind than the late william cobbett -- and as i think with more justice but in avoid one rock we must not as have already be intimate make shipwreck on another hot drink though they injure the power of the stomach and by that mean and through that medium be one principal cause of the almost universal early decay of tooth be yet less injurious or at least less dangerous immediately than cold one mr locke in speaking of the sport of a child in the open air have the follow quaint but judicious remark : play in the open air have but this one danger in it that i know and that be that when he be hot with run up and down he should sit or lie down on the cold or moist earth this i grant and drinking cold drink when they be hot with labor or exercise bring more people to the grave or to the brink of it by fever and other disease than anything i know these mischief be easily enough prevent when he be little be then seldom out of sight and if during he childhood he be constantly and rigorously keep from sit on the ground or drink any cold liquor while he be hot the custom of forbearing grow into _ habit _ will help much to preserve he when he be no longer under he maid 's or tutor 's eye more fever and surfeit be get by people 's drinking when they be hot than by any one thing i know if he -lrb- the child -rrb- be very hot he should by no means _ drink _ at least a good piece of bread first to be eat will gain time to warm he drink _ blood hot _ which then he may drink safely if he be very dry it will go down so warm and quench he thirst better and if he will not drink it so warm abstain will not hurt he besides this will teach he to forbear which be a habit of the greatest use for health of mind and body too the last remark be full of wisdom mother may depend upon it that every indulgence to which they accustom they child pave the way for _ habitual _ indulgence and have a tendency to lead indirectly to indulgence in other matter and on the contrary every self-denial which they can lead child to exercise voluntarily -- even in these every-day matter of food drink exercise & c be so much gain in the great work of self-denial and the resist of temptation in matter of higher importance but i must not moralize too long have dwell on this same point under the head confectionary i proceed therefore to make a few more extract from mr locke : not be permit to _ drink _ without eat will prevent the custom of have the cup often at he nose a dangerous beginning man often bring habitual hunger and thirst on themselves by custom you may if you please bring any one to be thirsty every hour i once live in a house where to appease a froward child they give he _ drink _ as often as he cry so that he be constantly bib and though he could not speak yet he drink more in twenty-four hour than i do it be convenient for health and sobriety to drink no more than natural thirst require and he that eat not salt meat nor drink strong drink will seldom thirst between meal great mischief be often do to they health by child at school and one instance of this be in get violently heat with exercise and then pour down large quantity of cold water to cool themselves i once make it a habitual rule for pupil that they must drink water if they drink it at all on leave they seat to go to they play but not afterwards : and i be so situate that i could prevent the law from be break as there be no spring or well to which they could have access privately and though they think the rule rather severe i have no doubt it save they from much injury and perhaps sometimes from sickness chapter ix give medicine prevention better than cure nine in ten infantile disease cause by error in diet and drink sign of fail health cause of a bad breath flesh eater gormandizer general rule for prevent disease when to call a physician so much error prevail in regard to the medical management of the young that a volume might be write without exhaust the subject -lrb- footnote : such a volume be in preparation it be intend as a companion to the present -rrb- my present limit and plan allow of only a few remark and those must be general that a ounce of prevention be worth a pound of cure have so long ago become a proverb that it seem almost idle to repeat the sentiment and yet it be to be fear that very few receive it as a practical truth in the management of child now nothing be more certain than that it be easier as well as more humane to prevent disease than to cure they i have elsewhere mention the opinion of a very eminent physician that nine in ten of child 's disease may be imputed to error with regard to the quantity or the quality of they food for myself i be by no means certain that nine out of ten be the exact proportion though i think the number be at all event very large few child or even grow person be seize with disease suddenly they progress towards it be always gradual and sometimes imperceptible to a physician of any tolerable degree of skill however there be no difficulty in observe and point out the first step towards illness in those whose habit of life be well know to he and of foretell the consequence but since parent and nurse be not so well qualify as physician to make these observation i will endeavor to point out a few certain sign and symptom by which they may know a child 's health to be decline even before be appear to be sick -- for if these be neglect the evil increase go on from bad to worse and more violent and apparent complaint will follow and perhaps end in incurable disease which a timely remedy or a slight change in the diet and manner of life would have infallibly prevent the first tendency to disease say dr cadogan may be observe in a child 's breath it be not enough that the breath be not offensive it should be sweet and fragrant like a nosegay of fresh flower or a pail of new milk from a young cow that feed upon the sweetest grass of the spring and this as well at first waking in the morning as all day long -lrb- footnote : buchan 's advice to mother page 337 388 -rrb- there be much of truth in these remark but if they be wholly true then very few child be perfectly healthy for no child that eat much animal food of any sort or what amount to nearly the same thing much butter or gravy will long retain the fragrant breath here allude to who have not observe the difference in this respect between animal in general which feed on flesh and those which feed on grass and whether it be the character of they respective food that make the difference or not it be also true that there be nearly as much difference of breath between _ man _ who use animal food and those who do not as between other animal the breath of some of we enormous meat eater would almost remind one of a slaughter house nor be it the quality of food alone that will induce a foul breath either in adult or infant he who swallow such enormous quantity even of plain food as by overload and fatigue the stomach tend gradually to debilitate it will produce the same effect the enormous feeder of this full feeding country whether they be young or old whether they inhabit the mountain or the vale and whether they feed on animal food or not have generally a bad breath and if they seldom offend it be because few feed otherwise and it be not too much -- in my own opinion -- to say of this whole class of gormandizer no less than of the flesh eater that they have lay for themselves the foundation of future disease one general rule may here be distinctly lay down as a child 's breath become hot and feverish or strong or acid we may be certain that digestion and surfeit have foul and disturb the blood and now be the time to apply a proper remedy and prevent a train of impend evil let the child be restrain in its food let it eat less live upon milk or thin broth for a day or two and be carry -lrb- or walk if it be able -rrb- a little more than usual in the open air -lrb- footnote : advice to mother page 338 -rrb- this rule be the more important because if duly persevere in it will generally prevent disease and save the trouble and evil consequence of take medicine at all meanwhile it will be advisable to call in a physician -- not to give drug but to prevent the necessity of give they there be a foolish fear abroad that physician if call before a person be violently sick will dose he with they drug as a matter of course till they _ make _ he sick but this no judicious physician will ever do it may _ have be _ do though i believe it have be seldom the more general course be to defer call for medical advice till it be too late to use preventive means and medicine be then resort to by the physician as a sort of necessary evil a judicious physician seasonably call in would in many instance save a severe fit of sickness besides a great deal of expense both of time and money but if the first symptom of approach disease be overlook -- if the child be feed or rather cram with solid food as much as ever -- and if no medical advice be seek he sleep will soon become disturbed he will be talk start and tumble about and will have frightful dream or he will at other time be find smile and laugh to these in the end may be add loss of appetite paleness emaciation weakness cough and consumption or colic worm and convulsion i do not undertake to say that the most judicious parental management aid by the greatest medical skill will always prevent disease far from it the child may and undoubtedly sometimes do inherit a tendency to a particular disease or he may be make sick by error in regard to dress exercise & c but so long as nine tenth of the disease and early mortality of the young might be prevent by due attention to all these means combine so long will it be necessary to reiterate the sentiment of the present section chapter x exercise sec 1 objection to the use of cradle -- sec 2 carry in the arm -- its use and abuse -- sec 3 creep -- why useful -- to be encourage -- sec 4 walking -- general direction about it -- sec 5 ride abroad in carriage -- sec 6 ride on horseback -- objection ride school this subject may be consider under the follow head : rock in the cradle carry in the arm creep walk ride in a carriage and ride on horseback these i shall consider in they order sec 1 _ rock in the cradle _ there be two opinion in regard to the use of the cradle in the nursery some condemn it altogether other think its occasional use highly proper those who condemn it do it chiefly on the ground that it produce a whirling motion of the brain which while it incline to giddiness and lull to sleep disturb in some degree the process of digestion it seem to I that there be weight to this objection and although the cradle have be extensively use without produce any obviously evil effect i should greatly prefer to have it universally lay aside as far as mere amusement be demand it be quite unnecessary since there be so many amusement which be far better as a means of induce sleep i be still more strongly oppose to it for if a child be rationally treat in every other respect it will never need artificial means to induce it to sleep nature will then be the most appropriate directress in this matter if there be a cradle in a nursery it be almost always full of clothes load with air more or less impure and the child be bury in it more than be compatible with health even in the judgment of the mother or the nurse for so convenient be its use and so great the temptation to keep the child in it that he will often be find soak there a large proportion of he time every one know that the air have not so free access to a child in the cradle as elsewhere especially if it have a kind of cover or hood to it as we often see besides the cradle be a piece of furniture which take up a great deal of space in the nursery and every one who have make the trial effectually will it seem to I greatly prefer its room to its company if any cradle be to be use those be best which be suspend by cord and be swing rather than rock and this swinging should be in a line with the body of the child as much as possible as this motion be less likely to produce injury than its opposite sec 2 _ carry in the arm _ this be the most appropriate exercise for the first two month of existence and indeed one of the best for some time afterward although a healthy thrive child ought to sleep for some time after birth from two third to three fourth of he time yet it should never be forget that the demand for proper exercise during the rest of the time be not the less imperious on this account but probably the more so i have already mention the importance of bathing which be one form of exercise and of gentle motion in the arm immediately afterward the same gentle motion should be often repeat during the day care be take to hold the child in such a position as will be easy to he and favorable to the free exercise of all he limb and muscle there be many mother and nurse who not only rejoice that the infant incline to sleep a great deal since it give they more liberty but who take pain to prolong these hour beyond what nature require by artificial means i refer not only to the use of the cradle but to means still more artificial -- the use of cordial and opiate to which i have already advert but whatever the means use may be they defeat the purpose of nature and be in the highest degree reprehensible nothing but the most chilling poverty should prevent the mother from have the child -- for a few week of its first existence at least -- in she own arm nearly all the time which be not absolutely demand for repose she should even invite it to wakefulness rather than encourage sleep attention to exercise ought to be commence before the child be more than ten day old for this purpose he should be place on he back on a pillow in order that the body may rest at as many point as possible in this position he have the opportunity to move he limb with the most perfect freedom and to exercise he numerous muscle there be nothing more important to the infant -- not even sleep itself -- than the action of all he muscle and nothing contribute more to he rapid growth at first the body should be keep while on the arm in nearly a horizontal position with the head perhaps a very little elevated but after a few week it will be proper to change the position for a small part of the time place the body so that it may form a angle of a few degree with the horizon when this be do however it should always be by place the hand against the shoulder and head in such a manner as to support well the back for it be extremely injurious to suffer the feeble spine to sustain at this early period any considerable weight still more erroneous be the practice of some careless nurse of carry the child quite upright a part of the time almost without any support at all there can be no doubt that the spinal column of many a child be injure for life in this way there can be no apology for such thing but it be not sufficient to denounce merely the custom of hold the infant 's body in a erect position every inquire mother -- and it be for such and no other that i write -- will naturally and properly ask the reason why the child be not bear with all its bone solid some be mere cartilage for a considerable time this be the case with the bone of the back now every person must see that the weight of the child 's head and shoulder rest for a considerable time on the slender cartilaginous spinal column may easily bend it and a curvature thus give may and often do deform child for life dr dewee mention a nurse who from a foolish fondness for display they make the child consign to she charge sit perfectly upright before they be a month old it be truly ludicrous he say to see the little creature sit as straight as if they be stiffen by a back board it be truly _ horrible _ i should say rather than ludicrous crooked spine must be the inevitable consequence if nothing worse the practice of brace child as it be call by strap back board corset & c where it have produce any effect at all have always have a tendency to crook the spine this may be see first by observe one shoulder to be lower than the other and next by a projection of the part of the shoulder blade next to the spine whenever these change begin to appear it be time to send for a physician though it may often be too late to effect a cure but on the general subject of brace and corset i have treat at sufficient length elsewhere there be another error commit in carry child in the arm the head of the infant be often permit either to hang constantly on one side or to roll about loosely as if it hardly belong to the body in the former case there be danger of produce a habit of hold the head upon one side which it will be very difficult to overcome in the latter the spinal marrow itself may be injure -- which would produce alarming and perhaps fatal consequence but all these evil as have already be say may be prevent if the hand be place so as to support the head and shoulder let not the mother however who read this work trust the matter wholly to a nurse she must see to it herself else she incur a most fearful responsibility the suggestion i have make be the more important in the case of child either very fleshy or very feeble and of those dispose to rickets or scrofula but they be important to all i have say that the motion of the child on the arm should be gentle many be in the habit of toss infant about there can be no objection to a slight and slow movement up and down for a minute or so at a time indeed it be rather to be recommend as likely to give strength and vigor no less than pleasure to the child but when such movement be carry to excess so as to frighten the child they be highly reprehensible the shock thus produce to the nervous system have sometimes be so great as to produce sudden death nor be it safe to run jump or descend stair hastily or violently with a child in we arm and for similar reason infant should not be carry always on the same arm for there be danger of contract a habit of lean to one side and thus of become crooked on this account the arm on which they rest should be often change nor should they be grasp too firmly a skilful mother will hold a child quite loosely with the most perfect safety while a inexperienced one will grasp he so hard as to expose the soft bone to be bent out of they place and yet be quite as liable to let he fall as she who handle he with more ease and freedom sec 3 _ creep _ mankind must creep before they can walk be a old adage often use to remind we of that patient application which be so indispensable to secure any highly important or valuable end but it be as true literally as it be figuratively the act of creep exercise in a remarkable degree nearly all the muscle of the body and this too without much fatigue some mother there indeed be who think it a happy circumstance if a child can be teach to walk without this intermediate step but such mother must have strange idea of the animal economy they must never have think of the pleasure which creep afford the mind or of the vigor it impart to the body child be wonderfully please with they own voluntary effort what they can do themselves yield they ten-fold greater pleasure than if do by the mother or the nurse yet the latter be exceedingly prone to forget or overlook all this -- and to say at least practically that the only proper effort be those to which themselves give direction they be moreover exceedingly fond of display some mother seem to act -- in all they do with and for child -- as if all the latter be good for be display and amusement they feed they indeed and strive to prolong they existence but it appear to be for similar reason to those which would lead they to take kind care of a pet lamb it be on this account that they dress they out in the manner they do strive to make they sit up straight and prohibit they creep it be on this account too as much perhaps as any other that go-cart and lead string be put in such early requisition the contrary would be far the safer extreme and the parent who keep he child scramble about upon the back as long as possible and when he can not prevent longer a inversion of this position retain he at creep as long as be in he power be as much wiser in comparison with he who urge he forward to make a prodigy of he as he be who instead of make he child a prodigy in mind or moral at premature age hold he back and endeavor to have he mental and moral nature develop no faster than he physical frame i wish young mother would settle it in they mind at once that the longer they child creep the better they need have no fear that the force of habit will retain they on they knee after nature have give they strength to rise and walk for they incessant activity and incontrollable restlessness will be sure to rouse they as early as it ought least of all ought the difficulty of keep they clean to move they from the path of duty child who be allow to crawl will soon be anxious to do more we shall presently see they take hold of a chair or a table and endeavor to raise themselves up by it if they fail in a dozen attempt they do not give up the point but persevere till they effort be crown with success have succeed in raise themselves from the floor they soon learn to stand by hold to the object by which they have raise themselves soon they acquire the art of standing without hold -lrb- footnote : the art of standing which consist in balance one 's self by means of the muscle of the body and lower limb -- simple as it may seem to those who have never reflect on the subject -- be really a important acquisition for a child of twelve or fifteen month no wonder they feel a conscious pride when they find themselves able to stand erect like the world around they -rrb- ere long they venture to put forward one foot -- they then repeat the effort and walk a little holding at the same time by a chair and lastly they acquire with joy to they inexpressible and to we inconceivable the art of trudge alone when child learn to walk in nature 's own way it be seldom indeed that we find they with curved leg or crooked or club foot these deformity be almost universally owe either to the mother or the nurse let I be distinctly understand as utterly oppose not only to go-cart lead string and every other _ mechanical _ contrivance to induce child to walk before they leg be fit for it but to effort of every kind whose main object be the same teach they to walk by take hold of one of they hand be in some respects quite as bad as any other mode for if the child should fall while we have hold of he hand there be some danger of dislocate or otherwise injure the limb fall we must expect but if a child be leave to he own voluntary effort as much as possible these fall will be fewer and probably less serious than under any other circumstance sec 4 _ walk _ the way to learn how to write without rule line be _ to rule _ be the frequent saying of a old schoolmaster whom i once know and i may say with as much confidence and with more truth that the way for a child to learn to walk alone be to hold by thing i have anticipate in previous page much of what might have otherwise be contain in this section a few additional remark be all that will be necessary at first the nursery will be quite large enough for we young pedestrian much time should elapse before he be permit to go abroad upon the green grass -- not lest the air should reach he or the sun shine upon he face and hand but because the surface of the ground be so much less firm and regular than the floor that he ought to be quite familiar with walk on the latter in the first place but when he can walk well in the play ground garden field and road it be highly desirable that he should go out more or less every day when the weather will possibly admit nor would i be so fearful as many be of a drop of rain or dew or a breath of wind for say what they will in favor of ride sailing and other mode of exercise there be none equal to walk as soon as a child be able -- none so natural -- none in ordinary case so salutary i know it be unpopular and therefore we young master or young miss must be hoist into a carriage or upon the back of a horse to the manifest danger of health or limb or both who of we ever know a herdsman or a shepherd who find it for the health and well-being of the young calf or lamb to hoist it into a carriage and carry it through the street instead of suffer it to walk such a thing would excite astonishment and the man who should do it would be deem insane the health and growth of we young domestic animal be best promote by suffer they to walk run and skip in they own way they ask no artificial leg or horse or carriage but would it not be difficult to find argument in favor of carry child about when they be able to walk which would not be equally strong in favor of carry about lamb and calf and pig this be the more remarkable from the consideration elsewhere urge that in general we take more rational pain about the physical well-being of domestic animal than of child however it will be see on a little reflection that the number of those who carry child about be after all very inconsiderable the greater portion of the community regard it as too troublesome or costly and if poverty bring with it no other evil than a permit to child to walk on the leg which the creator give they it could hardly be deem a misfortune it be scarcely necessary to add that there will be nothing gain to the young -- or to person of any age -- from walk which be very long and fatiguing walking should refresh and invigorate : when it be carry beyond this especially with the young child we have pass the line of safety sec 5 _ ride in carriage _ it will be see by the foregoing section that i be not very friendly to the use of carriage for the young after they can walk before this period however i think they may be often serviceable and there be occasional instance which may render they useful afterward on this account i have think it might be well to give the follow general direction carriage for child should be so construct as not to be liable to overset to this end the wheel must be low and the axle unusually extend the body should be long enough to allow the child to lie down when necessary and so deep that he may not be likely to fall out everything should be make secure and firm to avoid if possible the danger of accident the carriage should be draw steadily and slowly not violently or with a jerking motion such a place should be select as will secure the child -- if necessary -- from the full blaze of a hot sun this point might indeed be secure by have the carriage cover but i be oppose to cover carriage for child or adult unless we be compel to ride in the rain while the child be unable to sit up without injury and even for some month afterwards he ought by all means to lie down in a carriage because it require more strength to sit in a seat which be move than in a place where he be stationary in assume the horizontal position in a carriage a pillow be need and such other arrangement as will prevent too much rolling after the child 's strength will fairly permit he may sit up in the carriage but he ought still to be secure against too much motion as he strength increase however the latter direction will be less and less necessary i need not repeat in this place -lrb- have i not witness so many accident from neglect -rrb- the caution recently give that great care should be take to prevent the child from fall out of the carriage while child be ride abroad in cold weather much pain should be take to see that they be suitably clothe it be well to keep they in motion while they be in the carriage and especially to guard against they fall asleep in the open air until they have become very much accustomed to be out in it it have be say by some writer that a ride ought never to exceed the length of half a hour but no positive rule can be give except to avoid over-fatigue sec 6 _ ride on horseback _ while child be very young i think it both improper and unsafe to take they abroad on horseback i mean so long as they be in health in case of disease this mode of exercise be sometimes one of the most salutary in the world but after boy be six or seven year old and girl ten if they be ever to practice horsemanship it be time for they to begin both because they be less apt to be unreasonably timid at this age and because they learn much more rapidly so few parent be good horseman that if there be a ride school at hand i should prefer place a child in it at once but i wish to be distinctly understand that i do not consider it a matter of importance especially to female that they should ever learn to ride at all some of the principal objection to ride on horseback by boy as a ordinary exercise be the following : 1 walking as i have already intimate be one of the most healthy mode of exercise in the world it be nature 's exercise and be unquestionably in exclusive use long before universal dominion be give to man if not for many century afterward and i believe it would be very difficult to prove that it interfere at all with human longevity for the first of we race live almost a thousand year 2 young child in ride on horseback be rather apt to acquire rapidly the habit of domineering over animal it seem almost needless to say how easy the transition be in such case should opportunity offer from tyranny over the brute slave to tyranny over the human be there be slave-holder in the family and in the school as well as elsewhere it be the spirit of a person which make he either a tyrant or slave-holder and let we beware how we foster this spirit in the child whom god have give we chapter xi amusement universal need of amusement why so necessary error of school error of family infant school as often conduct particularly injurious lesson or task should be short mistake of some manual labor school of particular amusement in the nursery with small wooden cube -- picture -- shuttlecock -- the rock horse -- top and marble -- backgammon -- checkers -- morrice -- dice -- nine-pin -- skip the rope -- trundle the hoop -- play at ball -- kite -- skating and swimming -- dissect map -- black board -- element of letter -- dissect picture however heterodox the concession may be i be one of those who believe amusement of some sort or other to be universally necessary indeed i can not possibly conceive of a individual in health whatever may be the age sex condition or employment who do not need they in a greater or less degree now if by the term amusement i merely mean employment nobody would probably differ from I -- at least in theory every one be ready to admit the importance of be constantly employ a mind unemployed be a vacant mind and a vacant or idle mind be the devil 's work-shop so say the proverb by amusement however i mean something more than mere employment for the more constantly a adult individual be employ the greater generally be he demand for amusement indolent person have less need of be amuse than other but perhaps there be few if any person to be find who be so indolent as not to think continually on one subject or another and it be this constant think more than anything else that create the necessity of which i be speak the mere drudge whether biped or quadrup -- he i mean whose think power be scarcely alive -- have little need of the relief which be afford by amusement the young of all animal -- man among the rest -- appear to have such a instinctive fondness for amusement that so long as they be unrestrained they seldom need any urge on this point in regard to _ quality _ the case be somewhat different in this respect most child require attention and restraint and some of they a great deal of it but what be the nature of the amusement which adult -- nay mankind generally -- require i answer it be relief from the employment of think for it be not that mankind do not really think at all that moralist complain so loudly when they tell we that man will not think they mean that they will not think as rational being they think indeed and so do the ox and the horse and the dog and the elephant -- but not as rational man ought to do and this it be that constitute the burden of complaint but you will probably find few person belong to the human species who do not think constantly at least while awake and whose mental power do not become fatigued and demand relief in amusement child 's mind be so soon wearied by a continuous train of think even on topic which be please to they that they can seldom he bring to give they attention to a single subject long at once they require almost incessant change both for the sake of relief and to amuse for the _ sake _ of amusement and it be to my own mind one of the most striking proof of infinite wisdom in the creation of the human mind that it have during infancy such a irresistible tendency to amusement how greatly do they err who grudge child especially very young child the time which in obedience to the dictate of they nature they be so fond of spending in sport and gambol how much more rational would it be to encourage and direct they in they amusement and how exceedingly unwise be the practice whenever and wherever it exist of confine they to school room and bench not only for hour but for whole half day at once if individual and circumstance be everywhere combine with the special purpose to oppose the intention of nature respect the human be at every step of he progress from the cradle to maturity and from maturity to the grave i hardly know how they could contrive to accomplish such a purpose more effectually than it be at present accomplished but it be proper that i should here explain a little all we family arrangement tend to repress amusement everything be contrived to facilitate business -- especially the business or employment of adult the child be hardly regard as a human being -- certainly not as a _ perfect _ be he be consider as a mere fragment or to change the figure as a plant too young to be of any real service to mankind because too young to bear any of its appropriate fruit whereas in my opinion both infancy and childhood at every stage should bring forth they appropriate fruit in other word the child of the most tender year should be regard as a whole and not as the mere fragment of a be as a perfect member of a family -- occupy a full and complete only a more limited sphere than older member : and all the rule and regulation and arrangement of the family should have a reference to this point so long as a child be reckon to be a mere cipher in creation or at most as of no more practical importance till the arrival of he twenty-first birth day or some other equally arbitrary period than we domestic animal -- that be of just sufficient consequence to be feed and caress and fondle and make a pet of -- so long will we arrangement be make with reference to the comfort and happiness of adult there may indeed be here and there a child 's chair or a child 's carriage or newspaper or book but there will seldom be except by stealth any free juvenile conversation at the table or the fireside here the child must sit as a blank or cypher to ruminate on the past or to receive half form and passive impression from the present the arrangement of the infant school also seem design for the same purpose -- to repress as much as possible the infantile desire for amusement not that this be they original nor that it now be they legitimate intention they legitimate object be or should be not to develope the intellect by over-work the tender brain but to promote cheerfulness and health and love and happiness by well contrived amusement conduct as much as possible in the open air and by unremitting effort to elicit and direct the affection infant school should repress rather than encourage the hard study of book lesson at this age should be draw chiefly from object in the garden the field and the grove from the flower the plant the tree the brook the bird the beast the worm the fly the human body -- the sun or the visible heaven these lesson whether give by the parent as constitute a part of the family arrangement or by the infant or primary school teacher should it be true be regard for the time be as study but they should never be long and they should be frequently relieve by the most free and unrestrained pastime and gambol of the young on the green grass or beside the ripple stream uninfluenced or at least unrepressed by those who be set over they the public or common school overlook as it do any direct attempt to make provision for the amusement of the pupil even during the scanty recess that be afford they once in three hour would appear to a stranger on this planet at first sight to be design as much as possible to defeat every intention of nature with reference to the growth of the human frame for we may often travel many hundred mile and not see so much as a enclose play ground and never perhaps any direct provision for particular and more favorable amusement i might speak of other school and place of resort for child and proceed to show how all we arrangement appear to be the offspring of a species of utilitarianism which reject every sport whose value can not be estimate in dollar and cent i might even refer to those school of we country where these ultra utilitarian notion be carry to a extent which exclude amusing conversation or reading even during meal-time and devote the hour which be formerly spend in recreation to manual labor of some productive kind or other -- but i forbear enough have be say to illustrate the position i have take that there be in vogue a system which bear the mark of have be contrived if not by the enemy of we race either openly or covertly at least by those whom ignorance render scarcely less at war with the general happiness now i would not deny nor attempt to deny that change of occupation of body or mind be of itself a amusement and one too of great value undoubtedly it be so to some child study of every kind be a amusement and there be few indeed to whom none be so labor with many when alternate with study be amusing and yet after all unless such labor be perform in company where light and cheerful conversation be sure to keep the mind away from the subject about which it have just be engage i be afraid that the purpose for which amusement be design be very far from be _ all _ secure but perhaps i be dwelling too long on the general principle that people of every age and child in particular need and must have amusement whether they be of a productive kind or not and that it be very far from be sufficient be it either practicable or desirable to turn all study and labor into amusement -lrb- footnote : i will even say more distinctly than i have already do that however popular the contrary opinion may be neither study nor work ought to be regard as mere amusement i would it be true take every possible pain to render both work and study agreeable but i would at the same time have it distinctly understand that one of they be by no mean the other that on the contrary work be _ work _ -- study _ study _ -- and amusement _ amusement _ -rrb- my business be with those who direct the first dawning of affection and intellect principle be by no means of less importance on this account but the limit of a work for young mother do not admit of anything more than a brief discussion of they importance i will now proceed to speak of some of the more common amusement of the nursery i have see very young child sit on the floor and amuse themselves for nearly half a hour together with pile up and take down small wooden cube of different size some of they instead of be cube however may be of the shape of brick they ingenuity while they be scarcely a year or two old in erect house temple church & c be sometimes surprising girl as well as boy seem to be greatly amuse with this form of exercise and both seem to be little less gratify in destroy than in rear they lilliputian edifice next to the latter kind of amusement be the viewing of picture it be surprising at what a early age child may be teach to notice miniature representation of object live object especially representation of the work of art should come in a little later than those of thing in nature i know a father who prepare volume of picture solely for this purpose though he usually regard they not only as a source of amusement to child but as a medium of instruction battledoor or shuttlecock may be teach to child of both sex very early and it afford a healthy and almost untiring source of amusement it give activity as well as strength to the muscle or move power and have many other important advantage there be some danger accord to dr pierson -lrb- footnote : see he lecture before the american institute of instruction -rrb- of distort the spine by play at shuttlecock too frequently and too long but this will seldom be the case with little child in the nursery neither shuttlecock nor any other amusement will secure they attention long enough to injure they very much perhaps this exercise come nearer to my idea of a perfect amusement than almost any which could be name the mind be agreeably occupy without be fatigue and if the amusement be proportion to the age and strength of the child there be very little fatigue of the body it give moreover great practical accuracy to the eye and to the hand a rocking-horse be much recommend for the nursery i have have no opportunity for observe the effect of this kind of amusement but if it be one half as valuable as some suppose i should be incline to recommend it but i be oppose to foster in the rider lesson of cruelty by arm he with whip and spur if the young be ever to learn to ride on a living horse the exercise of the rocking-horse will most certainly be a sort of preparation for the purpose top and marble afford a great deal of rational amusement to the young and of a very useful kind too spin a top be second to no exercise which i have yet mention unless it be play at shuttlecock dr dewee recommend a small backgammon table with man but without dice he say also that child as soon as they be capable of comprehend the subject should be teach draught or checkers this game be not only highly amusing but also very instructive in another place he heap additional encomium upon the game of checkers it become a source of endless amusement he say as it never tire but always instruct of exercise which instruct however as well as amuse i shall speak presently the amusement call morrice fox and goose & c with which some of the child of almost every neighborhood be more or less acquaint be of the same general character and tendency as checkers so be a play sometimes but very improperly call dice in which two party play with a small bundle of wooden pin not unlike knit pin in shape but shorter the writer to whom i have refer above recommend nine-pin and ball of proper size as highly useful both for diversion and exercise if they can be use without lead to bad habit and bad association i think they may be useful for girl who demand a great deal more of exercise both within door and without skip the rope be a excellent amusement so also be swing both of these exercise may be use either out of door or in the nursery trundle a hoop i have always regard as a amusing out-of-door exercise and i be not sorry when i sometimes see girl as well as boy engage in it under the eye of they mother and teacher play ball of which there be many different game and fly kite employ a large proportion if not all of the muscle of the body in such a manner as be likely to confirm the strength and greatly improve the health the same may be say of skating in the winter and swimming in the summer but these last be exercise over which the mother can not ordinarily have very much control under the head of amusement it only remain for I to speak of a few juvenile employment of a mixed nature of these i shall treat very briefly as they be a branch of the subject which do not necessarily come within the compass of my present plan they be exercise too which should more properly come under the head of infantile instruction dissect map afford child of every age a great fund of amusement but much caution be necessary with those that be very young not to discourage or confound they by show they too many at once thus if we cut in piece the map of one of the smaller united state at the county line or the whole united state at the state line it be quite as many division as they can manage cut up as large a state even as pennsylvanium or new york be into county and try to lead they to amuse themselves by put together so large a number many of which must inevitably very closely resemble each other and it be ten to one but you bewilder and even perplex and discourage they the same result would follow from cut up even the whole of a large county or a small state into town i have usually begin with little child by require they to put together the eight county of the small state of connecticut in this case the county be not only few but there be a very striking difference in they shape a black board and a piece of chalk along with a little ingenuity on the part of the mother will furnish the child with a almost endless variety of amusement let he attempt to imitate almost any object which interest he whether among the work of nature or art however rude he picture may be do not laugh at but on the contrary endeavor to encourage he he may also be permit to imitate letter and figure the element of letter too both print and write may be give he and he may be require to put they together dissect picture as well as dissect map and letter be useful and to most child very acceptable in short the device of a ingenious thinking mother for the amusement of she very young child be almost endless and the great danger be that when a mother once enter deeply into the spirit of these exercise she will substitute they for those much more healthy one which have be already mention such as require muscular activity or may be perform in the open air chapter xii cry its importance danger of repress a tendency to cry anecdote from dr rush physiology of cry folly of attempt wholly to suppress it cry say dr dewee should be look upon as a exercise of much importance and he be sustain in this view by many eminent medical writer but people generally think otherwise nothing be more common than the idea that to cry be unbecoming and child be everywhere teach when they suffer pain to brave it out and _ not cry _ such a direction -- to say nothing of its tendency to encourage hypocrisy -- be wholly unphilosophical the follow anecdote may serve in part to illustrate my mean it be say to have be relate by dr rush a gentleman in south carolina be about to undergo a very painful surgical operation he have imbibe the idea that it be beneath the dignity of a man ever to say or do anything expressive of pain he therefore refuse to submit to the usual precaution of secure the hand and foot by bandage declare to he surgeon that he have nothing to fear from he be untied for he would not move a muscle of he body he keep he word it be true but he die instantly after the operation from apoplexy there be very little doubt in the mind of any physiologist in regard to the cause of apoplexy in this case and that it might have be prevent by the relief which be always afford by groan and tear it be i believe very generally know that in the profoundest grief people do not and can not shed tear and that when the _ latter _ begin to flow it afford immediate relief i do not undertake to argue from this that cry be so important either to the young or the old that it be ever worth while to excite or continue it by artificial means or that a habit of cry so easily and readily acquire by the young be not to be guard against as a serious evil my object be first to show the folly of those who denounce all cry and secondly to point out some of its advantage -- in the hope of prevent parent from go to that extreme which border upon stoicism one of the most intelligent man i ever know frequently make it he boast that he neither laugh nor cry on any occasion and on be tell that both laughing and cry be physiologically useful he only ridicule the sentiment cry be useful to very young infant because it favor the passage of blood in they lung where it have not before be accustom to travel and where its motion be now indispensable and it not only promote the circulation of the blood but expand the air-cell of the lung and thus help forward that great change by which the dark-colored impure blood of the vein be change at once into pure blood and thus render fit to nourish the system and sustain life but this be not all cry strengthen the lung themselves it do this by expand the little air-cell of which i have just speak and not only accustom they to be stretch at a period of all other the most favorable for this purpose but free they at the same time from mucus and other injurious accumulation they therefore who oppose a infant 's cry know not what they do so far be it from be hurtful to the child that its occasional recurrence be as we have already see positively useful some practitioner of medicine in some of the more try situation in which human nature can be place even encourage they patient to suffer tear to flow as a means of relief infant it should also be recollect have no other language by which to express they want and feeling than sigh and tear cry be not always a expression of positive pain it sometimes indicate hunger and thirst and sometimes the want of a change of posture this last consideration deserve great attention and all the inconvenience of cry ought to be bear cheerfully for the sake of have the little sufferer remind we when nature demand a change of position no child ought to be permit to remain in one position longer than two hour even while sleep nor half that time while awake and if nurse and mother will overlook this matter as they often do it be a favorable circumstance that the child should remind they of it cry have be call the waste gate of the human system the door of escape to that excess of excitability which sometimes prevail especially among child and nervous adult to all such person it be healthy -- most undoubtedly so nor do i know that its occasional recurrence be injurious to any adult -- a fastidious public sentiment to the contrary notwithstanding some have suppose that what be here say will be construe by the young mother into a license to suffer she child to cry unnecessarily perhaps say they she be a labor woman and wish to be at work well she lay down she child in the cradle or on the bed and go to she work presently the child become wet perhaps begin to cry as well he might but instead of go to he and take care of he she continue at she employment and when one remonstrate against she conduct as cruelty she plead the authority of the author of the young mother all this may happen but if it should i be not answerable for it i have insist strongly on guard the child against wet clothing and on watch he with the utmost care to prevent all real suffering mother like the specimen here give if they happen to have a little sensibility to suffer and not much love of they offspring generally know of a shorter way to quiet they infant and procure time to work than that which be here mention they have nothing to do but to give they some cordial or elixir whose basis be opium startle not reader at the statement -- this abominable practice be follow by many a female who claim the sacred name of mother and many a wretch have thus in she ignorance indolence or avarice slowly destroy she child i repeat therefore that i do not think my remark on cry be necessarily liable to abuse though i be not sure that there be not a few individual to be find who may apply they in the manner above mention -- a application however which be as far remove from the original intention of the author as can possibly be conceive chapter xiii laugh laugh and be fat laughing be healthy a common error monastic notion yet too prevalent on this subject laughing like cry have a good effect on the infantile lung nor be it less salutary in other respects laugh and be fat a old adage have its meaning and also its philosophy there be a excess however to which laugh no less than cry may be carry and which we can not too carefully avoid but how little to be envy -- how much to be pity -- be they who consider it a weakness and a sin to laugh and in the plenitude of they wisdom tell we that _ the savior of mankind never laugh _ when i hear this last assertion i be always ready to ask whether the individual who make it have read a new revelation or a new gospel for certainly none of the sacred book which i have see give we any such information but i will not dwell here the common notion on this subject if not ridiculous be certainly strange i will only add that come into vogue as it might have do there be no opinion more unfounded than the very general one among adult that child should be uniformly grave and that just in proportion as they laugh and appear frolicsome just in the same proportion be they out of the way and deserving of reprehension it be strange that it should be so but i have see many parent who be miserable because they child be sportive and joyful oh when will the day of monkish sadness and austerity be over and the public sentiment in the christian world get right on this subject chapter xiv sleep general remark hint to father -- sec 1 proper hour for repose dark room noise -- sec 2 place for sleep sleep alone -- reason -- sec 3 purity of the air in sleep room -- sec 4 the bed objection to feather other material -- sec 5 the covering of bed cover the head -- sec 6 night dress robe -- sec 7 posture of the body in sleep -- sec 8 state of the mind -- sec 9 quality of sleep -- sec 10 quantity of sleep not a few person consider all rule relative to sleep as utterly futile they regard it as so much of a natural or animal process that if we be let alone we shall seldom err at any age respect it rule on the subject above all they regard as wholly misplace those who entertain such view would do well in order to be consistent to go a little farther and as breathing and eating and drinking -- nay even _ think _ -- be natural process deny the utility of all rule respect _ they _ also perhaps they would do well moreover to deny that rule of any sort be valuable but would not this have the effect to bar the door perpetually against all human improvement would it not be equivalent to say to a half-civilized because only half-christianized community -- go on with you barbarous custom and you uncleanly and unthinking habit forever but i have not so learn human nature i regard man as susceptible of endless progression and i know of no way in which more rapid progress can be make than by enlighten young mother on subject which pertain to we physical nature and the means of physical improvement not for the _ sake _ of that perishable part of man the frame but because it be nearly in vain to attempt to improve the mind and heart without due attention to the frame-work to which mind and heart for the present be append and most intimately related let it be leave to father to study the improvement of hound and horse and cattle and at the same time to think themselves above the concern of the nursery we may indeed read of a cato once in three thousand year who be in the habit of quit all other business in order to be present when the nurse wash and rub he child but we passion for gain in the present age be so much more absorb and soul-destroying than the passion for military glory that we can not expect many cato oh no all or nearly all must devolve on the mother the father have no time to attend to he child what belong to the mother if she can be duly awaken may be at least _ half _ do what belong to the father must i fear be leave undo i be accustom to regard every day -- even of the infant -- as a miniature life i be moreover accustom to consider mental and bodily vigor not only for each separate day but for life 's whole day as greatly influence by the circumstance of sleep the hour place purity of the air the bed the cover dress posture state of the mind quality quantity and duration sec 1 _ hour for repose _ generally speak the night be the appropriate season for repose but in early infancy it be _ every _ hour i have already speak of the vast amount of sleep which the new-born infant require as well as of many other circumstance connect with it require we attention suffer I however to enlarge at the risk of a little repetition what time the infant be awake should be during the day it be of very great importance in the formation of good habit that he should be undressed and put to bed at evening with as much regularity as if be have not sleep during the day for a single moment it be also important that he be permit to sleep during the whole night as uninterruptedly as possible and that when he be arouse to have he position or diaper change or to receive food it should be do with little parade and noise and with as little light as possible all person old as well as young sleep more quietly in a dark room than in one where a light be burn i be well aware that the course here recommend may be carry to a excess which will utterly defeat the object intend since there be child to be find who be so train in this respect that the lightest tread upon the floor will awake and perhaps frighten they but this be a excess which be not require all that be necessary during the night be a reasonable degree of silence in order to induce the habit of continued rest if possible in the day time on the contrary fatigue will impel a child to sleep occasionally even in the midst of noise i be not sure that the habit of sleep in the midst of noise be not worth a little pain on the part of the mother nor be it improbable that a habit of this kind once acquire by the infant might ultimately be extend to the night so that over-caution even in regard to that season might gradually be lay aside dr north a distinguished medical practitioner in hartford conn confirm the foregoing sentiment and add that he deem it a imperious duty of those parent who wish well to they infant to form in they the habit of sleep when fatigue whether the room be quiet or noisy with he child no cradle or opiate be need or use sec 2 _ place _ for some time after its birth the infant should sleep near its mother though not in the same bed the bedstead should be of the usual height of bedstead and should be enclose with a railing sufficient to secure the infant from fall out but not of such a structure as to hinder in any degree a free circulation of the air the reason why a child ought to sleep alone and not with the mother or nurse be numerous but the follow be the principal 1 the heat accumulate by the body of the mother and child both be often too great for health 2 the air be too impure i have already speak of the change in the purity of the air which be produce by breathing in it it be bad enough for two adult to sleep in the same bed breathing over and over again the impure air as they must do more or less even if the bed be very large -- but it be still worse for infant they lung demand atmospheric air in its utmost purity and if deny it they must eventually suffer 3 but besides the change of the air by breathe the surface of the body be perpetually change it in the same manner as be state in the chapter on ventilation now a child will almost inevitably breathe a stream of this bad air as it issue from the bed and what be still worse it be very apt in spite of every precaution to get its head cover up with the clothes where it can hardly breathe anything else this if frequently repeat be slow but certain death -- as much so as if the child be to drink poison in moderate quantity let I not be tell that this be a exaggeration that thousand of mother make it a point to cover up the bead of they infant and that notwithstanding this they be as healthy as the infant of they neighbor i have not say that they would droop and die while infant the fume of lead which be a certain poison may be inhale and yet the child or adult who inhale they may live on in tolerable health for many year but suffer he must in the end in spite of every effort and every hope so must the child whose head be cover habitually with the bed clothing where it be compel to breathe not only the air spoil by its own skin but also that which be spoil by the much larger surface of body of the mother or nurse but i have proof on this subject friedlander in he physical education say expressly that in great britain alone between the year 1686 and 1800 no less than 40000 child die in consequence of this practice of allow they to sleep near they nurse i be at first disposed to doubt the accuracy of this most remarkable statement but when i consider the respectability of the authority from which it emanate and that it be only about 350 a year for that great empire i can not doubt that the estimate be substantially correct what a sacrifice at the shrine of ignorance and folly it should be add in this place both to confirm the foregoing sentiment and to show that british mother and nurse be not alone that dr dewee have witness in the circle of he practice four death from the same cause if every physician in the united state have meet with as many case of the kind in proportion to he practice as dr d the evil be about as great in this country as dr f say it be in great britain if a child sleep alone it can not of course be liable to as much suffering of this kind as if it sleep with another person though much precaution will still be necessary to keep its head uncovered and prevent its inhale air spoil by its own lung and skin 4 there be one more evil which will be avoid by have a child sleep alone many a mother have seriously injured she child by pressure i do not here allude to those monster in human nature whose besotted habit have be the frequent cause of the suffocation and death of they offspring but to the more careful and tender mother who would sooner injure herself than she own child such mother even have be know to dislocate or fracture a limb -lrb- footnote : there may be instance where the debility of a infant will be so great that the mother or a nurse must sleep with it to keep it warm but such case of disease be very rare -rrb- to cap the climax of error in this matter some mother allow they infant to lie on they arm as a pillow this practice not only expose they to all or nearly all the evil which have be mention but to one more viz the danger of be throw from the bed a young mother with whom i be well acquaint be sleep one night with she infant on she arm when she make a sudden and rather violent effort to turn in the bed in do which she throw the child upon the floor with such violence as to fracture its little skull and cause its death enough i trust have now be say to convince every reasonable young mother where absolute poverty do not preclude comfort and health that she child ought never to be permit to sleep in the same bed with she but that it should be place on a bedstead by itself at a short distance from she and properly guard from accident -- and above all from inhale impure air at a suitable age a child may be remove from the nursery to a separate chamber here if the circumstance permit it should still sleep by itself and if the bedstead be somewhat lower than ordinary and the room be not too small it will need no watch perhaps this may be the proper place to say that there be more reason than one -- and some of they be of a moral nature too -- why a child should continue to sleep alone after it leave the nursery nor be it sufficient to prohibit its sleep with younger person and yet crowd it into the bed with a aged grandfather or grandmother or with both there be no excuse for a course like this except the iron hand of necessity and even then i should prefer to have a child of mine sleep on the hard floor at least during the summer season rather than with a aged person let it not be suppose i have imbibe the fashionable idea that it be _ peculiarly _ unhealthy for the young to sleep with the old i know this doctrine have many learn advocate and yet i doubt its correctness i believe that the manners and habit of the old may injure the young who sleep with they and i know that they render the air impure like other people but i can not see why the mere circumstance of they be _ old _ should be a source of unhealthiness to they younger bed-fellow still i say that there be reason enough against the practice i be oppose without this some parent allow dog and cat to sleep with child other have a prejudice against cat but not against dog the truth be that they both contaminate the air by respiration and perspiration in the same manner that adult do and aside from the fact that they be often infested by louse and other insect and addict to uncleanly habit they ought always to be exclude and with iron bar and bolt if necessary from the bed of child but of this too i have treat elsewhere sec 3 _ purity of the air _ the general importance of pure air have be mention i have speak of the element of the atmosphere in which we live of the manner in which it may be vitiate and the consequence to health i have show -- perhaps at sufficient length -- the impropriety of wash dry and iron clothes in the room where a child be keep of cooking in the room especially on a stove of suffer the floor or clothes particularly those of the child to remain long wet in the room of smoking tobacco use spirit burn oil with too long a wick & c all which have thus be say of the purity of the air of the nursery generally be applicable to that of all sleep room it be a important point gain when we can secure a nursery with folding door in the center so as when we please to make two room of it in that case the division in which the bed be can be completely ventilate a little before night and thus be comparatively pure for the reception of both the mother and the child shall the window and door where a child sleep be keep closed or shall they be suffer to remain open a part or the whole of the night this must be determine by circumstance if there be no door but such as communicate with apartment whose air be equally impure with that in which the child be it be preferable to keep they close if the window can not be open without expose the child to a current of air it be perhaps the less of two evil not to open they but we be not usually drive to such extremity in some instance window be construct -- and all of they ought to be -- so that they can be lower from the top when this be not the case something can be place before the window to break the current so that it need not fall directly upon the child close the blind will partially effect this where blind exist i have know many a individual who be in the habit of sleep with he window open during the whole year and without any obvious evil consequence dr gregory be of this habit but if adult -- not train to it -- can acquire such a habit with impunity with how much more safety could child be train to it from the very first year macnish say there can be no doubt that a gentle current pervade we sleep apartment be in the highest degree essential to health this consideration -- i mean the impurity of sleep room even after every precaution have be use to keep they ventilate -- afford one of the strongest inducement to go abroad early in the morning -lrb- especially when there be no other room which either adult or child can occupy -rrb- while the nursery or chamber be air and ventilate the utility of _ rise _ early i hope no one can doubt but some have doubt of the propriety of go abroad till the dew have pass away such should be remind by the foregoing train of remark that early walking may be a choice of evil and that if it _ be _ on the whole advantageous to adult it can not be less so to child and as soon as the sun have chase away the vapor of the night if the weather be tolerable most child should be carry abroad sec 4 _ the bed _ this should never be of feather there be many reason for this prohibition especially to the feeble 1 they be too warm infant should by all means be keep warm enough as i have all along insist but excess of heat excite or stimulate the skin cause a unnatural degree of perspiration and thus induce weakness or debility 2 when we first enter a room in which there be a feather bed which have be occupy during the night we be strike with the offensive smell of the air this be owe to a variety of cause one of which probably be that bed of this kind be better adapt to absorb and retain the effluvium of we body but let the cause be what they may the effect ought if possible to be avoid for both experience and authority combine to pronounce they very injurious 3 feather bed -- if use in the nursery -- will inevitably discharge more or less of dust and down both of which be injurious to the tender lung of the infant mattress be better for person of every age than soft feather bed they may be make of horse hair or moss but hair be the best if the mattress do not appear to be warm enough for the very young infant a blanket may be spread over it dr dewee say that in case mattress can not be have the sack bottom may be substitute or even the floor at least in warm weather : for almost anything he add be preferable to feather macnish in he philosophy of sleep object strongly to air bed and say that he can assert from experience that they be the very worst that can possibly be employ my theory -- for i have have no experience on the subject -- would lead I to a similar conclusion a british writer of eminence assure we that the higher class in ireland to a considerable extent accustom themselves and they infant to sleep on bag of cut straw overspread with blanket and a light coverlid and that the custom be rapidly find favor i have sleep on straw both in winter and summer for many year yet i be always warm and those who know my habit say i use less _ cover _ on my bed than almost any individual whom they have ever know i have no hostility to soft bed especially for young child and feeble adult could softness be secure without much heat and relaxation of the system on the contrary it be certainly desirable in itself to have the bed so soft that as large a proportion of the surface of the body may rest on it as possible but i consider hardness as a much smaller evil than feather it be worthy of remark how generally physician for the last hundred year have recommend hard bed especially straw bed or hair mattress to they more feeble and delicate patient this fact might at least quiet we apprehension in regard to they tendency on those who be accustom to they in early infancy some writer on these subject appear to doubt whether after all that they say they shall have much influence on mother in induce they to give up feather bed for they infant but they need not be so faithless multitude have already be reform by they writings and multitude larger still would be so could they gain access to they it be a most serious evil that they be often so written and publish that comparatively few mother will ever possess they the pillow as well as the bed should be rather hard and its thickness should be much less than be usual or we shall do mischief by bend the neck and thus compress the vessel and obstruct the circulation of the blood but on this subject i will say more when i come to treat on posture the child 's bed should not be place near the wall on account of dampness there be also during the summer another reason should lightning strike the house it will be much more apt to injure those who be near the wall than other person as it seldom leave the wall to pass over the central part of the room curtain be not only useless but injurious they prevent a free circulation of the air everything which have this tendency must be studiously guard against in the management of infant nothing be more injurious to the old or the young than damp bed and damp cover it behove especially all those who have the care of infant to see that everything about they bed be thoroughly dry the wall and clothes should also be dry and wet clothes should never be hang up in the room by neglect these precaution cold rheumatism inflammation fever consumption and death may ensue many a person lose he health and not a few they life in this way the author of this work be once throw into a fever from such a cause warm the bed be in all case a bad practice while in the nursery if the air be keep at a proper temperature there will be no need of it after the child be assign to a separate chamber its enervating tendency would result in more evil than good it be better to let the bed become gradually heat by the body in a natural and healthy way no person and above all no infant should be suffer to sleep in a bed that have be recently occupy by the sick the bed and all the clothes should first be thoroughly air could we see with we eye at once how rapidly these body of ours fill the air and even the bed we sleep in with carbonic acid and other hurtful gas and impurity even while in health but much more so in sickness we should be cautious of expose the lung of the tender infant in such a atmosphere until everything have be properly cleanse and the apartment properly ventilate sec 5 _ the cover _ the covering of the bed should be sufficiently warm but never any warmer than be absolutely necessary to protect the child from chilliness the lightest cover which will secure this object be the best perhaps there be nothing in use that with so little weight secure so much heat as what be call comfortable the clothes should not be tuck up at the side and foot of the bed with too much care and exactness for when the bed be once warm thoroughly with the child 's body the admission of a little fresh air into it when he elevate or otherwise move he limb can do no harm but _ may _ do much of good in the way of ventilation i deem it important moreover to inure child very early to little partial exposure of this kind those mother who from over-tenderness and want of correct information on the subject pursue a contrary course and consider it as almost certain death to have a particle of fresh air reach the body of they infant during they slumber be generally sure to outwit themselves and defeat they very intention for by be thus tender of they child it often turn out that whenever the mother be ill or when on any other account she cease to watch over they -- and such time must in general sooner or later come -- they be much more liable to take cold or sustain other injury should they be expose than if they have be treat more rationally i know a mother who would not trust she child to take care of they own bed on retire to rest as long as they remain in she house even though they be twenty or thirty year old but they have no better or firmer constitution than the other child of the same neighborhood hardly anything can be more injurious than cover the head with the bed clothes and yet some mother and nurse cover in this way not only they own head but those of they child i have elsewhere show how impure the air be which be imprison under the bed clothes i hope those mother who be willing to destroy _ themselves _ by cover up they head while they sleep will at least have mercy on they unoffending infant sec 6 _ night dress _ the grand rule on this point be to wear as little dress during sleep as possible some mother not only suffer they infant to sleep in the same shirt cap and stocking that they have worn during the day but add a night gown to the rest no cap should be worn during the night any more than in the day time or if the foolish practice have be adopt for the day it should be discontinue at night it be enough for those adult whose long hair would otherwise be dishevel to wear night cap and subject themselves as they inevitably do to catarrh and periodical headache child 's head should have nothing on they by night nor even by day except to defend they from the rain or the hot ray of the sun the stocking too should be wholly lay aside at night unless in the case of those who be feeble apt to have they foot cold or particularly liable to bowel complaint such may be allow to sleep in they stocking but not in those which have be wear all the day indeed neither child nor adult should ever wear a single garment in the night which they have worn during the day the reason be that there be too many cause of impurity in operation while we sleep without we wear the clothes in which we have be perspire during the day-time -- and which must be already more or less fill with the effluvium of we body it be a very easy thing to have a loose night gown to supply the place of the shirt we have worn during the day and if nothing else be convenient a spare shirt will answer but both a night gown and shirt should never be admit especially in warm weather the garment to supply the place of the shirt during the night may be of calico in the summer and of flannel in the winter the collar and wristband of this night dress should be loose and the whole garment should be large and long no article of dress should ever press upon we body so as in the least to impede the circulation and for this reason it be that writer on physical education have inveigh so much against cravat strap garter & c this caution so important to all be doubly so to young mother on whom devolve the management of the tender infant when the child have be perspire freely during the evening just before he be undressed or when he have just be subject to the warm bath it may be well to use a little care in undress and exchange clothes to prevent take cold -- though it should ever be remember that those child who be manage on a rational system will bear slight exposure with far more safety than they who have be manage at random -- sometimes indeed with great tenderness but at other wholly neglect sec 7 _ posture of the body _ in early infancy child who be not stuff rather than fed may occasionally be permit to sleep on they back especially if they incline to do so but it will be well to encourage they to sleep on one side as soon as you can without great inconvenience the right side as a general rule be preferable because the stomach which lie towards the left side be thus leave uncompressed and digestion undisturbed i would not however require a child to lie always on the right side but would occasionally change he position lest he should become unable to sleep at all except in a particular manner i have say elsewhere that the head ought to be a little raise especially if the child be liable to disease of the brain but this remark rather hastily throw out require explanation there be so much blood send by the heart to the head and upper part of the system of infant as to predispose those part especially the brain to disease in a horizontal position of the body there be more blood send to the brain than when the body be erect this will show the reader at once that if the infant be peculiarly expose to disease of the brain -- and it certainly be so -- he ought to remain in a horizontal posture as little as possible except during sleep and that even then it be desirable to make he bed in such a manner as to elevate the head and shoulder as much as we can without compress the lung or obstruct the circulation in the neck i recommend therefore to raise the head of a infant 's bedstead a little higher than the foot though not so much as to incline he to slide downward into the bed for that would be to produce one evil in cure another sir charle bell think that the common disease of infant call _ diabetes _ arise from they be permit to sleep on they back and that by break up the habit of lie in this position and accustom they to lie on they side we shall prevent it i doubt whether the effect here refer to be ever the result of such a cause still i be as much oppose to the _ habit _ of sleep on the back as sir charle bell it be quite injurious to free respiration closely ally to the subject of bodily position in general be the state of particular organ especially the stomach and the sens i have already intimate that in order to have a infant sleep quietly it be desirable to darken the room this be the more necessary where infant be unnaturally wakeful in such case not only light should be exclude from the eye but sound from the ear odor from the nostril & c a remarkably full stomach be in the way of go quietly to sleep whether the person be old or young neither infant nor adult ought to take food for some time previous to they go to sleep for the night great bodily heat as well as too great cold be also unfavorable if too hot the temperature of the infant should be somewhat reduce by exposure to the air if too cold it should be raise in a natural healthy and appropriate manner sec 8 _ state of the mind _ in give direction how to procure pleasant dream dr franklin mention as a highly important requisition the possession of a quiet conscience a wise prescription no doubt but infant as well as adult in order to sleep quietly should have they mind and feeling in a state of tranquillity the youngest child have its trouble and it be highly important if not indispensable to _ healthy _ sleep that the mother take all reasonable pain to remove they before sleep be induce we sometimes hear about child cry themselves to sleep as if it be a matter of no consequence and sometimes as if it be on the contrary rather desirable but be the sleep of a adult satisfy who go to bed in trouble and only sleep because nature be so exhaust that she can not bear the protracted watchfulness any longer why then should we expect it in the case of the infant i know a excellent father who be so far from believe this doctrine that he silence the cry of he child by the word of command -- and believe that in so do he promote both he health and he happiness he would no more let he cry himself to sleep than he would let he cough himself to sleep though both cry and cough in they place may be and undoubtedly be salutary whatever may be the age and circumstance of a individual he ought to retire for rest with a cheerful mind all anxiety about the future all regret about the past all plan even in regard to the business or amusement of the morrow should be keep wholly out of the mind we should yield ourselves up to the arm of sleep with the same quietude as if life be finish and we have nothing more to do or think of sec 9 _ quality of sleep _ the soundness as well as other quality of sleep differ greatly in different individual and even in the same night with the same individual in different circumstance the first four or five hour of sleep be usually more sound than the remainder hardly anything will interrupt the repose of some person during the early part of the night while they awake afterwards at the slightest noise or movement -- the chirping of a cricket or the playing of a kitten in profound sleep we probably dream very little if at all but in other circumstance we be constantly disturb by dream and sometimes start and wake in the greatest anxiety or horror nightmare be generally accompany by dream of the most distressing kind we imagine a wild beast or a serpent in pursuit of we or a rock be detach from some neighbor cliff and be about to roll upon and crush we and yet all we effort to fly be unavail we seem chained to the spot but while in the very jaw of destruction perhaps we awake tremble and palpitate and weary as if something of a serious nature have really happen in the case of nightmare it be more than probable that we fall asleep with we stomach too heavily load with food or with a smaller quantity of that which be highly indigestible or it may sometimes arise from a improper position of the body such as disturb the action of the stomach or lung or of both these organ lie on the back when we first go to sleep be very apt to produce nightmare but distressing dream often follow a evening of anxious care especially if those care prey upon we for the last half hour and also after late supper even if they be light -- and late reading hence the injunction of the last section hence too the importance of take we last meal two or three hour before sleep and of engage during these hour in cheerful conversation and in the social and private duty of religion family and private worship in the evening be enjoin no less by philosophy than they be by christianity and every young mother will do well to understand this matter and train she offspring accordingly that sleep from which we be easily rouse be the healthiest say macnish very profound slumber partake of the nature of apoplexy i should say rather that a medium between the two extreme be healthiest profound apoplectic sleep i be sure be injurious but that from which we be too easily rouse can not it seem to I be less so thus i have often go to sleep with a resolution to wake at a certain hour or at the striking of the clock and have find myself able to wake at the propose time almost without one failure in twenty instance where i have make the trial but my sleep be obviously unsound and certainly unsatisfying the desire to awake at a certain moment or period seem to buoy I above the usual state of healthy sleep and render I liable to awake at the slightest disturbance be it not for sacrifice the ease of other it would be far better in such case to rely upon some person to wake we instead of charge we own mind with it the quality of we sleep will be greatly affect by the quantity but this think if extend would anticipate the subject of we next section so easily do one thing especially in physical education run into or involve another i will therefore for the present only say that if we confine ourselves to a smaller number of hour than be really require we sleep become too sound to be quite healthy as if nature endeavor to make up in quality for want of due quantity on the contrary if we attempt to sleep longer than be really necessary to restore we the quality of we sleep be not what it ought to be for we do not sleep soundly enough the silence and darkness of the night tend to induce sleep of a better quality than the noise and activity of day it be unquestionably desirable that child should be able to sleep at least occasionally without absolute quiet and yet such sleep can not be sufficiently sound to answer the purpose of health if frequently repeat hence it be perhaps -- at least in part -- that the maxim have obtain currency that one hour of sleep before midnight be worth two afterward the comparison have probably be make between the quiet and darksome hour of evening and those which follow daybreak when light and music and bustle conspire as they should to make we wakeful no person can sleep as soundly and as effectually when light reach he closed eye and sound strike he ear as in darkness and silence he may sleep indeed under almost any circumstance when fatigue and exhaustion demand it but never so profoundly as when in absolute abstraction of light and complete quiet sec 10 _ quantity _ on this point much might be say without exhaust the subject but i have already observe that infant when first bear require to sleep nearly they whole time as they advance in year the necessity for sleep however diminish until they come to maturity when it remain for many year nearly stationary in advanced age the necessity for sleep again increase till we reach the extremest old age or what be usually call second childhood when we again sometimes sleep nearly the whole time i have already remark that much might be say on this subject but i do not think that the present occasion require it if the suggestion which be make in the chapter on early rising should receive the attention i flatter myself they merit i do not believe child would often sleep too long if on the contrary they be suffer to lie late in the morning and then sit up late in the evening all healthful habit and tendency will he so deranged or break up that nature in she indication will by no means prove the unerring guide which she be wont to do in other circumstance a few thought here on the quantity of sleep require by the young after they approach maturity may not be misplace jeremy taylor think that for a healthy adult three hour in twenty-four be enough for all the purpose of sleep baxter think four hour about a reasonable time wesley six lord coke and sir wm jone seven and sir john sinclair eight these be the _ theory _ of man who be all eminent for they learning and most of they for they piety how far they _ practice _ correspond with they theory we be not in every instance tell but to come to the practice of several person who have be distinguish in the world general elliot one of the most vigorous man of he age though live for he whole life on nothing but vegetable and water and who at sixty-four have scarcely begin to feel the infirmity of old age sleep but four hour in twenty-four frederick the great of prussium and the illustrious british surgeon john hunter sleep but five hour a day napoleon bonaparte for a great part of he life sleep only four hour and lord brougham be say to require no more other in numerous instance require but six hour but there be other still who consume eight the conclusion -- in my own mind -- be that with a good constitution and active habit man may habituate themselves to very different quantity of sleep still i think that six hour be little enough for most person and if a child on arrive at maturity be not incline to sleep much longer than that i should not regard he as waste time most person it appear to I require six hour of sound sleep in twenty-four -- i mean between the age of twenty and seventy macnish be the most liberal modern writer i be acquaint with in he allowance of time for sleep speaking of the want of adult he say -- no person who pass only eight hour in bed can be say to waste he time in sleep yet he obviously contradict himself on the very same page for he say expressly that when a person be young strong and healthy a hour or two less may be sufficient but a hour or two less than eight hour reduce the amount to seven or six hour and take the whole period of life to which he probably refer -- say from eighteen to forty -- into consideration there be a very considerable difference between six hour and eight hour a day if six hour be sufficient it can not be right to sleep eight hour let we here make a few estimate if six hour be sufficient for sleep between the age of eighteen and forty he who sleep eight hour a day actually lose 16060 hour -- equal to nearly two whole year of life or about two year and three quarter of time in which we be usually awake this in the meridian of life be not a small waste permit it to every person now in the united state and the sum total of waste time to a single generation would be 25649098 year -- equal to the average duration of the life of 854970 person the value of this time as a commodity in the market at a low estimate -- only forty dollar a year -- would be over a thousand million of dollar and its value for the purpose of mental and moral improvement can not be estimate except in eternity every young mother must derive from these consideration a motive to discourage all unnecessary waste of time in sleep while no one as i trust will forget that to sleep too little be also dangerous to health and prejudicial to the general happiness chapter xv early rise all child naturally early riser evil of sit up late at night excitement in the evening the morning by its beauty invite we abroad example of parent forbid child to rise early keep they out of the way how many be burn up by parental neglect lecture they what be a early hour some writer -- i do not recollect who -- have say that all child be naturally early riser and i can not help come to the same conclusion that they be not so be no more prove from the fact that as thing now be they be generally find addict to the contrary habit than the very general neglect of milk among the higher class of we citizen prove that they have not a natural relish for it -- when every one know that at we first set out in life milk be almost without exception the sole article of human sustenance one of the great difficulty in the way of early rising as i have already have occasion to say be late sit up if child be not accustom to retire till nine or ten o'clock nor then until they have be subject to all the excitement pertain to fashionable life -- company heat and impure air stimulate drink fruit high-seasoned food and perhaps music -- and be become actually feverish no one but a ignorant person or a brute ought to expect they to rise early indeed whatever may have be the cause and whether it have operate on high or low life late retire will inevitably result in late rise the current may be turn out of its course a little while it be true but not always it will ere long return to its accustomed channel perhaps to renew its course with increase pertinacity everything in the morning naturally invite to early rise the pleasant light the music at certain season of some of the animated tribe and the joy which we feel in activity and in the society of those whom we love all conspire to rouse we if we have retire late however and especially in a feverish condition so that when we wake we feel wretched and as sometimes happen more fatigued than when we lay down other collateral motive may be need i have say that everything invite we in the morning to rise early but it be upon the presumption that we parent and brother and sister set we a good example if parent and other friend lie in bed late themselves can anything else be expect of child admit even that they rise early themselves if they never speak of early rising as a pleasure and connect along with it in they child 's mind pleasant association they would be unreasonable to expect otherwise than that they child should cling to the morning couch till they be fairly compel to rise as a relief from pain and uneasiness but when parent go farther than this and actually discourage they child from rise early and use every means in they power short of actual punishment -- and sometimes even that -- to make they lie still till breakfast in order that they may be out of the way what shall we say and what be to be expect as the result there be hope however under the last circumstance people sometimes carry thing to a extreme that defeat they very purpose thus it occasionally be in the case before we this forbid child to rise early and threaten they if they do sometimes excite they curiosity and lead they to the forbid course of conduct simply _ because _ it be forbid not a few person among we possess the disposition to be govern by what have sometimes be call the rule of contrary i might stop here to show that there be nothing so well calculate to develope and improve the mind and heart even of parent themselves as the society of those whom god give they to train for he and they country i might show that not a few of those trait of character which render the company of many old person rather irksome especially to the young have they origin in they neglect of the young and of keep up as long as circumstance will possibly admit juvenile feeling action and habit and yet what do we too often witness in life be not every effort make to induce the young to lie in bed late that they may be out of the way be they not place as soon as possible after they be up with the servant -- if unfortunately there be any in the family -- that they may be out of the way be they not require to breakfast and dine and sup elsewhere if possible that they may be out of the way do we not send they to school even the sabbath school to get they out of the way do not some mother even dose they infant with stupify medicine to lull they to sleep in order to have they out of the way and to crown all though they be quite too often permit to sit up late in the evening to enjoy that society which they be deny so great a part of the day-time be they not occasionally put to bed early that they may be out of the way and that the parent may attend late party to indulge in immoral or unhealthy habit in the last instance they be indeed sometimes put out of the way in the result -- and with a vengeance many a child nay many thousand of child be burn up yearly while they parent be go abroad in the evening in quest of that enjoyment which ought to be find in the bosom of they family in westminster a part of london contain less than two hundred thousand inhabitant one hundred child be thus destroy during a single year and the moral result which occasionally happen be a thousand time worse than burn but enough of this the common practice of lecture the young on the importance of early rising may have a good effect on a few but in general it be believe to produce the contrary result it be in short to sum up the whole matter the influence of parental example and the speaking often of the happiness which early rise afford with perhaps the occasional indulgence of the child in a pleasant morning walk which if he retire early enough be almost certain to produce in he the valuable habit of early rising but what be a early hour some call it early when the sun be one hour high some at sunrise other when they hear of a early riser suppose he must be one who rise at least by daybreak midnight be of course as near the middle of the night as any hour and he who go to bed four or five hour before midnight will never complain of those who insist that _ he _ be not a early riser who be not up by four or five o'clock in summer no adult ought to lie in bed after four o'clock and no child except the mere infant after five much be say by a few writer especially macnish of the danger of rise before the sun have attain a sufficient height above the horizon to chase away the vapor and remove the dampness but i must insist upon earlier rise than this though we should not choose to venture abroad invigorate and restore as we be by sleep i can not think that the dampness of the morning air be more injurious than the foul air of some of we sleep room chapter xvi harden the constitution mistake about harden child they clothing much cold enfeeble the scotch highlander the two extreme equally fatal -- over-tenderness and neglect a interesting anecdote from dr dewee while i have be very particular in enjoin on my reader the importance of thoroughly ventilate they dwelling i have also insist upon the necessity of take child abroad as much as possible not however to harden they so much as to give they a more free access to air and light than they can have at home and also -- when they be old enough -- to cultivate the faculty of attention comparison & c the practice of attempt to harden child by frequent exposure to air much colder than that to which they have be accustom without sufficient additional clothing be open to the same objection which have be bring against cold bathing under the management of a judicious medical practitioner it may do great good to a few constitution but its indiscriminate use would injure a thousand infant for one who be benefit true it be that if the child be protect against cold no harm but on the contrary much good may result from carry he abroad into the fresh air even in very cold weather but what can be more painful than to see the little sufferer carry along when they limb be purple or benumbed with cold and how idle it be to hope that such exposure harden or improve the constitution it be on the same mistaken principle that many adult go thinly clothe late in the fall i have see man in November and December beating and rub they hand who on be ask why they do not wear mitten reply that if they should wear one pair of mitten so early in the season they should want two in the winter now i cheerfully admit that to put on additional clothing before the severity of the weather demand it actually produce the effect here suppose but to endure severe cold on the contrary never harden anybody nay more it enfeeble cold when combine with the evil of _ poverty _ produce more mischief and destroy more life than any one disease in the whole catalogue of human malady adam smith say that it be not uncommon for mother in the highland of scotland who have bear twenty child to have only two of they alive it may be difficult to say whether child be oftener destroy by over-tenderness than by neglect and the evil incident to poverty both extreme be common while the happy medium -- that of conduct a child 's education upon the principle of physiology be rarely know and still more rarely follow i have be much amuse and not a little instruct by the follow anecdote on this point from dr dewee : we be speak with a lady who have lose three or four child with croup who inform we she be convince from absolute experiment that there be nothing like exposure to all kind of weather to protect and harden the system by she first plan of manage she child which be by keep they very warmly clad she say she lose several by the croup but since she have adopt the opposite scheme she child have be perfectly healthy and never have betray the slightest disposition to that terrible disease which have rob she of she child perhaps madam we observe you do not in make you first experiment attend to a number of detail which might be think essential to the plan you do not probably take the proper precaution when you send they into the cold air or observe what be important for they when they return from it oh yes she reply i take every possible care when they be go out i always make they wear a very warm great coat well line with baize and a fur cape or collar i always make they wear a ` comfortable ' round they neck make of soft woollen yarn and as for they foot they be always protect by sock or over-shoe line with wool or fur as the weather might be wet or dry do you believe madam they be keep at a proper degree of warmth by these means oh certainly indeed rather too warm for they would often be in a state of perspiration they tell I when in the open air especially if they run slide or skate and what be do when they be thus heated oh they get cool enough before they reach home and would they receive no injury in pass from this state of perspiration to that of chill not at all for when this happen i always make they take a little warm brandy or wine and water and make they toast they foot well by the fire -lrb- footnote : this absurd custom be a fruitful source of that distressing condition of the hand and foot in winter call chilblain -rrb- do they sleep in a cold or warm room in a warm room a good fire be always make in the stove before they go to bed which keep they quite warm all night would they never complain of be cold towards morning when the stove have become cold yes certainly but then there be always at hand additional bed-clothes with which they could cover themselves and do they always do it oh i suppose so well madam how do you carry you second plan into execution which you say be attend with such happy result i begin by not let they put on they great coat except when the weather be so cold as to require this additional cover and do not permit they to wear a ` comfortable ' or fur round they neck i take away they over-shoe and if they foot chance to get wet -lrb- for they be always provide with good sound shoe -rrb- the shoe be immediately change if they be at home if the weather be wet or unusually cold they be permit to wear they great coat but not without if they come home very cold they be not allow to approach the fire too soon i give they no warm heating drink and accustom they to sleep in room without fire who do not recognize in this second plan for the enjoyment of air and exercise as judicious a plan of physical education so far as it go as can well be point out we be so successful as to convince this lady in a very short time that we own plan of expose the body be precisely the one she have pursue with so much success we also inquire of she what plan she pursue with she child when too young to be submit to the rule just mention she inform we that it be the same system throughout only the detail vary as circumstance of age & c make it necessary that be she send she child into the open air at very early period of they life provide in summer it be neither too wet nor too warm in winter when the air be mild dry and clear -- but always carefully wrap up that they little extremity might not suffer from cold she never suffer they to sleep in the open air if it could be avoid to prevent which as much as possible she constantly charge the nurse to bring the child home as soon as she find they disposed to sleep unless it be when they be very young at which time it be impossible to guard against it and when she child be sufficiently old to walk she take care to prepare they properly for it whether it might be in warm cold or moderate weather she never send they abroad for pleasure at the risk of encounter a storm of any kind nor permit they to walk at the hazard of get wet or very muddy foot be the constitution of you child pretty much the same we demand of this lady no one of my boy be extremely feeble from he very birth do you treat he precisely as you do the other yes as far as regard principle that be i permit he to bear as much of cold heat or wet as he constitution would endure without pain or injury the degree however be very different from those he brother bear have they be determine by the measurement of the thermometer but precisely the same in effect as far as could be ascertain by consequence thus if he be expose to the same temperature as he brother he experience no more inconvenience from it when it be very low than they because he have additional cover to protect he chapter xvii society duty of mother in this matter child prefer the society of parent importance of other society necessity of society illustrate early diffidence select companion for child moral effect of society on the young parent should play with they child every mother be unquestionably as much bind to have a eye to the society of she child as to he food drink or clothing and if the quality amount and general character of the latter be important those of the former be by no means less so it be indeed true that many a child have be happy in a degree in the society of its mother alone where the father be seldom see and the brother and sister never and it be equally true that a few child have so far prefer the society of they parent alone as to become disincline to other society but case of this kind be only as exception to the general rule and be probably monstrous formation of character i can not believe that any child rightly educate would prefer the society of none but its parent or even its parent and brother and sister a french author have write a considerable volume on the importance of what he call _ gaiety _ but which he should prefer to call cheerfulness among the rest he maintain that it be indispensable to the best health but if so -- and i do not doubt it -- then it ought to be encourage in child and the earlier the better now there be no way to encourage cheerfulness in the young so effectually as by indulge they with considerable society that the thing may be carry to excess i have no doubt i have see mother who permit they child to play with they mate till they become excited and be thus lead to continue they sport not only farther than cheerfulness and health demand but until they be excessively fatigued and almost make sick and i believe that the excitement of number in infant and other school may be so great as to be injurious rather than salutary still i think these be rare case truth usually lie somewhere between extreme to keep a child especially a boy always in the nursery or even in the parlor with he mother be one extreme and to let he go abroad continually till he home and its smaller circle become insipid be the other a child properly train will _ usually _ prefer home and only desire to go abroad occasionally he will rather need urge in the matter than require restraint but he must at any rate be teach to be sociable not only for the salve of cheerfulness and the consequent health but for the sake of he manners he mind and he moral if it be a matter of indifference in the formation of human character whether we mix in society or not then for anything i can see a improvement might be propose in the construction of the material universe instead of form the planet so large -- and this earth among the rest -- each might have be divide into hundred of million and every human being might have have a little planet and a immortality exclusively he own such a arrangement would certainly prevent a great many evil and among the rest a great deal of quarrel and bloodsh but divine wisdom be higher than human wisdom and one world to hundred of million of human being have be make instead of give to each individual of the universe a little world of he own in which he might have reign sole monarch and only weep with alexander because none of the other world be within he grasp where a family be already large other society will be unnecessary for some time but where it consist of a mother only although she society be always to be consider of the _ first _ importance i can not but think she ought to take great pain to introduce she child occasionally to the company of other child that diffidence which almost destroy the influence and the happiness of many individual be often cherish if not create by too much seclusion where there be a natural constitution which predispose the child to timidity and diffidence the danger be greatly increase and parent should take unwearied pain to guard against it it be hardly necessary for I to say that great care should also be use in select the companion of child they character will be greatly influence for life by they earlier associate friendship between child be sometimes form while play together which be interrupt only by death those parent who be so fond of control the choice of they son and daughter in regard to a companion for life at a period when control be generally resist would do well to take a hint from what have here be suggest there be no doubt but they might often -- very often -- give such a direction to the embryo affection of they infant and child as would terminate only with they existence it be still less necessary to advert in a work like this to the effect which much observation and experience show good society to have on purity both physical and moral every one must have observe its tendency to form habit of cleanliness not to say neatness there may be excess even in this young person of both sex often spend too much time in prepare they dress for the reception or the visit of they friend still this be only the abuse of a good thing nor be it less true though it may be less obvious that moral purity be more likely to be secure where child and youth of both sex associate a great deal from the earliest infancy -lrb- footnote : if this principle be correct what be the tendency of we numerous school which be exclusively for one sex must there not be latent evil to counterbalance some of the seeming good for myself i doubt whether moral character can ever be form in due proportion and harmony where this separation long exist -rrb- there be tremendous case of declension on record which establish this point beyond the possibility of debate to say that the mother -- and indeed both parent -- ought to form a part of the playing circle of the youngest child in order to watch they opening disposition to check what may be improper and encourage what ought to be encourage would be only to repeat what have often be recommend by the best writer on education -- but which must be repeat again and again till it leave a impression especially on christian parent it be strange that many regard this matter as they do and appear not only ashamed to be see sport with they child but almost ashamed to have they child thus occupy they might as well be ashamed of the gambol of the kitten or the lamb or of the grave mother as she turn aside occasionally to join in its frolic when will parent be willing to take lesson in education from that brute world which they have be so long accustom to overlook or despise chapter xviii employment influence of mother over daughter anecdote of benjamin west anecdote of a poor mother of set lesson and lecture daughter under the mother 's eye why young lady now-a-days dislike domestic employment miserable housewife -- not to be wonder at mistake of one class of man mr flint 's opinion one important and never-to-be-forgotten employment of the young be the cultivation of they mind and another that of they moral but my present purpose be only to speak of those employment denominate manual or physical it be obvious at the first glance that the influence of the mother in we own country at least will be less over boy than over girl we leave it to savage and semi-savage to employ they female and even they mother in hard manual labor here in america what i should say on the employment of boy would be more properly address to the young father there be some exception to the general truth contain in the last paragraph many a mother have -- unconsciously at the time but with no less certainty than if she have do it intentionally -- give a direction to the whole current of she son 's life and this too at a very early period the mother of benjamin west the painter if she do not give the first tendency to he favorite pursuit while he be yet a mere child at the least greatly confirm he in it by the manner of express she surprise at one of he early performance my mother 's kiss on that occasion say he make I a painter nor be fact of the same general character by any means uncommon i know a poor mother who in the absence of she husband at he weekly or monthly labor use to detain she eldest boy then almost a infant from go to bed in the evening till she day 's work be finish -- because in she loneliness she want he company -- by tell story of eminent man and especially of distinguished philanthropist until she have unconsciously kindle in he a philanthropic spirit which will not cease to burn till he death but it be in form the predilection of daughter for they destine employment that mother be especially influential not so much by they set lesson or lecture however as by the force of continued example no mother who send she child away to be nurse and subsequently to she return seize on every possible opportunity to keep she out of the way and out of she sight will be likely to give she any choice of employment or indeed any fondness for employment at all nor be it sufficient that she keep she daughter constantly under she eye with a view to qualify she for the duty of a housewife if the daughter see as plainly as in the light of mid-day that the mother dislike the employment herself she must love what she would have she daughter love and even what she would have she understand nor be it sufficient that she _ affect _ a fondness for the employment she love for it must be real little girl have keener eye and better judgment than some mother seem willing to believe or to admit many person seem greatly surprise that the young lady of modern day have so little fondness for domestic life and domestic duty how few it be often say will do they own housework if they can possibly get a train of domestic around they even though the care and oversight of the domestic themselves gear they out more rapidly than bodily labor would but there be a reason for this hostility to domestic employment it be because mother almost universally consider they occupation as mere drudgery and bring up they child in the same spirit and what else could be expect as the result it would be a anomaly in the history of human nature if the female member of family be to grow up in love with ordinary domestic avocation when they have be accustom to see they mother and nurse and elder sister complain and fret while engage in they and show by they action no less than by they word that they regard themselves as miserable and wretched no wonder so many girl of the present day make miserable housewife no wonder a factory a book-bindery or a shoemaker 's shop be consider preferable to the kitchen no wonder the world degenerate because female no longer healthfully employ become pale and sickly spreading gloom and misery all around they and transmit the same ill which themselves suffer to those who come after they it be true the guilt of this dereliction must not be charge wholly on mother though they ought unquestionably to bear a large share of it those who have and ought to have much influence in society erroneously and i suppose thoughtlessly help mother along in they evil way if there be a universal combination between certain class of mankind and the whole race of mother to ruin rather than be instrumental of reform mankind and of save they deathless soul i hardly know how they could invent a much better or at least a much more certain plan than that now in operation so long as those who take the lead in society and govern the fashion in this matter as other govern it in the matter of dress refuse as a general rule to form alliance for life except with those who practically despise house-hold concern -- and so long as we house be fill with domestic whose object be to aid these spoil mother but whose real effect be to complete they ruin and accelerate the ruin of mankind -- just so long will human progress towards perfection be retard if mother be in love with they occupation and they daughter know it then to the influence of a good example they could add many lesson of instruction these might be give in the way of natural unstudied conversation and thus be not only hear with attention but sink deep if the world be ever to be reform say mr flint in he western review woman sensible enlighten well educate and principled must be the original mover in the great work every one who have consider well the extent and nature of female influence will concur in the sentiment and if he have one remain particle of devotion to the father of spirit he will send up the most fervent petition to he throne of mercy in behalf of this often depressed or enslaved half of the human race that they may speedily be emancipate and become as conspicuous in human redemption as they have sometimes be in human condemnation chapter xix education of the sens improve the sens example of improvement sec 1 hearing -- how injure -- how improve -- sec 2 see -- how injured -- sec 3 tasting and smell -- how benumb -- how preserved -- sec 4 feel the blind hint to parent education of both hand man be much less useful and happy in this world than he would be if more pain be take by parent and teacher as well as by himself to cultivate he sens -- hearing see feeling tasting and smell -- and to preserve they rectitude the extent to which the sens can be improve or exalt can best be understand by observe how perfect they become when we be compel to cultivate they thus the blind who be oblige to cultivate hearing feeling and smell often astonish we by the keenness of these sens they will distinguish sound -- especially voice -- which other can not and with so much accuracy as to remember for several year the voice of a person in a large company which they hear but once they will also distinguish small piece of money different fabric and quality of cloth & c and in walk often ascertain by the feeling of the air or by other sensation when they approach a building or any other considerable body so the north american indian whose habit of life seem to require it can hear the footstep of a approach enemy at distance which astonish we so also the deaf and dumb be very keen-sighted and generally make very accurate observation any reader who be sceptical in regard to the cultivation of the sens would do well to consult the account of julium brace the deaf and dumb and blind girl as publish in some of the early volume of the annals of education but it be hardly necessary to resort to the blind or to savage or to the deaf and dumb in order to prove man 's susceptibility in this respect we may be remind of the same fact by observe with what accuracy the merchant tailor can distinguish by feel the quality of he goods how quick a painter a engraver or a printer will discover error in painting or printing which wholly escape ordinary reader or observer and how quick the ear of a good musician will discover the existence and origin of a discordant sound in he choir now i do not undertake to say or prove that mankind would be better or happier for have they sens all cultivate in the highest possible degree though i be not sure that this would not be the case but so long as a large proportion of we idea enter we mind through the medium of the five sens it be desirable that something should be do to perfect they instead of overlook the whole subject what mother ought to do in this matter deserve therefore a brief consideration sec 1 _ hearing _ the suggestion in another place to keep away cap from the child 's head if duly attend to be one means of perfect or at least of preserve the sense of hearing for cap by the heat they produce to a part which can not safely endure a increase of temperature greatly expose child to catarrhal affection and many a catarrh have lay the foundation for dulness of hearing if not of actual deafness the ear should be keep clean if wash sufficiently often and syringe once a week with warm milk and water or with very weak soap-suds gently warm the ceruman or ear wax will hardly be find accumulate in such mass as to produce deafness and yet such accumulation with such consequence be by no means uncommon it be not long since a young man with whom i be acquaint apply to a eminent surgeon of boston on account of deafness in one ear which have become quite troublesome and as it be fear incurable syringing with a large and strong syringe disengage a large mass of ceruman and hearing be immediately restore child should be teach to distinguish sound with closed eye or blindfold we may strike on various object and ask they to tell what we strike & c this will lead they to _ observe _ sound and will perfect they hearing in a remarkable degree there be also advantage to be derive from accustom a child to a great variety of sound both as regard they strength and character but this must only be occasional for if the ear be constantly accustom to sound of any kind and more especially those which be harsh or loud the organ of hearing be liable to sustain injury music as it be now begin to be teach to child in we school will do much i think to improve the faculty of hearing sec 2 _ see _ the sight say addison be the most perfect of all we sens and this be unquestionably true but it be more or less perfect in different individual accord to the early education they have receive sometimes it be true we be bear near-or dim-sighted but such case be comparatively rare the question be sometimes ask why there be so many person now-a-day who lose they sight become near-sighted & c very young it may be difficult to answer this question fully yet i can not help think that the follow be some of the cause 1 the great heat of we apartment which together with late hour and much lamp light affect the eye unpleasantly be believe to be among the more prominent cause of early decay of sight formerly we apartment be neither so steadily nor so generally heated and we rise earlier and consequently go to bed earlier 2 the fine print of a large proportion of we book especially we school book have do immense injury i do not believe that read fine print occasionally for a few moment at a time or reading by a very strong or very weak light in the same way do harm on the contrary i think it may strengthen and improve the sight it be the long continuance of these thing that do the mischief and the mischief thus do be immense i rejoice that printer and publisher be begin of late to use much larger type than they have do for some year past 3 the early use of spectacles do mischief -- i mean before they be need after they begin to be need there be no advantage in delay to use they as some do for fear they shall wear they too soon this be about as wise as the practice of go cold to harden ourselves 4 reading when we be fatigue or ill or have a very full stomach be another way to injure the sight 5 rub the eye with the finger or with anything else do inevitable mischief the german have a proverb which say -- never touch you eye except with you elbow there be much of good sense in it in short there be a thousand way in which that delicate organ the human eye may sustain injury and nearly as many in which it may be strengthen cultivate and improve but my limit merely permit I to add that the frequent but gentle application of water to the eye several time a day at such a temperature as be most agreeable -- but cold when it can be bear -- be one of the best preservative of sight which the world afford connected alike with physical and intellectual education be the practice of measure by the eye height distance superfice weight and solid it be not difficult to train the eye to a accuracy in this matter which would astonish the uninstructed sec 3 _ tasting and smell _ i do not know that it be worth we while to take pain by any direct method to cultivate the organ of taste or smell but i think it proper at the least to preserve they original rectitude many i know undertake to say that be it not for we error in regard to food and drink and be it not in particular for the multitude of strange mixture which tend to benumb those two sens we might determine the quality of food and drink -- whether they be favorable or adverse -- by means of taste and smell like the animal but i do not believe this the creator have substitute reason in we for instinct in the brute animal it be not necessary that we should possess the latter when the former be so manifestly superior to it and accordingly i do not believe that it be give we or any of that acuteness of sensation which exist in the dog the tiger the vulture & c -- and which so closely resemble it there can be no doubt -- no reasonable doubt certainly -- that the wretched custom of modern cookery benumb the sens of taste and smell more or less and that high-seasoned food condiment and stimulate drink do the same and should for this reason be it for no other be studiously avoid closely connect with the organ of taste be the tooth a volume might profitably be write on these -- as on the eye but i will only say that they should be keep perfectly clean either by rinse or brushing or both especially after eat that they should be permit to chew all we food instead of merely stand by as silent spectator to the passage of that which be mash soaked chop & c that they should not be pick or clean with pin or other equally hard instrument that they should not be use to crack nut or other hard indigestible substance and that the stomach with which they be apt to sympathize very strongly should also be keep in a good and healthy condition sec 4 _ feeling _ corpulence and slovenliness be generally among the more prolific source of a want of acuteness in feel the first be a disease and may be avoid by a proper diet and by active mental and bodily employment slovenliness we may of course avoid whenever there be a wish to do so and a abundance of water but the sense of feeling or especially that accumulation of it which we call touch and which seem to be specially located in the ball of the finger and on the palm of the hand be susceptible of a degree of improvement far beyond what would be the natural result of cleanliness and freedom from plethora or corpulence i have already allude in my general remark at the head of this chapter to the acuteness of this sense in the blind as well as in the dealer in cloth i might add many more illustration but a single one in relation to the blind which be accidentally omit in that place will be sufficient the blind at the institution in this city as well as in other similar institution be now teach to read and write with considerable facility but how most of my reader may have hear how they read but i will describe the process as well as i can a description of they method of write be more difficult the letter be form by press the paper while quite moist upon rather large type which raise a ridge in the line of every letter and which remain prominent after the paper be dry in order to read the pupil have to feel out these ridge a circular ridge on the paper he be tell be o a perpendicular one i a crooked one s & c they read music and arithmetic print in a similar manner a few month of practice in this way will enable a ingenious youth to read with considerable ease and despatch now if nothing be want but a little training to render the touch so accurate would it not be useful to train every child to judge frequently of the property of body by this sense and can not every one recall to he mind a thousand situation in which a greater accuracy of this sense would have save he much inconvenience as well as afford he no little pleasure i shall conclude this section with a few remark on the hand the custom of neglect or almost neglect the left hand though nearly universal in this country at least appear to I to be wrong -- decidedly so for although more blood may be send to the right arm than to the leave as physiologist say yet the difference be not as great at birth as it be afterward so that education either weaken the one or strengthen the other besides this we occasionally find a person who be left-handed as it be call that be he left hand and arm be as much larger and stronger than the right as the right be usually stronger than the left how be this do we find a corresponding change in the internal structure but suppose it could be ascertain that such a change do exist which i believe have never be do the question would still arise whether the difference be the same at birth or whether the more frequent use of the left hand have not in part produce it i do not mean here to intimate that a more frequent use of the left hand than the right would make new blood-vessel grow where there be none before but it would certainly do one thing it would make the same vessel carry more blood than they do before which be in effect nearly the same thing : -- for the more blood in the limb as a general rule the more strength -- provide the limb be in due health and exercise the inference which i wish the reader to make from all this be that since the left hand and arm by due cultivation and without essential difference or change of structure to begin with can occasionally be make stronger than the right it be fair to conclude that it may if find desirable be always render more nearly equal to it than in adult year we usually find it the question be now fairly before we -- be such a result desirable i maintain that it be and shall endeavor to show my reason how often be one hand injure by a accident or render nearly useless by disease but if it should be the right how helpless it make we the man who be accustom to shave himself must now resort to a barber if he be a barber himself or almost any other mechanic he business must be discontinue or if he be a clerk he can not use he left hand and must consequently lose he time or if amputation chance to be perform on a favorite arm how entirely useless to society we be till we have learn to use the other it not only take up a great deal of valuable time to acquire a facility of use it but if we be already arrive at maturity we can never use it so well as the other during we whole life because it be too late in life to increase its size and strength much by constant exercise whereas in youth it might have be do easily be it not then important -- for these and many more reason -- to teach a child to use with nearly equal readiness both of he hand but if so who can do it better than the mother and when can it be better do than in the earliest infancy when be the time which would be devote to it worth less than at this period chapter xx abuse bad seat for child at table and elsewhere why child hate Sunday seat at sabbath school -- at church -- at district school suspend child between the heaven and the earth cushion to sit on seat with back child in factory evil produce bodily punishment strike the head of child very injurious beating across the middle of the body anecdote of a teacher conclude advice to mother it be difficult to determine in regard to many thing which concern the management of the young whether they belong most properly to moral or physical education so close be the connection between the two and so decidedly do everything or nearly everything which relate to the management of the body have a bearing upon the formation of moral character this work might be extend very much farther do it comport with my original plan but i hasten to close the volume with a few thought on certain abuse of the body which prevail to a greater or less extent in family and school and to which i have not adverted elsewhere the seat of child be usually bad both at table and elsewhere it seem not enough that we condemn they to the use of knife fork spoons & c of the same size with those of adult we go farther and give they chair of the same height and proportion with we own there be a few exception to the truth of this remark here and there we see a child 's chair it be true -- but not often but how unreasonable be it to seat a child in a chair so high that he foot can not reach the floor and so construct that there be no outer place on which the foot can rest what adult would be willing to sit in so painful a posture with he leg dangle no wonder child dislike to sit much in such circumstance and it be a great blessing to both parent and child that they do no wonder child hate the sabbath especially in those family where they be compel to keep the day holy by sit motionless sabbath school though they bring with they some evil along with a great deal of good be a relief to the young in this particular -- especially if they seat be more comfortable elsewhere than at home they consider it much more tolerable to spend the morning and intermission of the day in go and return from sabbath school than in constant and close confinement they prefer variety and the occasional light and air of heaven to monotony and seclusion and silence it happen however that the seat at the sabbath school and at church be not always what they should be nor so far as church be concern do i see that this evil can be wholly avoid child usually sit with they parent in the sanctuary -- and they ought to do so : and the height of the seat can not of course accommodate both if there be a building erect solely for the use of the sabbath school the seat may be construct accordingly without seriously incommode anybody but in the church i do not see as i have once before observe how the evil can be remedy the greatest trouble in regard to seat however be at the day school especially in we district or common school there it be usual for child to be confine six hour a day -- and sometimes two in succession -- to hard narrow plank seat a large proportion of which be without back and raise so high that the foot of most of the pupil can not possibly touch the floor there suspend as i have say in another work -lrb- footnote : see a prize essay on school house page 7 -rrb- between the heaven and the earth they be compel to remain motionless for a hour or a hour and a half together i have also show in the same essay that in regard to the desk and indeed many other thing which pertain to or be connect with the school very little pain be take to provide for the physical welfare or even comfort of the pupil and that a thorough reform on the subject appear to be indispensable when i speak of hard plank seat let I not be understand as hint at the necessity of cushion when i write the essay above mention i do indeed believe that they be desirable but i be now oppose to they use either by child or adult even where a laborious employment would seem to demand a long confinement to this awkward and unnatural position if we seat be cushion we shall sit too easily i believe that we health require a hard seat because its very hardness incline we to change frequently we position but if we must sit be it ever so short a time we seat should always have back and those which be design for child should not be so high as to render they uncomfortable nor should the back of seat be so high as they usually be either for child or adult they should never come much higher than the middle of the body if they reach the shoulder they either favor a crouching forward or interfere with the free action of the lung this might be deem a proper place for say something on the position of child in manufactory but here a world of abuse open upon my view the full development of which demand a large volume how many crooked spine emaciated body decay lung as well as scrofula fever and consumption be either induce or accelerate by these unnatural employment i mean they be unnatural for the _ young _ as to employ adult in they i have nothing at present to say but when i think of the cruel custom of place child in these place whose body -- and be this the place i might add _ mind _ -- be immature and especially girl i be compel by the voice of conscience and as i trust by a regard to those law which god have establish in we physical frame but which be yet so strangely violate to protest against it better that no factory should exist than that child should be ruin in they as they now be better by far that we should return be it possible to the primitive habit of new england -- to those by-gone day when mother and daughter make the wear apparel of themselves and they family -- when if there be less of intellectual cultivation and less money expend for luxury and extravagance there be much more of health and happiness there be one more species of abuse to which in closing i wish to direct maternal attention i allude to injudicious mode of inflict corporal punishment let I not be understand to appear in this place as the advocate of bodily punishment of any kind for if they be even admissible under some circumstance i be fully convince that in the way in which they be commonly administer they do much more harm than good but leave the question of they utility in the abstract wholly untouched and take it for grant for the present that they be -- as be undoubtedly the fact -- sometimes employ and will continue to be so for a great while to come i proceed to speak of they more flagrant abuse among these none be more reprehensible than blow of any kind on the head even the rod be objectionable for this purpose since it expose the eye but the hand -- in boxing the ear or striking in any way -- be more so the bone of the head in young child be not yet firmly knit together and these concussion may injure the tender brain i know of whole family whose mental faculty be dull as the consequence -- i believe -- of a perpetual boxing and striking of the head some individual be make almost idiot in this very manner -- but the worst be not yet tell many teacher be in the habit of strike they pupil ' head with thick heavy book and with wooden rule i have see one of the latter of considerable size and thickness break in two across the head of a very small boy and this too -- such be the public mind -- in the presence of a mother who be pay a visit to the school i have see parent and master strike the head of they child with piece of wood of much larger size -- in one instance with a common size tailor 's press-board in another with the heavy end of a wooden whip-handle about a inch in diameter child be sometimes severely beat across the middle of the body -- the region where lie the vital organ -- the lung the heart the liver & c they be sometimes beat too across the joint or in any place that the excited perhaps passionate teacher or parent can reach rule and book be throw with violence at pupil in school there be a story in the annals of education vol iv at page 28 of a teacher who throw a rule at a little boy six year old which strike he with great force within a inch of one of he eye have it strike a little nearer to he nose it would in all probability have destroy he left eye \* \* \* \* \* but without extend these remark any farther every intelligent mother who read what i have already write will see as i trust the necessity of properly inform herself on the great subject of physical education and of be better prepared than she have hitherto be for acquit herself with satisfaction of those high and sacred responsibility which in the wise arrangement of nature and providence devolve upon she end of the project gutenberg ebook
