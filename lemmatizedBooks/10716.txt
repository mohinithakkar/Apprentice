produce by garrett alley and pg distribute proofreader the epic : a essay by lascelle abercrombie 1914 by the same author : towards a theory of art speculative dialogue four short play thoma hardy : a critical study principle of english prosody preface _ as this essay be dispose to consider epic poetry as a species of literature and not as a department of sociology or archaeology or ethnology the reader will not find it anything material to the discussion which may be typify in those very interesting work gilbert murray 's the rise of the greek epic and andrew lang 's the world of homer the distinction between a literary and a scientific attitude to homer -lrb- and all other authentic epic -rrb- be i think finally sum up in mr mackail 's lecture on greek poetry the follow page at any rate assume that this be so theory about epic origin be therefore indifferent to my purpose besides i do not see the need for any theory i think it need only be say of any epic poem whatever that it be compose by a man and transmit by man but this be not to say that investigation of the authentic epic poet 's _ milieu _ may not be extremely profitable and for settle the preliminary of this essay i owe a great deal to mr chadwick 's profoundly interesting study the heroic age though i daresay mr chadwick would repudiate some of my conclusion i must also acknowledge suggestion take from mr macneile dixon 's learn and vigorous english epic and heroic poetry and especially the assistance of mr john clark 's history of epic poetry mr clark 's book be so thorough and so adequate that my own would certainly have be superfluous be it not that i have take a particular point of view which he method seem to rule out -- a point of view which seem well worth take this be my excuse too for consider only the most conspicuous instance of epic poetry they have be discuss often enough but not often so far as i know primarily as stage of one continuous artistic development _ i beginning the invention of epic poetry correspond with a definite and in the history of the world often recur state of society that be to say epic poetry have be invent many time and independently but as the need which prompt the invention have be broadly similar so the invention itself have be most nation have pass through the same sort of chemistry before they hot racial element have be thoroughly compound and thence have cool into the stable convenience of routine which be the material shape of civilization -- before this have firmly occur there have usually be what be call a heroic age it be apt to be the hottest and most glowing stage of the process so much be commonplace exactly what cause the racial element of a nation with all they vary property to flash suddenly -lrb- as it seem -rrb- into the splendid incandescence of a heroic age and thence to shift again into a comparatively rigid and perhaps comparatively lustreless civilization -- this difficult matter have be very nicely investigate of late and to interesting though not decide result but i may not concern myself with this nor even with the detailed characteristic allege or ascertain of the heroic age of nation it be enough for the purpose of this book that the name heroic age be a good one for this stage of the business it be obviously and on the whole rightly descriptive for the stage display the first vigorous expression as the natural thing and without conspicuous restraint of private individuality in savagery thought sentiment religion and social organization may be exceedingly complicate full of the most subtle and strange relationship but they exist as complete and determine _ whole _ each part absolutely bind up with the rest analysis have never come near they the savage be blind to the glaring incongruity of he tribal idea not so much by habit or reverence it be simply that the mere possibility of such a thing as analysis have never occur to he he think he feel he live all in a whole each person be the tribe in little this may make everyone a astoundingly complex character but it make strong individuality impossible in savagery since everyone accept the same elaborate unanalysed whole of tribal existence that existence indeed would find in the assertion of private individuality a serious danger and tribal organization guard against this so efficiently that it be doubtless impossible so long as there be no interruption from outside in some obscure manner however savage existence have be constantly interrupted and it seem as if the long-repressed force of individuality then burst out into exaggerated vehemence for the result -lrb- if it be not slavery -rrb- be that a people pass from its savage to its heroic age on its way to some permanence of civilization it must always have take a good deal to break up the rigidity of savage society it might be the shock of enforced mixture with a totally alien race the two kind of blood full of independent vigor compel to flow together -lrb- 1 -rrb- or it might be the migration due to economic stress from one tract of country to which the tribal existence be perfectly adapt to another for which it be quite unsuited with the add necessity of conquer the people find in possession whatever the cause may have be the result be obvious : a sudden liberation a delighted expansion of numerous private individuality but the various appearance of the heroic age can not perhaps be completely generalize what have just be write will probably do for the heroic age which produce homer and for that which produce the _ nibelungenly beowulf _ and the northern saga it may therefore stand as the typical case since homer and these northern poem be what most people have in they mind when they speak of authentic epic but decidedly heroic age have occur much later than the latest of these case and they arise out of a state of society which can not roundly be call savagery europe for instance have its unmistakable heroic age when it be fight with the moslem whether that warfare be a cause or merely a accompaniment and the period which precede it the period after the failure of roman civilization be sufficiently dark and devoid of individuality to make the sudden plenty of potent and splendid individual seem a phenomenon of the same sort as that which have be roughly describe it can scarcely be doubt that the age which be exhibit in the _ poem of the cid _ the _ song of roland _ and the lay of the crusader -lrb- _ la chanson d'antioche _ for instance -rrb- be similar in all essential to the age we find in homer and the _ nibelungenly _ servium too have its ballad-cycle of christian and mahometan warfare which suppose a age obviously heroic but it hardly fall in with we scheme servium at this time might have be expect to have go well past its heroic age either then it be somehow unusually prolonged or else the clash of the ottoman war revive it the case of servium be interesting in another way the song about the battle of kossovo describe servian defeat -- defeat so overwhelming that poetry can not possibly translate it and do not attempt it into anything that look like victory even the splendid courage of its hero milo who counter a imputation of treachery by ride in full daylight into the ottoman camp and murder the sultan even this courage be rather near to desperation the marko cycle -- marko whose betrayal of he country seem wipe out by he immense prowess -- have in a less degree this utter defeat of servium as its background but servian history before all this have many glory which one would think would serve the turn of heroic song better than appalling defeat and indeed enslavement why be the latter celebrated and not the former the reason can only be this : heroic poetry depend on a heroic age and a age be heroic because of what it be not because of what it do servia 's defeat by the army of amurath come at a time when its people be too strongly possess by the heroic spirit to avoid utter itself in poetry and from this it appear too that when the heroic age sing it primarily sing of itself even when that mean singing of its own humiliation -- one other exceptional kind of heroic age must just be mention in this professedly inadequate summary it be the kind which occur quite locally and on a petty scale with cause obscurer than ever the border ballad for instance and the robin hood ballad clearly suppose a state of society which be nothing but a very circumscribed and not very important heroic age here the household of gentry take the place of court and the poetry in vogue there be perhaps instantly take up by the tavern or perhaps this be a case in which the hero be so little remove from common folk that celebration of individual prowess begin among the latter not as seem usually to have happen among the social equal of the hero but doubtless there be infinite grade in the structure of the heroic age the note of the heroic age then be vehement private individuality freely and greatly assert itself the assertion be not always what we should call noble but it be always forceful and unmistakable there would be no doubt some social and religious scheme to contain the individual 's self-assertion but the latter not the former be the thing that count it be not a age that last for very long as a rule and before there come the state in which strong social organization and strong private individuality be compatible -- mutually helpful instead of destroy one another as they do in opposite way in savagery and in the heroic age -- before the state call civilization can arrive there have commonly be a long passage of dark obscurity which throw up into exaggerated brightness the radiance of the heroic age the balance of private good and general welfare be at the bottom of civilized moral but the moral of the heroic age be found on individuality and on nothing else in homer for instance it can be see pretty clearly that a good man be simply a man of impose active individuality -lrb- 2 -rrb- a bad man be a inefficient undistinguished man -- probably too like thersite ugly it be in fact a absolutely aristocratic age -- a age in which he who rule be thereby prove the best and from its nature it must be a age very heartily engage in something usually fight whoever be near enough to be fight with though in _ beowulf _ it seem to be do something more profitable to the civilization which be to follow it -- tame the fierceness of surround circumstance and man 's primitive kind but in any case it have a good deal of leisure and the best way to prevent this from drag heavily be -lrb- after feast -rrb- to glory in the thing it have do or perhaps in the thing it would like to have do hence heroic poetry but exactly what heroic poetry be in its origin probably we shall never know it would scarcely be history and it would scarcely be very ornate poetry the first thing require would be to translate the prowess of champion into good and move narrative and this would be metrify because so it become both more exciting and more easily remembered each succeed bard would improve accord to he own notion the material he receive from he teacher the prowess of the great hero would become more and more astonishing more and more calculate to keep awake the feast noble who listen to the song in a age when write if it exist at all be a rare and secret art the mist of antiquity descend after a very few generation there be little chance of the song of the bard be check by record actuality for if anyone could write at all it would be the bard themselves who would use the mystery or purpose of they own trade in quite a short time oral tradition in keep of the bard whose business be to purvey wonder make the champion perform easily deed which the man of the present time can only gape at and every bard take over the stock of tradition not from original source but from the mingled fantasy and memory of the bard who come just before he so that when this tradition survive at all it survive in a form very different from what it be in the beginning but apparently we can mark out several stage in the fortune of the tradition it be first of all court poetry or perhaps baronial poetry and it may survive as that from this stage it may pass into possession of the common people or at least into the possession of bard whose client be peasant and not noble from be court poetry it become the poetry of cottage and tavern it may survive as this finally it may be take up again by the court and become poetry of much greater sophistication and nicety than it be in either of the precede stage but each stage leave its sign on the tradition all this give we what be conveniently call epic material the material out of which epic poetry might be make but it do not give we epic poetry the world know of a vast stock of epic material scatter up and down the nation sometimes its artistic value be as extraordinary as its archaeological interest but not always instance be we own border ballad and robin hood ballad the servian cycle of the battle of kossovo and the prowess of marko the modern greek song of the revolt against turkey -lrb- the condition of which seem to have be similar to those which surround the growth of we ride ballad -rrb- the fragment of finnish legend which be piece together into the _ kalevala _ the ossianic poetry and perhaps some of the minor saga should be put in here then there be the glorious welsh story of arthur tristram and the rest and the not less glorious irish story of deirdre and cuchulain both of these noble mass of legend seem to have only just miss the final shaping which turn epic material into epic poetry for epic material it must be repeat be not the same thing as epic poetry epic material be fragmentary scatter loosely related sometimes contradictory each piece of comparatively small size with no intention beyond hearty narrative it be a heap of excellent stone admirably quarry out of a great rock-face of stubborn experience but for this to be work into some great structure of epic poetry the heroic age must be capable of produce individuality of much profounder nature than any of its fight champion or rather we should simply say that the production of epic poetry depend on the occurrence -lrb- always a accidental occurrence -rrb- of creative genius it be quite likely that what homer have to work on be nothing superior to the arthurian legend but homer occur and the tale of troy and odysseus become incomparable poetry a epic be not make by piece together a set of heroic lay adjust they discrepancy and make they into a continuous narrative a epic be not even a re-creation of old thing it be altogether a new creation a new creation in term of old thing and what else be any other poetry the epic poet have behind he a tradition of matter and a tradition of style and that be what every other poet have behind he too only for the epic poet tradition be rather narrower rather more strictly compelling this must not be lose sight of it be what the poet do with the tradition he fall in which be artistically the important thing he take a mass of confused splendor and he make they into something which they certainly be not before something which as we can clearly see by compare epic poetry with mere epic material the latter scarce hint at he make this heap of matter into a grand design he force it to obey a single preside unity of artistic purpose obviously something much more potent be require for this than a fine skill in narrative and poetic ornament unity be not merely a external affair there be only one thing which can master the perplexed stuff of epic material into unity and that be a ability to see in particular human experience some significant symbolism of man 's general destiny it be natural that after the epic poet have arrive the crude epic material in which he work should scarcely be hear of it could only be hand on by the minstrel themselves and they audience would not be likely to listen comfortably to the old piecemeal song after they have hear the familiar event fall into the magnificent order pomp of the genuine epic poet the tradition indeed would start afresh with he but how the novel tradition fare as it grow old with he successor be difficult guesswork we can tell however sometimes in what stage of the epic material 's development the great unifying epic poet occur three roughly define stage have be mention homer perhaps come when the epic material be still in its first stage of be court-poetry almost certainly this be when the poet of the crusading lay of the _ song of roland _ and the _ poem of the cid _ set to work hesiod be a clear instance of the poet who master epic material after it have pass into popular possession and the _ nibelungenly _ be think to be make out of matter that have pass from the people back again to the court epic poetry then as distinct from mere epic material be the concern of this book the intention be to determine wherein epic poetry be a definite species of literature what it characteristically do for conscious human life and to find out whether this species and this function have show and be likely to show any development it must be admit that the great unifying poet who work on the epic material before he do not always produce something which must come within the scope of this intention hesiod have just be give as a instance of such a poet but he work be scarcely a epic -lrb- 3 -rrb- the great saga too i must omit they be epic enough in primary intention but they be not poetry and i be among those who believe that there be a difference between poetry and prose if epic poetry be a definite species the saga do not fall within it but this will leave I more of the authentic epic poetry than i can possibly deal with and i shall have to confine myself to its greatest example before however proceed to consider epic poetry as a whole as a constantly recur form of art continually respond to the new need of man 's develop consciousness i must go rapidly and generally over the literary epic and especially i must question whether it be really justifiable or profitable to divide epic poetry into the two contrast department of authentic and literary footnote : -lrb- footnote 1

good man be the admirable man in this sense homer 's god be certainly good every epithet he give they -- joyous-thunderer far-darter cloud-gatherer and the rest -- proclaim they unapproachable goodness if it have be say to homer that he god can not be good because they behavior be consistently cynical cruel unscrupulous and scandalous he would simply think he have not hear aright : zeus be a habitual liar of course but what have that get to do with he goodness -- only those who would have homer a kind of salvationist need regret this just because he could only make he god good in this primitive style he be able to treat they discordant family in that vein of exquisite comedy which be one of the most precious thing in the world -rrb- -lrb- footnote 3 : scarcely what _ we _ call epic epo might include hesiod as well as epic material epopee be the business that homer start -rrb- ii literary epic epic poetry then be invent to supply the artistic demand of society in a certain definite and recognizable state or rather it be the epic material which supply that the first epic poet give they age as genius always do something which the age have never think of ask for which nevertheless when it be give the age take good hold of and find that after all this too it have want without know it but as society go on towards civilization the need for epic grow less and less and its preservation if not accidental be a act of conscious aesthetic admiration rather than of unconscious necessity it be preserve somehow however and after other kind of literature have arise as inevitably and naturally as epic and have become in they turn thing of less instant necessity than they be it be find that in the manner and purpose of epic poetry something be give which be not give elsewhere something of extraordinary value epic poetry would therefore be undertake again but now of course deliberately with several different kind of poetry to choose from a man would decide that he would like best to be a epic poet and he would set out in conscious determination on a epic poem the result good or bad of such a determination be call literary epic the poem of apollonius rhodius virgil lucan camoen tasso and milton be literary epic but such poetry as the _ odyssey _ the _ iliad _ _ beowulf _ the _ song of roland _ and the _ nibelungenly _ poetry which seem a immediate response to some general and instant need in its surround community -- such poetry be authentic epic a great deal have be make of this distinction it have almost be take to divide epic poetry into two species and as the name commonly give to the two suppose species suggest there be some notion that literary epic must be in a way inferior to authentic epic the superstition of antiquity have something to do with this but the presence of homer among the authentic epic have probably still more to do with it for homer be the poet who be usually choose to stand for authentic epic and by a facile association of idea the conspicuous characteristic of homer seem to be the mark of authentic epic as a species it be of course quite true that for sustained grandeur and splendor no poet can be put beside homer except dante and milton but it be also quite clear that in homer as in dante and milton such conspicuous characteristic be simply the mark of peculiar poetic genius if we leave homer out and consider poetic greatness only -lrb- the only important thing to consider -rrb- there be no authentic epic which can stand against _ paradise lose _ or the _ aeneid _ then there be the curious modern feeling -- which be sometimes but dress up by erroneous aesthetic theory -lrb- the worship of a quite national lyricism for instance -rrb- but which be really nothing but a sign of covert barbarism -- that lengthy poetic composition be somehow undesirable and homer be think to have have a better excuse for compose a long poem than milton but doubtless the real reason for the hard division of epic poetry into two class and for the presumed inferiority of literary to authentic lie in the application of that curiosity among false idea the belief in a folk-spirit this notion that such a thing as a folk-spirit can create art and that the art which it do create must be somehow better than other art be i suppose the offspring of democratic idea in politics the chief objection to it be that there never have be and never can be anything in actuality correspond to the folk-spirit which this notion suppose poetry be the work of poet not of people or community artistic creation can never be anything but the production of a individual mind we may if we like think that poetry would be more natural if it be compose by the folk as the folk and not by person peculiarly endowed and to think so be doubtless agreeable to the notion that the folk be more important than the individual but there be nothing gain by think in this way except a very illusory kind of pleasure since it be impossible that the folk should ever be a poet this indisputable axiom have be ignore more in theory about ballad -- about epic material -- than in theory about the epic themselves but the belief in a real folk-origin for ballad untenable though it be in a little examination have have a decide effect on the common opinion of the authentic epic in the first place a poem construct out of ballad compose somehow or other by the folk ought to be more natural than a work of deliberate art -- a literary epic that be to say these rousseau-ish notion will admire it for be further from civilization and nearer to the noble savage civilization be hold by some mysterious argument to be deficient in naturalness in the second place this belief have make it credible that the plain corruption of authentic epic by oral transmission or very limited transmission through script might be the sign of multiple authorship for if you believe that a whole folk can compose a ballad you may easily believe that a dozen poet can compose a epic but all this rest on simple ignore of the nature of poetic composition the folk-origin of ballad and the multiple authorship of epic be heresies worse than the futility of the baconian at any rate they be base on the same resolute omission and build on it a wilder fantasy they omit to consider what poetry be those who think bacon write _ hamlet _ and those who think several poet write the _ iliad _ can make out a deal of ingenious evidence for they doctrine but it be all useless because the first assumption in each case be unthinkable it be psychologically impossible that the mind of bacon should have produce _ hamlet _ but the impossibility be even more clamant when it come to suppose that several poet not in collaboration but in haphazard succession could produce a poem of vast sweeping unity and superbly consistent splendor of style so far as mere authorship go then we can not make any real difference between authentic and literary epic we can not say that while this be write by a individual genius that be the work of a community individual genius of whatever quality be responsible for both the folk however can not be rule out genius do the work but the folk be the condition in which genius do it and here we may find a genuine difference between literary and authentic not so much in the nature of the condition as in its closeness and insistence the kind of folk-spirit behind the poet be indeed different in the _ iliad _ and _ beowulf _ and the _ song of roland _ from what it be in milton and tasso and virgil but there be also as much difference here between the member of each class as between the two class themselves you can not read much of _ beowulf _ with homer in you mind without become conscious that the difference in individual genius be by no mean the whole difference both poet maintain a similar ideal in life but they maintain it within condition altogether unlike the folk-spirit behind _ beowulf _ be cloudy and tumultuous find grandeur in storm and gloom and mere mass -- in the misty _ lack _ of shape behind homer it be on the contrary radiant and however vehement always delight in measure find grandeur in brightness and clarity and shine outline so again we may very easily see how tasso 's poetry imply the italy of he time and milton 's the england of he time but where homer and beowulf together differ from tasso and milton be in the way the surround folk-spirit contain the poet 's mind it would be a very idle piece of work to choose between the potency of homer 's genius and of milton 's but it be clear that the immediate circumstance of the poet 's life press much more insistently on the _ iliad _ and the _ odyssey _ than on _ paradise lose _ it be the difference between the contract precise but vigorous tradition of a heroic age and the diffused eclectic complicated culture of a civilization and if it may be say that the insistence of racial circumstance in homer give he a greater intensity of cordial human inspiration it must also be say that the larger less exacting condition of milton 's mental life allow he art to go into greater scope and more subtle complexity of significance great epic poetry will always frankly accept the social condition within which it be compose but the condition contract and intensify the conduct of the poem or allow it to dilate and absorb larger matter accord as the narrow primitive torrent of man 's spirit broaden into the greater but slower volume of civilized life the change be neither desirable nor undesirable it be merely inevitable it mean that epic poetry have keep up with the development of human life it be because of all this that we have hear a good deal about the authentic epic get closer to its subject than literary epic it seem on the face of it very improbable that there should be any real difference here no great poetry of whatever kind be conceivable unless the subject have become integrate with the poet 's mind and mood milton be as close to he subject virgil to he as homer to achille or the saxon poet to beowulf what be really mean can be nothing but the greater insistence of racial tradition in the authentic epic the subject of the _ iliad _ be the fighting of hero with all its implication and consequence the subject of the _ odyssey _ be adventure and its opposite the longing for safety and home in _ beowulf _ it be kingship -- the ability to show man how to conquer the monstrous force of he world and so on such be the subject which a imperious racial tradition press on the early epic poet who delight to be so govern these be the matter which he people could understand of which they could easily perceive the significance for he then there could be no other matter than these or the like of these but it be not in such matter that a poet living in a time of less primitive and more expand consciousness would find the highest importance for a roman the chief matter for a epic poem would be roman civilization for a puritan it would be the relation of god and man when therefore we consider how close to he subject a epic poet be we must be careful to be quite clear what he subject be and if he have go beyond the immediate experience of primitive society we need not expect he to be as close as the early poet be to the fury of battle and the agony of wound and the desolation of widow or to the sensation of explore beyond the familiar region or to the marsh-fiend and fire-drake into which primitive imagination naturally translate the terrible unknown power of the world we need not in a word expect the literary epic to compete with the authentic epic for the fact be that the purpose of epic poetry and therefore the nature of its subject must continually develop it be quite true that the later epic take over to a very great extent the method and manners of the earlier poem just as architecture hand on the style of wooden structure to a age that build in stone and again impose the manners of stone construction on a age that build in concrete and steel but in the case of epic at any rate this be not merely the inertia of artistic convention with the development of epic intention and the subsequent choosing of theme larger and subtler than what common experience be wont to deal in a certain duplicity become inevitable the real intention of the _ aeneid _ and the real intention of _ paradise lose _ be not easily bring into vivid apprehension the natural thing to do then would be to use the familiar substance of early epic but to use it as a convenient and pleasant solvent for the novel intention it be what have be do in all the great literary epic but hasty criticism finding that where they resemble homer they seem not so close to they matter have take this as a pervading and unfortunate characteristic it have not perceive that what in homer be the main business of the epic have become in later epic a device have so altered it have naturally lose in significance but in the greatest instance of later epic that for which the device be use have be as profoundly absorb into the poet 's be as homer 's matter be into he be it may be note too that a corresponding change have also take place in the opposite direction as homer 's chief substance become a device in later epic so a device of homer 's become in later epic the chief substance homer 's supernatural machinery may be reckon as a device -- a device to heighten the general style and action of he poem the _ significance _ of homer must be find among he hero not among he god but with milton it have become necessary to entrust to the supernatural action the whole aim and purport of the poem on the whole then there be no reason why literary epic should not be as close to its subject as authentic epic there be every reason why both kind should be equally close but in testing whether they actually be equally close we have to remember that in the later epic it have become necessary to use the ostensible subject as a vehicle for the real subject and who with any active sympathy for poetry can say that milton feel he theme with less intensity than homer milton be not so close to he fight angel as homer be to he fight man but the war in heaven be a incident in milton 's figurative expression of something that have become altogether himself -- the mystery of individual existence in universal existence and the accompany mystery of sin of individual will inexplicably allow to tamper with the divinely universal will milton of course in closeness to he subject and in everything else stand as supreme above the other poet of literary epic as homer do above the poet of authentic epic but what be true of milton be true in less degree of the other if there be any good in they it be primarily because they have get very close to they subject : that be require not only for epic but for all poetry coleridge in a famous estimate put twenty year for the shortest period in which a epic could be compose and of this ten year be to be for preparation he mean that not less than ten year would do for the poet to fill all he be with the theme and nothing else will serve it be well know how milton brood over he subject how virgil linger over he how camoen carry the _ luisad _ round the world with he with what furious intensity tasso give himself to write _ jerusalem deliver _ we may suppose perhaps that the poet of authentic epic have a somewhat easier task there be no need for they to be long choosing and begin late the pressure of racial tradition would see that they choose the right sort of subject would see too that they live right in the heart of they subject for the poet of literary epic however it be he own consciousness that must select the kind of theme which will fulfil the epic intention for he own day it be he own determination and studious endurance that will draw the theme into the secret of he be if he be not capable of get close to he subject we should not for that reason call he work literary epic it would put he in the class of milton the most literary of all poet we must simply call he stuff bad epic there be plenty of it southey be the great instance southey would decide to write a epic about spain or indium or arabium or america next he would read up in several language about he propose subject that would take he perhaps a year then he would versify as much strange information as he could remember that might take a few month the result be deadly and because he be never anywhere near he subject it be for the same reason that the unspeakable labor of blackmore glover and wilkie and voltaire 's ridiculous _ henriade _ have go to pile up the rubbish-heap of literature so far suppose difference between authentic and literary epic have resolve themselves into little more than sign of development in epic intention the change have not be find to produce enough artistic difference between early and later epic to warrant anything like a division into two distinct species the epic whether literary or authentic be a single form of art but it be a form capable of adapt itself to the alter requirement of prevalent consciousness in addition however to difference in general conception there be certain mechanical difference which should be just notice the first epic be intend for recitation the literary epic be mean to be read it be more difficult to keep the attention of hearer than of reader this in itself would be enough to rule out theme remote from common experience suppose any such be to suggest themselves to the primitive epic poet perhaps indeed we should not be far wrong if we see a chief reason for the pressure of surround tradition on the early epic in this very fact that it be poetry mean for recitation traditional matter must be glorified since it would be easier to listen to the re-creation of familiar story than to quite new and unexpected thing the listener we must remember need poetry chiefly as the re-creation of tired hour traditional manner would be equally difficult to avoid for it be a tradition that plainly embody the requirement fix by experience of _ recite _ poetry those feature of it which make for tedium when it be read -- repetition stock epithet set phrase for give situation -- be the very thing best suit with they recur well-known syllable to fix the attention of listener more firmly or to stir it when it drows at the least they provide a sort of recognizable scaffolding for the event and it be remarkable how easily the progress of event may be miss when poetry be declaim indeed if the primitive epic poet could avoid some of the anxiety peculiar to the composition of literary epic he have other to make up for it he have to study closely the delicate science of hold auricular attention when once he have get it and probably he would have some difficulty in get it at all the really great poet challenge it like homer with some tremendous irresistible opening and in this respect the magnificent prelude to _ beowulf _ may almost be put beside homer but lesser poet have another way that prolixity at the beginning of many primitive epic they wordy deliberation in get under way be probably intentional the _ song of roland _ for instance begin with a long series of exceedingly dull stanza to a reader the preliminary of the story seem insufferably draw out but by the time the reciter have get through this unimportant dreariness no doubt he audience have settle down to listen the _ chanson d'antioche _ contain perhaps the most illuminating admission of this difficulty in the first chant the first section open : -lrb- 4 -rrb- seigneur faite silence et que tout bruit cesse si vous voulez entendre une glorieuse chanson aucun jongleur ne vous en dira une meilleure then some vaguely prelusive line but the audience be clearly not quite ready yet for the second section begin : baron écoutez-moi et cessez vos querelles je vous dirai une très-belle chanson and after some further prelude the section end : ici commence la chanson où il y a tant à apprendre the chanson do indeed make some show of begin in the third section but it still move with a cautious and prelusive air as if anxious not to launch out too soon and this be evidently prudent for when the fourth section open direct exhortation to the audience have again become necessary : maintenant seigneurs écoutez ce que dit l'écriture and once more in the fifth section : baron écoutez un excellent couplet in the sixth the jongleur be get desperate : seigneur pour l'amour de dieu faites silence écoutez-moi pour qu'en partant de ce monde vous entriez dans un meilleur but after this exclamation he have he way though the story proper be still a good way off perhaps not all of these hortatory stanza be commonly use any or all of they could certainly be omit without damage the poem but they be there to be use accord to the judgment of the jongleur and the temper of he audience and they presence in the poem be very suggestive of the special difficulty in the art of rhapsodic poetry but the gravest difficulty and perhaps the most important in poetry mean solely for recitation be the difficulty of achieve verbal beauty or rather of make verbal beauty tell vigorous but controlled imagination formative power insight into the significance of thing -- these be quality which a poet must eminently possess but these be quality which may also be eminently possess by man who can not claim the title of poet the real differentium of the poet be he command over the secret magic of word other may have as delighted a sense of this magic but it be only the poet who can master it and do what he like with it and next to the invention of speak itself the most important invention for the poet have be the invention of write and read for this have add immensely to the scope of he mastery over word no poet will ever take the write word as a substitute for the speak word he know that it be on the speak word and the speak word only that he art be found but he trust he reader to do as he himself do -- to receive written word always as the code of speak word to do so have wonderfully enlarged he technical opportunity for apprehension be quicker and finer through the eye than through the ear after the invention of read even poetry design primarily for declamation -lrb- like drama or lyric -rrb- have depths and subtlety of art which be not possible for the primitive poet accordingly we find that on the whole in comparison with literary epic the texture of authentic epic be flat and dull the story may be superb and its management may be superb but the word in which the story life do not come near the grandeur of milton or the exquisiteness of virgil or the deliciousness of tasso indeed if we be to say what be the real difference between _ beowulf _ and _ paradise lose _ we must simply say that _ beowulf _ be not such good poetry there be of course one tremendous exception homer be the one poet of authentic epic who have sufficient genius to make unfailingly nobly beautiful poetry within the strict and hard condition of purely auricular art compare homer 's ambrosial glory with the descent tap-water of hesiod compare he continuous burnished gleam of work metal with the sparse grain that lie in the sandy diction of all the authentic epic of the other nation and by all ancient account the other early greek epic would not fare much better in the comparison homer 's singularity in this respect be overwhelming but it be frequently forget and especially by those who think to help in the homeric question by compare he with other authentic epic suppose -lrb- we can only just suppose it -rrb- a case be make out for the growth rather than the individual authorship of some authentic epic other than homer it could never have any bearing on the question of homeric authorship because no early epic be comparable with the _ poetry _ of homer nothing indeed be comparable with the poetry of homer except poetry for whose individual authorship history unmistakably vouch so we can not say that homer be not as deliberate a craftsman in word as milton himself the scope of he craft be more restricted as he repetition and stock epithet show he be restrict by the fact that he compose for recitation and the auricular appreciation of diction be limit the nature of poetry obey in the main the nature of those for whom it be compose but this be just a case in which genius transcend technical scope the effect homer produce with he method be as great as any effect produce by later and more elaborate method after poetry begin to be read as well as hear but neither must we say that the other poet of authentic epic be not deliberate craftsman in word poet will always get as much beauty out of word as they can the fact that so often in the early epic a magnificent subject be tell on the whole in a lumpish and tedious diction be not to be explain by any contempt for careful art as though it be a thing unworthy of such heroic singer it be simply to be explain by lack of such genius as be capable of transcend the severe limitation of auricular poetry and we may well believe that only the rarest and most potent kind of genius could transcend such limitation in summary then we find certain conceptual difference and certain mechanical difference between authentic and literary epic but these be not such as to enable we to say that there be artistically any real difference between the two kind rather the difference exhibit the change we might expect in a art that have keep up with consciousness develop and civilization become more intricate literary epic be as close to its subject as authentic but as a general rule authentic epic in response to its surround need have a simple and concrete subject and the closeness of the poet to this be therefore more obvious than in literary epic which -lrb- again in response to surround need -rrb- have be drive to take for subject some great abstract idea and display this in a concrete but only ostensible subject then in craftsmanship the two kind of epic be equally deliberate equally concern with careful art but literary epic have be able to take such advantage of the habit of read that with the single exception of homer it have achieve a diction much more answerable to the greatness of epic matter than the authentic poem we may then in a general survey regard epic poetry as be in all age essentially the same kind of art fulfil always a similar though constantly develop intention whatever sort of society he live in whether he be surround by illiterate heroism or placid culture the epic poet have a definite function to perform we see he accept and with he genius transfigure the general circumstance of he time we see he symbolize in some appropriate form whatever sense of the significance of life he feel act as the accept unconscious metaphysic of he age to do this he take some great story which have be absorb into the prevail consciousness of he people as a rule though not quite invariably the story will be of thing which be or seem so far back in the past that anything may credibly happen in it so imagination have its freedom and so significance be display but quite invariably the material of the story will have a unmistakable air of actuality that be they come profoundly out of human experience whether they declare legendary heroism as in homer and virgil or myth as in _ beowulf _ and _ paradise lose _ or actual history as in lucan and camoen and tasso and he set out this story and its significance in poetry as lofty and as elaborate as he can compass that roughly be what we see the epic poet do whether they be literary or authentic and if this can be agree on we should now have come tolerably close to a definition of epic poetry footnote : -lrb- footnote 4 : from the version of the marquise de sainte-aulaire -rrb- iii the nature of epic rigid definition in literature be however dangerous at bottom it be what we feel not what we think that make we put certain poem together and apart from other and feeling can not be define but only related if we define a poem we say what we think about it and that may not sufficiently imply the essential thing the poem do for we hence the definition be liable either to be too strict or to admit work which do not properly satisfy the criterion of feel it seem probable that in the last resort classification in literature rest on that least tangible least definable matter style for style be the sign of the poem 's spirit and it be the spirit that we feel if we can get some notion of how those poem which we call epic agree with one another in style it be likely we shall be as close as may be to a definition of epic i use the word style of course in its largest sense -- manner of conception as well as manner of composition a easy way to define epic though not a very profitable way would be to say simply that a epic be a poem which produce feeling similar to those produce by _ paradise lose _ or the _ iliad _ _ beowulf _ or the _ song of roland _ indeed you might include all the epic of europe in this definition without lose you breath for the epic poet be the rarest kind of artist and while it be not a simple matter to say off-hand what it be that be common to all these poem there seem to be general acknowledgment that they be clearly separable from other kind of poetry and this although the word epic have be rather badly abused for instance _ the faery queene _ and _ la divina commedia _ have be call epic poem but i do not think that anyone could fail to admit on a little pressure that the experience of read _ the faery queene _ or _ la divina commedia _ be not in the least like the experience of read _ paradise lose _ or the _ iliad _ but as a poem may have lyrical quality without be a lyric so a poem may have epical quality without be a epic in all the poem which the world have agree to call epic there be a story tell and well tell but dante 's poem attempt no story at all and spenser 's though it attempt several do not tell they well -- it scarcely attempt to make the reader believe in they be much more concerned with the decoration and the implication of its fable than with the fable themselves what epic quality detach from epic proper do these poem possess then apart from the mere fact that they take up a great many page it be simply a question of they style -- the style of they conception and the style of they write the whole style of they imagination in fact they take we into a region in which nothing happen that be not deeply significant a dominant noticeably symbolic purpose preside over each poem mould it greatly and inform it throughout this take we some little way towards decide the nature of epic it must be a story and the story must be tell well and greatly and whether in the story itself or in the tell of it significance must be imply do that mean that the epic must be allegorical many have think so even homer have be accuse of construct allegory but this be only a crude way of emphasize the significance of epic and there be a vast deal of difference between a significant story and a allegorical story reality of substance be a thing on which epic poetry must always be able to rely not only because spenser do not tell he story very well but even more because they substance -lrb- not of course they meaning -rrb- be deliciously and deliberately unreal _ the faery queene _ be outside the strict sense of the word epic allegory require material ingeniously manipulate and fantastic what be more important it require material invent by the poet himself that be a long way from the solid reality of material which epic require not manipulation but imaginative transfiguration of material not invention but selection of exist material appropriate to he genius and complete absorption of it into he be that be how the epic poet work allegory be a beautiful way of inculcate and assert some special significance in life but epic have a severer task and a more impressive one it have not to say life in the world _ ought _ to mean this or that it have to show life unmistakably _ be _ significant it do not gloss or interpret the fact of life but re-create it and charge the fact itself with the poet 's own sense of ultimate value this will be less precise than the definite assertion of allegory but for that reason it will be more deeply feel the value will be emotional and spiritual rather than intellectual and they will be the poet 's own only because he have make they part of he be in he -lrb- though he probably do not know it -rrb- they will be representative of the best and most characteristic life of he time that do not mean that the epic poet 's image of life 's significance be of merely contemporary or transient importance no stage through which the general consciousness of man have go can ever be outgrow by man whatever happen afterwards do not displace it but include it we could not do without _ paradise lose _ nowadays but neither can we do without the _ iliad _ it would not perhaps be far from the truth if it be even say that the significance of _ paradise lose _ can not be properly understand unless the significance of the _ iliad _ be understand the prime material of the epic poet then must be real and not invent but when the story of the poem be safely concern with some reality he can of course graft on this as much appropriate invention as he please it will be one of he way of elaborate he main unifying purpose -- and to call it unifying be to assume that however brilliant he surround invention may be the purpose will always be firmly implicit in the central subject some of the early epic manage to do without any conspicuous add invention design to extend what the main subject intend but such nobly simple forthright narrative as _ beowulf _ and the _ song of roland _ would not do for a purpose slightly more subtle than what the maker of these ring poem have in mind the reality of the central subject be of course to be understand broadly it mean that the story must be found deep in the general experience of man a decisive campaign be not for the epic poet any more real than a legend full of human truth all that the name of caesar suggest be extremely important for mankind so be all that the name of satan suggest : satan in this sense be as real as caesar and as far as reality be concern there be nothing to choose between the christian take jerusalem and the greek take troy nor between odysseus sailing into fairyland and vasco da gama sailing round the world it be certainly possible that a poet might devise a story of such a kind that we could easily take it as something which might have be a real human experience but that be not enough for the epic poet he need something which everyone know about something which indisputably and admittedly _ have be _ a human experience and even grendel the fiend of the marsh be we can clearly see for the poet of _ beowulf _ a figure profoundly and generally accept as not only true but real what indeed can be more real for poetry than a devour fiend which live in pestilent fen and the reason why epic poetry so imperiously demand reality of subject be clear it be because such poetry have symbolically to re-create the actual fact and the actual particulars of human existence in term of a general significance -- the reader must feel that life itself have submit to plastic imagination no fiction will ever have the air so necessary for this epic symbolism not merely of represent but of unmistakably _ be _ human experience this might suggest that history would be the thing for a epic poet and so it would be if history be superior to legend in poetic reality but simply as substance there be nothing to choose between they while history have the obvious disadvantage of be commonly too strict in the manner of its event to allow of creative freedom its detail will probably be so well know that any modification of they will draw more attention to discrepancy with the record than to achievement thereby of poetic purpose and yet modification or at least suppression and exaggeration of the detail of history will certainly be necessary not to declare what happen and the result of what happen be the object of a epic but to accept all this as the mere material in which a single artistic purpose a unique vital symbolism may be shape and if legend after pass for innumerable year through popular imagination still require to be shape at the hand of the epic poet how much more must the crude event of history require this for it be not in event as they happen however notably that man may see symbol of vital destiny but in event as they be transform by plastic imagination yet it have be possible to use history as the material of great epic poetry camoen and tasso do this -- the chief subject of the _ lusiad _ be even contemporary history but evidently success in these case be due to the exceptional and fortunate fact that the fix notoriety of history be combine with a strange and mysterious geography the remoteness and one might say the romantic possibility of the place into which camoen and tasso be lead by they theme enable imagination to deal pretty freely with history but in a little more than ten year after camoen glorified portugal in a historical epic don alonso de ercilla try to do the same for spain he put he action far enough from home : the spaniard be conquer chili but the world have grow smaller and more familiar in the interval : the astonishing thing that could easily happen in the sea of madagascar can not now conveniently happen in chili the _ araucana _ be versified history not epic that be to say the action have no deeper significance than any other actual warfare it have not be and could not have be shape to any symbolic purpose long before tasso and camoen and ercilla two scotchman have attempt to put patriotism into epic form barbor have write he _ bruce _ and blind harry he _ wallace _ but what with the nearness of they event and what with the rusticity of they author these tolerable amble poem be quite unable to get the better of the hardness of history probably the boldest attempt to make epic of well-known documented history be lucan 's _ pharsalium _ it be a brilliant performance and a deliberate effort to carry on the development of epic at the very least it have enrich the thought of humanity with some imperishable line but it be true what the great critic say of it : the _ pharsalium _ partake more of the nature of oratory than of poetry it mean that lucan in choose history choose something which he have to declaim about something which at best he could imaginatively realize but not something which he could imaginatively re-create it be quite different with poem like the _ song of roland _ they be compose in or be draw immediately out of a heroic age a age that be to say when the idea of history have not arise when anything that happen turn inevitably and in a surprisingly short time into legend thus a unimportant probably unpunished attack by basque mountaineer on the emperor 's rear-guard have become in the _ song of roland _ a great infamy of saracenic treachery which must be greatly avenge such in a broad description be the nature of epic poetry to define it with any narrower nicety would probably be rash we have not be discover what a epic poem ought to be but roughly examine what similarity of quality there be in all those poem which we feel strictly attend to the emotional experience of read they can be class together and for convenience term epic but it be not much good have a name for this species of poetry if it be give as well to poem of quite a different nature it be not much good agree to call by the name of epic such poem as the _ iliad _ and the _ odyssey _ _ beowulf _ and the _ song of roland _ _ paradise lose _ and _ gerusalemme libera _ if epic be also to be the title for _ the faery queene _ and _ la divina commedia _ _ the idyll of the king _ and _ the ring and the book _ but i believe most of the importance in the meaning of the word epic when it be reasonably use will be find in what be write above apart from the specific form of epic it share much of its ultimate intention with the greatest kind of drama -lrb- though not with all drama -rrb- and just as drama whatever grandeur of purpose it may attempt must be a good play so epic must be a good story it will tell its tale both largely and intensely and the diction will be carry on the volume of a powerful flow metre to distinguish however between merely narrative poetry and poetry which go beyond be mere narrative into the being of epic must often be leave to feeling which can scarcely be precisely analyze a curious instance of the difficulty in exactly define epic -lrb- but not in exactly decide what be epic -rrb- may be find in the work of william morris morri leave two long narrative poem _ the life and death of jason _ and _ the story of sigurd the volsung _ i do not think anyone need hesitate to put _ sigurd _ among the epic but i do not think anyone who will scrupulously compare the experience of read _ jason _ with the experience of read _ sigurd _ can help agree that _ jason _ should be keep out of the epic there be nothing to choose between the subject of the two poem for a englishman greek mythology mean as much as the mythology of the north and i should say that the bright exact diction and the modest metre of _ jason _ be more interesting and attractive than the diction often monotonous and vague and the metre often clumsily vehement of _ sigurd _ yet for all that it be the style of _ sigurd _ that put it with the epic and apart from _ jason _ for style go beyond metre and diction beyond execution into conception the whole imagination of _ sigurd _ be incomparably larger than that of _ jason _ in _ sigurd _ you feel that the fashion grasp of imagination have not only seize on the show of thing and not only on the physical or moral unity of thing but have somehow bring into the midst of all this and have knead into the texture of it all something of the ultimate and metaphysical significance of life you scarcely feel that in _ jason _ yes epic poetry must be a affair of evident largeness it be well say that the praise of a epic poem be to feign a person exceed nature feign here mean to imagine and imagine do not mean to invent but like most of the numerous epigram that have be make about epic poetry the remark do not describe the nature of epic but rather one of the conspicuous sign that that nature be fulfil itself a poem which be in some sort a summation for its time of the value of life will inevitably concern itself with at least one figure and probably with several in whom the whole virtue and perhaps also the whole failure of live seem superhumanly concentrate a story weight with the epic purpose could not proceed at all unless it be express in person big enough to support it the subject then as the epic poet use it will obviously be a important one whether apart from the way the poet use it the subject ought to be a important one would not start a very profitable discussion homer have be praise for make in the _ iliad _ a first-rate poem out of a second-rate subject it be a neat say but it seem unlikely that anything really second-rate should turn into first-rate epic i imagine homer would have be considerably surprise if anyone have tell he that the vast train of tragic event cause by the gross and insupportable insult put by agamemnon the mean mind in authority on achille the typical hero -- that this noble and profoundly human theme be a second-rate subject at any rate the subject must be of capital importance in its treatment it must symbolize -- not as a particular and separable assertion but at large and generally -- some great aspect of vital destiny without lose the air of record some accept reality of human experience and without fail to be a good story and the pressure of high purpose will inform diction and metre as far at least as the poet 's verbal art will let it the usual attempt at stricter definition of epic than anything this chapter contain be either in spite of what they try for so vague that they would admit almost any long stretch of narrative poetry or else they be base on the accident or device of epic art and in that case they be apt to exclude work which be essentially epic because something inessential be lack it have for instance be seriously debate whether a epic should not contain a catalogue of hero other thing which epic have be require to contain besides much that be not worth mention -lrb- 5 -rrb- be a descent into hell and some supernatural machinery both of these be obviously device for enlarge the scope of the action the notion of a visit to the ghost have fascinate many poet and dante elaborate this homeric device into the main scheme of the greatest of non-epical poem as milton elaborate the other homeric device into the main scheme of the greatest of literary epic but a visit to the ghost be of course like game or single combat or a set debate merely a incident which may or may not be useful supernatural machinery however be worth some short discussion here though it must be allude to further in the sequel the first and obvious thing to remark be that a unquestionably epic effect can be give without any supernatural machinery at all the poet of _ beowulf _ have no need of it for instance a christian redactor have work over the poem with more piety than skill he can always be detect and he clumsy little interjection have nothing to do with the general tenor of the poem the human world end off as it be precipitously and beyond there be a endless impracticable abyss in which dwell the secret governance of thing a unknowable and implacable fate -- wyrd -- neither malign nor benevolent but simply inscrutable the peculiar cast of noble and desolate courage which this bleak conception give to the poem be perhaps unique among the epic but very few epic poet have venture to do without supernatural machinery of some sort and it be plain that it must greatly assist the epic purpose to surround the action with immortal who be not only interested spectator of the event but be deeply implicate in it nothing could more certainly liberate or at least more appropriately decorate the significant force of the subject we may leave milton out for there can be no question about _ paradise lose _ here the significance of the subject be not only liberate by it entirely exist in the supernatural machinery but with the other epic poet we should certainly expect they to ask we for we belief in they immortal that however be just what they seem curiously careless of do the immortal be there they be the occasion of splendid poetry they do what they be intend to do -- they declare namely by they speech and they action the importance to the world of what be go on in the poem only -- there be no obligation to believe in they and will not that mean no obligation to believe in they concern for the subject and all that that imply homer begin this paradox think of that lovely and exquisitely mischievous passage in the _ iliad _ call _ the cheating of zeus _ the salvationist school of commentator call this a interpolation but the spirit of it be implicit throughout the whole of homer 's deal with the god whenever at least he deal with they at length and not merely incidentally not to accept that spirit be not to accept homer the manner of describe the olympian family at the end of the first book be quite continuous throughout and simply reach its climax in the fourteenth book nobody ever believe in homer 's god as he must believe in hektor and achille -lrb- puritan like xenophane be annoy not with the god for be as homer describe they but with homer for describe they as he do -rrb- virgil be more decorous but can we imagine virgil pray or anybody pray to the god of the _ aeneid _ the supernatural machinery of camoen and tasso be frankly absurd they be not only careless of credibility but of sanity lucan try to do without god but he witchcraft engage belief even more faintly than the mingled paganism and christianity of camoen and merely show how strongly the most rationalistic of epic poet feel the value of some imaginary relaxation in the limit of human existence be it then only as such a relaxation that supernatural machinery be valuable or only as a superlative kind of ornament it be surely more than that in spite of the fact that we be not seriously ask to believe in it it do beautifully and strikingly crystallize the poet 's determination to show we thing that go past the reach of common knowledge but by put it whether instinctively or deliberately on a lower plane of credibility than the main action the poet obey he deepest and gravest necessity : the necessity of keep he poem emphatically a affair of recognizable _ human _ event it be of man and man 's purpose in the world that the epic poet have to sing not of the purpose of god the god must only illustrate man 's destiny and they must be keep within the bound of beautiful illustration but it require a finer genius than most epic poet have possess to keep supernatural machinery just sufficiently fanciful without miss its function perhaps only homer and virgil have do that perfectly milton 's revolutionary development mark a crisis in the general process of epic so important that it can only be discuss when that process be consider in the follow chapter as a whole footnote : -lrb- footnote 5 : such as simile and episode it be as if a man be to say the essential thing about a bridge be that it should be paint -rrb- iv the epic series by the general process of epic poetry i mean the way this form of art have constantly respond to the profound need of the society in which it be make but the development of human society do not go straight forward and the epic process will therefore be a recur process the series a recur series -- though not in exact repetition thus the homeric poem the _ argonautica _ the _ aeneid _ the _ pharsalium _ and the later latin epic form one series : the _ aeneid _ would be the climax of the series which thence decline be it not that the whole originate with the incomparable genius of homer -- a fact which make it seem to decline from start to finish then the process begin again and again fulfil itself in the series which go from _ beowulf _ the _ song of roland _ and the _ nibelungenly _ through camoen and tasso up to milton and in this case milton be plainly the climax there be nothing like _ paradise lose _ in the precede poem and epic poetry have do nothing since but decline from that tower glory but it will be convenient not to make too much of chronology in a general account of epic development it have already appear that the duty of all authentic epic be broadly the same and the poem of this kind though two thousand year may separate they occurrence may be properly bring together as variety of one sub-species literary epic differ much more in the specific purpose of its art as civilized society differ much more than heroic and also as the looser _ milieu _ of a civilization allow a less strictly traditional exercise of personal genius than a heroic age still it do not require any manipulation to combine the literary epic from both series into a single process indeed if we take homer virgil and milton as the outstanding event in the whole progress of epic poetry and group the less important poem appropriately round these three name we shall not be far from the _ ideal truth _ of epic development we might say then that homer begin the whole business of epic imperishably fix its type and in a way that can never be question declare its artistic purpose virgil perfect the type and milton perfect the purpose three such poet be not heaven know sum up in a phrase i mean merely to indicate how they be related one to another in the general scheme of epic poetry for discriminate they merit decide they comparative eminence i have no inclination and fortunately it do not come within the requirement of this essay indeed i think the reader will easily excuse I if i touch very slightly on the poetic manner in the common and narrow sense of the poet whom i shall have to mention since these quality have be so often and sometimes so admirably deal with it be at the broader aspect of artistic purpose that i wish to look from homer say goethe i learn every day more clearly that in we life here above ground we have properly speak to enact hell it be rather a startling sentence at first that poetry which for we in thoreau 's excellent word lie in the east of literature scarcely suggest in the usual opinion of it hell we be tempt to think of homer as the most fortunate of poet it seem as if he have but to open he mouth and speak to create divine poetry and it do not lessen we sense of he good fortune when on look a little closer we see that this be really the result of a unerring and unfailing art a extraordinarily skilful technique he have it entirely at he command and he exercise it in a language in which though it may be singularly artificial and conventional we can still feel the wonder of its sensuous beauty and the splendor of its expressive power it be a language that seem alive with eagerness to respond to imagination open homer anywhere and the casual grandeur of he untranslatable language appear such line as : amphi de naees smerdaleon konabaesan ausanton hup ' achaion -lrb- 6 -rrb- that you might say be homer at he ease when he exert himself you get a miracle like : su den strophalingus koniae keiso mega megalosti lelasmeno hipposunaon -lrb- 7 -rrb- it seem the art of one who walk through the world of thing endow with the sens of a god and able with that perfection of effort that look as if it be effortless to fashion he experience into incorruptible song whether it be the dance of fly round a byre at milking-time or a forest-fire on the mountain at night the shape and clamor of wave break on the beach in a storm be as irresistibly record by homer as the gleaming flower which earth put forth to be the bed of zeus and hera in gargaro when a golden cloud be they coverlet and sleep sit on a pine tree near by in the likeness of a murmur night-jar it be a art so balanced that when it tell we with no special emphasis how the trojan come on with a din like the clangor of a flock of crane but the achaian come on in silence the temper of the two host be discriminate for the whole poem or in the supreme instance when it tell we how the old man look at helen and say no wonder the young man fight for she then helen 's beauty must be accept by the faith of all the world the particulars of such poetry could be enumerate for page and this be the poetry which be fill more than any other literature in the _ iliad _ with the nobility of man and woman in the _ odyssey _ with the light of natural magic and think of those god of homer 's he be the one poet who have be able to make the dark terror of religion beautiful harmless and quietly entertaining it be easy to read this poetry and simply _ enjoy _ it it be easy to say the man whose spirit hold this poetry must have be divinely happy but this be the poetry whence goethe learn that the function of man be to enact hell goethe be profoundly right though possibly he put it in a way to which homer himself might have demur for the phrase inevitably have its point in the word hell homer we may suppose would have prefer the point to come in the word enact in any case the detail of christian eschatology must not engage we much in interpret goethe 's epigram there be truth in it not simply because the two poem take place in a theater of calamity not simply for instance because of the beloved hektor 's terrible agony of death and the woe of andromache and priam such thing be the partial incidental expression of the whole artistic purpose still less be it because of a strain of latent savagery in at any rate the _ iliad _ as when the sage and reverend nestor urge that not one of the greek should go home until he have lie with the wife of a slaughter trojan or as in the tremendous word of the oath : whoever first offend against this oath may they brain be pour out on the ground like this wine they own and they child 's and may they wife be make subject to stranger all that be one of the accidental quality of homer but the force of the word enact in goethe 's epigram will certainly come home to we when we think of those famous speech in which courage be unforgettably declare -- such speech as that of sarpedon to glauko or of glauko to diomede or of hektor at he parting with andromache what these speech mean however in the whole artistic purpose of homer will assuredly be miss if they be _ detach _ for consideration especially we shall miss the deep significance of the fact that in all of these speech the substantial thought fall as it be into two clause courage be in the one clause a deliberate face of death but something equally important be in the other be it honor the homeric hero make a great deal of honor but it be honor pay to himself live what he want above everything be to be admire -- always to be the best that be what true heroism be but he be to go where he know death will strike at he and he do not make much of honor after death for he the meanest man living be better than a dead hero death end everything as far as he be concerned honor and all he courage look for no reward hereafter no but _ since _ ten thousand fate of death be always instant round we _ since _ the generation of man be of no more account than leaf of a tree _ since _ troy and all its people will soon be destroy -- he will stand in death 's way sarpedon emphasize this with its converse : there would be no need of daring and fight he say of man-ennobling battle if we could be for ever ageless and deathless that be the heroic age any other would say if only we could not be kill how pleasant to run what might have be risk for the hero that would simply not be worth while do he find they pleasant then just because they be risky not quite that again be to detach part of the meaning from the whole if anywhere we shall perhaps find the whole meaning of homer most clearly indicate in such word as those give -lrb- without any enforcement -rrb- to achille and theti near the beginning of the _ iliad _ as if to sound the pitch of homer 's poetry : mêter hepus m heteke ge minynthadion per heonta timên per moi hophellen olympios engyalixai zeus hypsibremetês -lrb- 8 -rrb- \* \* \* \* \* timêson moi yion hos hôkymorôtatos hallon heplet ' -lrb- 9 -rrb- minunthadion -- hôkymorôtatos : those be the imporportant word key-word they might be call if we really understand these line if we see in they what it be that agamemnon 's insult have deprive achille of -- the sign and acknowledgment of he fellow ' admiration while he be still live among they the one thing which make a hero 's life worth living which enable he to enact he hell -- we shall scarcely complain that the _ iliad _ be compose on a second-rate subject the significance of the poem be not in the incident surround the achillei the whole significance be centre in the wrath of achille and thence make to impregnate every part life be short we must make the best of it how trite that sound but it be not trite at all really it seem difficult sometimes to believe that there be a time when sentiment now become habitual sentiment that imply not only the original imperative of conduct but the original metaphysic of living be by no means altogether habitual it be difficult to imagine backwards into the time when self-consciousness be still so fresh from its emergence out of the mere tribal consciousness of savagery that it must not only accept the fact but first intensely _ realize _ that man be hôkymorôtatos -- a thing of swiftest doom and it be for man who be able and force to do that that the _ iliad _ and the _ odyssey _ and the other early epic be compose but life be not only short it be in itself _ valueless _ as the generation of leaf so be the generation of man the life of man matter to nobody but himself it happen incidentally in universal destiny but beyond just happen it have no function no function of course except for man himself if man be to find any value in life it be he himself that must create the value for the sense of the ultimate uselessness of life of the blankness of imperturbable darkness that surround it goethe 's word hell be not too shocking but no one have properly live who have not feel this hell and we may easily believe that in a heroic age the intensity of this feeling be the secret of the intensity of live for where will the primitive instinct of man where will the hero find the chance of create a value for life in danger and in the courage that welcome danger that not only evaluate life it derive the value from the very fact that force man to create value -- the fact of he swift and instant doom -- hôkymorôtatos once more it make this dreadful fact _ enjoyable _ and so with courage as the value of life and man thence delightedly accept whatever can be make of he passage the doom of life be not simply suffer man enact he own life he have master it we need not say that this be the lesson of homer and all this barely state be a very different matter from what it be when it be poetically symbolize in the vast and shapely substance of the _ iliad _ and the _ odyssey _ it be quite possible of course to appreciate pleasantly and externally the _ iliad _ with its pressure of throng life and its daring unity and the _ odyssey _ with its serener life and its superb construction though much more sectional unity but we do not appreciate what homer do for he time and be still do for all the world we do not appreciate the spirit of he music unless we see the warfare and the adventure as symbol of the primary courage of life and there be more in those word than seem when they be baldly write and it be not he moral but homer 's art that do that for we and what homer 's art do supremely the other early epic do in they way too they way be not to be compare with homer 's way they be very much nearer than he be to the mere epic material -- to the moderate accomplishment of the primitive ballad apart from they greatness and often successful greatness of intention perhaps the only one that have a answerable greatness in the detail of its technique be _ beowulf _ that be not on account of its kenning -- the strange device by which early popular poetry -lrb- hesiod be another instance -rrb- try to liberate and master the magic of word a good deal have be make of these kenning but it do not take we far towards great poetry to have the sea call whale-road or swan-road or gannet 's - bath though we be get nearer to it when the sun be call candle of the firmament or heaven 's gem on the whole the poem be compose in a elaborate ambitious diction which be not properly govern alliteration prove a somewhat dangerous principle it seem mainly responsible for the way the poet make he sentence by pile up clause like shoot a load of stone out of a cart you can not always make out exactly what he mean and it be doubtful whether he always have a clearly-thought meaning most of the subsidiary matter be foist in with monstrous clumsiness yet _ beowulf _ have what we do not find out of homer in the other early epic it have occasionally a unforgettable grandeur of phrasing and it have other and perhaps deeper poetic quality when the warrior be wait in the haunt hall for the come of the marsh-fiend grendel they fall into untroubled sleep and the poet add with homeric restraint : not one of they think that he should thence be ever seek he loved home again he people or free city where he be nurture the opening be magnificent one of the noblest thing that have be do in language there be some wonderful grim landscape in the poem towards the middle there be a great speech on deterioration through prosperity a piece of sustained intensity that read like a aeschylean chorus and there be some admirable fighting especially the fight with grendel in the hall and with grendel 's mother under the water while beowulf 's companion anxiously watch the troubled surface of the mere the fact that the action of the poem be chiefly make of single combat with supernatural creature and that there be not tapestry figure with radiant god draw between the life of man and the ultimate darkness give a peculiar and notable character to the way beowulf symbolize the primary courage of life one would like to think with some enthusiast that this great poem compose in a language totally unintelligible to the huge majority of englishman -- further from english than latin be from italian -- and perhaps not even compose in england certainly not concerned either with england or englishman might nevertheless be call a english epic but of course the early epic do not any of they merely repeat the significance of homer in another form they might do that if poetry have to inculcate a moral as some have suppose but however nicely we may analyze it we shall never find in poetry a significance which be really detachable and expressible in another way the significance _ be _ the poetry what _ beowulf _ or the _ iliad _ or the _ odyssey _ mean be simply what it be in its whole nature we can but roughly indicate it and as poetry be never the same so its significance be never quite the same courage as the first necessary value of life be most naively and simply express perhaps in the _ poem of the cid _ but even here the expression be as in all art unique and chiefly because it be contrived through solidly imagine character there be splendid characterization too in the _ song of roland _ together with a fine sense of poetic form not fine enough however to avoid a prodigious deal of conventional gag the battle be lavish but always exciting and in at least that section which describe how the die oliver blind by weariness and wound mistake roland for a pagan and feebly smite he with he sword there be real and piercing pathos but for all he sense of character the poet have very little discretion in he admiration of he hero christianity in these two poem have less effect than one might think the conspicuous value of life be still the original value courage but elaboration and refinement of this begin to appear especially in the _ song of roland _ as passionately conscious patriotism and loyalty the chief contribution of the _ nibelungenly _ to the main process of epic poetry be _ plot _ in narrative a contribution that be to the manner rather than to the content of epic symbolism there be something that can be call plot in homer but with he as in all other early epic it be of no great account compare with the straightforward link of incident into a direct chain of narrative the story of the _ nibelungenly _ however be not a chain but a web event and the influence of character be weave closely and intricately together into one tragic pattern and this require not only characterization but also the add to the character of persistent and dominant motive epic poetry exhibit life in some great symbolic attitude it can not strictly be say to symbolize life itself but always some manner of life but life as courage -- the turning of the dark hard condition of life into something which can be exult in -- this which be the deep significance of the art of the first epic be the absolutely necessary foundation for any subsequent valuation of life man can achieve nothing until he have first achieve courage and this much more than any inheritance of manner be what make all the writer of deliberate or literary epic imply the existence of homer if homer have not do he work they could not have do theirs but literary epic be as necessary as homer we can not go on with courage as the solitary valuation of life we must have the foundation but we must also have the superstructure speak comparatively it may be say that the function of homeric epic have be to create imperishable symbolism for the actual courageous consciousness of life but the duty of literary epic have be to develop this function answerably to the development of life itself into symbolism of some conscious _ idea _ of life -- something at once more formalize and more subtilize than the primary virtue of courage the greek however be too much overshadow by the greatness of homer to do much towards this the _ argonautica _ the half-hearted epic of apollonius rhodius be the only attempt that need concern we it be not a poem that can be read straight through it be only enjoyable in moment -- moment of charming minute observation like the description of a sunbeam throw quiver on the wall from a basin of water which have just be pour out line not only charming in themselves but finely use as a simile for medea 's agitate heart or moment of romantic fantasy as when the argonaut see the eagle fly towards prometheus and then hear the titan 's agonized cry but it be not in such passage that what apollonius do for epic abide a great deal of he third book be a real contribution to the main process to epic content as well as to epic manner to the manner of epic he add analytic psychology no one will ever imagine character more deeply or more firmly than homer do in say achille but apollonius be the man who show how epic as well as drama may use the nice minutiae of psychological imagination through virgil this contribution to epic manner have pervade subsequent literature apollonius too in he fumble way as though he do not quite know what he be do have yet do something very important for the development of epic significance love have be nothing but a subordinate incident almost one might say a ornament in the early epic in apollonius though work through a deal of gross and lumbering mythological machinery love become for the first time one of the primary value of life the love of jason and medea be the vital symbolism of the _ argonautica _ but it be virgil who really begin the development of epic art he take over from apollonius love as part of the epic symbolism of life and delicate psychology as part of the epic method and like apollonius he use these novelty chiefly in the person of a heroine but in virgil they belong to a incomparably greater art and it be through virgil that they have become necessity of the epic tradition more than this however be require of he the epic poet collaborate with the spirit of he time in the composition of he work that be if he be successful the time may refuse to work with he but he may not refuse to work with he time virgil not only imply he often clearly state the original epic value of life the homeric value as in the famous : stat sua cuique die breve et inreparabile tempus omnibus est vita : sed famam extendere facti hoc virtutis opus -lrb- 10 -rrb- but to write a poem chiefly to symbolize this simple heroic metaphysic would scarcely have do for virgil it would certainly not have do for he time it be eminently a time of social organization one might perhaps say of social consciousness after syllum and marius and caesar life as a affair of sheer individualism would not very strongly appeal to a thoughtful roman accordingly as have so often be remark the _ aeneid _ celebrate the roman empire a political idea do not seem a very likely subject for a kind of poetry which must declare greatly the fundamental of live not even when it be a political idea unequalled in the world the idea of the roman empire have virgil be a _ good roman _ the _ aeneid _ might have be what no doubt augustus and rome generally desire a political epic but virgil be not a good roman there be something in he that be not roman at all it be this strange incalculable element in he that seem for ever make he accomplish something he have not think of it be surely this that make he unintentionally it may be use the idea of the roman empire as a vehicle for a much profounder valuation of life we must remember here the virgil of the fourth eclogue -- that extraordinary impassioned poem in which he dream of man attain to some perfection of live it be still this virgil though saddened and resign who write the _ aeneid _ man create he own destiny man however weary with the long task of resistance achieve some conscious community of aspiration and dream of the perfection of himself : the poet whose lovely and noble art make we a great symbol of _ that _ be assuredly carry on the work of homer this be the development in epic intention require to make epic poetry answer to the widen need of civilization but even more important in the whole process of epic than what virgil 's art do be the way it do it and this in spite of the fact which everyone have notice that virgil do not compare with homer as a poet of seafaring and warfaring he be not indeed very interested in either and it be unfortunate that in manage the story of aenea -lrb- in itself a excellent medium for he symbolic purpose -rrb- he feel himself compel to try for some likeness to the _ odyssey _ and the _ iliad _ -- to do by art marry to study what the poet of the _ odyssey _ and the _ iliad _ have do by art marry to intuitive experience but he failure in this do not matter much in comparison with he technical success otherwise virgil show how poetry may be make deliberately adequate to the epic purpose that do not mean that virgil be more artistic than homer homer 's redundance wholesale repetition of line and stock epithet can not be altogether dismiss as fault they be characteristic of a wonderfully accomplish and efficient technique but epic poetry can not be write as homer compose it whereas it must be write something as virgil write it yes if epic poetry be to be _ write _ virgil must show how that be to be do the superb virgilian economy be the thing for a epic poet now the concision the scrupulousness the loading of every word with something appreciable of the whole significance after the _ aeneid _ the epic style must be of this fashion : ibant ovscurus solum sub nocte per umbram perque domo ditis vacua et inania regna : quale per incertam lunam sub luce maligna est iter in silvi ubus caelum condidit umbra jupiter et rebus nox abstulit atra colorem -lrb- 11 -rrb- lucan be much more of a roman than virgil and the _ pharsalium _ so far as it be not a historical epic be a political one the idea of political liberty be at the bottom of it that be not a unworthy theme and lucan evidently feel the necessity for development in epic but he make the mistake characteristically roman of think history more real than legend and try to lead epic in this direction supernatural machinery would inevitably go too that perhaps be fortunate for it enable lucan safely to introduce one of he great and memorable line : jupiter est quodcunque vide quodcunque moveri -lrb- 12 -rrb- which would certainly explode any supernatural machinery that could be invent the _ pharsalium _ could not be anything more than a interesting but unsuccessful attempt it be not on these line that epic poetry be to develop lucan die at a age when most poet have do nothing very remarkable that he already have achieve a poem like the _ pharsalium _ would make we think he might have go to incredible height be it not that the mistake of the _ pharsalium _ seem to belong incurably to he temperament lucan 's determine stoicism may philosophically be more consistent than the dubious stoicism of virgil but virgil know that in epic supernatural imagination be better than consistency it be a important step when he make jupiter though a personal god a power to which no limit be assign when he also make the other divinity but shadow or at most function of jupiter this answer to he conviction that spirit universally and singly pervade matter but what be more it answer to the need of epic development when we come to tasso and camoen we seem to have go backward in this respect we seem to come upon poetry in which supernatural machinery be in a state of chronic insubordination but that too be perhaps necessary in comparison with the _ aeneid gerusalemme libera _ and _ os lusiada _ lack intellectual control and spiritual depth but in comparison with the roman the two modern poem thrill with a new passion of life a new wine of life heady as it seem with new significance -- a significance as yet only feel not understand both tasso and camoen clearly join on to the main epic tradition : tasso derive chiefly from the _ aeneid _ and the _ iliad _ camoen from the _ aeneid _ and the _ odyssey _ tasso be perhaps more virgilian than camoen the plastic power of he imagination be more assure but the advantage camoen have over tasso seem to repeat the advantage homer have over virgil the ostensible subject of the _ lusiad _ glow with the truth of experience but the real subject be behind these splendid voyaging just as the real subject of tasso be behind the battle of christian and saracen and in both poet the inmost theme be broadly the same it be the consciousness of modern europe _ jerusalem deliver _ and the _ lusiad _ be drench with the spirit of the renaissance and that be chiefly responsible for they lovely poetry but they reach out towards the new europe that be then just begin europe make common cause against the people that be not europe europe carry she domination round the world -- be that what tasso and camoen ultimately mean it would be too hard and too narrow a matter by itself to make these poem what they be no it be not the action of europe but the spirit of european consciousness that give tasso and camoen they deepest inspiration but what european consciousness really be these poet rather vaguely suggest than master into clear and irresistible expression into the supreme symbolism of perfectly adequate art they still take european consciousness as a affair of geography and race rather than simply as a triumphant stage in the general progress of man 's knowledge of himself they time impose a duty on they that they clearly understand but they do not clearly understand what the duty be partly no doubt because they be both strongly influence by mediaeval religion and so it be atmosphere in tasso and camoen that count much more than substance both poet seem perpetually thrill by something they can not express -- the _ non so che _ of tasso and what chiefly give this sense of quiver uncertain significance to they poetry be the increase of freedom and decrease of control in the supernatural supernaturalism be emphasize because they instinctively feel that this be the means epic poetry must use to accomplish its new duty it be disorderly because they do not quite know what use these duty require tasso and camoen for all the splendor and loveliness of they work leave epic poetry as it be consciously dissatisfy -- know that its future must achieve some significance larger and deeper than anything it have yet do and know that this must be do somehow through imagine supernaturalism it wait nearly a hundred year for the poet who understand exactly what be to be do and exactly how to do it in _ paradise lose _ the development of epic poetry culminate as far as it have yet go the essential inspiration of the poem imply a particular sense of human existence which have not yet definitely appear in the epic series but which the process of life in europe make it absolutely necessary that epic poetry should symbolize in milton the poet arise who be supremely adequate to the greatest task lay on epic poetry since its beginning with homer milton 's task be perhaps even more exacting than that original one he work be not the greatest of heroic poem only because it be not the first the epigram might just as reasonably have be the other way round but nothing would be more unprofitable than a discussion in which homer and milton compete for supremacy of genius we business here be quite otherwise with the partial exception of tasso and camoen all epic poetry before milton be some symbolism of man 's sense of he own will it be simply this in homer and the succeed poet develop this intention but remain well within it not even virgil with he metaphysic of individual merge into social will -- not even virgil go outside it in fact it be a sort of _ monism _ of consciousness that inspire all pre-miltonic epic but in milton it have become a _ dualism _ before he the primary impulse of epic be a impassioned sense of man 's nature _ be contain _ -- by he destiny : _ he _ only because he be in it and belong to it as we say _ my _ country with milton this have necessarily become not only a sense of man 's rigorously contain nature but equally a sense of that which contain man -- in fact simultaneously a sense of individual will and of universal necessity the single sense of these two irreconcilable be what milton 's poetry have to symbolize could they be reconcile the two element in man 's modern consciousness of existence would form a monism but this consciousness be a dualism its element be absolutely oppose _ paradise lose _ be inspire by intense consciousness of the eternal contradiction between the general unlimited irresistible will of universal destiny and define individual will exist within this and inexplicably capable of act on it even against it or if that seem too much of a antinomy to some philosophy -lrb- and it be perhaps possible to make it look more apparent than real -rrb- the dualism can be unavoidably declare by put it entirely in term of consciousness : destiny create within itself a existence which stand against and apart from destiny by be _ conscious _ of it in milton 's poetry the spirit of man be equally conscious of its own limited reality and of the unlimited reality of that which contain he and drive he with its motion -- of he own will strive in the midst of destiny : destiny irresistible yet he will unmaster this be not to examine the development of epic poetry by look at that which be not _ poetry _ in this kind of art more perhaps than in any other we must ignore the wilful theory of those who would set boundary to the meaning of the word poetry in such a poem as milton 's whatever be in it be its poetry the poetry of _ paradise lose _ be just -- _ paradise lose _ its pomp of divine syllable and glorious image be no more the poetry of milton than the idea of man which he express but the general manner of a art be for ever similar it be its inspiration that be for ever change we need never expect word and metre to do more than they do here : they fondly think to allay they appetite with gust instead of fruit chew bitter ash which the offended taste with spatter noise reject : oft they assay hunger and thirst constrain drug as oft with hatefullest disrelish writhe they jaw with soot and cinder fill or more than they do here : what though the field be lose all be not lose the unconquerable will and study of revenge immortal hate and courage never to submit or yield and what be else not to be overcome but what homer 's word and perhaps what virgil 's word set out to do they do just as marvellously there be no sure way of comparison here how word do they work in poetry and how we appreciate the way they do it -- this seem to involve the obscurest process of the mind : analysis can but fumble at it but we can compare inspiration -- the nature of the inmost urgent motive of poetry and it be not irrelevant to add -lrb- it seem to I mere fact -rrb- that milton have the greatest motive that have ever rule a poet for the vehicle of this motive a fable of purely human action would obviously not suffice what milton have to express be of course altogether human destiny be a entirely human conception but he have to express not simply the sense of human existence occur in destiny that bring in destiny only mediately through that which be destine he have to express the sense of destiny immediately at the same time as he express its opponent the destine will of man destiny will appear in poetry as a omnipotent god virgil have already prepare poetry for that but the action at large must clearly consist now and for the first time overwhelmingly of supernatural imagination milton have be foolishly blame for make he supernaturalism too human but nothing can come into poetry that be not shape and recognizable how else but in anthropomorphism could destiny or -lrb- its poetic equivalent -rrb- deity exist in _ paradise lose _ we may see what a change have come over epic poetry if we compare this supernatural imagination of milton 's with the supernatural machinery of any previous epic poet virgil be the most scrupulous in this respect and towards the inevitable change which milton complete and perfect from camoen and tasso virgil take a great step in make jupiter professedly almighty but compare virgil 's tantaene animi celestibus irae with milton 's evil be thou my good it be the difference between a accidental device and essential substance that in order to symbolize in epic form -- that be to say in _ narrative _ form -- the dualistic sense of destiny and the destine and both immediately -- milton have to dissolve he human action completely in a supernatural action be the sign not merely of a development but of a re-creation of epic art it have be say that satan be the hero of _ paradise lose _ the offence which the remark have cause be due no doubt to injudicious use of the word hero it be surely the simple fact that if _ paradise lose _ exist for any one figure that be satan just as the _ iliad _ exist for achille and the _ odyssey _ for odysseus it be in the figure of satan that the imperishable significance of _ paradise lose _ be centre he vast unyielding agony symbolize the profound antinomy of modern consciousness and if this be what he be in significance it be worth note what he be in technique he be the blending of the poem 's human plane with its supernatural plane the epic hero have always represent humanity by be superhuman in satan he have grow into the supernatural he do not thereby cease to symbolize human existence but he be thereby able to symbolize simultaneously the sense of its irreconcilable condition of the universal destiny that contain it out of satan 's colossal figure the single urgency of inspiration which this dualistic consciousness of existence make radiate through all the region of milton 's vast and rigorous imagination milton say landor even milton rankt with live man footnote : -lrb- footnote 6 : ` and all round the ship echo terribly to the shout achaian ' -rrb- -lrb- footnote 7 : ` when in a dusty whirlwind thou didst lie thy valor lose forget thy chivalry ' -- ogilby -lrb- the version leave out mega

know all that be feel be god -rrb- v after milton and after milton what be to happen first briefly for a few instance of what have happen we may leave out experiment in religious sentiment like klopstock 's _ messiah _ we must leave out also poem which have something of the look of epic at first glance but have nothing of the scope of epic intention such as scott 's longer poem these might resemble the lay out of which some people imagine authentic epic to have be make but the lay be not the epic scott 's poem have not the depth nor the definiteness of symbolic intention -- what be sometimes call the epic unity -- and this be what we can always discover in any poetry which give we the peculiar experience we must associate with the word epic if it be to have any precision of mean what apply to scott will apply still more to byron 's poem byron be one of the greatest of modern poet but that do not make he a epic poet we must keep we mind on epic intention shelley 's _ revolt of islam _ have something of it but too vaguely and too fantastically the generality of human experience have little to do with this glittering poem keat 's _ hyperion _ be wonderful but it do not go far enough to let we form any judgment of it appropriate to the present purpose -lrb- 13 -rrb- we search will not take we far before we notice something very remarkable poem which look superficially like epic turn out to have scarce anything of real epic intention whereas epic intention be apt to appear in poem that do not look like epic at all in fact it seem as if epic manner and epic content be try for a divorce if this be so the traditional epic manner will scarcely survive the separation epic content however may very well be look out for a match with a new manner though so far it do not seem to have find a altogether satisfactory partner but there be one or two poem in which the old union seem still happy most noteworthy be goethe 's _ hermann und dorothea _ you may say that it do not much matter whether such poetry should be call epic or as some hold idyllic but it be interesting to note first that the poem be deliberately write with epic style and epic intention and second that though singularly beautiful it make no attempt to add anything to epic development it be interesting too to see epic poetry try to get away from its hero and try to use material the poetic importance of which seem to depend solely on the treatment not on itself this be a natural and for some thing a laudable reaction but it inevitably mean that epic must renounce the triumph which milton have win for it william morris saw no reason for abandon either the hero or anything else of the epic tradition the chief personage of _ sigurd the volsung _ be admittedly more than human the event frankly marvellous the poem be a impressive one and in one way or another fulfil all the main qualification of epic but perhaps no great poem ever have so many fault these have nothing to do with its management of supernaturalism those who object to this simply show ignorance of the fundamental necessity of epic poetry the first book be magnificent everything that epic narrative should be but after this the poem grow long-winded and that be the last thing epic poetry should be it be write with a run pen so long as the verse keep go on morri seem satisfied though it be very often go on about unimportant thing and in a uninteresting manner after the first book indeed as far as morri 's epic manner be concerned virgil and milton might never have live it attempt to be the grand manner by means of vagueness in a altogether extraordinary way the poem slur over the crucial incident -lrb- as in the inept line describe the death of fafnir and those equally hollow describe the death of guttorm -- two noble opportunity simply not perceive -rrb- and tirelessly expatiate on the mere surroundings of the story yet there be no attempt to make anything there credible : morri seem to have mix up the effect of epic with the effect of a fairy-tale the poem lack intellect it have no clear-cut thought and it lack sensuous image it be full of the sentiment not of the sense of thing which be the wrong way round hence the protracted conversation be as a rule amazingly windy and pointless as the protracted description be amazingly useless and tedious and the superhuman virtue of the character be not show in the poem so much as energetically assert it say much for the genius of morri that _ sigurd the volsung _ with all these fault be not to be condemn that on the contrary to read it be rather a great than a tiresome experience and not only because the fault be relieve here and there by exquisite beauty and dignity indeed by incomparable line but because the poem as a whole do as it go on accumulate a immense pressure of significance all the great epic of the world have however perfectly clearly a significance in close relation with the spirit of they time the intense desire to symbolize the consciousness of man as far as it have attain be what vitally inspire a epic poet and the ardor of this infect he whole style morri in this sense be not vitally inspire _ sigurd the volsung _ be a kind of set exercise in epic poetry it be great but it be not _ need _ it be in fact a attempt to write epic poetry as it might have be write and to make epic poetry mean what it might have mean in the day when the tale of sigurd and the niblung be newly come among man 's mind mr doughty in he surprising poem _ the dawn in britain _ also seem try to compose a epic exercise rather than to be obey a vital necessity of inspiration for all that it be a great poem full of irresistible vision and memorable diction but it be write in a revolutionary syntax which like most revolution of this kind achieve nothing beyond the fact of be revolutionary and mr doughty often use the unexpected effect of he queer syntax instead of the unexpected effect of poetry which make the poem even longer psychologically than it be physically lander 's _ gebir _ have much that can truly be call epic in it and it have learn the lesson in manner which virgil and milton so nobly teach it have perhaps learn they too well never be concision and the loading of each word with heavy duty so thoroughly practice the action be so compress that it be difficult to make out exactly what be go on we no sooner realize that a incident have begin than we find ourselves in the midst of another apart from these idiosyncrasy the poetry of _ gebir _ be a curious mixture of splendor and commonplace if fiction could ever be wholly and not only partially epic it would be in _ gebir _ in all these poem we see a epic intention still combine with a recognizably epic manner but what be quite evident be that in all of they there be no attempt to carry on the development of epic to take up its symbolic power where milton leave it on the contrary this seem to be deliberately avoid for any tentative advance on miltonic significance even for any real acceptance of it we must go to poetry which try to put epic intention into a new form some obvious peculiarity of epic style be sufficiently definite to be detachable since theocritus a perverse kind of pleasure have often be obtain by put some of the peculiarity of epic -- peculiarity really require by a very long poem -- into the compass of a very short poem a epic idyll can not of course contain any considerable epic intention it be work out of the mere shell of epic and avoid any semblance of epic scope but by devise somehow a connected sequence of idyll something of epic scope can be acquire again as hugo say in he preface to _ la legende des siècles _ : comme dans une mosaïque chaque pierre a sa couleur et sa forme propre l'ensemble donne une figure la figure de ce livre he go on c'est l'homme to get a epic design or _ figure _ through a sequence of small idyll need not be the result of mere technical curiosity it may be a valuable method for the future of epic tennyson attempt this method in _ idyll of the king _ not as be now usually admit with any great success the sequence be admirable for sheer craftsmanship for astonishing craftsmanship but it do not manage to effect anything like a conspicuous symbolism you have but to think of _ paradise lose _ to see what _ idyll of the king _ lack victor hugo however do better in _ la legende des siècles _ la figure c'est l'homme there at any rate be the intention of epic symbolism and however pretentious the poem may be it undoubtedly do make a passionate effort to develop the significance which milton have achieve chiefly to enlarge the scope of this significance -lrb- 14 -rrb- browning 's _ the ring and the book _ also use this notion of a idyllic sequence but without any semblance of epic purpose purely for the exhibition of human character it have already be remark that the ultimate significance of great drama be the same as that of epic since the vital epic purpose -- the kind of epic purpose which answer to the spirit of the time -- be evidently look for some new form to inhabit it be not surprising then that it should have occasionally try on dramatic form and unquestionably for great poetic symbolism of the depths of modern consciousness for such symbolism as milton 's we must go to two such invasion of epic purpose into dramatic manner -- to goethe 's _ faust _ and hardy 's _ the dynast _ but dramatic significance and epic significance have be admit to be broadly the same to take but one instance aeschylus 's prometheus be closely related to milton 's satan -lrb- though i think prometheus really represent a monism of consciousness -- that which be destine -- as satan represent a dualism -- at once the destine and the destiny -rrb- how then can we speak of epic purpose invade drama surely in this way drama seek to present its significance with narrow intensity but epic in a large dilatation : the one contract the other expatiate when therefore we find drama set out its significance in such a way as to become epically dilate we may say that dramatic have grow into epic purpose or even more positively we may say that epic have take over drama and adapt it to its peculiar need in any case with one exception to be mention presently it be only in _ faust _ and _ the dynast _ that we find any great development of miltonic significance these be the poem that give we immense and shapely symbol of the spirit of man conscious not only of the sense of he own destine be but also of some sense of that which destine in fact these two be the poem that develop and elaborate in they own way the miltonic significance as all the epic in between homer and milton develop and elaborate homeric significance and yet in spite of _ faust _ and _ the dynast _ it may be doubt whether the union of epic and drama be likely to be permanent the peculiar effect which epic intention in whatever manner must aim at seem to be as much hinder as help by dramatic form and possibly it be because the detail be necessarily too much enforce for the broad perfection of epic effect the real truth seem to be that there be a inevitable and profound difficulty in carry on the miltonic significance in anything like a story regular epic have reach its climax in _ paradise lose _ the epic purpose must find some other way of go on hugo see this when he string he huge epic sequence together not on a connected story but on a single idea : la figure c'est l'homme if we be to have as we must have direct symbolism of the way man be conscious of he be nowadays which mean direct symbolism both of man 's spirit and of the -lrb- philosophical -rrb- opponent of this the universal fate of thing -- if we be to have all this it be hard to see how any story can be adequate to such symbolic requirement unless it be a story which move in some large region of imagine supernaturalism and it seem questionable whether we have enough _ formal _ belief nowadays to allow of such a story appear as solid and as vividly credible as epic poetry need it be a decide disadvantage from the purely epic point of view that those admirable intelligence in hardy 's _ the dynast _ be so obviously abstract idea disguise the supernaturalism of epic however incredible it may be in the poem must be work up out of the material of some generally accept belief i think it would be agree that what be possible for milton would scarcely be possible to-day and even more impossible would be the naïveté of homer and the quite different but equally impracticable naïveté of tasso and camoen the conclusion seem to be that the epic purpose will have to abandon the necessity of tell a story hugo 's way may prove to be the right one but there may be another and what have happen in the past may suggest what may happen in the future epic poetry in the regular epic form have before now seem unlikely it seem unlikely after the alexandrian have make such poor attempt at stand upright under the immensity of homer it seem so until after several effort latin poetry become triumphantly epic in virgil and again when the mystical prestige of virgil be domineering everything regular epic seem unlikely until after the doubtful attempt of boiardo and ariosto tasso arrive but in each case while the occurrence of regular epic be seem so improbable it nevertheless happen that poetry be write which be certainly nothing like epic in form but which be strongly charge with a profound pressure of purpose closely akin to epic purpose and _ de rerum natura _ and _ la divina commedia _ be very suggestive to speculation now of course the fact that in both these case regular epic do eventually occur must warn we that in artistic development anything may happen but it do seem as if there be a deeper improbability for the occurrence of regular epic now than in the time just before virgil and tasso -- of regular epic that be inspire by some vital import not simply like _ sigurd the volsung _ by archaeological import lucretius be a good deal more suggestive than dante for dante 's form be too exactly suit to he own peculiar genius and he own peculiar time to be adaptable but the method of lucretius be eminently adaptable that amazing image of the sublime mind of lucretius be exactly the kind of lofty symbolism that the continuation of epic purpose now seem to require -- a subjective symbolism i believe wordsworth feel this when he plan he great symbolic poem and partly execute it in _ the prelude _ and _ the excursion _ : for there more profoundly than anywhere out of milton himself milton 's spiritual legacy be employ it may be then that lucretius and wordsworth will preside over the change from objective to subjective symbolism which milton have perhaps make necessary for the continued development of the epic purpose : after milton it seem likely that there be nothing more to be do with objective epic but hugo 's method of a connected sequence of separate poem instead of one continuous poem may come in here the determination to keep up a continuous form bring both lucretius and wordsworth at time perilously near to the odious state of didactic poetry it be at least responsible for some tedium epic poetry will certainly never be didactic what we may imagine -- who know how vainly imagine -- be then a sequence of ode express in the image of some fortunate and lofty mind as much of the spiritual significance which the epic purpose must continue from milton as be possible in the style of lucretius and wordsworth for subjective symbolism a pregnant experiment towards something like this have already be see -- in george meredith 's magnificent set of _ ode in contribution to the song of the french history _ the subject be ostensibly concrete but france in she agony and triumph have be personify into a superb symbol of meredith 's own reading of human fate the series build up a decidedly epic significance and its manner be extraordinarily suggestive of a new epic method nevertheless something more lucretian in central imagination something less bind to concrete and particular event seem require for the complete development of epic purpose footnote : -lrb- footnote 13 : in the greatest poetry all the element of human nature be burn in a single flame the artifice of criticism be to detect what peculiar radiance each element contribute to the whole light but this no more affect the singleness of the compound energy in poetry than the spectroscopic examination of fire affect the single nature of actual flame for the purpose of this book it have be necessary to look chiefly at the contribution of intellect to epic poetry for it be in that contribution that the development of poetry so far as there be any development at all really consist this be so it might be think that keat could hardly have do anything for the real progress of epic but keat 's apparent -lrb- it be only apparent -rrb- rejection of intellect in he poetry be the result of youthful theory he letter show that in fact intellect be a thing unusually vigorous in he nature if the keat of the letter be add to the keat of the poem a personality appear that seem more likely than any of he contemporary or than anyone who have come after he for the work of carry miltonic epic forward without forsake miltonic form -rrb- -lrb- footnote 14 : for all i know hugo may never have read milton judge by some silly remark of he i should hope not but hugo could feel the thing in the spirit of man that milton feel not only because they be still there but because the secret influence of milton have intensify the consciousness of they in thousand who think they know nothing of _ paradise lose _ modern literary history will not be properly understand until it be realize that milton be one of the dominate mind of europe whether europe know it or not there be scarcely half a dozen figure that can be compare with milton for irresistible influence -- quite apart from he unapproachable supremacy in the technique of poetry when addison remark that _ paradise lose _ be universally and perpetually interesting he say what be not to be question though he do not perceive the real reason for he assertion darwin no more injure the significance of _ paradise lose _ than air-plane have injure homer -rrb- end of the project gutenberg ebook of the epic by lascelle abercrombie
