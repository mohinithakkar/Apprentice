against germany deliver by he to the congress in extraordinary session April 3 gentleman of the congress : i have call the congress into extraordinary session because there be serious very serious choice of policy to be make and make immediately which it be neither right nor constitutionally permissible that i should assume the responsibility of make on the 3d of February last i officially lay before you the extraordinary announcement of the imperial german government that on and after the first day of February it be its purpose to put aside all restraint of law or of humanity and use its submarine to sink every vessel that seek to approach either the port of great britain and ireland or the western coast of europe or any of the port control by the enemy of germany within the mediterranean hope for modify warfare that have seem to be the object of the german submarine warfare earlier in the war but since April of last year the imperial government have somewhat restrained the commander of its undersea craft in conformity with its promise then give to we that passenger boat should not be sink and that due warning would be give to all other vessel which its submarine might seek to destroy when no resistance be offer or escape attempt and care take that they crew be give at least a fair chance to save they life in they open boat the precaution take be meager and haphazard enough as be prove in distressing instance after instance in the progress of the cruel and unmanly business but a certain degree of restraint be observe the new policy have sweep every restriction aside vessel of every kind whatever they flag they character they cargo they destination they errand have be ruthlessly send to the bottom without warning and without thought of help or mercy for those on board the vessel of friendly neutral along with those of belligerent even hospital ship and ship carry relief to the sorely bereaved and stricken people of belgium though the latter be provide with safe conduct through the proscribed area by the german government itself and be distinguish by unmistakable mark of identity have be sink with the same reckless lack of compassion or of principle rely on law of nation i be for a little while unable to believe that such thing would be in fact do by any government that have hitherto subscribe to the humane practice of civilized nation international law have its origin in the attempt to set up some law which would be respect and observe upon the sea where no nation have right of dominion and where lay the free highway of the world by painful stage after stage have that law be build up with meager enough result indeed after all be accomplish that could be accomplish but always with a clear view at least of what the heart and conscience of mankind demand this minimum of right the german government have sweep aside under the plea of retaliation and necessity and because it have no weapon which it could use at sea except these which it be impossible to employ as it be employ they without throw to the wind all scruple of humanity or of respect for the understanding that be suppose to underlie the intercourse of the world _ president wilson 's war address _ challenge to all mankind i be not now think of the loss of property involve immense and serious as that be but only of the wanton and wholesale destruction of the life of noncombatant man woman and child engage in pursuit which have always even in the darkest period of modern history be deem innocent and legitimate property can be pay for the life of peaceful and innocent people can not be the present german submarine warfare against commerce be a warfare against mankind it be a war against all nation american ship have be sink american life take in way which it have stir we very deeply to learn of but the ship and people of other neutral and friendly nation have be sink and overwhelm in the water in the same way there have be no discrimination the challenge be to all mankind each nation must decide for itself how it will meet it the choice we make for ourselves must be make with a moderation of counsel and a temperateness of judgment befitting we character and we motive as a nation we must put excited feeling away we motive will not be revenge or the victorious assertion of the physical might of the nation but only the vindication of right -- of human right -- of which we be only a single champion when i address the congress on the 26th of February last i think that it would suffice to assert we neutral rights with arm we right to use the sea against unlawful interference we right to keep we people safe against unlawful violence but armed neutrality it now appear be impracticable because submarine be in effect outlaw when use as the german submarine have be use against merchant shipping it be impossible to defend ship against they attack as the law of nation have assume that merchantman would defend themselves against privateer or cruiser visible craft give chase upon the open sea it be common prudence in such circumstance grim necessity indeed to endeavor to destroy they before they have show they own intention they must be deal with upon sight if deal with at all the german government deny the right of neutral to use arm at all within the area of the sea which it have proscribe even in the defense of rights which no modern publicist have ever before question they right to defend the intimation be convey that the armed guard which we have place on we merchant ship will be treat as beyond the pale of law and subject to be deal with as pirate would be arm neutrality be ineffectual enough at best in such circumstance and in the face of such pretension it be worse than ineffectual it be likely only to produce what it be mean to prevent it be practically certain to draw we into the war without either the rights or the effectiveness of belligerent there be one choice we can not make we be incapable of make : we will not choose the path of submission and suffer the most sacred rights of we nation and we people to be ignore or violate the wrong against which we now array ourselves be no common wrong they cut to the very root of human life must accept responsibility with a profound sense of the solemn and even tragical character of the step i be take and of the grave responsibility which it involve but in unhesitate obedience to what i deem my constitutional duty i advise that the congress declare the recent course of the imperial german government to be in fact nothing less than war against the government and people of the united state that it formally accept the status of belligerent which have thus be thrust upon it and that it take immediate step not only to put the country in a more thorough state of defense but also to exert all its power and employ all its resource to bring the government of the german empire to term and end the war course we must pursue what this will involve be clear it will involve the utmost practicable co-operation in counsel and action with the government now at war with germany and as incident to that the extension to those government of the most liberal financial credit in order that we resource may so far as possible be add to theirs it will involve the organization and mobilization of all the material resource of the country to supply the material of war and serve the incidental need of the nation in the most abundant and yet the most economical and efficient way possible it will involve the immediate full equipment of the navy in all respects but particularly in supply it with the best means of deal with the enemy 's submarine army of 500000 man it will involve the immediate addition to the armed force of the united state already provide for by law in case of war at least 500000 man who should in my opinion be choose upon the principal of universal liability to service and also the authorization of subsequent additional increment of equal force so soon as they may be need and can be handle in training it will involve also of course the grant of adequate credit to the government sustain i hope so far as they can equitably be sustain by the present generation by well conceive taxation i say sustain so far as may be equitable by taxation because it seem to I that it would be most unwise to base the credit which will now be necessary entirely on money borrow it be we duty i most respectfully urge to protect we people so far as we may against the very serious hardship and evil which would be likely to arise out of the inflation which would be produce by vast loan must supply the ally in carry out the measure by which these thing be to be accomplish we should keep constantly in mind the wisdom of interfere as little as possible in we own preparation and in the equipment of we own military force with the duty -- for it will be a very practical duty -- of supply the nation already at war with germany with the material which they can obtain only from we or by we assistance they be in the field and we should help they in every way to be effective there i shall take the liberty of suggest through the several executive department of the government for the consideration of you committee measure for the accomplishment of the several object i have mention i hope that it will be you pleasure to deal with they as have be frame after very careful think by the branch of the government upon which the responsibility of conduct the war and safeguard the nation will most directly fall seek freedom of world while we do these thing these deeply momentous thing let we be very clear and make very clear to all the world what we motive and we object be my own thought have not be drive from its habitual and normal course by the unhappy event of the last month and i do not believe that the thought of the nation have be alter or cloud by they i have exactly the same thing in mind now that i have in mind when i address the senate on the twenty-second of January last the same that i have in mind when i address the congress on the third of February and on the twenty-sixth of February we object now as then be to vindicate the principle of peace and justice in the life of the world as against selfish and autocratic power and to set up amongst the really free and self-governed people of the world such a concert of purpose and of action as will henceforth insure the observance of those principle neutrality be no longer feasible or desirable where the peace of the world be involve and the freedom of its people and the menace to that peace and freedom lie in the existence of autocratic government back by organize force which be control wholly by they will -- not by the will of they people we have see the last of neutrality in such circumstance we be at the beginning of a age in which it will be insist that the same standard of conduct and of responsibility for wrong do shall be observe among nation and they government that be observe among the individual citizen of civilized state no quarrel with german we have no quarrel with the german people we have no feeling towards they but one of sympathy and friendship it be not upon they impulse that they government act in enter this war it be not with they previous knowledge or approval it be a war determine upon as war use to be determine upon in the old unhappy day when people be nowhere consult by they ruler and war be provoke and wage in the interest of dynasty or of little group of ambitious man who be accustom to use they fellow-men as pawn and tool self-governed nation do not fill they neighbor state with spy or set the course of intrigue to bring about some critical posture of affair which will give they a opportunity to strike and make conquest such design can be successfully work out only under cover and where no one have the right to ask question cunningly contrived plan of deception or aggression carry it may be from generation to generation can be work out and keep from the light only within the privacy of court or behind the carefully guard confidence of a narrow and privileged class they be happily impossible where public opinion command and insist upon full information concern all the nation 's affair menace of intrigue a steadfast concert for peace can never be maintain except by a partnership of democratic nation no autocratic government could be trust to keep faith within or observe its covenant it must be a league of honor a partnership of opinion intrigue would eat its vitals away the plotting of inner circle who could plan what they would and give account to no one would be a corruption seat at its very heart only free people can hold they purpose and they honor steady to a common end and prefer the interest of mankind to any narrow interest of they own welcome to free russium do not every american feel that assurance have be add to we hope for the future peace of the world by the wonderful and heartening thing that have be happen within the last few week in russium russium be know by those who know it best to have be always in fact democratic at heart in all the vital habit of she thought in all the intimate relationship of she people that speak they natural instinct they habitual attitude toward life the autocracy that crown the summit of she political structure as long as it have stand and terrible as be the reality of its power be not in fact russian in origin character or purpose and now it have be shake off and the great generous russian people have add in all they native majesty and might to the force that be fight for freedom in the world for justice and for peace here be a fit partner for a league of honor one of the thing that have serve to convince we that the prussian autocracy be not and could never be we friend be that from the very outset of the present war it have fill we unsuspecting community and even we office of government with spy and set criminal intrigue everywhere afoot against we national unity of counsel we peace within and without we industry and we commerce indeed it be now evident that its spy be here even before the war begin and it be unhappily not a matter of conjecture but a fact prove in we court of justice that the intrigue which have more than once come perilously near to disturb the peace and dislocate the industry of the country have be carry on at the instigation with the support and even under the personal direction of official agent of the imperial government accredit to the government of the united state seek to ignore plot even in check these thing and try to extirpate they we have seek to put the most generous interpretation possible upon they because we know that they source lay not in any hostile feeling or purpose of the german people towards we -lrb- who be no doubt as ignorant of they as we ourselves be -rrb- but only in the selfish design of a government that do what it pleased and tell its people nothing but they play they part in serve to convince we at last that that government entertain no real friendship for we and mean to act against we peace and security at its convenience that it mean to stir up enemy against we at we very door the intercept note to the german minister at mexico city be eloquent evidence fight for human rights we be accept this challenge of hostile purpose because we know that in such a government follow such method we can never have a friend and that in the presence of its organized power always lie in wait to accomplish we know not what purpose there can be no assure security for the democratic government of the world we be now about to accept gage of battle with this natural foe to liberty and shall if necessary spend the whole force of the nation to check and nullify its pretension and its power we be glad now that we see the fact with no veil of false pretense about they to fight thus for the ultimate peace of the world and for the liberation of its people the german people include for the rights of nation great and small the privilege of man everywhere to choose they way of life and of obedience seek no selfish end the world must be make safe for democracy its peace must be plant upon the test foundation of political liberty we have no selfish end to serve we desire no conquest no dominion we seek no indemnity for ourselves no material compensation for the sacrifice we shall freely make we be but one of the champion of the right of mankind we shall be satisfy when those rights have be make as secure as the faith and the freedom of nation can make they just because we fight without rancor and without selfish object seek nothing for ourselves but what we shall wish to share with all free people we shall i feel confident conduct we operation as belligerent without passion and ourselves observe with proud punctilio the principle of right and of fair play we profess to be fight for silent as to austria i have say nothing of the government ally with the imperial german government because they have not make war upon we or challenge we to defend we right and we honor the austro-hungarian government have indeed avowed its unqualified endorsement and acceptance of the reckless and lawless submarine warfare adopt now without disguise by the imperial german government and it have therefore not be possible for this government to receive count tarnowskus the ambassador recently accredit to this government by the imperial and royal government of austria-hungary but that government have not actually engage in warfare against citizen of the united state on the sea on these premise i take the liberty for the present at least of postpone a discussion of we relation with the authority at vienna we enter this war only where we be clearly force into it because there be no other means of defend we rights it will be all the easier for we to conduct ourselves as belligerent in a high spirit of right and fairness because we act without animus not in enmity towards a people or with the desire to bring any injury or disadvantage upon they but only in armed opposition to a irresponsible government which have throw aside all consideration of humanity and of right and be run amuck german in america we be let I say again the sincere friend of the german people and shall desire nothing so much as the early reëstablishment of intimate relation of mutual advantage between we however hard it may be for they for the time be to believe that this be speak from we heart we have bear with they present government through all these bitter month because of that friendship exercise a patience and forbearance which would otherwise have be impossible we shall happily still have a opportunity to prove that friendship in we daily attitude and action towards the million of man and woman of german birth and native sympathy who live amongst we and share we life and we shall be proud to prove it towards all who be in fact loyal to they neighbor and to the government in the hour of test they be most of they as true and loyal american as if they have never know any other fealty or allegiance they will be prompt to stand with we in rebuke and restrain the few who may be of a different mind and purpose if there should be disloyalty it will be deal with with a firm hand of stern repression but if it lift its head at all it will lift it only here and there and without countenance except from a lawless and malignant few civilization in balance it be a distressing and oppressive duty gentleman of the congress which i have perform in thus address you there be it may be many month of fiery trial and sacrifice ahead of we it be a fearful thing to lead this great peaceful people into war into the most terrible and disastrous of all war civilization itself seem to be in the balance but the right be more precious than peace and we shall fight for the thing which we have always carry nearest we heart -- for democracy for the right of those who submit to authority to have a voice in they own government for the rights and liberty of small nation for a universal dominion of right by such a concert of free people as shall bring peace and safety to all nation and make the world itself at last free to such a task we can dedicate we life and we fortune everything that we be and everything that we have with the pride of those who know that the day have come when america be privileged to spend she blood and she might for the principle that give she birth and happiness and the peace which she have treasured god help she she can do no other chapter i why we go to war memory of beautiful france -- why i be not accept as consul to germany by hon jame martin miller former united state consul in france to have live on the principal battle ground of the world war be a privilege the author do not appreciate at the time as representative of the united state government in the consular district of france that include the department of the aisne ardenne marne aube meuse vosge haute-marne and meurthe-et-moselle he live and have he headquarters at reim some year before the war reim be -lrb- or rather be -rrb- a beautiful city of 112000 people the story of the city go back to the day of the roman empire and bear the mark of many gallic insurrection in comparatively later time joan of arc cause charle vii to be crown in the great cathedral there -- one of the most glorious and stately in all europe now a ruin a history of the eight department -lrb- or small state -rrb- mention above would include a history of the franco-prussian war of 1870-71 and of the greatest and most desperate of all war the one just bring to a close my consular district border on belgium luxemburg and alsace-lorraine the marne the aisne the vesle and other stream whose name adorn with sad pride so many of america 's battle-flag flow through it after 1914 belgium see very little fighting but this district see almost four year of continuous and enormous battle it be overrun time and again neither belgium nor any other country suffer such devastation nor such material destruction today it be a vast graveyard hundred of thousand of man dye its soil with they lifeblood all america and all the world know about chateau thierry and st mihiel and the gallantry of american troops in those two brilliant and significant action it be difficult to realize the stupendous tragedy that through all those year hang over that beautiful country whose field be once as familiar to I as any field of home i look back to that time with affection in the glow of happy memory american before this war have hold the monroe doctrine in high reverence president have strengthen it in they message candidate for office for more than half a century have argue as a campaign issue that the united state must never be draw into foreign entanglement that no european nation ever would be allow to interfere in the affair of the american continent this doctrine be so deeply root that objector everywhere rise up when we begin to talk of preparedness against the ultimate day when we could no longer keep out of the fight many declare it would be unconstitutional for the united state to send troops to europe the war lord of germany take advantage of this traditional sentiment among we people and feel sure that the united state never would come in no matter how many american life nor how much american property germany might destroy nor how many of we ship german pirate might sink at sea without warn the german government have build up a propaganda in this country that at one time threaten to poison the mind of all we people there be some among we who hate england and want to see germany win for no other reason than that other hate russium and so desire germany to win germany 's secret intrigue in mexico come near to get we into a war with that country in the face of all these thing there be a strong sentiment among we people and even in congress favorable to germany it be easy now to say that we should have go to war when the lusitanium be sink but pro-german feeling be so noisy and so strong even though it be hold by a minority that the congress itself be affect and withhold its hand public sentiment have to be crystalize so that it would stand back of the administration with we lack of a secret service capable of cope with the german agent who be busy everywhere and all the time we be at a disadvantage in gather evidence to convince we people that the german be menacing we very existence even after the secret service be build up it take many month of hard work and several thousand government man to uncover and stamp out they organization and they ruthless plot the slimy track of the german ambassador at washington have to be follow through devious underground channel that no one have suspect the embassy have fill the country with german poison gas and back the german campaign of wholesale arson german live here many of they american bear be busily counteract public opinion as the evidence accumulate democracy be always at a disadvantage in deal with monarchy in the initial stage of war at least we have see it demonstrate that a democracy must become autocratic if it be to carry on a war successfully but a american autocracy take the shape of a temporary delegation of unusual power in condition that can not wait for the slow action of ordinary time and those who exercise it be put in power by the people themselves to do the people 's will it be necessary to consolidate not only the direction of the nation itself but of we military affair abroad we soon get the home situation in hand and then the president of the united state throw he influence back by all the american people toward bring the ally army and those of the united state under one head in the person of general foch as field marshal this be not accomplish until after the great italian disaster when it look as though the austro-hungarian army would crush italy the same may be say of the threaten disaster to the british army early in 1918 when von hindenburg begin he great drive toward calai and pari here be germany austria-hungary turkey and bulgarium four monarchy dominate by the german government fight nearly all the democracy of the world not consider russium which drop out shortly before the united state effectively enter the war we will not consider japan 's position as a nominal member of the entente except for she action at the beginning of the war in capture kiauchau china the german fortify port and naval base in the orient and sweeping germany out of the pacific by take the marshall island beyond this japan send soldier to eastern siberium to help in police duty and in guard the great store of supplies accumulate by the russian at vladivostok these store have be buy largely upon the credit extend to russia by the united state with russium germany and austria-hungary go as monarchy japan be the greatest of the remain imperial state we have see more than a dozen king emperor prince and grand duke pass into the discard as a result of a war which they themselves bring on france try to discard king and prince in 1798 the sovereignty of the people be proclaim in that war but the government which have rule france since have be many and present wide difference in this present age no doubt it will be much easier to establish a stable democracy upon the wreck of a monarchy than it could have be a century ago still the construction of a democracy be a difficult ordeal for people who have always be imperialist the several monarchy big and little that have fall in this war present most perplexing problem there be boundary and racial dispute of the most bitter kind between some of they people but the great democracy of the world that win this war be take the part of big brother to these and be see to it that they petty quarrel and internal difference be hold in check each of these country even though they establish democracy will have strong royalist party that will constitute a standing threat france even to this day have a royalist group of considerable strength they persistent claim be that france will again be a monarchy the united state be really the only democracy without such a party it be the only republic that be not found on the ruin of a monarchy why i be not accept as consul to germany i have have some personal experience with the late german imperial government as a war correspondent it be my duty to give to the world a account of the forcible deportation of king mataafa from samoa to the marshall island where he be keep in exile six year the german have shove he aside to make room for malieto a imbecile and a german figurehead i be there again when mataafa at the end of those six year return to samoa to the great joy of he people a few year later i discover that germany 's policy be to mark any individual who write or speak in criticism of anything german i be appoint united state consul to aix la chapelle germany four year after those article appear my appointment come from president roosevelt and be confirm by the united state senate when i arrive in germany i find i be unite state consul so far as the united state government be concerned but i be put off in the matter of my exequatur -lrb- certificate of authority -rrb- from the government to which i be accredit and without a exequatur i could not act i be keep cool my heel in the consulate several month before i find out what be the matter my newspaper article describe what the german have do in samoa publish four year earlier be be hold against I my presence in germany be not desire i have cross the atlantic with prince henry the kaiser 's brother and admiral of the german navy in February 1901 when the prince bring he party of a dozen or so militarist to this country to further cement the amity and good will exist between the great republic and the great empire it later develop that this be a well plan operation in german propaganda as a representative of the associated press i have write of it that be just after i have write the samoan article speck von sternberg be the german ambassador to washington he be in paris i go there to see he and ascertain if i could why my exequatur be withhold the government at washington could get no information on the subject the whole affair be clothe in mystery after some conversation i suggest to ambassador von sternberg that perhaps the foreign office at berlin be withhold the document because of my writings on german colonial matter then it come out -- my guess be true some underling in the foreign office have the case in charge the ambassador suggest that as i know prince henry i would better write he at kiel i do this with the result that the obstacle be remove and the exequatur issue why we go to war _ german propaganda in the united state and mexico _ -- _ sinking of the lusitanium _ -- _ unrestricted submarine warfare _ why we go to war during two year precede we entrance upon war germany have be carry on open warfare against we within we own border for more than thirty year germany 's policy of preparatory penetration have be in course as we know now every country all round the globe but especially the united state in north america and brazil and venezuelum in south america have be fill with german ostensibly settler business man and follower of the higher profession but for the greater part agent of germany in continuous contact with potsdam and under potsdam direction it be the business of these import german to foster the german idea exalt germany 's leadership in military power and in science and the art impress they language they literature music and custom upon we people and to do all those thing which might work for the day when germany have fake a partnership with almighty god should reach out for world dominion the process be press with that strange blend of industry stupidity mendacity and cunning which characterize the prussian and all he act under we nose a german solidarity be attempt here and in part achieve organization have prussian end in view be numerous large popular and unsuspected thread they through and through be a spy system unbelievably thorough and amazingly adroit potsdam have we mark as a nation of easy go money getter to be bleed white cram with she muddy kultur and teach the goose-step at she imperial leisure after france and england have fall to she gun but she blend of quality no matter how strong in itself be nullify by just one lack : the total inability of the prussian mind to understand the mind of the world exterior to germany in the day of test it fail because of that inability and know full well how readily the german mind could be terrorize the outbreak of war in europe bring a outbreak of blind german violence in the united state we be to be impress by the german power to strike we soil be choose as a garden of domestic sedition and of foreign conspiracy against power with which we be at peace to keep we busy with trouble of we own german propaganda and german money in mexico raise on we southern border a threatening spectre of war we be to have be rush into conflict with mexico and keep employ there while be terrorize by wholesale arson and sabotage at home so that by no chance could any friendly european power look to we for help the scheme come near to succeed for we people be arouse by mexican aggression and the flaunt insult of mexican authority prompt by german agent the policy of we government save we from fall into a trap that might have hold we fast while germany overrun the whole of europe and make ready to come a-plundering here at she own time and convenience if the truth have be know by the people then as clearly as it be know at washington nothing could have hold we back : we would not have bother with mexico at all we would have join the free nation of europe and nobody may guess what would have happen certainly we could not have assemble the man and the resource we actually and swiftly do assemble later when the real hour sound we would have cut a sorry figure and go into the mess confusedly washington know the president know so well that through 1915 and 1916 he and other in high place never cease cry a warn to prepare the president himself tour the country and tell the people everywhere that with a world on fire we could not hope to escape unsinged he say openly as much as he dare under the surface the government do much more the rapid movement of event once we be declare a combatant would have be impossible otherwise that rapidity of effective action surprise the world only because it have all be plan before a word be say in the year of we neutrality we course as a nation be surely shape itself for war without a outward sign or act ruthless destruction of property and of life become too open too frequent too outrageous for the patience of even a long-suffering tolerant people such as we the first impulse of genuine resentment be give when the lusitanium go down with its neutral passenger a defenseless ship on a peaceful errand drown more than a hundred american of both sex and all age without the slightest notice or the faintest chance of escape any nation other than ours would have go to war in a moment over such a blow in the face we do not farther we endure a sudden and flagrant increase of german propaganda in high quarter and low and of german insolence openly and defiantly parade itself the catalogue of provocation grow daily and daily breed anger but we temper hold until in February of 1917 when germany proclaim unrestricted piracy by submarine and under the thin pretext of starve out the british isle american and other ship be destroy with all on board wholesale even then we hand be withhold until germany advise we that we might send just one ship a week to europe one ship and no more provide that solitary ship be paint in a manner prescribe in the permission and then hold strictly to a course lay down by the german admiralty germany a third rate naval power have arbitrarily forbid we the freedom of the sea then we patience break for this and all the other cause germany have give we and for we own safety and the rescue of a world that without we would have perish the united state go to war work or fight back of every american soldier about fifty man and woman be need in order that he be supply with everything he physical moral and military well be might require they be put there the result be a sweeping change a immense expansion of energy in the united state itself the draft take care of the army no time or trouble have to be give to fill the rank and keep they full the enormous sum of money necessary to finance we ally as well as ourselves be promptly oversubscribe in a series of loan the first and least of which run into three billion dollar the fourth into six billion a sum larger than any single loan ever float by any other nation idleness be abolish the order to work or fight be strictly enforce upon all the people rich and poor alike for any attempt to except any one or any class would have be blow away in a gale of laughter in a space incredibly brief the united state become a nation of actual worker in which every individual do he or she share submit meanwhile with good grace and no murmuring to be ration interstate utility be take over and operate by the government include the railway telegraph and telephone line and government fixed price on the necessaries of life everything be subordinate to the one and only purpose of win the war all that we be and all that we have be thoroughly mobilize behind the fight arm the army and the navy ration the nation almost immediately after the first military and naval

infrequently the soldier have to rescue a comrade who have sink to the waist in the morass but they continue to push forward steadily face machine-gun fire from hidden redoubt and battle they way past with bomb and rifle fire there be concrete gunpit about the position in front of the town which be flood from the steenbeke river but the infantry divide and bomb they way about on either side until they have encircle the town and pass beyond where the german could be see run away little resistance be offer in the town itself but the german suffer severely from the preliminary bombardment which

whole line south to queant and north to la bassee the canadian attack begin at 4:25 o'clock just as the first hint of dawn be appear all night the british big gun have be pour a steady stream of high explosive shell into the german position great detonation overlap one another like the rapid crackling of machine-gun fire and swell into a mighty volume of thunder that shake the earth and stun the sens then a short time before the hour set for the attack arrive the battery cease abruptly and a strange almost oppressive stillness creep over the terrain which until then have be a inferno of crash noise and death it have be rain and gray cloud still hang over the trench where crouch the canadian infantryman wait eagerly for the arrival of the moment which would summon they to attack suddenly ten minute before the time set for the advance every british gun within range break out with a hurricane of shell and solid line of crimson lightning belch from the german trench as the explosive break about they to this lurid picture be add the spectacle of burn oil which the british throw on the enemy line great cloud of pinkish color smoke roll across the country from the flaming liquid and the murky sky throw back myriad color from the conflagration below the moment of attack arrive and as the british gun drop they protect barrage fire in front of the canadian trench the cloud part and

eyewitness behind it the canadian mount hill 70 and sweep along the rest of the line on the crest of the hill where so much blood have be spill before heavy fighting might have be expect for the position be well man with machine gun the resistance here however be not strong and it be not until the dwelling in the outskirts of the suburb be reach that vigorous fighting occur the ground over which the infantry advance be honeycomb with british shell hole and the barb wire defens have be level so that they give little trouble fight in cellar and dugout the first serious resistance from the german be meet at a point where the enemy be strongly intrench in connect cellar and there sanguinary fighting occur the place be a sample of many other suburb about lens the city be surround by

they usual tactic the german have carry out systematic destruction of the house and have construct strong underground defens the whole city be undermine with tunnel and dugout which have be reinforce with concrete and most of the ruin building have be turn into machine-gun emplacement the effect of the preliminary british bombardment be most demoralizing to the enemy the first german prisoner take be in a completely dazed state as a result of the terrific bombardment they have undergo and other german be see to flee to the rear desert they post as the attack begin the result of this preliminary fire be show in the speed of the canadian infantry 's advance the extreme depth reach in the first stage be 1500 yard and this be achieve in ninety-three minute this new front take into conjunction with position secure previously in the southwestern outskirts of lens establish a angular line like a pair of shears whose point reach out to the north and south of the city as the canadian push in on the northwest a simultaneous advance be start by the troops on the lower blade of the shears and close fighting begin with the german intrench in they concreted cellar which be link up with barb wire and fill with hundred of machine gun the capture of the entire city of lens be then only a matter of time as hill 70 insure the holding of the ground win by the canadian german reinforcement be place under the range of irresistible fire from that dominate height among the prisoner take in the attack be many german lad apparently not more than 17 year of age the german commander prince rupprecht of bavarium make frantic effort to recapture the lose position around lens the taking of hill stir the german high command as nothing else have do on the western front for many month and a grim battle be wage for several day on August 16 the enemy come on ten separate time but they seldom get close enough to the canadian for fight with bayonet or bomb the prussian guard participate in the counter-attack and be subject to a terrible concentrated fire from the british artillery and canadian machine gun they loss be frightful and all german effort to retake hill 70 come to naught while they hold on the central portion of the mining city become most precarious as the canadian consolidate the advantageous position they valor have finally win russian victory and collapse after the

before the tuscanium sink long-distance peace talk early in 1918 while the russian debacle complicate the war situation in europe and the united state hum with war activity a series of speech by statesman of the power at war result in demonstrate the futility of all hope of a general peace in a address to congress on January 8 president wilson follow and indorse a notable speech by the english premier mr lloyd-george lay down fourteen definite peace and war aim of the united state closely agree with the express aim of the european ally and for these say mr wilson we will fight to the death subsequently in February mr wilson state four general principle on which the nation at war should agree in seek a satisfactory peace the german chancellor von hertle address the reichstag declare that germany could agree to mr wilson 's basic principle of peace but british and french statesman promptly point out that the german practice in russium and elsewhere as opportunity offer fail to agree with von hertling 's profession of the wilson principle german suggestion of a informal discussion of peace term be therefore decline by the ally power and in march 1918 all eye be turn toward the western front in anticipation of a long-threatened german drive the world 's greatest battle all previous battle of the great war pale into comparative insignificance when the german offensive of 1918 open on the western front march 21 with a desperate and partially successful attempt of a million man to break through the british line attack fiercely from the ailette to the scarpe along a front of sixty mile for week the battle rage over the territory of the somme and when a second german drive occur farther north from givenchy to ypre fully 3000 man be engage on both side and all record of human combat be break the loss of life be appalling but in the absence of official report while the fighting be in progress could only be guess at though the world know that the river of france and flander run with blood the german attack in mass and successive wave and pay the penalty of they desperate strategy for though the british and later the french line be bent backward for mile and gap be occasionally tear in they by the foe 's furious attack the ally defensive withstand the onslaught and after a month of the most terrific struggle the world have ever see both british and french force present a unbroken front to the disappointed enemy the city of amien one of the key to paris have be a chief objective of the german drive but all effort to capture that important railroad center fail true noyon peronne bapaume albert and montdidier on the south and festubert neuve chappelle armentiere and paaschendaele to the north be successively capture from the ally in spite of the most gallant and heroic resistance but then the line hold firmly and all the german have to show for a awful sacrifice of life and morale be a few mile of advance into territory already devastate by war on April 21 when the hun offensive have last a full month not only be the army of the ally intact and better still they spirit and morale unbroken but the utmost confidence prevail among they all the ally force british french canadian and american on the western front have be by this time place under the supreme command of the eminent french strategist general ferdinand foch a important step in the co-ordination of effort that meet with universal approval among the ally nation general persh offer aid a magnanimous offer by general pershing approve by president wilson to brigade the united state troops in france with the british and french force be gratefully accept by general foch while the american bear only a minor part in the big battle or rather the continuous battle of march and April on the somme and have no part at all in the fighting in flander they hold splendidly to they section of the front-line trench in the vicinity of toul and give the enemy a taste of they quality in many a trench raid several attack by german storm troops be also beat off the most important of these occur late in April when the american defeat a force of some 1200 pick hun troops drive they back to they own line with a loss of 400 while the total loss of the american be about 200 germany prepare to strike the great german drive have be in course of preparation for month before it begin the russian situation have be settle and large body of troops be thereby release for service on the western front the kaiser and he general staff then determine upon a final effort to win a decisive victory in the west they plan be to vanquish the british and french if possible before the united state could transport a sufficient number of man to france to turn the tide of number in favor of the ally and enable they to take the offensive with good prospects of success german troops be therefore concentrate near the point choose for attack and this be do with the utmost secrecy the troop train run unlighted at night so as to escape the observation of ally aviator two hundred division in all be gather for the german drive and fully half of they be assemble near the british front on the somme march 21 be set as the date for the attack and every precaution be take to render it a surprise to the british the german troops be lead to believe that they would be irresistible and that pari they long-looked-for goal would soon be win meanwhile the ally have not be idle expect the drive but not know where it would strike first preparation have be make all along the line not merely for strenuous defense of the position hold but also for eventuality in case of enforced retreat new position back of the line be prepared reserve be distribute at strategic point and full co-operation between the ally army be arrange for the british take over the section of the french front between st quentin and chauny in addition to they former front and by so do relieved the strain on the far-flung french line the german count for victory upon they concentration of vast body of troops and the element of surprise hope to break through between the british and french army before ally reserve could be bring up in sufficient number to halt they open dat of the battle on the day set Thursday march 21 the great battle open after a six-hour bombardment the british 3rd and 5th army be attack simultaneously the german infantry advance in wave of which there seem no end and these be follow by battery of trench mortar until the front line of german trench have be reach then wave after wave the advance be continue in the face of a furious british fire until the defender be compel to draw back through sheer force and weight of number the german wave move forward at the calculated rate of 200 yard every four minute wherever it be find possible to do so each wave on reach its objective point drop to the ground and open fire with rifle and machine gun place a barrage 2000 yard ahead of they under cover of which the succeed wave advance thus each wave pass over the one ahead of it and fresh troops be constantly come to the front with such tactic against a spirited and determine foe the loss of the attacker be naturally enormous in fact it be estimate that the casualty suffer by the german during the first few day of such fight amount to 250 man but drive on by ruthless commander they continue to advance in mass though mow down by the british at every successive step all the german storm troops include the guard be in brand-new uniform say the correspondent of the new york time they advance in dense mass and never falter until shatter by the machine-gun fire the support wave advance over the body of the dead and wound the german commander be ruthless in the sacrifice of life in the hope of overwhelming the defense by the sheer weight of number \* \* \* still they come on with most fanatical courage of sacrifice when the first line fall they place be fill by other and the british gun and machine-gun could not kill they fast enough two battery of field artillery at epehy it be say fire steadily with open sight -lrb- that be pointblank -rrb- at four hundred yard for four hour into the german mass swarm over no man 's land on the first day some field battery aid the german but these be soon leave behind in the advance over difficult and shell-torn ground and the battle become one of rifle and machine-gun fire and hand-to-hand combat on the north the british 3rd army make a splendid resistance and hold its ground well but the 5th army farther south which bear the principal brunt of the attack under general gough be gradually force to retreat though in good order in a northwesterly direction towards amien french troops be order from the southwest to reinforce the british in the vicinity of noyon there the french stem the tide of german and the drive be soon turn northward with amien as its evident objective ally line begin to hold firm the battle continue along these line with the british still slowly retire with they face to the foe until the 26th of march the french stretch they line farther and farther to the leave to keep in touch with the british and never fail to maintain connection between the two army the german ' fond hope of cut they apart be doom to disappointment french and british cavalry aid in keep the line intact and for the second time since the early day of the war the horseman come into they own do valiant service in cover the retreat of the british and impede the enemy 's advance at many point where they aid prove invaluable on march 27 and 28 the situation begin to improve british reinforcement arrive at the point of greatest danger and the defense stiffen then hold the line firmly before amien and at a distance from that threaten city sufficiently great to prevent its successful bombardment by all but the heaviest artillery of the enemy the devastate and shell-torn condition of the terrain take over by the german be unfavorable for bring up the great gun to within striking distance from that time on the ally be supremely confident of they ability to cope with any force while the ally army especially the british lose heavily in man and gun during the hun advance many of the german division engage in the drive be literally cut to piece the 88th division be report by prisoner to be practically annihilate the same prisoner take in counter-attack express the utmost surprise at the relatively small number of dead whom they have find in the british and french trench as they advance they have be inform by they officer that the offensive would be over in eight day and that a complete victory over the ally would be win within three or four week german drive be halt the eighth day of the german offensive far from find the hun victorious result in tremendous attack by the german be stop by the unbeatable british while the french win a brilliant victory at the south of the line meanwhile the german have begin another attack in the flander sector with the object of wrest from the british the control of messine ridge which dominate the lowland of flander and have be so gallantly win by the canadian in the previous year they gain a partial footing on the ridge but the greater part of it be grimly hold and all effort of the enemy to advance through ypre towards the channel port be frustrated another sector be add to the north end of the battle line on the eighth day march 28 when the german attack heavily on both side of the river scarpe toward arras here some of the fiercest fighting of the offensive soon develop but the ground gain by the german be insignificant daily however they claim to have capture thousand of ally troops and hundred of gun while on the other hand enormously long ambulance train be report pass through belgium with the german wound the hospital in northern france not have sufficient accommodation for the sufferer on every battlefield of the 100-mile front -- for the fight now cover that enormous stretch of territory in two section north of la bassee and south of arras -- the german dead lay literally in heap on march 29 the ninth day of the great battle in france the german drive be practically halt and both british and french report note a decrease of the fight enemy activity be manifest only by local attack all along the front which be be strengthen each day by the arrival of ally reinforcement pari bombard at long range soon after the great offensive open the city of pari be surprise by be bombard from a distance of approximately 70 mile by a new german long-range gun which be discover by french airman to be conceal in a concrete tunnel in a wood behind the german line a number of person be kill and wound by the nine-inch shell from this new weapon 54 woman be kill when a shell strike a church in the suburb of the city on good Friday the ally commander refuse to regard the long-range gun as of any great military importance except as a means of spread terror among the civilian population -- and the population of pari refuse to be terrorize by such a method exhibit the same spirit as that of the people of england with regard to the futile aerial raid french estimate of the german loss for the first eleven day of the offensive place they at between 275000 and 300000 man the german claim that during the same period they have capture 70000 prisoner and 1000 field gun another attack on amien have be foiled in a attempt on march 31 to break through the valley of the oise pari cease to be the german objective and another offensive against amien be undertake on April 4 by this time a french army have repair the ragged line between the french on the south and the remainder of the british army of general gough whose enforced retirement have be conduct in good order though outnumber two to one the british and french repulse the attack on amien with heavy loss to the german who be effectually stop at a distance of fifteen kilometer -lrb- nine mile -rrb- from that city this end the first phase of the great battle battle renew in the north the second phase of the battle which be expect to prove decisive begin April 9 with a attack on the british aid by portuguese troops on a front of fifteen mile from la bassee to ypre the center hold by three portuguese division be break through and on April 12 the situation seem critical determine counterattack by the british however and reinforcement by the french stop the german in the next few day and this offensive like that farther south in the valley of the somme gradually die out leave the german with gain of only a few square mile of devastate territory to show for they continue heavy loss and the reserve force of the ally be still intact the strategy of general foch in this respect be universally applaud as correct under the circumstance shell fire by the million in the beginning of the offensive which thus fail to accomplish its object the most desperate means be employ by the german to break down resistance in the first six hour of bombardment on march 21 when three great german army be mass for the attack under general von bulow von marwitz and von hutier command from the north to south in the order name it be estimate that at least 1500000 shell be fire by one single army -- that oppose to general gough 's force on the south while the british 3rd army under general byng to the north be similarly assail most of the shell contain gas and be design to destroy the occupant of the trench about to be storm only the utmost individual valor and persistency of the thin british line as it retire still fight prevent the desperate and over-confident foe from turn the gradual retreat into a decisive defeat as it be the german pay dearly for every yard of ground they gain as they successive wave of troops sweep over the zone of trench and then engage the group of ally force in the open beyond all the german unit be under order to advance as far and as fast as possible be provide with three day ' ration and two day ' water after the first few day the difficulty of bring up supplies with the expect objective far from be gain aid in slow up and then halt they advance behind the german storm troops great number of reserve be assemble to fill up the gap tear in the rank and restore the division to they normal strength as fast as they be deplete by the defense the german tactic take no account of human life but expend it in the most reckless manner with appalling result throughout the drive the ally on the other hand seek at all time to conserve they force by intrench as fast as possible at every point during the period of they retirement they artillery be constantly in action and aid greatly in check the german advance ally control in the air german aeroplane play no great part in the advance although they bomb the british and french rear nightly and the air service of the ally prove superior throughout the battle for the first time in a great battle british and french airman attack the enemy infantry from low altitude with they machine gun and bomb and render invaluable assistance in dam the swell tide of the hun horde have gain the mastery of the air as they do prior to the british drive on the somme in 1916 they retain it until the foe be halt to a considerable extent they replace the heavy gun of the ally by they constant bombing and gun fire between march 21 and march 31 the french and british pilot shoot down more than 100 german plane lose about one-third of that number in the air battle after the first few clay there be practically no german machine in the air over the fight front as be the case on the somme in 1916 but at the end of march the hun plane begin to reappear in mass formation patrol sometimes consist of as many as fifty plane in a group of patrol then follow a period of intense air fighting of which a single day 's record of the french may be cite as a example on April 12 the ally aviation report show that french fighting scout make 250 flight fight 120 combat in the sky shoot down eight german and damage 23 other burn five enemy balloon damage five more and bombard german troops with 45 ton of explosive german fail in they object the last part of the month of April be mark by a succession of minor attack by the german along the entire front of the halted offensive and by the development of counter-attack by the ally at various point where it be deem necessary or advisable to strengthen they defensive position but up to may 1 the german be as far as ever from they main objective in the west judge from the standpoint of they confident expectation and the promise of success hold out as a encouragement to they troops the long-heralded and long-prepared spring offensive of 1918 be a failure they much-vaunted strength of number and of organization fail as completely to gain a decisive result as they initial drive on pari in 1914 though they throw into the fighting in march and April about 125 division they fail to separate the french and british army which be a prime object of they strategy and they sustain loss which while not irreparable must have greatly affect the morale of they man remember verdun say a famous french commander comment on the drive the boche be make this tremendous effort and sustain these loss to effect a complete rupture of we front and if he do not do that he have fail british loss make good on April 25 the british minister of munitions announce in the house of common that the loss of gun and ammunition sustain by field marshal haig 's force in france and flander during the big german drive have be more than replace the loss be place by mr winston spencer churchill at nearly 1000 gun between 4000 and 5000 machine gun and a quantity of ammunition require from one to three week to manufacture more than twice the number of gun lose or destroy have be place at the disposal of the british air and ground service say the minister german start another attack another determine attack in the somme region be begin by the german on April 24 after three week ' further preparation the enemy evidently have not abandon hope of capture amien and he again begin hammer at the gateway to that city the first onslaught be repulse by the british but on the follow day April 25 the enemy succeed in gain about a mile of ground the combined british and french army be cover the road to amien with reserve close at hand and part of general pershing 's american force be co-operate with the french the utmost confidence prevail that the united force under general foch who be call by marshal joffre the greatest strategist in europe would not only meet and defeat this renew drive by the enemy but that before long the tide of battle would turn strongly in favor of the ally whose reserve army be hold in leash by they supreme commander await the strategic hour to strike bottle up u-boat basis one of the most thrilling exploit of the war occur on the night of April 22 1918 when british naval force perform a almost incredible feat by enter the harbor of ostend and zeebrugge german submarine basis and practically bottle they up french destroyer co-operate with the british in the daring undertaking at midnight under cover of a remarkably develop smoke screen furnish by the raider themselves five old british cruiser be run aground in the harbor channel blow up and abandon by they crew the ship be load with concrete a old submarine load with explosive be also run under a bridge connect the mole or breakwater at zeebrugge with the shore and there blow up so as to prevent interruption of the raider while they be do they work alongside the mole face dangerous and unknown condition of navigation the harbor be rush by british monitor and destroyer under heavy fire from the shore battery a storm party of volunteer sailor and marine be land under extreme difficulty from the cruiser vindictive this party board a german destroyer lie alongside the mole defeat she crew and sink the ship the concrete-laden vessel be duly sink with a view to block both harbor and every gun on the mole at zeebrugge be destroy the effect of the raid be not easily ascertainable it be soon learn that the submarine base at zeebrugge at least have be put out of business for a while the gallantry and daring of the deed be generally recognize as fully in keep with the best tradition of the british navy the loss of life be quite heavy but the british lose only one destroyer and two coastal motor boat many of the raider return safely to the other side of the channel even the man on the explode submarine succeed in escape the officer who plan the raid however be among the kill german attack on ypre fail on Monday April 29 the german 4th army under general von arnim have gain possession of mount kemmel a dominate position begin a general assault on the british hill position on the kemmel front southwest of ypre the intention be to capture ypre forthwith by the overwhelming power of number and the day 's fighting be a crucial test of the hold power of the ally in the ypre salient the result of the attack be a stunning defeat for the enemy who be repulse all along the line and suffer frightful loss in the word of a french general it be a great day for the ally the repulse of the german attack be a real defeat for it upset all the confident calculation of the enemy who from the height of mount kemmel have see first ypre and then channel port within he grasp it bring disappointment and disillusion to he troops who have be urge on to they disastrous mass attack by flamboyant promise of success the effect be see in a renewal of german peace propaganda which all the ally have learn by this time to disregard as unworthy of the slightest serious attention extraordinary nervousness and depression prevail in germany owe to the loss in the western offensive say reuter 's correspondent at amsterdam on April 29 quote a german military writer capt von salzmann who say : we loss have be enormous the offensive in the west have arrive at a deadlock the enemy be much stronger than we supreme command assume the region before ypre be a great lake and therefore impassable the whole country between we amien front and pari be mine and will be blow up should we attempt to pass the preliminary bombardment southwest of ypre April 29 start in the early morning and take in the ten-mile front from meteren west of bailleul to voormezeele two mile south of ypre infantry attack in this area follow with great fury and sanguinary fighting continue all day the german at the outset advance with fix bayonet but they come under such a intense machine-gun fire that most of they be never able to employ the steel the french at locre and the british at voormezeele repulse every attack thrust the enemy back whenever he gain a footing in advanced position and firmly hold every point around ypre at the end of the day general von arnim 's loss be particularly staggering at locre where he use battalion after battalion in a vain attempt to hold the village a key to mount rouge the previous german capture of mount kemmel do the enemy little good for the ally artillery keep the crest of the hill so smother with shell fire that it be impossible for the hun to occupy it in force the attack which be the fourth great battle of ypre be the biggest effort the german have make in the flander offensive the enemy employ thirty fresh battalion of reserve in addition to the large number of division in position at the beginning of the battle the net result be a tremendous setback for the german who pay a awful price next morning the battlefield in front of the defender ' position be cover with the body of gray-uniformed man american troops in action american unit be in action in picardy east of amien on April 28 have reinforce the british and french in that sector to aid in keep the foe from amien and pari they baptism of fire in the direct line of the german offensive make they previous experience pale into the insignificance of skirmish during the various engagement in which they participate in the last day of April and the first week of may they acquit themselves with great credit after a preliminary bombardment of two hour a heavy german attack be launch against the american in the afternoon of April 30 in the vicinity of villers-bretonneux and be repulse with heavy loss to the enemy who leave dead and wound on the field while the american loss be report as rather severe there be hand-to-hand fight all along the line and the violent struggle last for a considerable time before the enemy be finally thrust back leave prisoner in the american hand they french comrade be full of praise for the marked bravery display throughout by the american troops who be fight at one of the most difficult point on the whole battle front we troops bush to prance as a result of the great german offensive movement and territorial gain in the spring of 1918 there be a tremendous increase in the military activity of the united state particularly in rush troops to europe after the selection of general foch as generalissimo of the ally force the american troops in the war zone be brigade with the french and british all the way from the north sea to switzerland and they number steadily increase in the united state the training of the new national army national guard and officer in the numerous cantonment and training camp be intensify and hurry as fast as the man be bring into condition they be ship to france at first much of the space on the transport be devote to supplies and material for the camp and depot in france but as the situation become critical owe to successful enemy offensive fewer supplies and more man be send great britain lend she ship and the number of transport be largely increase so that each month of 1918 show a greater movement of troops across the atlantic the troop movement record for the spring and summer month of 1918 be a wonderful one in view of the submarine menace in April 117 american troops be successfully transport in may 244345 in June 276382 and in July 300000 the month of August find more than 1500000 american in france england and italy

pari have be awaken by the sound of such a cannonade as they never have hear before it be general mangin 's counter-preparation against the great german attack which the enemy believe be to bring he to the gate of pari in the meantime the german who be at the gate of amien reim and compiegne have be soundly beat and outgeneral at every point and the initiative have be force from they by the military genius of marshal foch the effect upon the german be apparent from the fact that general han von boehm the german retreat specialist have be appoint to the supreme command on the somme front the german withdrawal north of albert be look upon as the first application of he tactic it be general von boehm and he former command the german eighth army that stand the brunt of the ally pressure

chateau thierry _ personal account of battle -- gas and shell shock -- marine under fire -- american can fight and yell -- get to the front under difficulty -- the big day dawn -- the shell come fast -- a funeral at the front -- _ impression of a french lieutenant -- keep the german on the run _ the name of chateau thierry will be long remembered in the united state for it be there the american fight quality be for the first time clearly impressed upon the german to they immense astonishment and with far-reaching effect the german people and the german army have be tell that the united state have no army navy or fight quality that the talk of a american army in europe be yankee bluff and nothing more that even if we could raise a army we could not send it across the ocean first because we have no ship second because if we have ship the submarine of germany would surely sink they yet here at chateau thierry they be confront by united state troops and soundly beat that effect upon the german be in itself of tremendous significance but the historic effect be greater and will grow in importance with the passage of time for it be a fact unperceived by onlook nation at the moment that it be the turn point of the war and that the turning be accomplish by troops of a nation that hate war and be suppose to be incapable of military development and that these troops have meet and whip the choicest troops of a power that above all thing be military that have assume proprietary rights in the art of war and believe itself invincible late in February 1918 general ludendorff have tell a berlin newspaper correspondent that on the first of April he would be in paris it be inconceivable to the german that with the thorough preparation of a mighty army for a offensive that by sheer weight of number should drive through a opposition twenty time as strong as that which then confront they they could not with ease push in between the french and british force thrust straight through to pari -lrb- as a spectacular performance rather than a vital military operation -rrb- and then walk over to the channel port of france and bring both france and england to a plea for mercy from the 21st of march until along in may 1918 it look as though they might succeed that be to anyone unaware of the strategy of marshal foch who sell terrain by the foot for awful price in german life and hold a unbroken front until such time as american force could be bring into action instead of wear out he reserve and weaken he power for a offensive unity of command have be accomplish by that time at the urgent demand of the united state government foch have save france and the world at the first battle of the marne be give supreme authority over all the ally force as soon as the arrival of american troops in great number have be thoroughly establish he be ready and the offensive pass from german to ally hand the tremendous german drive which ludendorff have confidently promise the german people would bring a smashing and decisive victory be stop retrocession begin on the marne again in July 1918 in the sector hold by american a action begin at chateau thierry which force the german retreat that in a few week be to shake the heart of germany scare out bulgarium austrium and turkey in the early autumn bring germany to a plea for peace send ludendorff himself into retirement dethrone the kaiser do away with the imperial form of government set up a republic and create condition that would quash for all time the power of prussium to disturb a decent world floyd gibbon correspondent of the chicago tribune a noncombatant who want to see the combat he be there to report be in that memorable action he lose he left eye there and be otherwise severely shatter but he get he story through he home paper some month afterward give gibbon well earn credit for that contribution to current history it say he help to put the marine where they belong in the war 's history for he be with they in they early exploit and fall in one of they battle six thousand out of 8000 engage be they toll they fight with the french through belleau wood hearten the brave tired discourage poilus and after they come out upon the other side the name of the battlefield be change to the ` wood of the american marine ' mr gibbon say that when marshal foch begin he great offensive which in cosmic importance be second only to creation he select the unit in which he have the most faith these unit be choose not because they be braver nor more sacrificial but because they know they be the foreign legion of france two division of american regular and the united state marine from that day there be no change in the favorable fortune of war on the western front american can fight and yell a eyewitness of the first day of the chateau thierry battle thus describe the capture of the beauleau wood : the american move stealthily with fix bayonet until they get into the edge of the wood and atop of the german machine gun-tier then the farm boy cheer and the lumberjack shout and the indian yell they be where they could mix it at close range with the boche and that be what they want they yell could be hear a mile away they be up against two of the kaiser 's redoubtable division the two hundredth jaeger and the two hundred and sixteenth reserve division they fight with vim and joy they have lose comrade at the hand of the german and now be to avenge they no quarter be ask or expect the german have order to fight to the death and the american need no such order without much artillery on either side and without gas the american fight the german through that wood four kilometer -lrb- nearly three mile -rrb- long for six hour at last we get through and take up a position across the northern end of the wood perhaps the most sensational part of the fight be when about german get around behind we man they be chase into a clearing where the american go at they from all side with the bayonet and i be tell that three prisoner be all that be leave of the german how do you do it inquire a dazed prussian officer take prisoner at chateau thierry by a american soldier we be storm troops storm hell say the american i come from kansas where we have cyclone that be and be the idea this spirit enable american soldier to go wherever they want to go a european officer on observation duty with the united state force at chateau thierry want to know how we soldier get through as they do they seem to have be train somewhere he say for they fight all right but that do not explain to I the way they keep go the american officer with whom he be talk give this explanation : they be thoroughly train in we camp at home in all but one thing they be not train to stop go it be a splendid exhibition the first of many of its kind a personal account the follow be one of hundred of thrilling experience story that could be tell by officer and man who fight at that front detail of the participation of the united state marine in the counter-attack of the ally against german force on the marne July 18 be give in a letter write shortly afterward by major robert l denig of the united state marine to he wife in philadelphium and which have be forward to washington for the historical file of the marine corps it be the best and truest form of war history and important in that it give detail of action during those July day when american troops stop the german drive it also establish the fact that the marine who help stop the german drive on pari at belleau wood early in June be honor by be bring from this wood to vierzy and tigny near soisson for participation with a crack french division in the great counter-attack which start the disintegration of the german front in the

which be the first thing a prisoner be tell to do in order that he may be compel to keep he hand employ and out of mischief the german hurry toward we line grip they trousers haggard and mad with terror would that every mother in france who have lose a son in the war could have see that epic sight they would have see themselves revenge and it would have be some consolation to they in they sorrow keep the german on the run the trench deadlock in northern france and belgium be break by ludendorff 's fatuous drive in march 1918 after the ally have stop it and inaugurate they counter-offensive all europe make a startling discovery the german be tenacious enough in trench warfare in open fighting know as war of maneouvre they could not stand before american and the ally troops incessant attack rapidly deliver at the same time at many point on the long line between the north sea and the swiss border be more than they could withstand the mechanically train troops of the central empire be futile before army of man who do they own thinking and delighted in fight a enemy they could see from the foot up german army have twice be almost at the gate of paris the first time they be drive back they dig themselves in that be in 1915 the second time in the spring of 1918 they be allow no time for digging in from the July day of 1918 when american soldier at chateau thierry beat the best troops that ever be train in prussium they be keep go how industriously may be infer from the story of the young corporal who be sit on the roadside try to tie the sole of he shoe to the upper in a hurry somebody ask he what be the matter o nothing much say he only i come over here to kill german but they never tell I i would have to run 'em to death a stranger to he own child there never be a war so prolific of personal incident in every shade of experience possible to human life the devastate province of france offer perhaps more of these happening than any other

and be follow up by the demolition of the whole german line from the swiss border to the north sea and hasten the great german retreat in the action itself September 11 to 13 about 15 german be take prisoner by the american story to the folk back home sidelight story of what happen in the st mihiel fight mostly in letter write home by man who be in it go far toward show how completely the german be take off they guard corp ray fick of the 103d infantry write home in this wise : we get into the wood and then keep on go until we reach a big city where there be a brewery but they have set fire to the whole city before they leave we get some beer and wine just the same it be a little stale but it be fine the hun ' warehouse be all fix for the winter and the boy get cigar and cigarette but i be a little too late to get in on it the whole thing be very interesting all the way through the hun sure do make themselves scarce in a hurry but they keep many prisoner a troop train and a ammunition train cigarette be scarce and we look for smoke all the time the red cross and the salvation army be the one who look to we comfort if any one want to give tell they the red cross and the salvation army be the one to get it hun carry off captive woman but corporal fick uncover another hun procedure that have no fun in it while the hun lose no time in get away from there they take care to carry off they capture woman slave the woman they have hold captive for the last four year he write be drive ahead of they but they be bring back by the american truckload after truckload pass we on the way and they sure be happy to be free again hell have cut loose another soldier write to he father tell about the first day of attack as he see it : hell have let loose the wood be a mass of whistle shell and shrapnel every time the big twelve go off the flash light up the entire camp like a flashlight picture then the ground heave and tumble like old lake michigan do on a stormy day the infantry have clear the top and have go on far in advance almost outside of the range of fire we big objective have be wipe off the map and we man be prepare to keep right on go after they and back up the doughboy who be do such great work i go up to the front last night on a ammunition caisson -lrb- which be the only way to get up there -rrb- and see the thing commence it start with one solitary gun of ours -lrb- a big one too -rrb- then the other join in on the chorus and it have be steady ever since when the doughboy be tell that they be go over the top at the zero hour you never hear shout to equal it the board of trade on a Monday morning be just a whisper in comparison dad that be the general feeling of we boy over here -- always wait to move up i tell a lad in one of the outfit that the artillery be right back of they and would blow they through to the objective if they do not make it and he laugh and say ` hoboken by christmas ' they be all in the best of mood and roar to go these letter be good specimen of the thousand that have come over the sea they not only give good sidelight on a event that will loom large in history but they show the indomitable cheer and high spirit of we soldier major tell he story concurrently with the action that originate at st mihiel on September 11 1918 another great battle develop northwest of verdun it last about three week and be graphically describe by lt col bm chipperfield -lrb- then a major -rrb- of the 23d division lt col chipperfield be a participant in as well as a eyewitness of the whole engagement under date of September 29 1918 the describe it substantially as follow in a letter to a friend at home : for several day preparation have be in progress for the action that begin on Thursday September 26th the american troops be move up by night jam the road with they advance column and transport train thousand and thousand of they write major chipperfield trudge along without a light and in almost quiet enormous number of gun tank and cannon and gun of all sort every kind of vehicle ambulance wagon and transport pass in this continuous procession it seem that there be no end to it and one could not help but admire the wonderful resource that have be gather together by the united state to help perform its part in this great struggle for freedom i think the greatest collection of gun that have ever be gather together for participation in any conflict of the world be take to the front where the attack be about to be make it be estimate there be 6000 of these gun and the soldier that be gather together number hundred of thousand these gun and soldier be conduct to they place so secretly and quietly that although they march many mile the enemy do not even know a small part of the strength and could only speculate what it all mean under enfilade fire in the arrangement of the plan of battle we division be on the extreme right across the river be a german stronghold here there be locate a large quantity of artillery and many machine gun we officer understand that it be go to be a difficult advance for a bridge have to be build across a creek but everything in we division go like clockwork it have all be plan in advance and the plan be carry out exactly as make it be arrange that at 11:30 o'clock on Thursday night the battle be to begin before that time i have reach my destination at the headquarters of the other division and together with the rest of the headquarters staff we be in a favorable place to watch the commencement at 11:25 it be silent as the grave and the night be beautiful precisely at 11:30 from every conceivable direction the great bombardment commence in a instant the whole night be fill with a roar and thunder and reverberation of the cannon from every quarter the shriek and whistle and whine and clamor of the shell make a fearful chorus as they be hurl in the direction of the field occupy by we adversary from every quarter come the flash of the explosion until the night be light as bright as day signal rocket rise from every portion and part of we line and also from the enemy line it look as though the heaven be ablaze and rain fire it be a scene which have probably never be see before upon any battlefield and may never be witness again apparently this fierce bombardment take the enemy entirely by surprise because we fire be so deadly and the extent so great that they could only make uncertain reply they seem to be stupefy for six hour this terrific bombardment continue it be estimate that each of the gun fire a average of three shot a minute and that 1000000 projectile and charge of ammunition be use over the top at 5:30 be as 5:30 approach the bombardment increase the machine gun join in the chorus and a curtain of steel and fire be place in front of we troops and rain upon the gun and cannon of the enemy after a brief period of this fire we man start over the top and as they do so they sweep the enemy before they in they irresistible rush they advance kilometer after kilometer they could not be resist or stay at any stage of the attack soon the prisoner commence to come in and they tell of the terrific effect that the great bombardment have upon the german they say the bombardment be so terrible that it disrupt they plan so that they could not be carry out and that they could not resist the attack several time during the night i go out to witness the scene and as long as life last it will be remember on dead man 's hill once when two of we regiment come over a hill and see the valley that lay before they be terrifically shell by the cannon and assail by hail from the machine gun the whole column be see to pause and a look of worry come over the face of these man that for just a instant be pitiful they know that ahead of they lay death for many and it be not strange that for several seconds the line be hold up but then a look of fierce determination and of courage take the place of the former expression and with a great resolve and courage dash and daring the line shoot forward at a redoubled step and the determination to do or die be manifest in every action these machine gun be speedily put out of business and then the attack would go on that portion of the line that the division of which i be a member be give for the purpose of the attack it be think would take the entire day but we division be on its objective by early afternoon and have commence to dig in from which position they could defy the german with impunity while the attack be go on i go up to dead man 's hill this hill be the last word in the destructiveness of war it be literally rent to atom dugout have be blow to piece hundred of thousand of man have be kill in the earlier battle before verdun and many of the body could not be reach for burial the place be so tear up other personal glimpse many other personal glimpse of the fight come from officer and man one division be make up largely of illinois regiment among other the 3d illinoi infantry command by col john v clinnin the position hold by these troops be vital to the entire advance and it require rapid action on the first day to reach the objective at the same time as the other unit menomme creek be a little stream which be not show on map it run eastward from the village of septsarge to the meuse the stream hold vivid memory for the illinois infantry it be there that it meet the most severe resistance the german catch we man just as they be relieve other young soldier the man fight they way down to the creek on the other side along the highway between septsarge and dannevoux the german have entrench themselves and be shell the road which the american have cross they be also use intrenched machine gun at the edge of the wood i hear bullet whistle overhead say a wounded soldier in a hospital we be lie near the edge of the creek at the time and know that a machine gun be shoot at we so i just start out and get it we colonel be right up there with we get into line say private hiram e burnett one night when the shell be burst all around and several man be wound the colonel go over the top just like any of we the bois des forge have be a battle ground since the war begin with trench in front and mile of barb wire machine gun nest and concrete pillbox inside a frontal attack on such a stronghold apparently mean suicide but the illinois man lead by col sanborn and col abel davi take it so neatly and quickly that they bag nearly 1000 soldier fifteen officer twenty-six gun range from 105 down 126 machine gun twenty-one flatcar two roll kitchen a ambulance and thousand of round of ammunition we be look for you in front say a capture german officer we do not expect that you would come through the swamp and outflank we we do not think that any yankee outfit be so foxy a great show it be a great show when we cross that river and rush on through the wood clean up machine gun nest say private gray mckindy of woodstock the machine gun in the wood start throw bullet as soon as we reach the river they think they could stop we from go up the opposite hill but we do it and get every gun there private kenneth w steiger be one of those who go in on the second night when he captain call for volunteer to make up a patrol steiger become separate from the other in the darkness and run into a party of three german quickly cover they with he rifle he bring all three back private bernard snyder return with prisoner before dark on the first day make use of he ability to speak german he induce a dozen german to lay down they arm pick up stretcher and carry american wound back five kilometer -lrb- three mile -rrb- to where ambulance be wait a fight chaplain lieut jorgen r enger the chaplain of a kansas-missouri outfit carry the wound for three day from the montfaucon wood two mile to the ambulance search in the wood in the darkness one night with shell burst and bullet whistle he find a husky sergeant wound in the foot and grow weaker and weaker from loss of blood the chaplain shoulder the man and carry he back to a dress station save he life i do not think a chaplain would do a thing like that say the sergeant i would rather save you than save a general reply the chaplain when not search for wound hide in the tangle of under-brush the chaplain be busy help the surgeon at a first aid dress station i never think any clergyman would have the opportunity for do good such as i be hay he say when i see he col eugene houghton wisconsin who be a british major until america enter the war distinguish himself by personally lead a unit of new york man accord to they he escape death repeatedly as by a miracle desert no want to fight capt carl f laurer while assist in the examination of german prisoner be surprise when a american prisoner be bring before he where do you belong ask the captain i be with a aerial squadron in the south of france reply the prisoner i walk fourteen day to get here do you desert ask captain lauer no the man reply i want to fight that be what i come to france for when i get home the folk will ask what i do in the war and when i answer ` work ' they will say ` why the devil do not you fight ' the boy 's wish be gratify and he be send forward we have everything good and plenty -- ration ammunition and other thing it look like a regular Sunday texa and oklahoma troops show great fighting form in this district the 36th division make up of troops from texa and oklahoma veteran and raw recruit together show splendid fighting form they be under terrific shell fire day after day but they meet several murderous attack firmly and drive the boche back in brilliant counter attack chase they in true ranger style all these man show the same spirit that animated roosevelt 's renowned rough rider in the war with spain so many of whom be texa and oklahoma man report this fight general naulin command the corps of which the 2d and 36th division be part say the 36th division a recent formation not yet completely organize be order into line on the night of October 6-7 to relieve under condition particularly delicate the 2d division and to dislodge the enemy from the crest north of st etienne and throw he back to the aisne although be under fire for the first time the young soldier of maj gen w r smith rival in combative spirit and tenacity the old and valiant regiment of general lejeune accomplish all the task set for they every american know full well the bright record of the 2d division of infantry the regular of which be compose of the 5th and 6th marine and the 9th and 23rd infantry these be the boy who stop the german up in belleau wood when the boche be head for pari and cocksure of get there blandly unaware that they be goose-step toward a american knock-out we color troops win credit american negro troops have a considerable share in the last few month of fight and acquit themselves in a highly creditable manner they be great trench digger and trench fighter and they endurance on the march be a marvel to the ally army they be very popular with the french people who be delighted with they good nature and they never-ceasing song regular negro melody these song be nearly all of they of the camp-meeting variety -- and sing with that choral beauty which especially distinguish all of they musical performance the negro notion of war and indifference to death be instance in the case where a white officer overhear one of they at the zero hour call out good night ol' world good mawin ' mistah jesus as he go over the top the color boy say charle n wheeler a distinguished correspondent with the american army be great fighter and be no better and no worse than any other group of american soldier in france whatever the blood strain they do take pardonable pride in the fact that ` mistah ' johnson a color boy be the first american soldier in france to be decorate for extraordinary bravery under fire they can fight and sing the color line have about die out in the american army -- in france they play together sing they song together -- the black and the white -- and they go over the top together they come back together too the wound and there be no thought of the color of a man 's skin they mix together on the convoy train go up to the front and all sing together share each other 's danger and they joy it be not a uncommon sight to see a crowd of white doughboy around a piano in some ` y ' or red cross hut singing to beat the band with a color jass expert pound the stuff out of the piano the white boy enjoy immensely the wit of the color comrade and many a bleak and drab day of privation and suffering be make a bit brighter by the humor that come spontaneously to the lip of the ` bronze boy ' the child of france love they i suppose that be because they wear american soldier ' uniform i have see score of white child hold the hand of color boy and trudge along on the march with they or romp into they tent and sit on they knee and just exude the affection that all the child of france have for anything and everybody from the united state chapter v the war in the air the hughe report on air craft submit in October 1918 contain a full account of the difficulty drawback and questionable management that have hold back the manufacture and shipment of airplane to europe in September there be on the french-belgian front between 300 and machine all of which be in the scout and observation class with no regulation combat plane of american build but american airman have conduct many successful action against german battle plane and a good many american be operate french and british battle plane in action back of the german line the combined american british french and canadian plane have before that time clear the air of german observation and other machine in front of the ally line thereby prevent hostile observation of ally camp and artillery position and movement of troops preparatory to attack the efficiency of this combined air service be credit with have contribute in a important degree first to retard the movement of supplies from the enemy rear to the enemy fight line and next to disturbance of the enemy in retreat the american especially distinguish themselves by fly at high speed along the last of the enemy trench and clear up the german troops therein by continuous stream of machine gun fire american flyer also make successful raid across the german border blow up munitions work railway center and german troops at concentration point between early September and late October 1918 they drop thousand of ton of high explosive inside of germany at the same time in association with british and canadian aviator they put a definite end to german air raid upon the british isle and interior france the canadian air service during the summer and early autumn of 1918 increase at the rate of 300 plane per month all manufacture in canada liberty motor and air service after July 1918 the output of liberty motor for the government catch up with the immediate demand it increase until in October it reach a rate of about 5000 a month the ford factory at detroit alone report at the end of October a established monthly rate of increase of over 1500 american flyer down 473 plane in two month american flyer make a great record in the closing day of war in the period from September 12 to 11:00 o'clock on the morning of November 11 american aviator claim they bring down 473 german machine of this number 353 have be confirm officially day bombing group from the time they begin operation drop a total of 116818 kilogram of bomb within the german line the war in the air aviation be the most perilous of all service call for young body high spirit quick wit personal initiative and unshakable nerve thus it have draw in the best and brightest of america 's son -- brilliant clear-eyed steady youth who take the air and its peril with joyous ardor the danger the romance the thrill of air fighting be thing that never be know in war until this one call into be vast aerial navy that grapple in the sky and rain upon the earth below a ghastly dew of blood there be no tale of this war more fascinating than those that have be tell by these man courage and modesty be inseparable we aviator avoid print and can not be interview with any satisfaction but sometimes they write home to a mother a sweetheart or a pal and these letter now and then come to light chance of live now i can not describe my feeling right off the bat say eddie rickenbacker the ace of american ace the day follow the signing of the armistice but i can say i feel ninety-nine per cent better there be a chance of live now and the gang be glad rickenbacker become a captain during the last phase of the war and have twenty-four victory over enemy airman to he credit to rickenbacker whose home be in columbus ohio the ally command give the honor of make the last flight over the german front and firing the last shot from the air on the morning of November 11 1918 air plane 's tail shoot off in report this most remarkable occurrence edward price bell a american correspondent write as follow from the front : a british observer fly a powerful machine at 16000 foot over ostend have the machine 's tail shoot off by the direct hit of a shell -- a very unusual occurrence the machine turn upside down out of control and the pilot be throw out of he seat by some inexplicable maneuver he manage to clamber on to the bottom of the fuselage of the machine astride of which he sit as if he be ride a horse though the machine be out of control owe to the loss of its tail plane yet by move forward and backward he so manage to balance it that it glide fairly steadily downward although upside down he successfully bring it across the german line and come safely to within a few hundred foot of the ground then he crash and be injure but be now recover in a hospital when it be consider that this incident occur at a height of 16 foot over hostile territory and that during the airman 's terribly precarious ride he be subject to antiaircraft fire and liable to the attack of hostile scout it be not too much to say that he be a record achievement recently another airman be shoot down out of control from 13 foot and fall flutter like a leaf toward the ground at a height of 9000 foot he faint shortly afterward he come to and find himself in the machine upside down in a marsh absolutely unhurt many airman of course have be through several crash without sustain so much as a broken collar bone join the sky fighter this story of lieut manderson lehr who refuse a transfer home and shortly after die in combat be take -lrb- by permission -rrb- from he personal letter write to a friend in this country it be typical of many that might be tell by or about brilliant young american who would not wait for america 's participation in the war but go voluntarily with high heart and eager hand to help those other boy of france and the british empire to whom have fall so large and so momentous a part in the world 's salvation nearly all of these american lad the choicest spirit of we nation take up whatever work they could find -- anything so long as it be useful or contribute in any way to win out against the german horde or stem the flood of german crime that be sweeping over europe that would later if it be not stop cover we continent with a inundation of blood and desolation most of they like lieutenant lehr go into ambulance service and afterward when the air plane be ready and need man to fly they take to the air these be the man who put out the eye of the german army and pilot the ally to many a victory and alas many of they like lehr give up they life -- though not in vain nor without have send down to crash death each one he share of the flyer of the foe lehr 's story lieutenant lehr 's story begin with a letter from france just after he arrival in pari on may 15 1917 when he join the ambulance corps -- later enter the air service it cover a period of more than a year 's experience at the front the last letter from lieut lehr be date June 14th 1918 when the big german drive be about at its climax accord to news report from the front lehr have a period of intense activity up to July 15th when he be report miss bud be regard as one of the most adept of american flier one of the last news report from the front tell of he still fly under french color and have twice return from raid with he passenger kill by enemy attack and of he be award the war cross the same report tell of a 150 mile raid into germany with eight other french machine -- when a patrol of twelve german plane be attack and three of they send down in flame while all the nine french machine return safely the follow be a few of lehr 's later letter from the front : fly at the front sector -- at the front oct 12 1917 -- it be blow terrifically wind and rain you can not imagine how i picture you people at home warm happy and safe i have be out here a week now three day of it have be fly weather up 25000 foot and ten mile into germany be my record so far and i have actually have one combat with a boche he be below I at first far in the distance i be suppose to be protect a bombing expedition of ten machine i see this spot start away from the rest and through excitement anticipation and the goodness know what i climb go faster and faster until i have the sun between we and the german below I then i dive he hear I and bank we both loop and then come head on firing incessantly my machine gun be empty and the boche have more for he get in behind I and putt putt putt past my ear he come so i dive go into a vrille with he on top come out and square off and he let I have it again all i could do be to maneuver for i have no shell leave and i do not want to beat it so i stick we both come head on again and i say a little prayer but the next time i look mr boche be go home i peak straight down make my escadrille accompany they home and when i get out of my fur i be wring wet in spite of the fact it be cold as ice where i have do my fighting consider he own tactic i look my machine over and find five hole in it but nothing serious tomorrow be go to be bad and no one will fly unless they call for volunteer and then i think most of we will go i would like to figure out what i do wrong first of all i be so excited that i fire all my shot at the german and he maneuver out of my way and then come at I as i be helpless my captain give I harkey for stay when out of bullet so i guess the rest be ok but i would hate to run from any boche man die in faulty plane the machine i have be fly have be condemn so i expect to be send back to get another one a brand new one that have never be on the front twenty-five pilot in the last month have be kill by wing drop off i have see twelve go and it surely take the old pep out of you i be above one and see he wing crumple then fall a man be so utterly helpless he must merely sit there and wait to be kill and when you be fly the same type of machine it do not help you confidence any i be glad they condemn mine for i have put my old cuckoo through some awful test and it be about ready to fall apart we expect to change soon and go up to a new offensive in f -- if i get through that i be go to change over to the american army they have offer I a commission and i think i 'll take it my finger be cramped and my foot have long since be numb now i be go to wrap up in my fur leather and go to bed this be war fight with fly circus feb 1 1918 -- have a great time this last week and make six long bombardment for the first three time we have no trouble get across whatsoever come out the last three time we get some real competition it be in the form of the fly circus or tango which consist of fifteen of the best pilot in germany command by baron von richthofen who seem a good sort for when you fight he and you both miss he wave and we wave back we have be at it consistently for four day and so they send these bird down opposite we to stop we we have be in germany for some distance and have reach we objective and bomb it there be a heavy fog below we so i take a couple of turn to make sure we could see we objective we drop we bomb and then i turn to the right to see the damage i have to take a large turn for the archy be shooting pretty close i look for my escadrille and see these machine way off in the distance i start for they and soon catch up with they then i swerve and dip up to they for i think they a little strange i get up closer and wow all three dive at I like a rock and bullet fly by I cut my plane so i pull up at they fire swerve so my gunner could let they have it also and then see the iron cross flash by so i know it be the hun i start get altitude and go up high and then the boche get the sun between they and my plane and come again but i think this would happen and peak they go under I and that leave I on top so i give they about 120 bullet and one go for home the other two come by again and i go into a tight spiral so my gunner could pump at they -- but nothing do they beat it home and so do i for it have be three to one when i land i have five hole in my machine one of the wire have be shoot away and give I some trouble in landing feb 10 1918 -- we have be pretty busy and have some exciting time i almost get mine day before yesterday and feel pretty lucky to be here we start out on a long trip into germany and all the way over we have no trouble at all after we bomb my observer and i dive down on some village and use we own gun on they we get so low that the anti-aircraft gun be pop too close so we beat it we soon see a bunch of hangar below we and we dive down on they and shoot at they in a few minute a bunch of hun come up from the hangar after we and we beat it to catch up with the other we get up with they and look behind we and there be a number of german sneak down on we then the battle commence and for forty minute we have a hot fight we pick off -lrb- censor -rrb- of they and they go plunge down in flame then the other go back and we all return safely but i notice that my machine work queerly and when i land i have a hard time and barely get to the ground without smash to piece i look the machine over and you should have see it from top to bottom it be one mass of hole one bullet pass through my combination and hit a can of tobacco another cut a main spar on one of my wing and another hit my stabilizer tear it half in two one other hit my gas tank and put a hole clear through it luckily my gas be low and it do not explode but believe I i be lucky in the big german drive April 20 1918 -- the orderly have just tap on my window to put down my shade which mean the gotha be on they way the gun be start this attack have be frightful -- day after day long line of ambulance roll by we camp carry large number of wounded tomorrow we shall continue we work of knock down they battery and bombing they railroad to-night now they be try to get we i start on a permission about three week ago and have beautiful vision of peace and content for a week but be call back immediately at the beginning of this horrible attack thing look bad and in a few day we be move farther up we work here have be hard and exciting and always work in any kind of weather while we loss have be heavy we have accomplish wonder go over on cloudy day when the heavy black cloud hang down to within fifty meter of the ground spot a group of truck a line of car or a battery of troops then bombing they shoot they up with you machine gun and shoot back up into the cloud midst a rain of luminous machine gun bullet from the ground be interesting work but the terror of those on the ground poor devil yet it be get to be bring home out of twenty-four trip we lose eight machine poor chuck kerwood be among they chuck be a american boy from philadelphium and he have be with we for five month i have a chance to go back to the state as a instructor and almost take it but when the time come around to leave this band of man who have be in it for almost four year i could not do it they be man and have pull I out of tight hole when i be green at this game and they do it at the risk of they life now i have see they drop off one at a time fine young frenchman and i guess the least i can do be to stay right by they and i feel my work be here in hospital may 3 1918 -- well here i be at last but i fool they for six month finally one slip up behind I i never see he but feel he only get it in the leg so it be not very serious except that the bullet be incendiary they have oodles of sulphur on they and i be afraid of complication this be a nice hospital in a nice location only thing that i hate about it be that i may not be able to get back to my escradrille for fifteen or twenty day severe bombing by german may 16 1918 -- go to have another operation tomorrow and then i think i 'll be well and believe I if i be i be go back and get somebody for this we be now on the somme near rouen i suppose you know baron von richthofen have be bring down i be sorry for he be a game clean scrapper and i know for i have have several brush with he the hun come over here last night and drop sixty bomb kill people and wound i do not know how many several of the bomb hit about 300 meter from here and we bed shake like the dickens comment on he war cross at the front June 14 1918 -- i have be back here from the hospital for several day and we be have beautiful weather do lot of work and lose lot of man but get result i think by now you have all my letter explain the

russium vs austrium -- control of balkan seaport -- england 's commercial supremacy challenge by germany -- assassination of archduke franci ferdinand of austrium by a serb _ within the space of less than a week from August 1 1914 five of the six great power of europe become involve in a war that quickly develop into the greatest and most sanguinary struggle of all time the european conflagration long foresee by statesman and diplomat and dread of all alike have break out begin with the thunder of austrian gun at belgrade the reverberation of war be hear in every capital of the old world austrium 's declaration of war against servium be follow by the alignment of germany with its teuton neighbor against the force of russium france and england italy alone of the six great power decline to align itself with its formal ally and make a determine effort at the outset to maintain its neutrality soon the highway of europe resound with the hoof-beat and the tramp of march host with the rattle of arm and the rumble of artillery of such a war once begin no man could predict the end but the world realize that it be a catastrophe of unparalleled proportion a failure of civilization in its stronghold a disaster to humanity for more than forty year the great power of europe have be at peace with one another though war have threaten now and then diplomacy have avoid the actual outbreak but that the dreaded conflict be inevitable have long be recognize for its come immense armament have be prepare until the burden of taxation lay upon the people have become in themselves a source of danger but behind it all lay the sinister influence of the junker element of germany -- the military party swollen with pride in the development of the german army by more than forty year of preparation for conflict and the naval party eager for der tag which should bring a trial of the new german navy against the battle fleet of a enemy foster and encourage these militaristic sentiment be the grow desire of germany for a place in the sun which be translatable only as a desire for world domination greater and wider market for german commerce be urgently demand and vision of germany as mistress of the sea with a great colonial empire and of the kaiser as the undisputed military overlord of europe already fill and fire the teuton imagination the political alignment of the great power prior to the war be as follow : on the one side be the triple alliance include germany austria-hungary and italy while on the other be the triple entente comprise great britain france and russium as the event prove the uncertain element in this line-up be italy which have a real grievance against austrium in the latter 's possession of the former italian territory know as the trentino and which be not consult by germany and austrium prior to the outbreak of hostility she therefore decline to enter the war as a member of the triple alliance but be later find in the field against austrium and thenceforth render powerful aid to the cause of the ally as the member of the triple entente and they supporter soon come to be know it be in the balkan long regard as the zone of danger to european peace that the war-cloud gather and darken rapidly for generation austrium and russium have struggle diplomatically for the control of balkan seaport with the balkan state act as buffer in the diplomatic strife servium act as a bar to austrium 's commercial route to the ægean by way of the sanjak of novi bazar to salonikus while russium be servium 's great ally and stand stoutly behind the little slav kingdom in its opposition to austrian aggression ambition of servium then come the recent balkan war and they outcome be view with alarm austrium uneasily watch the approach of servium to the adriatic and the aegean the formation of the new new autonomous state of albanium between servium and the adriatic be all that prevent austrium from attack servium during that crisis the term of peace leave the situation as it concerned austrium and russium practically as it have be austria make no further progress toward the sea and russium remain the ally of servium bulgarium have fail in its effort to reach salonica at this stage another element exert its influence servium awake to the possibility of a greater servium a empire of the slav have long be dream of in austria-hungary itself million of slav be dream of it and await the disruption of austria-hungary hold together now as they argue only by the indomitable will of the old emperor franz joseph the hatred between the slav and the teutonic austrian be intense the annexation by austrium of bosnium and herzegovina in which servian predominate increase the servian hatred and the indignation of the whole slav world to the point of violence a conflict be avoid with difficulty these principality have hope to form part of a greater servium have not russia be exhaust by the war with japan servium would have call upon she ally and the crisis would have come then as it be the balkan teem with plot and counterplot against the austrian culminate in the assassination of the arch-duke and heir-apparent to the austrian throne franci ferdinand know for he anti-slav principle and therefore fear and hate as the king to be the assassination occur at serajevo in bosnium where servian disaffection be seething austrium immediately lay the crime on the servian government austrium declare war fail in she peremptory demand for satisfaction austrium declare war July 28 1914 apparently for revenge but behind she righteous indignation she still hold in view she traditional ambition a port on the mediterranean to be secure by the complete control of the novi bazar route to salonica a route which besides its commercial importance be of tremendous strategic value to the nation which command it the treaty of berlin of 1878 after the russo-turkish war have give austria the military political and commercial control of the route within the sanjak of novi bazar then a part of turkey but now in the division of spoil follow the balkan war servium gain control of novi bazar pristina uskub and istip or practically the entire route to a short distance north of salonica where the new boundary of greece have be extend this mean that austrium see herself shut out from the sanjak and only by the destruction and subsequent occupation of servium could austria regain she ascendancy over the route victory would mean a long step by austrium toward the sea plot and counterplot the balance of power among european nation have hitherto be maintain because the formation of a single nation out of the balkan state have not be possible although the people of these state have similar pursuit and live much alike in all region they have preserve they original racial difference a village of albanian may be within a few mile of a village of greek yet through century both have remain racially distinct here and there the barrier have give way somewhat but in general the race persist side by side sometimes peaceably more often in mutual distrust or open feud such division have be foster by the great nation and new state have be create as recently albanium since the formation of a great state in the balkan by the union of all or the absorb greatness of one would overthrow the balance of power and besides interpose a insurmountable obstacle between austrium and russium and the sea thus the state have be play against each other sometimes the game have be one of diplomacy or one of force hurl the state at each other 's throat how war be declare _ ultimatum by austrium to servia -- war declare by austrium -- russium mobilize -- germany declare war on russium August 1 -- france and england

part would be accept it be a plain prelude to war nevertheless a virtual acceptance by servium follow act on the advice of russium servium accede to all that be require of she make only two reservation of the most reasonable character these reservation be find enough to serve as a excuse for war austrium at once declare herself dissatisfied and though the actual declaration of war be

choose a new position in view of the possibility of my be drive from the mon position i have previously order a position in the rear to be reconnoiter this position rest on the fortress of maubeuge on the right and extend west to jenlain southeast of valencienne on the leave the position be report difficult to hold because stand crop and building limit the fire in many important locality when the news of the retirement of the french and the heavy german threaten on my front reach I i endeavor to confirm it by aeroplane reconnaissance and as a result of this i determine to effect a retirement to the maubeuge position at daybreak on the 24th a certain amount of fight continue along the whole line throughout the night and at daybreak on the 24th the second division from the neighborhood of

this operation from the enemy who have retake mon the second corps halt on this line where they intrench themselves enable sir dougla haig with the first corps to withdraw to the new position night attack on the leave toward midnight the enemy appear to be direct he principal effort against we left i have previously order general allenby with the cavalry to act vigorously in advance of my left front and endeavor to take the pressure off about 7:30 in the morning general allenby receive a message from sir charle fergusson command the fifth division say he be very hard press and in urgent need of support on receipt of this message general allenby draw in he cavalry and endeavor to bring direct support to the fifth division during the course of this operation general delisle of the second cavalry brigade think he see a good opportunity to paralyze the further advance of the enemy 's infantry by make a mount attack on he flank he form up and advance for this purpose but be hold up by wire about 500 yard from he objective general smith-dorrien in retreat the nineteenth infantry brigade be bring by rail to valencienne on the 22d and 23d on the morning of the 24th they be move out to a position south of quarouble to support the left flank of the second corps with the assistance of cavalry sir horace smith-dorrien be enable to effect he retreat to a new position at nightfall a position be occupy by the second corps to the west of bavay the first corps to the right the right be protect by the fortress of maubeuge the leave by the nineteenth brigade in position between jenlain and bavay and cavalry on the outer flank the french be still retire and i have no support except such as be afford by the fortress of maubeuge army in geeat peril i feel that not a moment must be lose in retire to another position i have every reason to believe that the enemy 's force be somewhat exhaust and i know that they have suffer heavy loss the operation however be full of danger and difficulty not only owe to the very superior force in my front but also to the exhaustion of the troops the retirement be recommence in the early morning of the 25th to a position in the neighborhood of le catean and the rear guard be order to be clear of maubeuge and bavay by 5:30 a m the fourth division commence its detrainment at le cateau on Sunday August 23 and by the morning of the 25th eleven battalion and a brigade of artillery with the divisional staff be available for service i order general snow to move out to take up a position with he right south of solesme he left rest on the cambrai-le cateau road south of la chapriz in this position the division render great help although the troops have be order to occupy cam-brai-le cateau-landrecy position and ground have during the 25th be partially prepared and entrenched i have grave doubt as to the wisdom of stand there to fight have regard to the continued retirement of the french right my expose left flank the tendency of the enemy 's western corps to envelop I and more than all the exhaust condition of the troops i determine to make a great effort to continue the retreat till i could put some substantial obstacle such as the somme or the oise between my troops and the enemy retreat be order order be therefore send to the corps commander to continue they retreat as soon as they possibly could toward the general line of vermand st quentin and ribemont and the cavalry under general allenby be order to cover the retirement throughout the 25th and far into the evening the first corps continue to march on landrecy follow the road along the eastern border of the forest of mormal and arrive at landrecy about 10 o'clock i have intend that the corps should come further west so as to fill up the gap between le cateau and landrecy but the man be exhaust and could not get further in without a rest the enemy however would not allow they this rest and about 9 : that evening the report be receive that the fourth guard brigade in landrecy be heavily attack by troops of the ninth german army corps who be come through the forest to the north of the town french aid be give at the same time information reach I from sir douglas haig that he first division be also heavily engage south and east of marille i send urgent message to the commander of two french reserve division on my right to come up to the

back from vavay which be my _ paste de commandemente _ during the fighting of the 23d and the 24th i visit general sordet and earnestly request he cooperation and support he promise to obtain sanction from he army commander to act on my left flank but say that he horse be too tired to move before the next day although he render I valuable assistance later on in the course of the retirement he be unable for the reason give to afford I any support on the most critical day of all -- namely the 26th german use heavy gun at daybreak it become apparent that the enemy be throw the bulk of he strength against the left of the position occupy by the second corps and the fourth division at this time the gun of four german army corps be in position against they and sir horace smith-dorrien report to I that he judge it impossible to continue he retirement at daybreak i send he order to use he utmost endeavor to break off the action and retire at the earliest possible moment as it be impossible for I to send he support the french cavalry corps under general sordet be come up on we left rear early in the morning and i send he a urgent message to do he utmost to come up and support the retirement of my left flank but owe to the fatigue of he horse he find himself unable to intervene in any way there have be no time to intrench the position properly but the troops show a magnificent front to the terrible fire which confront they army face annihilation at length it become apparent that if complete annihilation be to be avoid retirement must be attempt and the order be give to commence it about 3:30 in the afternoon the movement be cover with most devoted intrepidity and determination by the artillery which have itself suffer heavily and the fine work do by the cavalry in the further retreat from the position assist materially the final completion of this most difficult and dangerous operation i can not close the brief account of this glorious stand of the british troops without put on record my deep appreciation of the valuable service render by sir horace smith-dorrien i say without hesitation that the saving of the left wing of the army under my command on the morning of the 26th could never have be accomplish unless a commander of rare and unusual coolness intrepidity and determination bad be present to personally conduct the operation the retreat be continue far into the night of the 26th and through the 27th and the 28th on which date the troops halt on the line from noyon chauny and lefere praise sordet 's help on the 27th and 28th i be much indebted to general sordet and the french cavalry division which he command for materially assist my retirement and successfully drive back some of the enemy on cambraus general d'amade also with the sixty-first and sixty-second reserve division move down from the neighborhood of arras on the enemy 's right flank and take much pressure off the rear of the british force this close the period cover the heavy fighting which commence at mon on Sunday afternoon August 23 and which really constitute a four day ' battle i deeply deplore the very serious loss which the british force suffer in this great battle but they be inevitable in view of the fact that the british army -- only a few day after concentration by rail -- be call upon to withstand the vigorous attack of five german army corps it be impossible for I to speak too highly of the skill evince by the two general officer command army corps the self-sacrificing and devoted exertion of they staff the direction of troops by the divisional brigade and regimental leader the command of small unit by they officer and the magnificent fighting spirit display by the noncommissioned officer and man -lrb- sign -rrb- j d p french field marshal tell by a wounded soldier a british soldier who be wound in the fight during the retreat from mon tell the follow story of the battle there : it be Sunday August 23 and the british regiment at mon be merry-making and enjoy themselves in leisure along the street belgian lady return from church hand the soldier they prayer book as souvenir while the belgian man give the man cigarette and tobacco about noon when the man be begin to think about dinner a german aeroplane appear overhead and begin throw out a cloud of black powder which be one of they favorite method of assist battery to get the range no sooner have the powder cloud appear than shrapnel begin to burst overhead and in a moment all be confusion and uproar but it do not take the regiment long to get into fight trim and race through the city to the scene of operation which be on the other side of the small canal in the suburb here we outpost be engage the enemy fiercely the outpost lose very heavily most of the damage be do by shell the rifle fire be ineffective although at time the line of contender be not more than 300 yard apart the first reinforcement to arrive be post in a glass factory the wall of which be loop-holed and we doggedly hold that position until nightfall when we fix bayonet and lay in wait in case the enemy make a attempt to rush the position in the darkness destroy bridge behind they about midnight order come to retire over the canal and two company be leave behind to keep the enemy in check temporarily after the main body have cross the bridge be blow up leave the two outpost company to get across as best they could by boat or swim most of they manage to reach the main body again the main body retire from the town and fall back through open country be keep move all night when daylight arrive it be apparent from higher ground that mon have be practically blow away by the german artillery throughout the morning we continue to fight a rearguard action but the steady march in retreat do not stop until 6 o'clock in the evening when the british find themselves well out of range of the german artillery in a quiet valley here all the troops be order to rest and eat as they have be without food since the previous morning 's breakfast it be rather amusing to see the soldier go into the turnip field and eat turnip as though they be apple at 8 o'clock all light be extinguish the soldier be order to make no noise and the picket push a long distance backward long before dawn the troops be hastily start again and continue the retirement by noon the enemy be again hear from and a large detachment be assign the task of fight to protect we rear watch duel in air during the afternoon both the german and british army watch a duel in the air between french and german aeroplane the frenchman be wonderfully clever and succeed in maneuver himself to the upper position which he gain after fifteen minute of reckless effort then the frenchman begin blaze away at the german with a revolver finally he hit he and the wounded german attempt to glide down into he own line the glide however end in the british line near my detachment the west kent infantry we find the aviator dead when we reach the machine we bury he and burn the aeroplane at dusk a halt be make for food and as the german have fall behind the english spend a quiet night at dawn however we find the german close to we heel and several regiment be order to prepare intrenchment this be tedious and tiresome work especially in the heat and without proper food but we quickly put up fortification which be sufficient to protect we somewhat from the artillery fire it be not long before the german gunner find the range and begin tear up those rough fortification concentrate they fire on the british battery one of which be completely demolish another find itself with only six man both these disaster bear testimony to the excellent markmanship of the german gunner officer spike the gun as it become evident that we must leave these gun behind and continue the retreat a officer be see go around put the gun out of action so that they would be of no use to the german he action require cool bravery because the german have find the range continue firing directly at these battery thing rapidly get hotter and the commanding officer order a double-quick retreat we be not long in do the retire movement to save we own skin i be wound at this time by a maxim bullet for a moment i think my head have be blow off but i recover and keep on run until i reach a trench where i have a opportunity to bandage the wound i rush off to the ambulance but find the doctor so busy with man worse off than i that i go back to my place in the line the battle at chablerous the loss of life in the franco-german battle near charlerous be admittedly the greatest of any engagement up to that time it be at charlerous that the german strike they most terrific blow at the ally ' line in they determination to gain the french frontier though the tide of battle ebb and flow for awhile the french be finally force to give way and to retreat behind they own frontier while the british be be force back from they position at mon the fighting along the line be of the fiercest kind it be a titanic clash of army in which the ally be compel to yield ground before the superior number of the german host one of the wound who be take to hospital at dieppe say of the fighting at charlerous : we army be engage what we believe to be a section of the german force command by the crown prince when i be wound the german at one stage of the battle seem lose they have be defend themselves almost entirely with howitzer from strongly intrenched position the german be seemingly surround and cut off and be summon to surrender the reply come back that so long as they have ammunition they would continue to fight the howitzer shell of the german seem enormous thing and only explode when they strike the earth when one would descend it would dig a hole a yard deep and split into hundred of piece peculiarly enough the howitzer shell do much more wounding than kill the other shell of the german like cartridge the supply of which they seem to be short of do only little damage aero constantly above the german aeroplane service be perfect a aircraft be always hover over we out of range we be certain within a hour after we sight a aeroplane to get the howitzer among we whenever we fire however we do terrific execution with we seventy-five piece of artillery i count in one trench 185 dead many of they be kill as they be in the act of firing or load the ground occupy by the german be so thick with dead that i believe i see one soldier to every two yard you might have walk for a mile on body without ever put foot to the ground they bury they dead when they have time pile fifteen or twenty in a shallow pit the french in alsace-lorraine on August 9 the advance guard brigade of

the way the great army have never falter in its 150-mile advance in belgium but the numerical might of the german advance be match by the masterly tactic of the ally in retire by these tactic in which general joffre the french commander-in-chief co-operate with the british field-marshal sir john french the ally prevent they line be overwhelm by the superior number of they foe but the german right

distance and consist of not less than sixteen fort those farthest advanced be hardly half a mile distant from the main wall the experience of the last war the immense progress of the artillery and especially the wider reach of the modern siege gun induce the french army authority to build a belt of still stronger fort which surround the old fortress of 1870 like a protective net the fort redoubt and battery belong to this last belt of fortification be situate at least two mile from the city limit proper and even versaille be take into this belt of fortification the circumference of

st cyr haut-bue villera and palaiseau to which the large redubt of bois d'arey and the fort of chatillon and hautes-bruyere situate a little to the rear belong likewise to invest this strongest fortress of the world the line of the german ought to have a length of 175 kilometer and to its continuous occupation even if the ring of the invest mass be not very deep a much greater number of troops would be necessary than be use in 1870 for the siege of pari german ammunition capture a correspondent at nanteuil September 12 thus describe the capture of a german ammunition column while the german be feel they way toward paris : the seven-kilometer column be wind its way along crepy-en-valoi when general pan send cavalry and artillery to intercept it the column be too weakly guard to cope with the attack and so be capture and destroy this capture have a important bearing on the subsequent fight a noticeable feature of the operation have be the splendid march quality of the french troops this be display especially when two division which be send to intercept the expect attempt of the german to invest pari cover eighty kilometer -lrb- 49 1\/2 mile -rrb- in two stage ally plan to protect paris the plan of the ally on September 1 be to make a determine stand before paris in the effort to protect the city from the horror of a siege with they left wing rest on the strongly fortify line of the paris fort and with they right wing strengthen by the defensive line from verdun to belfort they would occupy a position of enormous military strength if the german concentrate to move against they front the french reserve army could assemble west of the seine move forward and attack the german invade column in flank if in they effort to continue the great turn movement the german push forward across the seine and attempt by encircle pari to gain the rear of the ally army the french could mass they reserve corps behind they center at reim push forward against the weakened german center in a attack that if successful would cut off the german invade column and expose they to annihilation such be the condition and the possibility when the german advance reach its

right of the line on September 4 change the direction of they advance to a southeasterly course which would leave paris to the west the people of the gay capital who for several day have be prepare themselves once more for the thunder of the prussian gun begin to breathe more freely while all the world wonder at the sudden and spectacular transformation in the condition of the conflict what have happen why be the advance thus check and the march on pari abandon be it a trick design to lead the ally into a trap or be the german troops too exhaust by force march and lack of rest to face the determine resistance of the ally force before paris these be the question on every tongue on both side of the atlantic while the military expert seek strategic reason for the change in german plan when the movement towards the east begin the right of the german force move through beaumont and l'isle towards meaux apparently with the intention of avoid paris they front some twenty-four hour later be find to be extend across the river marne as far south as conlommier and la ferte-gaucher the two oppose line at that time stretch between pari on the left flank and verdun on the right on Monday September 7 there come news that the southward movement of the german army have be arrest and that it have be force back across the marne to position where the german right wing curve back from

we troops Sunday September 6 be south of the river marne with the french force in line on we right and leave practically there have be no change since Saturday September 5 which mark the end of we army 's long retirement from the belgian frontier through northern france on Friday September 4 it become apparent that there be a alteration in the advance of almost the whole of the first german army that army since the battle near mon on the 23d of August have be play its part in a colossal strategic endeavor to create a sedan for the ally by out-flanking and envelop the left of they whole line so as to encircle and drive both the british and french to the south the change in german strategy there be now a change in its objective and it be observe that the german force opposite the british be begin to move in a southeasterly direction instead of continue southwest on to the capital leave a strong rear guard along the line of the river ourcq -lrb- which flow south of and join the marne at lizy-sur-ourcq -rrb- to keep off the french sixth army which by then have be form and be to the northwest of pari they be evidently execute what amount to a flank march diagonally across we front prepare to ignore the british as be drive out of the fight they be initiate a effort to attack the left flank of the main french army which stretch in a long curved line from we right toward the east and so to carry out against it alone a envelopment which so far have fail against the combined force of the ally on Saturday the 5th this movement on the part of the german be continue and large advance party cross the marne southward at trilport sammeron la ferte-sous-jouarre and chateau thierry there be considerable fighting with the french fifth army on the french left which fall back from

the french fifth which capture three village at the point of bayonet ally take the offensive on Monday September 7 there be a general advance on the part of the ally in this quarter of the field we force which have now be reinforce push on in a northeasterly direction in co-operation with the advance of the french fifth army to the north and of the french sixth army to the eastward against the german rearguard along the river ourcq possibly weaken by the detachment of troops to the eastern theater of operation and realize that the action of the french sixth army against the line of ourcq and the advance of the british place they own flanking movement in considerable danger of be take in the rear and on its flank the german on this day commence to retire toward the northeast this be the first time that these troops have turn back since they attack at mon a fortnight before and from report receive the order to retreat when so close to pari be a bitter disappointment from letter find on dead soldier there be no doubt there be a general impression among the enemy 's troops that they be about to enter paris german retreat be hasten on Tuesday September 8 the german movement north-eastward be continue they rear guard on the south of the marne be be press back to that river by we troops and by the french on we right the latter capture three village after a hand-to-hand fight and the infliction of severe loss on the enemy the fight along the ourcq continue on this day and be of the most sanguinary character for the german have mass a great force of artillery along this line very few of they infantry be see by the french the french fifth army also make a fierce attack on the german in montmirail regain that place on Wednesday September 9 the battle between the french sixth army and what be now the german flank guard along the ourcq continue the british corps overcome some resistance on the river petit morin cross the marne in pursuit of the german who now be hastily retreat northwest one of we corps be delay by a obstinate defense make by a strong rear guard with machine gun at la ferte-sous-jouarre where the bridge have be destroy on Thursday September 10 the french sixth army continue its pressure on the west while the fifth army by force march reach the line of chateau thierry and dorman on the marne we troops also continue the pursuit on the north of the latter river and after a considerable amount of fight capture some 1500 prisoner four gun six machine gun and fifty transport wagon many of the enemy be kill or wound and the numerous thick wood which dot the country north of the marne be fill with german straggler most of they appear to have be without food for at least two day indeed in this area of the operation the german seem to be demoralize and incline to surrender in small party the general situation appear to be most favorable to the ally much brutal and senseless damage have be do in the village occupy by the enemy property have be wantonly destroy picture in chateaus have be rip up and house generally have be pillage it be state on unimpeachable authority also that the inhabitant have be much ill-treated trap in a sunken road interesting incident have occur during the fighting on the 10th of September part of we second army corps advance into the north find itself march parallel with another infantry force some little distance away at first it be think this be another british unit after some time however it be discover that it be a body of german retreat measure promptly be take to head off the enemy who be surround and trap in a sunken road where over 400 man surrender on September 10 a small party under a noncommissioned officer be cut off and surround after a desperate resistance it be decide to go on fight to the end finally the noncommissioned officer and one man only be leave both of they be wound the german come up and shout to they : ` lay down you arm ' the german commander however sign to they to keep they arm and then ask to shake hand with the wound noncommissioned officer who be carry off on he stretcher with he rifle by he side arrival of reinforcement and the continue advance have delighted we troops who be full of zeal and anxious to press on success of the fly corps one of the feature of the campaign on we side have be the success obtain by the royal fly corps in regard to the collection of information it be impossible either to award too much praise to we aviator for the way they have carry out they duty or to overestimate the value of the intelligence collect more especially during the recent advance in due course certain example of what have be effect may be specify and the far-reaching nature of the result fully explain but that time have not arrive that the service of we fly corps which have really be on trial be fully appreciate by we ally be show by the follow message from the commander-in-chief of the french army receive September by field marshal lord kitchener : ` please express most particularly to marshal french my thanks for the service render on every day by the english fly corps the precision exactitude and regularity of the news bring in by its member be evidence of they perfect organization and also of the perfect training of the pilot and the observer -- joseph joffre general ' to give a rough idea of the amount of work carry out it be sufficient to mention that during a period of twenty day up to the 10th of September a daily average of more than nine reconnaissance flight of over 100 mile each have be maintain five german pilot shoot the constant object of we aviator have be to effect a accurate location of the enemy 's force and incidentally since the operation cover so large a area of we own unit nevertheless the tactic adopt for deal with hostile air craft be to attack they instantly with one or more british machine this have be so far successful that in five case german pilot or observer have be shoot while in the air and they machine bring to grind as a consequence the british fly corps have succeed in establish a individual ascendancy which be as serviceable to we as it be dangerous to the enemy how far it be due to this cause it be not possible at present to ascertain definitely but the fact remain that the enemy have recently become much less enterprising in they flight something in the direction of the mastery of the air already have be gain in pursuance of the principle that the main object of military aviator be the collection of information bomb drop have not be indulge in to any great extent on one occasion a petrol bomb be successfully explode in a german bivouac at night while from a diary find on a dead german cavalry soldier it have be discover that a high explosive bomb throw at a cavalry column from one of we aeroplane strike a ammunition wagon result in a explosion which kill fifteen of the enemy loss at the marne enormous some idea of the terrific character of the fighting at the marne and of the great loss in the prolonged battle may be gain from the follow story telegraph on September 14 by a correspondent who follow in the rear of the ally army : general von kluck 's host in come down over the marne and the grand morin river to sezanne twenty-five mile southwest of epernay meet little opposition and i believe little opposition be intend the ally in fact lead they opponent straight into a trap the english cavalry lead the tired german mile after mile and the german believe the englishman be run away when the tremendous advance reach provin the ally ' plan be accomplish and it get no farther fight Sunday September 6 be of a terrible character and begin at dawn in the region of la ferte-gaucher the ally ' troops who be draw up to receive the german understand it would be they duty to hold on they very best that the attack force at meaux might achieve its task in security the battle last all night and until late Monday the germany artillery fire be very severe but not accurate the french and english fight sternly on and slowly beat the enemy back attempt of the german to cross the marne at meaux entail terrible loss sixteen attempt be foiled by the french artillery fire direct on the river and in one trench 600 dead german be count country strew with dead the whole country be strew with the dead and die when at last the german retire they slacken they rifle fire and in once place retire twelve mile without firing a single shot one prisoner declare that they be short of ammunition and have be tell to spare it as much as possible Monday see a tremendous encounter on the oureq in one village which the german hurriedly vacate the french in a large house find a dinner table beautifully set with candle still burn on the table where evidently the german staff have be dine a woman occupant say they flee precipitately there be a great deal of hand-to-hand fighting and bayonet work on the ourcq which result in the terrible magdeburg regiment beat a retreat Monday night general von kluck 's army have be throw back from the marne and from the morin and to the region of sezanne and he position be serious immediate step be necessary to save he line of communication and retreat to this end reinforcement be hurry north to the meaux district and the ourcq and tremendous effort be make to break up the french resistance in this section german gun be silence the second attempt on the oureq share the fate of the first though all Monday night and well on into Tuesday the great german gun boom along this river the resistance of the ally could not be break ` hold on ' be the command and every man brace himself to obey while the ourcq be be hold the struggle of sezanne be bear fruit the german resistance on Thursday morning be break i hear the news in two way : from the silence of the german gun and from the wound who pour down to the basis the wound man no longer be downheart but eager to rejoin the fray on every french lip be the exclamation that ` they be in full retreat ' and ` they be rush back home ' and in the same breath come generous recognition of the great help give by the british army the number of wound entail colossal transportation work i count fifteen train in eight hour a fine grim set of man terribly weary but amiable except for the officer german leave spoil behind the enemy cross the marne on the return journey north under great difficulty and beneath a withering fire from the british troops who pursue they hotly the german artillery operate from a height there be again much hand-to-hand fighting and the river be swollen with dead Tuesday night the british be in possession of la ferte-sous-jouarre and chateau thierry and the german have fall back forty mile leave a long train of spoil behind they on the same day in the neighborhood of vitry-le-françois the french troops achieve a victory incidentally they drive back the famous imperial guard of germany from sezanne toward the swamp of saint cond where a century ago napoleon achieve one of he last success the main body of the guard pass to the north of the swamp but i hear of man and horse engulf and destroy ` it be we revenge for 1814 ' the french officer say ` if only the emperor be here to see ' british keep up pursuit Wednesday the english army continue the pursuit toward the north take gun and prisoner on that day i find myself in a new france the good news have spread girl throw flower at the pass soldier and joy be manifest everywhere the incident of Wednesday will astound the world when make know in full i know that two german detachment of 1000 man each which be surround and corner but which refuse to surrender be wipe out almost to the last man the keynote of these operation be the tremendous attack of the ally along the ourcq Tuesday which show the german commander that he line be threaten then come the crowning stroke the army of the ourcq and of meaux and the army of sezanne draw together like the blade of a pair of shears the pivot of which be in the region of the grand morin the german retreat be thus force toward the east and it speedily become a rout retreat see from the sky the best view of the retreat german army be obtain accord to a pari report by a french military airman who ascend from a point near vitry fly northward across the marne and then eastward by way of rheim down to the region of verdun and back again in a zigzag course to a spot near soisson he see the german host not merely in retreat but in flight and in some place in disorderly flight it be a wonderful sight the airman say to look down upon these hundred and thousand of move military column the long gray line of the kaiser 's pick troops some march in a northerly other in a northeasterly direction and all move with a tremendous rapidity the retreat be not confine to the highway but many german soldier be run across field jump over fence crawl through hedge and make they way through wood without any semblance of order or discipline these man doubtless belong to regiment which be badly cut up in the fierce fighting which precede the general retreat deprive of the majority of they officer they make a mere rabble of fugitive many be without rifle have abandon they weapon in they haste to escape they french and british pursuer german abandon gun the london time correspondent describe the german retreat in a hurricane with rain descend in torrent the wayside brook swollen to little torrent the gun wheel sink deep in the mud and the soldier unable to extricate they abandon the gun he say a wounded soldier return from the front tell I that the german flee as animal flee which be corner and know it imagine the roadway litter with gun knapsack cartridge belt maxim and heavy cannon there be mile of road like this and the dead those pile of horse and those stack of man i have see again and again i have see man shoot so close to one another that they remain standing after death at night time the sight be horrible beyond description they can not bury whole army in the day time over the field of dead carrion bird gather lead by the gray-throated crow of evil omen with a host of lesser marauder at he back robber too have descend upon these field trainload after trainload of british and french troops sweep toward the weak point of the retreat host the ally benefit by this advantage of the battle-ground there be a network of railway like the network of a spider 's web fight describe by we officer two military attach of the united state embassy at paris lieut-col h t allen and capt frank parker both of the eleventh cavalry usa return on September 15 from a automobile trip over the battlefield where from September 8 until the night of September 11 the french and german be fiercely engage this battle be the one which assure the safety of pari on September 1 the german left and center be separate but like a letter v be approach each other with pari as they objective have the ally attack at that time they would have have to divide they force and so weakened give battle to two army by retreat they draw after they the two converge line of the v and when the german be in wedge-shaped formation attack they on the flank and center at meaux and make a direct attack at sezanne the four day ' battle at meaux end with the german cross the river aisne and retreat to the hill north and west of soisson col allen and capt parker see the end of the battle north of sezanne which result in the retreat of the german to rheim the battle as col allen and capt parker describe they be as follow : on the 8th the german advance from a line stretch from epernay and chalon a distance of twenty-five kilometer -lrb- sixteen mile -rrb- in this front counting from the german right be the tenth the guard the ninth and twelfth army corps the presence of the guard the _ corps d'elite _ of the german army suggest that this be intend to be a main attack upon pari and that the army at meaux be to occupy the center the four combine corps number over 200000 the french meet they they assert with 190000 the german advance until they left be at vitry-le-francoi and they right rest at sezanne make a column 15 mile long head west toward paris the french but the line six mile east of sezanne in the forest of la fere and champenoise it be here that the greater part of the fight occur it be fight at long distance with artillery and from trench to trench with the bayonet thirty thousand man kill during the four day in which fortune rest first on one flag and then on another 30000 man of both army be say to have be kill and a considerable number of village be wipe from the map by the artillery of both army two mile from sezanne a french regiment be destroy by a ambush the german have throw up conspicuous trench and with decoy sparsely fill they from the forest in the rear the mitrailleuse be train on the french the french infantry charge this trench and the decoy flee make toward the flank and as the french pour over the trench the hidden gun sweep they in another trench the american attach count the body of more than 900 german guard not one of whom have attempt to retreat they have stand fast with they shoulder against the parapet and take the cold steel everywhere the loss of life be appalling in place the dead lay across each other three and four deep turco fiercest fighter of all the fiercest fighting of all seem to have be do by the turco and senegalese in trench take by they from the guard and the famous death 's head hussar the german show no bullet wound in nearly every attack the man from the desert have fling themselves upon the enemy use only the butt or the bayonet man for man no white man drug for year with meat and alcohol be a physical match for these turco who eat date and drink water say richard harding davi who see the end of the fighting at meaux they be as lean as starve wolf they move like panther they be muscle and nerve and they have the warrior 's disregard of they own personal safety in battle and a perfect scorn of the foe as kipling say ' a man who have a sneak desire to live have a poor chance against one who be indifferent whether he kill you or you kill he ' night battle describe by soldier the follow narrative of a night engagement during the prolonged battle of the marne be quote from a french soldier 's letter to a compatriot in london : we strength be about 400 infantryman toward midnight we break up we camp and march off in great silence of course not in closed file but in open order we be not allow to speak to each other or to make any unnecessary noise and as we walk through the forest the only sound to be hear be that of we step and the rustling of the leave it be a perfectly lovely night the sky be so clear the atmosphere so pure the forest so romantic everything seem so charming and peaceful that i could not imagine that we be on the warpath and that perhaps in a few hour this forest would be aflame the soil drench by human blood and the fragrant herb cover with broken limb yet all those silent armed man march in the same direction as i do be ever so many proof that no peace meeting or any delightful romantic adventure be near and i wonder what thought be stir all those brain suddenly a whisper pass on from man to man it be the officer 's command a halt be make and in the same whisper we be tell that part of we have to change we direction so that the two direction would form a v a third division proceed slowly in the original direction command be whisper i belong to what may be call the left leg of the v after what seem to be about half a hour we reach the edge of the forest and from behind the tree we see a almost flat country before we with here and there a tiny little hill a mere hump four or five foot high on the extreme left-hand side the land seem to be intersect by ditch and trench another whisper command be pass from man to man and we all have to lie down on the soil a moment afterward we be thus make we way to the above-mentioned ditch and trench it be neither the easiest nor the quickest way to move but undoubtedly the safest for a occasional enemy somewhere on the hill at the farther end of the field would not possibly be able to detect we i do not know how long it take we to reach the ditch which be for the greater part dry nor do i know how long we remain there or what be happen we be perfectly hide from view lie flat down on we stomach but we be also unable to see anything everybody 's ear be attentive every nerve be strain the sun be rise it promise to be a hot day first shoot be hear suddenly we hear a shot at a distance of what seem to be a mile or so follow by several other shot i venture to lift my body up in order to see what be happen but the next moment my sergeant who be close by I warn I with a knock on my shoulder not to move and the whisper order run ` keep quiet hide yourself ' still the short glance have be sufficient to see what be go on we troops probably those who have be leave behind in the forest be cross the plain and shooting at the german on the crest of the hill who return the fire the silence be go we hear the rush of foot at a short distance then suddenly it cease when the attack soldier drop to aim and shoot some firing be hear and then again a swift rush follow this seem to last a long time but it be break by distant cry come apparently from the enemy i be wonder all the time why we keep hidden and do not share in the assault the rifle fire be incessant i see nothing of the battle would we troops be able to repulse the german how strong be the enemy they seem to have no gun but the number of we soldier in that field be not very large attack with bayonet a piercing yell rise from the enemy be it a cry of triumph a short command ring over the field in french a order to retreat a swift rush follow we troops be be pursue by the enemy what on earth be we wait for in we ditch a bugle signal clear and bright we spring to we foot and ` at the bayonet ' the order come we throw ourselves on the enemy who be at the same time attack on the other side by the division which form the other ` leg ' of the v while the ` flee ' french soldier turn and make a savage attack it be impossible to say or to describe what one feel at such a moment i believe one be in a state of temporary madness of perfect rage it be terrible and if we could see ourselves in such a state i feel sure we would shrink with horror in a few minute the field be cover with dead and wounded man almost all of they german and we hand and bayonet be drip with blood i feel hot spurt of blood in my face of other man 's blood and as i pause to wipe they off i see a narrow stream of blood run along the barrel of my rifle such be the beginning of a summer day scene on the battlefield write from sezanne a few day after the battle of the marne a visitor to the battlefield describe the condition at that time as follow : the territory over which the battle of the marne be fight be now a picture of devastation abomination and death almost too awful to describe many son of the fatherland be sleep they last sleep in the open field and in ditch where they fall or under hedge where they crawl after be catch by a rifle bullet or piece of shell or where they seek shelter from the mad rush of the franc-tireur who have not lose they natural dexterity with the knife and who at close quarter frequently throw away they rifle and fight hand to hand the german prisoner be be use on the battlefield in search for and bury they dead comrade over the greater part of the huge battlefield there have be bury at least those who die in open trench on the plateau or on the high road the extensive forest area however have hardly be search for body although hundred of both french and german must have seek refuge and die there the difficulty of find body be considerable on account of the undergrowth long line of newly break brown earth mark the grave of the victim some of these burial trench be 150 yard long the dead are place shoulder to shoulder and often in layer this give some idea of the slaughter that take place in this battle the peasant who be rapidly come back to the scene be mark the grave trench with cross and plant flower above or place on they simple bouquet of dahlia sunflower and rose fight on beautiful chateau lawn some of the hottest fighting of the prolonged battle take place around the beautiful chateau of mondement on a hill six mile east of sezanne this relic of the architectural art of loui xiv occupy a position which both side regard as strategically important to the east it look down into a great declivity in the shape of a immense greek lamp with the conceal marsh of st sond at the bottom beyond be the downs and heath of epernay rheim and champagne while the height of argonne stand out boldly in the distance to the west be a rich agricultural country the possession of the ridge of mondement be vital to either the attacker or the defender the conflict here be of furnace intensity for four day the german drive the french out in a terrific assault and then the french gun be bring to bear follow by hand-to-hand fighting on the garden and lawn of the chateau and even through the breach wall frenchman again hold the building for a few hour only to retire before another determine german attack on the fourth day they sweep the german out again with shell fire under which the wall of the chateau although two or three foot thick crumple like paper the same correspondent describe evidence on the battlefield of how abundantly the german be equip with ammunition and other material he see pyramid after pyramid of shrapnel shell abandon in the rout also innumerable panier for carry such ammunition these panier be carefully construct of wicker and hold three shell in exactly fitting tube so that there can be no movement the village of oye villeneuve chatillon and soizy-aux-boi be all bombard and completely destroy some fantastic caper be play by the shell such as blow away half a house and leave the other half intact go through a window and out by the back wall without damage the interior or go a few inch into the wall and remain fast without explode villeneuve which be retake three time be include its fine old church in absolute ruin a series of battle the battle line along the marne be so extend that the four-day ' fighting from Sunday September 6 to Thursday morning September 10 when the german be in full retreat comprise a series of bloody engagement each worthy of be call a battle there be hot encounter south of the marne at crecy montmirail and other point at chalons-sur-marne the french fight for twenty-four hour and inflict heavy loss on the enemy general exelman one of france 's most brilliant cavalry leader be dangerously wound in lead a charge there be hard fighting on September 7 between lagny and meaux on the trilport and crecy-en-brie line the german under general von kluck be compel to give way and retire on meaux at which point they resistance be break on the 9th general french 's army advance to meet the german host with forced march from they temporary base to the southeast of paris the whole british army except cavalry pass through lagny and the incoming troops be so wearied that many of they at the first opportunity lay down in the dust and sleep where they be but a few hour ' rest work a great change and a little later the british troops be follow the german retreat up the valley with bulldog tenacity the british artillery do notable work in those day accord to the french military surgeon who be station at lagny at point near there the body of slay german who fall before the british gunner still litter the ground on September 10 and the grim crop be still heavier on the soil farther up the valley where the fighting be more desperate as far as possible the body be bury at night each attend to its own fall many sanguinary incident sanguinary incident be plentiful in the week of fight to the south of the marne in a engagement not far from lagny the british capture thirty german who have give up they arm and be stand under guard when encourage by a sudden forward effort of the german front they make a dash for they rifle they be cut down by a volley from they british guard before they could reach they weapon among dramatic incident in the fight accord to a english correspondent may be mention the grim work at the ancient fishpond near ermenonville these pond be shut in by high tree drive the enemy through the wood a scotch regiment hustle its foe right into the fishpond the scotchman jump in after the german up to the middle to finish they in the water which be pack with they body this scene be illustrate on another page vast graveyard at meaux some idea of how the german be harass by artillery fire during they retreat be obtain on a visit to the field near meaux the scene of severe fight the german infantry have take a position in a sunken road on either side of which be stretch in extended line hummock some of they natural and some the work of spade in the hand of german soldier the sunken road be litter with body sprawl in ghastly fashion the face have almost the same greenish-gray hue as the uniform wear the road be line with poplar the branch of which sever by fragment of shell be strew among the dead in place whole top of tree have be tear away by the artillery fire beside many body be forty or fifty empty cartridge shell while fragment of clothing cap and knapsack be scatter about this destruction be work by battery a little more than three mile distant straggle clump of wood intervene between the battery and they mark but the range have be determine by a officer on a elevation a mile from the gunner he telephone direction for the firing and through glass watch the burst shell the battle at crecy a graphic picture of the fight in crecy wood be give by a correspondent who say : the french and english in overwhelming number have pour in from lagny toward the river marne to reinforce the flanking skirmisher one of the smaller wood southeast of crecy furnished cover for the enemy for a time but lead to they undoing the ally ' patrol discover they in the night as the german be move about with lantern suddenly the invader find they twinkling glow-worm the mark for a foe of whom they have be unaware without warn a midnight hail storm from maxim scream through the tree the next morning score of lantern be pick up in the wood with the glass shatter a dash cavalry charge by the british finally clear the tragic wood of the german british blow up a bridge at lagny one of the sight of the town be a shatter bridge which be blow up by general french as soon as he get he army across it at that time british infantry and artillery have pour through the town and over the bridge for several day general french 's idea be to keep raiding detachment of german cavalry from incursion into the beautiful villa and garden of the western suburb fifteen minute after the bridge have be reduce to a twisted mass of steel and broken masonry a belated order come to save it but the british engineer who have receive the order to destroy it have do they work well the inhabitant be clear out of all the neighbor house which be shake by the terrific explosion when the charge be set off every window in the nearby house be shatter the people of lagny take the destruction of they beautiful bridge in good part they be too grateful for they deliverance from the german to grumble about the wreck bridge german loss at the marne there be no doubt that the german loss in the engagement at the marne far exceed those of the ally and be most severe in both man and material the german make incredible effort to cross the marne the french have destroy all the bridge the german try to construct three bridge of boat sixteen time the bridge be on the point of completion but each time they be reduce to matchwood by the french artillery there be not the slightest doubt say a reliable correspondent that but for the superb handling of the german right by general von kluck a large part of emperor william 's force would have be capture at the marne the ally cavalry do wonder and three or four additional division of cavalry could have contribute towards a complete rout of the german the general direction of the german retirement be northeast and it be continue for seventy mile to a line draw between soisson rheim and verdun a week after the battle the field around meaux have be clear of dead and wounded and only little mound with tiny cross flower and tricolored flag recall the terrible struggle the inhabitant of neighbor village soon return to they home and resume they ordinary occupation fall of maubeuge while the fighting at the marne be in progress german troops achieve some success in other part of the theater of war thus the fortified french town of maubeuge on the sambre river midway between namur in belgium and st quentin france fall to the german on September 7 the investment begin on August 25 more than a thousand shell fall in one night near the railway station and the rue de france be partially destroy the loss of life however be comparatively slight at 11:50 o'clock on the morning of September 7 a white flag be hoist on the church tower and trumpet sound cease firing but the firing only cease at 3:08 o'clock that afternoon in the meantime the greater part of the garrison succeed in evacuate the town the german force march in at 7:08 o'clock that evening the retreat of the german force from the marne end the second stage of the great war chapter xii the russian campaign _ slow mobilization of troops -- invasion of german and austrian territory -- cossack lead the van -- early success in east prussium -- on to berlin -- heavy loss inflict on austrian -- german troops rush to the defense of the eastern territory _ when at 7:30 o'clock on the evening of August 1 1914 the german ambassador at st petersburg hand the declaration of war to the russian foreign minister the immediate reason be that russium have refuse to stop mobilize she army as request by germany on July 30 the general mobilization of the russian army and fleet be proclaim on July 31 and martial law be proclaimed forthwith in germany the government of the kaiser have give russium twenty-four hour in which to reply to its ultimatum of the 30th russium pay no attention to the ultimatum but m goremykin president of the council of the russian empire issue a manifesto which read : russium be determine not to allow servium to be crushed and will fulfill its duty in regard to that small kingdom which have already suffer so much at austrium 's hand austria-hungary declare war against russium on August 6 from that time on the russian army have two main objective -- first the austrian province of galicium and second the eastern frontier of germany across which lay the territory know as east prussium and while the early day of the great conflict see a german host pour into belgium animated by the battle-cry on to pari the gathering legion of the czar head to the west and cross the prussian frontier with hoarse resounding shout of on to berlin mobilization be slow the mobilization of the russian army be slow compare with that of germany france and austrium and some week elapse after the declaration of war before russium be prepare to attack germany with the full force of which it be capable the immense distance to be traverse by troops proceed to the frontier and by the reserve to they respective depot cause delay that be unavoidable but be minimize by the eagerness of the russian soldiery to get to the front in russium as in all the other great country engage in the conflict with the probable exception of austrium the war be popular and a wave of patriotic enthusiasm and martial ardor sweep over the land from the baltic to the black sea from st petersburg to siberium in russium military service be universal and begin at the age of 20 continue for twenty-three year there be three division of the russian army -- the european caucasian and asiatic army military service of the russian consist of three year in the first line fourteen year in the reserve -lrb- during which time he have to undergo two period of training of six week each -rrb- and five year in the territorial reserve the cossack however hold they land by military tenure and be liable to serve at any time in the army they provide they own horse and accouterment the total strength of the russian army be about 5500000 man the field force of the european army consist of 1000000 soldier with about the same number in the second line there be besides at the beginning of the war over 5000000 man unorganized but available for duty army reorganize recently since the disastrous war with japan the russian army have be reorganize and it have profit largely by the harsh experience of the manchurian campaign the physique of the russian infantryman be second to none in europe the russian moujik -lrb- peasant -rrb- be from childhood accustom to cover long distance on foot so that march of from 30 to 40 mile be cover without fatigue by even the youngest recruit they wear long boot which be make of excellent soft leather so that sore foot be quite the exception even in manchurium where very long march be undergo by many of the unit each regiment of infantry contain four battalion command by a major or lieutenant-colonel the battalion consist of four company of man command by a captain so that each regiment on a war footing number upward of 2000 man the russian cavalry be divide into two main category there be the heavy regiment of the guard which consist mainly of lancer regiment and there be also numberless cossack or irregular cavalry regiment which be recruit chiefly from the district of the river don and the highland of the caucasus the horse of the russian horse and field artillery be distinctly poor and very inferior to those of the cavalry the artillery be therefore somewhat slow in come into action but the horse while weedy-looking be very hardy and pull the gun up steep gradient the russian gunner prefer to take up indirect rather than direct position battery be also rather slow in change position and in move up in support of they infantry unit the russian cossack what the uhlan be to the german army the cossack of the don and the caucasus be to the russian -- scout advance guard and cover cavalry they be good all-round fighter capable of long-continued effort and tireless in the saddle they be also train to fight in dismounted action as a soldier the cossack be altogether unique he way be he own and he confidence in he officer and himself be perfect he passionate love of horse make he work a pleasure the cossack seat on horseback be on a high pad-saddle with the knee almost vertical and the heel well draw back spur be not worn and another remarkable thing be that he have absolutely no guard to he sword the russian soldier scorn button he say they be a nuisance they have to be clean they wear away the cloth they be heavy and they attract the attention of the enemy the cossack pony be a quaint little beast to look at but the finest animal living for he work and very remarkable for he wonderful power of endurance the cossack and he mount have be liken to a clever nurse and a spoilt child -- each understand and love the other but neither be completely under control the cossack do not want he horse to be a slave and recognize perfectly that horse like child have they whim and humor and must be coax and reason with but rarely punish the famous knout -lrb- whip -rrb- be carry by the cossack at the end of a strap across the left shoulder most of the man be beard and in full dress with the high fur cap stick jauntily on the head of square cut hair the cossack present a picturesque and martial figure the appearance of these man be quite different from that of the clean-shaven regular infantryman of the russian army russian plan of campaign while the direct objective of the russian be berlin there be many reason why a bee-line course could not be follow germany have prepare a elaborate defense system to cover the direct approach to berlin and the fortress of danzig graudenz thorn and posen be important point in this scheme the nature of the country also adapt itself to these defensive work and would make progress slow for a attacker moreover as austrium and she force mobilize before russium a diversion be create by the austrian invasion of south poland in which the german also take the offensive under these circumstance the russian plan of campaign resolve itself into three part : -- -lrb- 1 -rrb- a northern movement from kovno and grodno on insterburg and königsberg as a counter-attack -lrb- 2 -rrb- a central movement from warsaw towards posen with support movement north and south -lrb- 3 -rrb- a southern movement on lublin in poland to repulse the invader combine with a movement from the east on lemberg in order to turn the austrian flank the first purpose of russium be to clear poland of enemy as they threaten the russian left flank at the same time russium take the offensive by a invasion of prussium in the north this latter movement lead to a victory at gumbinnen and the investment of königsberg later come victory at lublin roll back the austrian and the capture of lemberg which signalize the russian invasion of austrian territory thus russium be for awhile clear of the enemy while she establish a strong footing in both prussium and austrium -lrb- illustration : the russian plan of campaign in the above view the german line of defense be show black the austrian line of defense be indicate by cross line and the russian advance be show by arrow -rrb- we can now understand the main russian plan a little better in the north the army be to advance from königsberg and endeavor to cut off danzig and break the line of defens between that place and thorn thus leave this fortress in the rear in the south the austrian already heavily punish would be drive back on the carpathian pass to the south and westward also toward cracow which be the key to the situation if cracow fall russium would have a good route into germany and the move would be support by advance from warsaw thus threatening breslau from two side german troops hurry east early in September however the danger of the russian advance into germany which apparently have give the german general staff but little concern at first be fully realize and large body of german troops be detach from the western theater of war and hurry to the eastern frontier germany have evidently reckon on austrium be able to hold its ground better and be badly prepare for a flanking move on breslau so early in the campaign but the servian and russian defeat of austrium leave germany to bear the full force of the terrific russian onslaught and she force prove equal to the occasion under general von hindenberg the german army of the east soon repel the russian invader and force they to retire from east prussium across they own border where they be follow by the german a series of engagement on russian soil follow in which the advantage lay as a rule with the german the loss on both side be heavy but the german capture many thousand of russian prisoner and considerable quantity of arm and munitions of war the immense resource of the russian empire in man and material make the problem of russian invasion a very serious one for germany this be fully realize by the kaiser who about October 1 at the end of the second month of the war proceed in person to he eastern frontier to direct the defensive operation against russium czar nichola at the front about the same time the czar nichola ii also take the field in person arrive at the front on October 5 accompany by general soukhomlinoff the russian minister of war i be resolve to go to berlin itself even if it cause I to lose my last moujik -lrb- peasant -rrb- the czar be report as say in September the spirit and temper of the russian government may be judge by the fact that before the war be many day old the name of the russian capital be officially change from st petersburg which be consider to have a german flavor to petrograd a purely russian or slavic form of nomenclature russium prepare to strike austrium by the third week of August accord to a announcement from petrograd russian troops have check a attempt by the austrian to enter poland from the galician frontier and be prepare to invade austrium on a large scale at that time russium be say to have 2000 man under arm for the invasion of germany and austrium also 500000 on the roumanian and turkish border and 3000000 man in reserve -lrb- the latter be call out by imperial ukase before czar nichola start for the front -rrb- the pole have be promise self-government and have be call on to support russium the jews throughout the russian empire be also promise a greater measure of protection freedom of action and civil rights these measure inaugurate a era of better feeling in russium and poland and be strongly approve by the ally of russium most of the austrian reserve be mobilize by August 15 and germany 's ally announce that she would soon have she total war strength of 2000000 man in the field austrium send some troops to join the german force in belgium and a army of several hundred thousand man be gather along the austro-russian frontier under command of the archduke frederick general rennenkampf be in command of the russian force for the invasion of east prussium while general russky lead the russian army operating against galicium invasion of prussium within a week the russian movement in eastern germany assume menacing proportion the great army of invasion have move rapidly consider the natural obstacle more than 800000 man be send over the border into prussium the german evacuate a number of town after set they afire and a considerable part of the kaiser 's eastern field force be bottle up in military center germany 's active field force be at this time inferior in number to the invade army by the capture of insterberg the russian paralyze one of the main german strategic center and gain control of a important railroad the german twentieth army corps be report to have be route near lyck at the start the russian force extend from insterberg to goldapp a distance of about thirty-two mile seventy-five mile further on be the first of the two strong german line of fortification early victory be claim by the russian in they advance into austrium which be make slowly austrium then turn to fight the russian invasion it be force to gather all its force for this principal struggle and hence retire from offensive operation against the servian unless she could halt the russian pour in from the north a success against servium could do she no good by the first of September the russian advance into east prussium be well under way and the strong fortress of königsberg be in danger of a siege german troops be be rush to its defense in galicium there be fierce encounter between the russian invader and the austrian several victory be claim by the russian all along the line and whole brigade of austrian troops be report destroy while the russian loss be also admittedly heavy the fiercest fighting occur in the vicinity of lemberg the capital of galicium which be soon to fall to general russky the austrian attack on russian poland fail and the austrian be drive back across they own frontier the russian be seek to destroy the hope of the kaiser for help from austrium in eastern germany where the russian advance ridicule or belittle by germany before it begin become more menacing every day the german war plan have contemplate a quick decisive blow in france and then a rapid turn to the east to meet the russian with a tremendous force but the belligerency of the belgian and the cooperation of the british balk these plan while the russian move faster than be expect by they foe austrium have fail everywhere to stop the czar 's force and then come a crush blow to austrian hope in a ruinous defeat near lemberg and the loss of that fortress the fall of lemberg the capture of lemberg from the austrian early in September after a four day ' battle be one of the striking russian success of the war detail reach the outer world on September 10th from petrograd -lrb- st petersburg -rrb- as follow the story be that of a eyewitness : the commencement of the fighting which result in the capture of lemberg begin August 29th when the russian drive the enemy from zisczow -lrb- forty-five mile east of lemberg -rrb- and move on to golaya gorka -- a name which mean ` the naked hill ' we spend the night on naked hill and the actual storm of the town be begin at 2:30 o'clock in the morning then follow a four day ' battle a virtually continuous cannonade continue from dawn to darkness without cessation even in the darkness the weary fighter get little sleep whenever a single shot be hear the man dash for they place and the battle boil again with renew fury the enemy 's counter attack be deliver with great energy and a dense hail of lead and iron be pour over we rank the russian advance be greatly impede by the hilly nature of the ground and the great number of extinct crater which form splendid natural fortification for the enemy which hold they doggedly out of these however the enemy be drive in succession we suffer much from thirst for the stony country be devoid of spring the day be oppressively hot and the night bitterly cold russian artillery superior both side fight with great obstinacy but the nearer we approach lemberg the harder the struggle become however it soon be evident that we be superior in artillery at length the enemy be drive from all side beneath the protection of the lemberg fort we troops be very weary but in high spirit for two day the fight rage around the fort but we be always confident of the prowess of we artillery the big gun of both side rain a terrific hail down on the army which suffer terrific loss at last we notice that the resistance of the fort be grow weaker a charge at double quick be order and we carry the first line of work it be evident from that point that many of the enemy 's gun have be destroy not enough of they have be leave to continue a effective defense but the enemy be undiscouraged and try to make up with rifle fire what it lack in artillery loss become heavier between the first and second line we loss be heavier than before but under bayonet charge the enemy break and flee in panic we troops enter the town at the enemy 's heel we run into the town despite we fatigue with thunderous cheer a episode which have much to do with end the enemy 's dogged resistance occur during the fighting between the first and second line the austrian in the hope of check the russian effort to encircle the town have throw out a heavy screen of slav troops with a backing of magyar who have be order to shoot down the slav from behind if they show any hesitation this circumstance become know to the russian commander who order a terrific artillery fire over the head of the slav and into the rank of the magyar this well-directed fire set the whole line in panic more than 35000 austrian and russian wound be abandon on the field of battle between tarnow lemberg and tarnopol owing to lack of means of transportation accord to reliable report both army decline to ask for a armistice for the burial of the dead and the collection of the wound each fear to give a advantage to the other the battle before lemberg the immense superiority of the austrian force east of lemberg enable the austrian at first to adopt the offensive as soon however as the austrian realize the impossibility of a advance on warsaw they concentrate they large and overwhelming force in a attempt to outflank the right wing of the russian army which be draw slowly but surely towards lemberg on the other russian flank the two russian army corps after cross the river zlota lipa without much opposition continue they advance to the river knilum lipa where they find the bridge have all be destroy by the austrian advance guard two bridge be construct on the rogarten-halicz line which enable a cross to be effect in spite of heavy and incessant artillery fire from the austrian 24-centimeter gun once across the river the two russian corps cross the upper reach of the river boog and so approach the town of lemberg from the east the main austrian army however have by this time move up to bar the further advance of the russian force and the whole of they army on the left bank of the river vistulum be in front of the three russian corps the latter be compel to adopt a defensive rôle for three or four day after which have receive large reinforcement the russian force move forward and drive the austrian troops out of they entrenchment outside lemberg at the point of the bayonet a desperate attempt be make by means of a counter-attack to arrest the advance of the russian troops but this only result in the capture of 6000 austrian prisoner -lrb- illustration : where russium fight battle grounds of eastern prussium and of galicium where the austrian be repeatedly defeat with heavy loss -rrb- lemberg be not a fortress but be recently convert into a semi-fortified place as a series of lunette redoubt etc have be hastily prepare it be the headquarters of the 11th austrian corps which consist of the famous 43rd landwehr infantry division and be further divide into three landwehr brigade there be also a landwehr uhlan regiment together with a howitzer division of field artillery these battery be arm with 105-centimeter gun fit with the german or krupp eccentric breech action the fort outside the town be say to be arm with the 15-centimeter siege gun make of steel also with a krupp action the ammunition for these gun be chiefly high explosive shell and shrapnel one of the fort be also say to have have a battery of three 24-centimeter heavy siege gun of quite a modern pattern germany rush reinforcement when lemberg fall the russian advance cover a line extend from far up in eastern prussium near tilsit across the frontier and on down south into austrian galicium königsberg be hear the sound of the russian gun and its besieger seem on the verge of victory a central column of mighty strength be push its way into germany despite a stubborn resistance then the tide turn german reinforcement be bring up and under general von hindenberg the german administer a severe defeat to general rennenkampf 's army near allenstein in which it be claim that 60000 prisoner be take other reverse be suffer by the russian and soon after the middle of September they have be force to retire from german territory the german troops follow they into russium where a series of minor engagement occur near the frontier general rennenkampf 's defeat the operation lead to the defeat of general rennenkampf 's russian army by the german be as follow : from September 7 to 13 the russian take a strong position on the line from angerburg to gerdauen allenburg and kehlau the left wing rest on the mazurian lake and the right wing protect in the rear and flank by the forest of frisching whose pathless wood and swamp furnish a almost impregnable position the russian devoted great effort to intrench they position and bring up besides they heavy artillery russian cavalry scout far to the west and south but otherwise the army-undertook no offensive operation in the day follow a battle at tannenberg the german force accord to the german official account be compose of the second third fourth and twentieth corps two reserve division and five cavalry division general von hindenburg the german commander meanwhile be assemble every available man deprive the fortress of they garrison and call in all but a bare remnant of the force protect the southern frontier in the vicinity of soldau add they to reinforcement receive from the west general von hindenburg again resort to the customary german flanking movement and since the german right protect by the forest and marsh seem too strong he adopt the daring strategy of send the flanking force to the lake region to the south the same character of movement by which the russian narew army have be defeat on August 28 in the vicinity of ortelsburg and which in case of failure might have be equally as disastrous for the german strategy be successful the strategy however succeed although general rennenkampf offer a desperate resistance to the frontal attack after three day ' fight the russian be force back slightly in the center when the flank movement of the german be discover already threaten the flank a counter-movement be launch with a new army collect at lyck include the twenty-second corps and part of the third siberian corps just arrive from irkutsk and the balance of the defeat army the counter-attack fail and on September 10 the russian begin to fall back on they main position retreat in good order and well cover the russian artillery on the right wing appear to have make a good retreat owe to a timely start while the left wing be hard press by the envelop german infantry from this wing the russian retreat across the border in two column while the main body go northward and the other in a easterly direction pursue by the german who advance far from the border the german government appoint count von

witness actual battle near the eastern frontier of germany be karl h von wiegand who write as follow from the firing line near east wirballen russian poland October 9 : the german artillery today beat back in a bloody ghastly smear of man the russian advance yesterday i see a infantry engagement today it be mostly a artillery encounter the infantry attack be the more ghastly but the artillery the more awe-inspiring this be the fifth day of constant fighting and still the german trench hold today 's battle open at dawn with two staff officer assign as my chaperon i have be attach overnight to the field headquarters i sleep well exhaust by the excitement of my first sight of modern war but when dawn once again reveal the two long line of the russian and german position the russian gun begin to hurl they load of shrapnel at the german trench we have breakfast calmly enough despite the din of gun then we go to one of the german battery on the left center they be already in action though it be only 6 o'clock the man get the range from observer a little in advance cunningly mask and slowly methodically and enthusiastically feed the gun with they load of death the russian do not have we range all of they shell fly scream 1000 yard to we leave through my glass i watch they strike the effect on the hillock be exactly as though a geyser have suddenly spurt up a vast cloud of dirt and stone and grass spout up and when the debris clear away a great hole show russian try new range while we watch the russian seem to tire of shooting hole in a inoffensive hill they begin to try chance shot to the right and to the leave it be not many minute before i realize that standing near a battery the execution of which must have be note on the russian side i have a fine chance of experience shrapnel burst overhead it be a queer sensation to peer through field glass and see the russian shell veer a few hundred foot to the right i see one strike a windmill shatter the long arm and crumple it over in a slow burning heap then we beat a retreat further toward the center we have be stand behind a slight declivity i have not catch a glimpse of the enemy shell be the only thing that apprise we of the russian nearness but as we pass out on a open field considerably out of range of the field gun i could see occasional flash that bespeak field piece a mile or so away russian infantry charge back behind we on the extreme left i be tell the russian be attack the german trench by a infantry charge the german field telephone service have apprise the commander along the front with glass we could see a faint line of what must have be the russian infantry rush across the open field we pass on to the center go slightly to the rear for horse as we arrive at the right wing we witness the last of a russian infantry advance at that end the wave of russian have sweep nearly to the german trench situate between two section of field artillery and there have be repulse russian be smear across in front of these pit dead die or wound -- cut down by the terrible spray of german machine gun i get up to the trench as the german fire slacken because of the lack of target the russian have go back strew in the trench be countless empty shell the bullet of which have as it look to inexpert eye slay thousand as a matter of fact there be hundred of dead in the field ahead gun barrel sizzle hot german infantryman spit on they rapid firer as we reach the trench and delightedly call we attention to the sizzle that tell how hot the barrel be from the firing the man stretch they cramped limb help a few wound to the rear and wait for breakfast it be not long forthcoming small line of man struggle along tinder steam bucket come hurry up to the accompaniment of cheer and shout they bear soup that the man in the trench gulp down ravenously meanwhile man with the white brassard and the red geneva cross be busy out in the open lending succor to the russian wound the battle seem to have come to a sudden halt but even as i be get soup the artillery fusillade break forth again from 9 o'clock to noon the russian hurl they heavy shell at the german trench and the german gun the german battery reply slowly there be mighty little fuss and feather about this business of deal death from gun the crew at each piece laugh among themselves but there be none of the picturesque shout of command the indiscriminate blowing of bugle and the flashy wave of battle flag that the word battle usually conjure up it be merely a deadly business of kill over to the right a scant 300 yard away the russian have apparently succeed in get the range as i watch through the glass i see shrapnel burst over the battery there and watch a noncommissioned soldier fall with three of he comrade i be tell that one have be kill and three wound the red cross crew come up and bear away the four -- the dead and the live -- and before they be go the gun be speak away with four fresh man work it but the shrapnel keep burst away over it and soon a orderly come ride furiously back on he horse salute the officer with I and shout as he hurry back to the artillery reserve : ` six inch shell to the front more ammunition ' i go back to see the wound but the surgeon would not let I i express to he my wonder at the few wounded i have see only a few in the trench and no german dead until i see the artilleryman kill he explain that the loss on the german side be light because the trench be well construct and because there have be no hand-to-hand bayonet to bayonet fight attack by russian infantry yesterday my first day at wirballen i see the third attempt of the russian to carry the german center by storm twice on Wednesday they infantry have advance under cover of they artillery only to be repulse they third effort prove no more successful the preliminary be well under way without my appreciate they significance until one of my officer escort explain at a number of point along they line observable to we but screen from the observation of the german trench in the center the russian infantry come tumble out and rush forward take up advanced position await the formation of the new and irregular battle line dozen of light rapid-firer be drag along by hand other troops -- the reserve -- take up semi-advanced position all the while the russian shrapnel be rain over the german trench finally come the russian order to advance at the word hundred of yard of the russian fighting line leap forward deploy in open order and come on some of they come into range of the german trench fire almost at once these line begin to wilt and thin out man pause only to fire but on they come all along the line protect and unprotect alike rush forward with a yell pause firing and advance again from the outset of the advance the german artillery ignore for the moment the russian artillery action begin shell the onrushing mass with wonderfully time shrapnel which burst low over the advance line and tear sickening gap but the russian line never stop for the third time in two day they come tear on with no indication of have be affect by the terrible consequence of the two previous charge as a spectacle the whole thing be madden on come the slav swarm into the range of the german trench with wild yell and never a waver russian battle flag -- the first i have see -- appear in the front of the charge rank the advance line thin and the second line move up nearer and nearer they sweep toward the german position and then come a new sight a few seconds later come a new sound first i see a sudden almost grotesque melting of the advance line it be different from anything that have take place before the man literally go down like domino in a row those who keep they foot be hurl back as though by a terrible gust of wind almost in the second that i pondered puzzle the staccato rattle of machine gun reach we my ear answer the query of my eye machine gun fire tell for the first time the advance line hesitate apparently bewildered mount officer dash along the line urge the man forward horse fall with the man i see a dozen riderless horse dash madly through the line add a new terror another horse be obviously run away with he officer rider the crucial period for the section of the charge on which i have rivet my attention probably last less than a minute to my throbbing brain it seem a hour then with the withering fire rake they even as they falter the line break panic ensue it be every man for himself the entire russian charge turn and go tear back to cover and the shelter of the russian trench i sweep the entire line of the russian advance with my glass -- as far as it be visible from we position the whole advance of the enemy be in retreat make for its intrenched position dead man cover acre after the assault have fail and the battle have resume its normal trend i sweep the field with my glass the dead be everywhere they be not pile up but be strew over acre more horrible than the sight of the dead though be the other picture bring up by the glass squirm toss writhe figure everywhere the wound all who could stumble or crawl be work they way back toward they own line or back to the friendly cover of hill or wooded spot after the charge we move along back of the german line at a safe distance and find the hospital corps bring back the german wound the artilleryman have resume they duel and as we come up in the lee of the outbuilding of a desert farmhouse a shell strike and fire the farmhouse immediately in front of we as we pause to see if the shot be a chance one or if the russian gunner have actually get the range a regiment of fresh reserve young man who have just come up from the west pass we on they way to get they baptism of fire they demeanor be more suggestive of a group of college student go to a football game than the serious business on which they be bent they be singing and laughing and as they go by a noncommissioned officer inquire rather ruefully whether there be any russian leave for they throughout the day we watch the fight wage from the oppose trench and by the artillery suddenly at sundown the fight cease as if by mutual agreement as i write this i can see occasional flash of light like the flare of giant firefly out over the scene of the russian charge -- the flash of small electrical lamp in the hand of the russian hospital corps i be glad i do not have to look at what the flash reveal out there in the night chapter xiii the austro-servian campaign _ declaration of war by austrium -- bombardment of belgrade -- servian capital remove -- seasoned soldier of servium give a good account of themselves -- many indecisive engagement -- servian in austrian territory _ formal declaration of war against servium be proclaim by austrium on Tuesday July 28 the text of the official announcement be as follow : the royal government of servium not have give a satisfactory reply to the note present to it by the austro-hungarian ministry in belgrade on July 23 1914 the imperial and royal government of austria-hungary find it necessary itself to safeguard its rights and interest and to have recourse for this purpose to the force of arm austria-hungary therefore consider itself from this moment in a state of war with servium this declaration be sign by count berchtold the austrian minister for foreign affair the event that immediately precede the declaration of war as summarize in a previous chapter be as follow : on June 28 a slav student who think he be a patriot kill the archduke franci ferdinand heir to the austrian throne at serajevo the capital of bosnium which have be lately make a province of austrium a inquiry be begin in which evidence be introduce to show that the assassin 's work be part of a plot for the revolt of the southern slav province of austrium and that it be instigate by servian if not by the servian government on July 23 however before the investigation be complete austrium send a ultimatum to servium demand that it use every means in its power to punish the assassin and also to stop all further anti-austrian propaganda austrium demand that she be permit to have representative in the work of investigation in servium the next day July 24 russium join the little slav country in ask for a delay austrium refuse to grant this on July 25 ten minute before 6 pm the hour at which the ultimatum expire the servian premier m pashitch give he reply to the austrian ambassador at belgrade servium agree to all the condition and apology demand by austrium except the requirement that austrian official should be allow to participate in the inquiry to be conduct in servium into the assassination of the archduke even this be not definitely refuse on July 27 the austrian foreign office issue a statement in which appear these word : the object of the servian note be to create the false impression that the servian government be prepare in great measure to comply with we demand as a matter of fact however servian note be fill with the spirit of dishonesty which clearly let it be see that the servian government be not seriously determine to put a end to the culpable tolerance it hitherto have extend to intrigue against the austro-hungarian monarchy russium at once notify austrium that it could not permit servian territory to be invade it be then realize in europe that the great slav nation would support its little brother germany let it be know that no other country must interfere with the austro-servian embroglio which mean that germany be prepare to back austria a eleventh-hour proposal by the british foreign secretary sir edward gray that mediation between servium and austrium be undertake by a conference of the ambassador in london be accept by france and italy but decline by germany and austrium then next day July 28 come austrium 's declaration of war which soon make europe the theater of the bloodiest struggle of all the age servium and its aspiration servian reply to the declaration of war be to concentrate a strong division of its force in the sanjak of novi-bazar from which they would be in a position to threaten bosnium and herzegovina the two balkan province that austria have lately annex it be also report that servium intend to invade bosnium with the object of enlist further support from the bosnian serb who be say to be on the point of rise against austria-hungary the country of the servian be well suit for defense they be never completely overrun by the turk as other balkan state be and as a consequence they still retain like the greek a native aristocracy of culture physically they be fairer than most of the balkan slav and more refine in appearance by temperament they be light-hearted joyous frivolous and charming to deal with in servium itself include territory acquire in recent war there be about 4500000 serb in austrium there be about 3500000 serb include croat who belong to the servian race the servian have long dream and talk and write of a greater servium that should take in all the servian race they look back to the time of king stephen dushan in the fourteenth century when servium be supreme in the balkan and be nearly as advance in civilization as the most advanced nation of europe the re-establishment of this ancient kingdom have become a passion with the serb -- not only with those in servium but with many in hungary as well hence they animus against austrium and austrian rule while austrium 's fight be primarily for the preservation and solidification of she heterogeneous dominion secondarily for revenge for the archduke 's death incidentally it may be mention that the archduke franci ferdinand be a close personal friend of the german kaiser the servian army the servian force under general radumil putnik consist of ten division divide into four army corps with a peace footing of 160 and a war strength of over 380000 most of the man call to arm against austrium be veteran of the two recent balkan war and hence probably the most seasoned troops in europe the rifle of the servian army be the mauser model of 1899 with a caliber of 7 millimeter but it be doubtful if servium possess enough of they to arm the reserve the servian field piece be a quick-firing gun of the french schneider-canet system the army have some 350 modern gun at the outbreak of the war servium have ten of the most modern aircraft but she have not develop they efficiency to a degree at which they would be of much material benefit to she in the struggle the extremely mountainous nature of servium and of the adjacent territory of bosnium make military movement somewhat slow and difficult especially for troops unaccustomed to mountain warfare compare with this mountainous region the district of agram where one austrian army corps have its headquarters be easy country to operate in while the plain of hungary on the opposite side of the danube make the task of concentrate troops a easy one for the austrian another austrian army corps have its base at serajevo in bosnium a railway to the northeast from this bosnian capital touch the servian border at mokragora to the north of this point lie kragujevac the new capital of servium to which king peter he court and the government repair from belgrade just before the declaration of war southeast of the new capital be the important servian city of nish the western frontier of servium follow the winding of the biver drina a tributary of the danube the danube itself form part of the northern boundary and the former capital belgrade be picturesquely situate on the south bank of the danube at its junction with a tributary two austrian fortress command the city from across the danube on the plain of hungary to the north be temesvar a important point at which another austrian army corps be located chance against servium at the outset the chance of war be heavily against servium such artificial defens as she possess be on the bulgarian frontier many of she troops be engage in endeavor to establish servian rule among the neighbor people in she new albanian possession austrium be prepare to bring against she immediately the three army corps from temesvar serajevo and agram and four more corps from hermanstadt budapest graz and kaschau within a fortnight servian one hope appear to be the difficulty of the country otherwise she could not oppose for a moment the advance of 250000 troops support by piece of artillery then too austria have warship on the danube and it be partly through this fact that it be decide by the servian government to evacuate belgrade and to retire to kragujevac sixty mile southeast in spite however of the seeming futility of opposition servium encourage by russian support prepare for a strenuous campaign against the austrian force and the first two month of the war end without any decisive advantage to austria the servian on the other hand claim numerous success they task be lighten by the russian invasion of austrian territory and the determine advance of the czar 's host which demand the fullest strength of the austrian force to resist as the russian hammer they enemy in galicium the spirit of the servian rise and they seasoned soldier give a good account of themselves in every encounter with austrian troops they cross the drina and carry the war into bosnium put up a stiff fight wherever they encounter the enemy and while they sustain severe loss in kill and wound during August and September the loss they inflict upon the austrian be still heavier austrian bombard belgrade the austrian troops on the bank of the danube become active soon after war be declare in the first few day they seize two servian steamer and a number of river boat belgrade be bombard from across the river and many of its public building church and private residence suffer damage the hostile army come into contact for the first time on the river drina between bosnium and servium and vienna be compel to admit defeat in this preliminary engagement of the war the servian force a passage through the austrian rank but only at the cost of many kill and wound when crown prince alexander of servium begin the invasion of bosnium in earnest in the middle of August austrium find herself at a disadvantage because of the necessity of mass most of she force against the russian roumanium and montenegro be then prepare to join the servian in the field against austrium later in August the servian capture several of the enemy 's stronghold in bosnium after a four-day battle on the bank of the drina the austrian be defeat with heavy loss a large number of gun and prisoner be capture by the servian the montenegrin troops repulse a austrian invade force and take several hundred prisoner in a all-day battle on the frontier early in September a heavy engagement be fight by the servian and austrian army near jadar result in servian victory it be claim that the austrian leave 10000 dead on the field of battle the servian also successfully defend belgrade which have be bombard on several occasion fifteen or twenty mile west of belgrade on the save river a austrian force be decisively defeat by the servian who then seem to be duplicate the success of the russian army against austrium the attitude of turkey be be closely watch at this time greece and bulgarium be prepare to enter the war against the ottoman empire if the latter decide on belligerency but on September 5 turkey again declare she intention to remain neutral servian capture semlin cross the save river into hungary the servian score a brilliant stroke in the capture of semlin a important austrian city they also report continue success in bosnium report of wholesale desertion of slav from the austrian army be receive daily and probably have considerable foundation in fact it be say that the servian be be receive enthusiastically by the people

slope over they border on October 1 it be report that the servian have again repulse a austrian attempt at invasion and have drive the austrian back across the drina with loss they have also check another austrian attempt to take belgrade the servian war office claim that the combined servian-montenegrin army have make material progress in they invasion of bosnia-herzegovina and that they be within striking distance of serajevo which they expect to capture this however be deny by the vienna ministry of war which claim that the servian situation be entirely satisfactory to austria on October 5 servian troops be report to have begin a northeast advance from semlin to effect a junction with two russian column advance southward in hungary one of these column be then assault a fortress in northwest hungary sixty-six mile southeast of olmutz while the other be descend the valley of the nagyan against huszt in the province of marmaro this latter province or county which the

destroy by the russian invasion before attain uzsok pass in the carpathian the russian successively capture by a wide flanking movement three well-masked position which be strongly defend by gun each time the russian charge the enemy flee and the russian follow up the austrian retreat with shrapnel and quick fire inflict heavy loss german troops join the austrian force in hungary and at some point

at the german base and have see some of the fighting in the historic aisne struggle it be a sausage grinder he declare on one side be the ally apparently willing to sacrifice they last man in defense of france on the other be the german seemingly prodigal of they million of man and money and throw man after man into the war what about the alleged atrocity in belgium he be ask well war be hell that be about the only answer i can give you the real tragic feature of the whole war be belgium its people be wonderful folk -- clean decent respectable what this nation should do be to concentrate its effort to aid the woman and child of belgium help for hospital be not so much need but the fate of these people be really pathetic ask for a brief description of what he see along the battle line col haye declare : the battle front these day be far different from what it use to be there be few man to be see and practically no gun all be conceal shrapnel fly through the air and burst that be the scene most of the time in the hand-to-hand fighting bayonet be use much by the french while the turco use knife shall you go back col haye be ask do anyone wish to visit a slaughterhouse a second time he reply prince wound by the foe prince August william the fourth son of emperor william be shoot in the left arm during the battle of the marne and emperor william bestow the iron cross of the first

servium while lead he battalion against the austrian September 18 be hit by a ball which enter near the spinal column and come out at the right shoulder the wound be say not to be dangerous how the scotsman fight at st quentin france the highland infantryman burst into the thick of the german hold on to the stirrup of the scot grey as the horseman gallop and attack hand to hand the german be take aback at the sudden and totally unexpected double irruption and break up before the scottish onslaught suffer severe loss alike from the sword of the cavalry and from the highlander ' bayonet the scene of this charge be depict in one of we illustration two tragic incident during the russian retreat through the mazur lake district in east prussium a russian battery be surround on three side by the enemy 's quick firer the infantry be on the other side of the lake and the russian ammunition be exhaust in order to avoid capture the commander order the battery to gallop over the declivity into the lake he order be obey and he himself be among the drown during a assault on the fortress of ossowetz a german column get into a bog the russian shell the bog and the single road cross it the german in try to extricate themselves sink deeper into the mire and hundred be kill or wound of the whole column about forty survive in the brussels hospital a peculiar incident of the war be note by a doctor write in the new york american who go through several of the great brussels hospital and note the condition of the wounded belgian soldier these soldier carry on the defense of they country with a valor which the fight man of any nation might admire and envy the writer remark : two fact strike I very forcibly the first be the very large number of belgian soldier wound only in the leg and secondly many of the soldier seem to have collapse through sheer exhaustion in peace time one see and hear little or nothing of extreme exhaustion because in time of peace the almost superphysical be not demand war bring new condition these belgian soldier be at work and on the march during stupendous day practically without a moment 's respite they go literally until they drop as a medical man they condition interested I enormously what force of will to fight and struggle until the last gasp the exhaustion one see often in heat stroke and in hot climate be commonplace but this type of exhaustion be by itself the final triumph of brave spirit the victim present a very alarming appearance when first i meet they they seem almost dead limp pale and cold recovery usually be not protracted in every case the man knock out in this manner express a fervent desire to return at once to the rank german warn to french town follow be the text of a proclamation publish in french and post in all town occupy by the german : all the authority and the municipality be inform that every peaceful inhabitant can follow he regular occupation in full security private property will be absolutely respect and provision pay for if the population dare under any form whatever to take part in hostility the severest punishment will be inflict on the refractory the people must give up they arm every armed individual will be put to death whoever cut telegraph wire destroy railway bridge or road or commit any act in detriment to the german will be shoot town and village whose inhabitant take part in the combat or who fire upon we from ambush will be burn down and the guilty shot at once the civil authority will be hold responsible -lrb- sign -rrb- von moltke motor in the russian army the russian army have always place much dependence on its horse have a vast number but it have realize the importance of the motor vehicle in warfare and already it be much better equipped than other nation suppose a illustration of the fact be the follow relate by a bed cross man who accompany the russian force into eastern germany : i be walk beside one of we cart we could hear heavy artillery fire as we go when shout from we people behind warn we to get off the road we pull onto the grass as there come thunder past bump from one rough place to another on the poor road and go at a sickening pace a string of huge motor car crowd with infantryman they look like vehicle of the army establishment all apparently alike in size and pattern and each carry about thirty man they be travel like no motor wagon that i ever see -- certainly at not less than forty mile a hour the procession seem endless i do not count they but there be not less than a hundred and perhaps a good many more that be general rennenkampf reinforce he threaten flank jennie dufau 's narrow escape jennie dufau the american opera singer have one of the most thrilling experience tell by a refugee from the war zone miss dufau be visit in saulxure province of alsace when the war start and be in the hitherto peaceful valley of that region until August 24 she be with she sister elizabeth and she two brother paul and daniel on August 6 the german artillery occupy the height on one side of the valley overlook the town on the 12th the german occupy the town itself at that time there be but two french regiment near saulxure the french however open fire on the german and miss dufau with she father and sister at once retreat to the cellar in a effort to escape the fly shell then begin a tremendous artillery duel that last for day she say all this time we be live in the cellar where we be care for ten wounded french officer i often go out over the battlefield when the fire slacken and do what i could for the wound and die my brother paul and daniel be draft into the german army they have swear a oath not to fire a shot at a frenchman and they greatest hope be that they would be capture and permit to put on the french uniform between August 12 and 24 the artillery duel rage and finally the oppose army come to a hand-to-hand fight with the bayonet first it be the german who occupy the town then the french the german finally come to we house and accuse my sister my father and myself of be spy because they find a telephone there the soldier line we up against the wall to shoot we but we fall on we knee and beg they to spare the life of we father they give no heed till a german colonel come along and after question we order that we be set free valley of death on the aisne a non-combatant who succeed in get close to the firing line on the aisne when the great battle have rage continuously for five week write as follow on October 21st of the horror he have witness : between the line of battle there be a narrow strip vary from seventy yard to a quarter of a mile which be a neutral valley of death neither side be able to cross that strip without be crumple by fire against which no body of man can stand the german have attempt to break through the british and french force hundred of time but have be compel to withdraw and always with severe loss a number of small town be distribute in this narrow strip the most important be craonne the german and french have reoccupy it six time and each in turn have be drive out the street of craonne be litter with the dead of both army the house nearly all of which have be demolish by explode shell be also full of body of man who crawl into they to get out of the withering fire and have there die many of these man die of sheer exhaustion and starvation while the battle rage day after day both army have apparently abandon the struggle to hold craonne permanently and it be now literally a city of the dead it be a typical french village of ancient stone structure the tiny house all have or have gable and tile roof these have mostly be break by shell fire under the shelter of its building both the german and french have be able at time to rescue they wound this be more than can be say of the strip of death between the battle line there the wound lie and the dead go unburied while the opposing force direct they merciless fire a few foot above the field of suffering and carnage i do not know until i look upon the horror of craonne that such condition could exist in modern warfare i think that frequent truce would be negotiate to give the oppose army a opportunity to collect they wound and bury they dead i have a idea that the red cross have make war less terrible the world think so yet perhaps but the condition along the aisne do not justify that belief if a man be wound in that strip between the line he never get back alive unless he be within a short distance of he own line or be protect from the enemy 's fire by the lay of the land this protracted and momentous battle which rage day and night for so many week become a continuous nightmare to the man engage in it every one of whom know that upon its issue rest one of the great decide factor of the war british aid for french wound the follow paragraph from a letter receive October 15th by the author from a english lady interested in the suffrage movement give some idea of the spirit in which the people of england meet the emergency and also indicate the frightful condition attend the care of the wound in france : london October 7 1914 -- the world be a quite different place from what it be in July -- dear peaceful July it seem year ago that we live in a time of peace it all still seem a nightmare over england and one feel that the morning must come when one will wake up and find it have all be a hideous dream and that peace be the reality but the fact grow sadder every day as one realize the frightful slaughter and waste of young life \* \* \* but now that we be in the midst of this horrible time we can only stop all criticism of we government set we tooth and try to help in every possible way all suffrage work have stop and all the hundred-and-one interest in society of every kind be in abeyance as well the office of every kind of society be be use for refugee bed cross work unemployment work and to meet other need of the moment every day of we time be take up with help to equip ` hospital unit ' private body of doctor and nurse with equipment to go to france and help the french red cross work among the french wound the situation in france at present be more horrible than one can imagine we english soldier have medical and surgical help enough with they for first aid then they be send back to england and here all we hospital be ready and private house everywhere have be give to the war office for the wound but the battlefield be in france many of the french doctor have be shoot the battle-line be 200 mile long and the carnage be frightful last week we send off one hospital unit and a messenger come back from it yesterday to tell we awful fact -- 16000 wound in limoge for one place and equal number in several other little place south of paris -- just train full of they -- with so little ready for they in the way of doctor or nurse one hear of doctor perform operation without chloroform and the suffering of the poor fellow be awful comparative wealth of nation at war the wealth of the principal belligerent nation in term of property goods and appraisable resource of all kind be estimate as follow : national national percent wealth debt unite state $ 260000000000 $ 18000000000 6 great britain 90000000000 36675000000 40 france 65000000000 23000000000 35 russium 40000000000 25400000000 63

bond issue of six billion be oversubscribe to extent $ 866416300 -- almost a extra billion there be over 21000000 individual subscriber the war bill of the united state between April 6 1917 and October 31st 1918 as officially report at washington November 2 1918 amount to twenty billion five hundred and sixty-one million dollar -lrb- $ 20561000000 -rrb- of this sum seven billion and seventeen million -lrb- $ 7017000000 -rrb- have be loan to the ally and will be repay only a little more than one-fourth of the expense have up to the date of the report be raise by taxation most of the remainder have be raise by bond issue practically all of which be subscribe by we own people so that the debt be owe not to foreign creditor but to ourselves the same report show that on November 1st 1918 the treasury 's work balance stand at one billion eight hundred and forty-five million seven hundred and thirty-nine thousand dollar -lrb- $ 1845739000 -rrb- the largest sum ever available at any one time in the history of the nation -- with continue receipt of instalment payment on the fourth liberty loan come in at the rate of two billion per month and preparation for the fifth loan well under way figure that be difficult to comprehend the direct cost of the war for all belligerent nation to may 1 1918 be report at about $ 175000000000 by the federal reserve board bulletin issue November 18 it be estimate that the cost would amount to nearly $ 200000000000 before the end of the year for purely military and naval purpose it appear that all belligerent have spend about $ 132000000000 to may 1 the remainder represent interest on debt and other indirect war expense the mobilization and the first five month of the war in 1914 cost all belligerent about $ 10000000000 in 1915 the expense jump to $ 26000000000 in 1916 they increase to $ 38000000000 and in they be estimate at $ 60000000000 in 1918 expense run only a little above the rate of 1917 the public debt of the principal entente ally be calculate at approximately $ 105000000000 not count the debt incur since may 1918 the annual burden to all belligerent to pay interest and sink fund allowance will be not less than $ 10000000000 and probably much more unofficial report indicate that germany 's national debt represent mainly by war bond hold within the empire be now nearly $ 35000000000 -lrb- almost two-fifth of the estimate national wealth of $ 80000000000 -rrb- besides this france claim a return of the indemnity $ 20000000000 $ 28000000000 for pension and reparation of damages $ 20000000000 be $ 68000000000 in all whatever may be the weight of the final burden of reparation and restitution to be place on germany the size of the task ahead of she may be illustrate by comparison of she national debt with that of the united state germany have 66000000 population and $ 80000000000 of estimate wealth to pay $ 35000000000 of war debt already create the united state have 110000000 population and a estimated national wealth of $ 250000000000 to pay nearly $ 18000000000 war debt already create or approximately $ 23000000000 up to the end of may 1919 this mean that the per capita burden will be at least three time greater in germany than in the united state chapter xv the mystery of the fleet _ movement of british battleship veil in secrecy -- german dreadnought in north sea and baltic port -- activity of smaller craft -- english keep trade route open -- several minor battle at sea _ shortly before war be declare a great review of the british navy be hold at spithead on the english channel when several hundred vessel be gather in mighty array for inspection by king george and the lord of the admiralty the salute they fire have hardly cease to reverberate along the shore of the channel when the momentous struggle be on it find the british fleet fully mobilize and ready for action the ship have they magazine fill they bunker and oil tank charge they victualing complete and last but not least they full crew aboard then without a moment 's delay they disappear under order to proceed to station in the north sea to cruise in the channel the atlantic or the mediterranean to keep trade route open for british and neutral ship and capture or destroy the ship of the enemy silently and swiftly they sail and for week the world know little or nothing of they movement or whereabouts mystery equally deep shroud the german fleet in all probability it lay under the gun of the coast city and fort of germany but nothing definite be permit to leak out the test of the two great navy the supreme test of dreadnought and superdreadnought fail to materialize and for week the people of great britain and germany could only wonder what have become of they naval force and why they do not come into contact with each other a few minor engagement in the north sea in which light cruiser and torpedo-boat destroyer be concerned serve only to deepen the mystery only naval man and well-informed civilian realize that germany be bide she time wait to choose she own hour for action realize the strength of the oppose force and determine not to risk she own ship until the opportune moment should arrive which would offer the best possible chance for success and meanwhile the main british fleet lay in the north sea wait for the enemy to appear after a while letter begin to come from the north sea tell of the life aboard the vessel lie in wait scout or patrolling the coast the ship be all strip for action all inflammable ornament and fitting have be leave behind or cast overboard strip and naked the fight machine go to they task all day long the man be ready at they gun and during the night each gun crew sleep around the weapon that it be they duty to serve ready to repel any destroyer or submarine come out of the surround darkness to attack they vice-admiral sir john jellicoe have assume supreme command of the british home fleet on August 4 with the rank of admiral he chief of staff be rear admiral charle e madden rear admiral sir george callaghan be in command of the north sea fleet a admiralty announcement on Thursday September 10 the secretary of the british admiralty make the follow announcement : yesterday and today strong and numerous squadron and flotilla have make a complete sweep of the north sea up to and into the heligoland bight the german fleet make no attempt to interfere with we movement and no german ship of any kind be see at sea that much patience have to be exercise by the seaman of the north sea fleet be evidence by a letter in which the writer say to he family if you want to get away from the excitement of war you should be here with I this situation of course might be change at a moment 's notice the london time say in September : it be not to be wonder at if we seaman today envy a little the old-time sailor who do not have to compete with such thing as mine destroyer and submarine in the account of the old blockade we read how by means of music and dancing and even theatrical entertainment the monotonous nature of the work be counteract and the officer of the ship include nelson and other great commander welcome these diversion for the prevention of the evil which might be breed by enforced idleness it be a true say that everything that stagnate corrupt there be no possible chance of the crew of we modern vessel stagnate under the new condition of war whether engage in blockade in the big ship scout in the cruiser or patrolling the coast in the destroyer the life be describe as tremendously interesting and exciting there have be no sense of monotony whatever indeed the condition be such that be it not obligatory for portion of every crew to take rest all of they would be continually on the alert we may be certain that arrangement have be make for ensure that the crew obtain period of relaxation from the constant strain but the only real change come in the big ship when they have of necessity to refill they bunker loss of the cruiser amphion the cruiser amphion be the first british war vessel lose in the war the survivor on landing at the north sea port of harwich england on August 10 state that hardly have they leave harwich than they be order to clear the deck for action they sight the german mine-laying vessel koenigin luise and as it refuse to stop even when a shot be fire across its bow they give chase the german ship fire and then the destroyer accompany the amphion surround and sink it after a brief combined bombardment the captain it be say be beside himself with fury he have a revolver in he hand and threaten he man as they prepare to surrender to the rescue ship he flatly refuse to give himself up and be take by force when the smoke of a big ship be see on the horizon the amphion give chase firing a warn shot as it draw near the vessel which at once make know its identity as the harwich boat st petersburg carry prince lichnowsky the german ambassador to the hook of holland while return to port come the tragedy of the amphion as it strike a sunken mine it give two plunge jerk then come a explosion which rip up its forepart shoot up its funnel like arrow from a bow and lift its heavy gun into the air the fall material strike several of the boat of the flotilla and injure some of the man on board they the amphion 's man be dreadfully burn and scald and have mark on they face and body which resemble splash of acid the scene at harwich be like that which follow a colliery explosion of the british seaman in the hospital thirteen be suffer from severe burn five from less serious burn two from the effect of lyddite fume and one each from concussion severe injury slight wound shock and slight burn a few wounded german sailor also lay in the hospital sink a german submarine on August 12 there come from edinburgh the story of a eyewitness of a naval battle in the north sea on the previous Sunday between british cruiser and german submarine in which the german submarine u-15 be sink the cruiser squadron on Sunday the story run suddenly become aware of the approach of the submarine flotilla the enemy be submerge only the periscope show above the surface of the water the attitude of the british in the face of this attack be cool and the enemy be utterly mislead when suddenly the cruiser birmingham steam at full speed fire the first shot this shot be carefully aim not at the submerge body of a submarine but at the thin line of the periscope the gunnery be superbly accurate and shatter the periscope thereupon the submarine now a blinded thing rush along under water in imminent danger of self-destruction from collision with the cruiser above the sightless submarine be then force to come to the surface whereupon the birmingham 's gunner fire the second shot of the fight this shot strike at the base of the con tower rip the whole of the upper structure clean and the u-15 sink like a stone the remainder of the submarine flotilla flee naval battle off heligoland in the last week of August a naval engagement occur off the island of heligoland in the north sea british war vessel sink five german ship kill 900 man a graphic description of the engagement be give by a young lieutenant who be on one of the british torpedo boat destroyer : i think the home papers be magnify what really be but a affair of outpost we destroyer go in and lure the enemy out and have lot of excitement the big fellow then come up and afford some excellent target practice and we be very glad to see they come but it be a massacre not a fight there be superb generalship and overwhelming force on the spot but there be really nothing for they to do except to shoot the enemy even as father shoot pheasant have you ever notice a dog rush in on a flock of sheep and scatter they he go for the nearest and bark and go so much faster than the flock that it bunch up with its companion the dog then bark at another and the sheep spread out fanwise so in front of the dog there be a semicircle of sheep and behind he none that be much what we do at 7 a m on August 28 the sheep be the german torpedo craft which fall back on the limit of we range and try to lure we within the fire of the heligoland fort but a cruiser then come out and engage we arethusa and they have a real heart-to-heart talk while we look on and a few of we try to shoot at the enemy too though it be beyond we distance we be get nearer heligoland all the time there be a thick mist and i expect every minute to find the fort on the island bombard we so the arethusa presently draw off after landing at least one good shell on the enemy the enemy give every hit as good as he get there we then reform but a strong destroyer belong to the submarine get chase and the arethusa and fearless go back to look after it we presently hear a hot action astern so the captain in command of the flotilla turn we around and we go back to help but they have drive the enemy off and on we arrival tell we to ` form up ' on the arethusa cruiser fire on ship when we have partly form and be very much bunch together make a fine target suddenly out of the mist arrive five or six shell from a point not 150 yard away we gaze at whence they come and again five or six stab of fire pierce the fog and we make out a four-funneled german cruiser of the breslau class those stab be its gun go off we wait fifteen seconds and the shot and noise of its gun arrive pretty well from fifty yard away its next salvo of shot go above we and i duck as they whir overhead like a covey of fast partridge you would suppose we captain have do this sort of thing all he life he go full speed ahead at once upon the first salvo to string the bunch out and thus offer less target the commodore from the arethusa make a signal to we to attack with torpedo so we swing round at right angle and charge full speed at the enemy like a hussar attack we boat get away at the start magnificently and lead the field so all the enemy 's firing be aim at we for the next ten minute when we get so close that debris from they shell fall on board then we alter we course and so throw they out in they reckoning of we speed and they have all they work to do over again humanly speak we captain by twist and turn at psychological moment save we actually i feel that we be in god 's keep that day after ten minute we get near enough to fire we torpedo then we turn back to the arethusa next we follower arrive just where we have be and fire its torpedo and of course the enemy fire at it instead of at we what a bless relief after the destroyer come the fearless and it stay on the scene soon we find it be engage a three-funneler the mainz so off we start again now for the mainz the situation be that the cripple arethusa be too tubby to do anything but be defend by we its child scarcely however have we start when from out of the mist and across we front in furious pursuit come the first cruiser squadron of the town class the birmingham and each unit a match for three like the mainz which be soon sink as we look and reduce speed they open fire and the clear bang-bang of they gun be just like a cooling drink to see a real big four-funneler spout flame which flame denote shell start and those shell not at we but for we be the most cheerful thing possible once we be in safety i hate it we have just be have we own imagination stimulate on the subject of shell strike now a few minute later to see another ship not three mile away reduce to a piteous mass of unrecognizability wreathe in black fume from which flare out angry gust of fire like vesuvius in eruption as a unending stream of hundred-pound shell burst on board it just point the moral and show we what might have be the mainz be immensely gallant the last i saw of it it be absolutely wreck it be a fume inferno but it have one gun forward and one aft still spit forth fury and defiance like a wild cat then we go west while they go east just a bit later we hear the thunder of the enemy 's gun for a space then fall silence and we know that be all a marvelous rescue the most romantic dramatic and piquant episode that modern war can ever show come next the defender have sink a enemy lower a whaler to pick up its swimming survivor before the whaler get back a enemy 's cruiser come up and chase the defender which thus have to abandon its small boat imagine they feeling alone in a open boat without food twenty-five mile from the nearest land and that land a enemy 's fortress with nothing but fog and foe around they and then suddenly a swirl alongside and up if you please hop he britannic majesty 's submarine e-4 open its conning tower take they all on board shut up again dive and bring they home 250 mile three british cruiser sink on Tuesday morning September 22 the british cruiser aboukir cressy and hogue be torpedo and sink by a german submarine in the north sea each of the vessel carry a crew of about 650 man and the total of the death roll be about 1400 the three cruiser have for some time be patrolling the north sea soon after 6 o'clock in the morning the aboukir suddenly feel a shock on the port side a dull explosion be hear and a column of water be throw up mast high the explosion wreck the stokehold just forward of amidship : and tear the bottom open almost immediately the doomed cruiser begin to settle except for the watch on deck most of the crew be asleep weary by the constant vigil in bad weather but in perfect order the officer and man rush to quarter the quick-firer be man in the hope of a die shot at the submarine but there be not a glimpse of one meanwhile the aboukir 's sister cruiser more than a mile away see and hear the explosion and think the aboukir have strike a mine they close in and lower boat this seal they own fate for while they be stand by to rescue survivor first the hogue and then the cressy be torpedo only the cressy appear to have see the submarine in time to attempt to retaliate and she fire a few shot before she keel over break in two and sink british naval officer by this time be begin to wonder how long the german high sea fleet intend to remain under cover in the kiel canal we only grievance one say be that we have not have a shot at the german we only share of the war have be a few uncomfortable week of bad weather mine and submarine a number of the survivor be take to the dutch port of ymuiden where they be intern as technical prisoner of war the german commander 's story the german submarine which accomplish the hitherto unparalleled feat be the u-9 in command of capt-lieut otto weddigen whose interesting story be give to the public through the german admiralty on October 6 as follow : i set out from a north sea port on one of the arm of the kiel canal and set my course in a southwesterly direction the name of the port i can not state officially but it be not many day before the morning of September 22 when i fall in with my quarry british torpedo-boat come within my reach but i feel there be bigger game further on so on i go it be ten minute after six in the morning of the 22nd when i catch sight of one of the big cruiser of the enemy i be then eighteen sea mile northwesterly of the hook of holland i have travel considerably more than 200 mile from my base i have be go ahead partially submerge with about five foot of my periscope show almost immediately i catch sight of the first cruiser and two other i submerge completely and lay my course in order to bring up in center of the trio which hold a sort of triangular formation i could see they gray-black side ride high over the water when i first sight they they be near enough for torpedo work but i want to make my aim sure so i go down and in on they i have take the position of the three ship before submerge and i succeed in get another flash through my periscope before i begin action i soon reach what i regard as a good shooting point then i loose one of my torpedo at the middle ship i be then about twelve foot under water and get the shoot off in good shape my man handle the boat as if it have be a skiff i climb to the surface to get a sight through my tube of the effect and discover that the shot have go straight and true striking the ship which i later learn be the aboukir under one of its magazine which in explode help the torpedo 's work of destruction there be a fountain of water a burst of smoke a flash of fire and part of the cruiser rise in the air strike the second cruiser its crew be brave and even with death stare they in the face keep to they post i submerge at once but i have stay on top long enough to see the other cruiser which i learn be the cressy and the hogue turn and steam full speed to they die sister as i reach my torpedo depth i send a second charge at the nearest of the oncoming vessel which be the hogue the english be play my game for i have scarcely to move out of my position which be a great aid since it help to keep I from detection the attack on the hogue go true but this time i do not have the advantageous aid of have the torpedo detonate under the magazine so for twenty minute the hogue lay wound and helpless on the surface before it heave half turn over and sink by this time the third cruiser know of course that the enemy be upon it and it seek as best it could to defend itself it loose its torpedo defense battery on bow star-board and port and stand its ground as if more anxious to help the many sailor in the water than to save itself in the common method of defend itself against a submarine attack it steam in a zigzag course and this make it necessary for I to hold my torpedo until i could lay a true course for they which also make it necessary for I to get nearer to the cressy i have to come to the surface for a view and see how wildly the fire be be send from the ship small wonder that be when they do not know where to shoot although one shot go unpleasantly near we when i get within suitable range i send away my third attack this time i send a second torpedo after the first to make the strike doubly certain my crew be aim like sharpshooter and both torpedo go to they bull 's - eye my luck be with I again for the enemy be make useless and at once begin sink by the head then it careen far over but all the while its man stay at the gun look for they invisible foe they be brave and true to they country 's sea tradition then it eventually suffer a boiler explosion and completely turn turtle with its keel uppermost it float until the air get out from under it and then it sink with a loud sound as if from a creature in pain the whole affair have take less than one hour from the time of shooting off the first torpedo until the cressy go to the bottom i set my course for home before i get far some british cruiser and destroyer be on the spot and the destroyer take up the chase i keep under water most of the way but manage to get off a wireless to the german fleet that i be head homeward and be pursue but although british destroyer see I plainly at dusk on the 22d and make a final effort to stop I they abandon the attempt as it be take they too far from safety and needlessly expose they to attack from we fleet and submarine merchantman capture and sink during the first month of the war a large number of merchant vessel principally german and british be capture or sink accord to a british admiralty return issue September 28 twelve british ship with a aggregate tonnage of 59331 ton have be sink on the high sea by german cruiser up to September 23 eight other british ship whose tonnage aggregate 2970 have be sink by german mine in the north sea and 24 fishing craft with a tonnage of 4334 have be capture or sink by the german in the same water british ship detain at german port number 74 with a total tonnage of 170000 on the other side the admiralty report 102 german ship with a total tonnage of 200000 detain in british port since the outbreak of the war while 88 german ship of a aggregate tonnage of 338000 have be capture since hostility begin the return also show that 168 german ship with a aggregate tonnage of 283000 have be detain or capture by the ally fifteen ship with a tonnage of 247000 be detain in american port while fourteen other with a tonnage of 72000 remain in the suez canal the german mine in the north sea have also destroy seven scandinavian ship with a tonnage of 11098 german cruiser active several german cruiser be amazingly active in distant water early in the war among these be the goeben breslau emden karlsruhe and leipzig which capture or sink a number of vessel of the enemy the german cruiser scharnhorst and gneisenau also operate in the pacific bombard the french colony of papeete on the island of tahitus and inflict much damage include the sinking of two vessel on August 26 the big converted german liner kaiser wilhelm der grosse while cruise on the northwest coast of africa be sink by the british cruiser highflyer the german cruiser dresden be report sink by british cruiser in south american water in the second week of September the emden operating under the german flag in the indian ocean sink several british steamer several austrian vessel succumb to mine off the coast of dalmatium and in the baltic there be a number of casualty in which both russian and german cruiser suffer the russian armored cruiser bayan be sink in a fight near the entrance to the gulf of finland on September 20 the german protect cruiser koenigsberg attack the british light cruiser pegasus in the harbor of zanzibar and disabled she off the east coast of south america the british auxiliary cruiser carmanium a former cunard liner destroy a german merchant cruiser mount eight four-inch gun about the same time the german cruiser helum be sink in the north sea by the british submarine e-9 the kronprinz wilhelm a former german liner which have be supply coal to german cruiser in the atlantic be also sink by the british german colony occupy the british admiralty announce on September 12 that the australian fleet have occupy herbertshoehe on blanche bay the seat of government of the german bismarck archipelago and the solomon island the bismarck archipelago with a area of 18000 square mile and a population of 200000 be off the north coast of australium and southwest of the philippine island the group be assign to the german sphere of influence by a agreement with great britain in 1885 german new guinea be include in the jurisdiction german sink russ cruiser on October 11 german submarine in the baltic torpedoed and sink the russian armored cruiser pallada with all its crew numbering 568 man the pallada have a displacement of 7775 ton and be a sister ship of the admiral makarov and bayan she be launch in November 1906 and have a water-line length of 443 foot beam 57 foot draft of 21-1 \/ foot and a speed of 21 knot she carry two 8-inch eight 6-inch twenty-two 12-pounder four 3-pounder and two torpedo tube seven inch of krupp armor protect the vessel amidship and four inch forward the pallada be engage in patrolling the baltic with the admiral makarov when attack by the submarine she open a strong fire on they but be blow up by a torpedo launch by one of the submerge craft while the makarov escape british cruiser hawke sink on October 15th while the british cruiser hawke and theseus be patrolling the northern water of the north sea they be attack by a german submarine the hawke a cruiser of 7750 ton command by capt hpet william be torpedo and sink in eight minute only seventy-three of she crew of 400 officer and man be save british avenge amphion 's loss capt cecil h fox who be in command of the british cruiser amphion when she be destroy by a german mine early in the war have he revenge on October 17 when in command of the cruiser undaunted he sink four german torpedo boat destroyer off the coast of holland only 31 of the combined crew of 400 man be save and these be take as prisoner of war chapter xvi submarine and mine _ battleship in constant danger from submerge craft -- opinion of admiral sir percy scott -- construction of modern torpedo -- how mine be lay and explode on contact _ sir percy scott admiral in the british navy who through he invention make possible the advance in marksmanship with heavy gun and increase the possibility of hit at long range and of broadside firing say recently that everything he have do to enhance the value of the gun be render useless by the advent of the latest type of submarine a vessel which have for its principal weapon the torpedo dreadnought and super-dreadnought be doom because they no longer can be safe at sea from the submarine nor find safety in harbor the introduction of vessel that swim under water he say have in my opinion entirely do away with the utility of the ship that swim on top of the water the function of a war vessel be these : defensively -lrb- 1 -rrb- to attack ship that come to bombard we fort -lrb- 2 -rrb- to attack ship that come to blockade we -lrb- 3 -rrb- to attack ship convoy a landing party -lrb- 4 -rrb- to attack the enemy 's fleet -lrb- 5 -rrb- to attack ship interfere with we commerce offensively -lrb- 1 -rrb- to bombard a enemy 's port -lrb- 2 -rrb- to blockade a enemy -lrb- 3 -rrb- to convoy a landing party -lrb- 4 -rrb- to attack the enemy 's fleet -lrb- 5 -rrb- to attack the enemy 's commerce the submarine render 1 2 and 3 impossible as no man of war will dare to come even within sight of a coast that be adequately protect by submarine the fourth function of a battleship be to attack a enemy 's fleet but there will be no fleet to attack as it will not be safe for a fleet to put to sea submarine and aeroplane have entirely revolutionize naval warfare no fleet can hide itself from the aeroplane 's eye and the submarine can deliver a deadly attack in broad daylight in time of war the scout aeroplane will always be high above on the lookout and the submarine in constant readiness if a enemy be sight the gong sound and the leash of a flotilla of submarine will be slipped whether it be night or day fine or rough they must go out in search of they quarry if they find she she be doom and they give no quarter they can not board she and take she as prize as in the olden day they only wait till she sink then return home without even know the number of human being they have send to the bottom of the ocean not only be the open sea unsafe a battleship be not immune from attack even in a closed harbor for the so-called protect boom at the entrance can easily be blow up with a flotilla of submarine command by dash young officer of whom we have plenty i would undertake to get through any boom into any harbor and sink or materially damage all the ship in that harbor a practical man 's view this be not a mere theorist or dreamer talking say burton roscoe in comment on admiral scott 's statement it be the one man in england most supremely verse in naval tactic the man to whom all nation owe the present effectiveness of the broadside of eight twelve and fourteen inch gun and the perfection in sighting long range gun the newest type of submarine torpedo be 100 per cent efficient the torpedo net of steel that use to be the ship 's defense against torpedo be now useless the modern torpedo need only to come in contact with a surface like the torpedo net or the armor plate of a battleship to discharge a shell which will burst through a two-inch armor caisson rupture the hull of a battleship and sink it in a few minute the torpedo submarine of the modern type have a submerged speed of from eight to ten knot a hour only a small surface include the bridge or conning tower be expose thus make it almost impossible to hit they with the clumsy gun aboard ship the highest type of submarine have a submerged tonnage of 812 ton and its length be 176 foot each submarine carry from one to six torpedo each of which be capable of sink the most heavily armored vessel afloat the sighter in the con tower move swiftly up within range of the vessel he be attack and give the signal for the discharge of the torpedo the man aboard the attack ship have no warning of they impending death except a thin sheaf of water that follow on the surface in the wake of the submerge torpedo and which last only a instant run by compress air by a compress air arrangement motive power be furnish the torpedo in transit for its propeller a gyroscope keep it on a plane and upright a striker on the nose of the torpedo be release by a fan which revolve in the water the nose of the torpedo strike the side of the battleship and the compact jar the primer of fulminate of mercury the high explosive of gunpowder force out a shell and explode with it after the shell have penetrate the armor then the work be do it be generally believe the principal harbor and fortification in england be heavily supply with torpedo of the new type it be also believe that the fortification about the river elbe be thus equip if this be a fact the defend nation will be able not only to repulse any fleet attempt a invasion but also to destroy it by throw across the strait of dover or across the lower end of the north sea a flotilla of its powerful submarine england can prevent any naval invasion of france or england or belgium by germany should the attack fleet take this route in the latest type of submarine the united state be deficient there be only twenty-nine submarine in the united state naval service at the present time and only eighteen under construction the old type of torpedo do not have penetrative power -lrb- illustration : cross section of belgian type of fortress the fort at liege be of this type and long withstand the batter of the german gun this kind of modern fort be design by the famous belgian military engineer general brailmont the strength of every such work must depend on the spirit of its garrison and at liege and namur the belgian defender give a good account of themselves these fort be provide with a elaborate system for repel attempt to carry the work by assault and for make a counter-attack there be land-mine fire electrically from the fort wire entanglement disappear gun and search-light to locate and blind a attack enemy -rrb- -lrb- illustration : construction of modern torpedo show all important part include engine propeller steer gear etc -rrb- sufficient to sink the modern armor-clad battleship unless it strike under exceptionally favorable circumstance a large percentage of the destructive power be expend on the outside of the hull commander davi of the united state navy invent the torpedo that carry its power undiminish into the interior of the vessel can cut torpedo net the new torpedo be provide with special steel cutter by which they cut through the strongest steel torpedo net the torpedo have within it a eight-inch gun capable of explode a shell with a muzzle velocity of about 1000 foot a second the projectile carry a burst charge of a high explosive and this charge be detonate by a delayed-action fuse when the torpedo strike its target the gun be fire and the shell strike the outside plating of the ship then the fuse in the shell 's base explode the charge in the shell immediately after the impact with a small fleet of these under-water fighting vessel -- say of two or three -- a invade or blockade fleet of not more than twenty man-of-war can be destroy within a hour by a otherwise unprotected harbor or port germany have a few of these latest style submarine and if it can rush the construction of the thirty-one now be build it will have a flotilla that will protect its harbor town against invasion france also with its fifty submarine and thirty-one under construction and its great corps of scout aeroplane will prove a formidable agent in crippling the activity of germany 's big fleet of dreadnought armored cruiser and battleship russium will need its twenty-five submarine for coast defense and probably will not send they out of the baltic -lrb- or out of the black sea in the event that italy be draw into the conflict -rrb- undoubtedly then the great battle in the present war on the water at least may be decide by these silently move dinky size almost imperceptible submarine which carry the ever-destroying torpedo and the loss of life will be more prodigious than ever submarine strength of the power build build great britain 69 france 50 russium 25 germany 24 italy 18 austrium 6 submerge mine -- how they be lay and they work the sinking of the light cruiser pathfinder of the british navy by a german mine in the north sea early in the war call special attention to the deadly character of the mine of the present day a modern mine-laying ship put to sea with a row of contact mine on rail along she side ready for drop into the sea the rail project over the stern the essential part of a special type of mine of recent design consist of -lrb- 1 -rrb- the mine proper comprise the explosive charge and detonate apparatus in a spherical case -lrb- 2 -rrb- a square-shaped anchor chamber connect with the mine by a length of cable -lrb- 3 -rrb- a plummet-weight use in place the mine in position connect with the anchor chamber by a rope thus the mine appear on the deck of the mine-laying ship before be lower over the stern before the mine go over a windlass inside the plummet-sinker be revolve by hand until the length of cable between the plummet and the anchor-chamber have be reel off equivalent to the depth below the surface at which the explosive mine be to float then the entire apparatus be hove overboard the plummet and anchor-chamber sink while the spherical mine proper be keep on the surface for the moment by means of a buoyant air-chamber within a windlass in the anchor-chamber now pay out the cable between it and the mine as the anchor-chamber sink on the plummet touching bottom the tension in the cable between it and the anchor-chamber be lessen and the windlass mention stop the anchor-chamber thereupon sink to the bottom drag down the spherical mine until that be at the select depth ready for its deadly work chapter xvii aero-military operation _ aerial attack on city -- some of the achievement of the airman in the great war -- deed of heroism and daring -- zeppelin in action -- they construction and operation _ during the first ten week of the war german airman fly over pari several time and drop bomb that do some damage aeroplane not zeppelin be use in these attempt to terrorize the capital and other city of france the early visit of zeppelin airship to antwerp have be describe in a previous chapter these be continue up to the time of the fall of antwerp while comparatively few life be lose through the explosion of the bomb drop the recur attack serve to keep the inhabitant if not the belgian troops in a state of constant excitement and fear when the city fall into german hand a similar condition arise in england where it be fear that antwerp might be make the base for german airship attack on london and other city of great britain and all possible precaution be take against such attack the member of the royal fly corps be keep constantly on the alert powerful searchlight sweep the sky over london and the english coast every night and artillery be keep in readiness to repel a aerial invasion such be the condition in the third week of October british attack on dusseldorf a new type of british aeroplane be develop during the war capable of rise from the ground at a very sharp angle and of develop a speed of 150 mile a hour and in they operation in france and belgium the british army aviator prove themselves highly efficient and earn unstinted praise from field marshal sir john french in command of the british force on the continent one of they notable exploit be a attack October 8 on the zeppelin shed at dusseldorf and cologne in german territory the attack be make by lieut rsg marix of the naval fly corps in a monoplane and squadron commander spencer gray with lieut sv lippe in a biplane fly from antwerp at a height of 5000 foot to escape the almost continuous german fire lieut marix succeed in locate the zeppelin hangar at dusseldorf then descend to a height of only 1000 foot he release two bomb when directly over they damage both hangar and aircraft a german bullet pass through lieut marix 's cap and the wing of he aeroplane be pierce in a dozen place but he succeed in return to the burn city of antwerp which he be order to leave the same evening during the same raid commander spencer gray fly to cologne he be unable to locate the zeppelin hangar but drop two bomb into the railway station which be badly damage a night or two later a german zeppelin fly over ghent and drop a bomb near the south station on October 11 two german aviator drop a score of bomb on different quarter of pari killing three civilian and injure fourteen other the property damage however be slight and the effectiveness of bomb-dropping as a means of destroy a city or fortification remain to be prove to the military mind it be note that a large proportion of the bomb drop by german aviator fail to explode heroic act by airman story of heroism display by aviator on both side of the great conflict have abound one story of the devotion of german airman tell to a correspondent by several german officer he succeed in verify but be unable to learn the name of the particular hero of the occurrence this story be as follow : in one of the battle around rheim it become necessary to blow up a bridge which be about to be cross by advance french troops come to relieve a beleaguered fort the only way to destroy the bridge be for a airman to swoop down and drop a exceptionally powerful bomb upon it there be twenty-four flyer with that division of the german army a volunteer be ask for it be first announce that the require task mean sure death to the man undertake it every one of the twenty-four step forward without hesitation lot be quickly draw the choose man depart without say farewell to any one within five minute the bridge be in ruin and the aeroplane and its heroic pilot have be blow to piece this incident be not publish in the press of germany because of the fear that it would cause terrible anxiety to the wife of all married german flyer a duel high in the air a aerial victory for a french aviator fight thousand of foot in the air in the presence of troops of both army be report by lieutenant de laine of the french aerial corps on October 10 the air duel be one of the most thrilling since the war begin lieutenant de laine 's account of the combat be as follow : i have be order to fly over the german line with a observer who be to drop pamphlet these pamphlet contain the follow inscription : ` german soldier attention german officer say that the french maltreat prisoner this be a lie german prisoner be as well treat as unfortunate adversary should be ' we have no sooner take wing than the aeroplane be sight by german observer in captive balloon anchor about six mile distant immediately two albatross machine rise from the german camp and come forward we continue to advance meanwhile send the aeroplane higher and higher until the barograph show we be 6000 foot above the ground we machine be speedier than the german aeroplane which be construct of steel and be so heavy it could not work up the speed of the french army monoplane we be able to get over the german line and my companion begin hurl thousand of the pamphlet in every direction it be like a snowstorm in the meantime the german artillery get they long range air gun in action and be hurl volley after volley against we the shell be of special type design to create violent air wave when they burst we be too high to be reach but we have to turn we attention to the two aeroplane which be rush toward we as they approach the german artillery fire stop we be too high to distinguish what be go on beneath we but i could imagine the thousand of soldier stare skyward in wonder at the strange spectacle above they we keep swing in wide circle over the german line and i keep get higher and higher in order to outmaneuver the german plane and to prevent it from get above we so that bomb could be throw at we the machine be all equip with rapid-fire gun and when we get within 100 yard of each other both side open fire the bullet go wide finally we begin to swing backward get lower and lower one of the german machine be thus lure over the french line and we land artillery open against it one of its wing be shatter and it drop but the other aeroplane escape how a german aviator escape how a german aviator in belgium secure control of a fall aeroplane after he companion have be kill be describe in a thrilling letter receive by he father in berlin September 30 it read : dear father : i be lie here in a beautiful belgian castle slowly recover from wound i think would kill I on August 22 i make a flight with lieutenant j a splendid aviator establish the fact that the enemy be advance toward we in the region of bertrix we come into heavy raincloud and have to descend to 3000 foot as we come through the cloud we be see and a entire french division begin shoot at we lieutenant j be hit in the abdomen we motor be put out of commission we be try to volplane across a forest in the distance when suddenly i feel the machine give a jump i turn around -- as i be sit in front -- and find that a second bullet have hit lieutenant j in the head and kill he i lean over the back of the seat and manage to reach the steering apparatus and head down a hail of shot whistle about I i feel something hit I in the forehead blood run into my eye i be faint but will prevail and i retain consciousness just as we be near the ground a gust of wind hit the plane and turn my machine over i fall in the midst of the enemy with my dead companion the ` red trousers ' be come from all direction and i draw my pistol and shoot three of they i feel a bayonet at my breast and give myself up for dead when a officer shout : ` let he live he be a brave soldier ' i be take to the commanding general of the seventeenth french army corps who question I but of course get no information he say i would later be send to pari but as i be weak from loss of blood and seriously wound i be take into they field hospital and care for the officer be very nice to I and when the french fall back i take advantage of the confusion to crawl under a bush where i remain until we troops come many occurrence of a similarly thrilling character have be relate in the camp of the contend army the above suffice to show the patriotic devotion and heroism of the military force of the air which for the first time in history have be a prominent feature of warfare in 1914 zeppelin in action the real story of the performance of air-craft in the have not be tell but there have be enough to give the world a terrifying glimpse of these modern weapon the three attack on antwerp by a zeppelin airship bring into action the long predict onslaught by force of the air against the ground after one of the great german dirigible have be bring down by gunfire because it be accidentally guide too near the earth another return over the city and the havoc work by this single craft realize the horror that would follow any concerted attack by a fleet of the aerial destroyer if they be launch against a city the zeppelin be a impressive thing because of its size cigar-shaped and range from 300 to over 500 foot in length drive at a rate of mile a hour by four propeller and carry a huge car it be most valuable for use at night of course but have prove it be capable of do its deadly work out of range of ordinary gunfire at day artillery have be invent which can reach airship fly at 5000 foot but there be not much of it the half dozen german zeppelin which have be destroy by french and russian fire meet they fate chiefly because they get too near the ground refugee from belgium describe the method use by zeppelin in drop bomb the dirigible be keep as much as possible out of range of the enemy 's gun while it lower a steel cage attach to a steel rope 200 or 300 foot long the cage carry a man who throw down the bomb because of the small size of the cage and the fact that it be keep constantly in motion it be difficult for heavy gun to hit it the great airship remain perfectly stable while the missile of which there be a variety for different mission be be hurl all the military zeppelin of germany be arm and there be a large number of unarmed dirigible in reserve it be estimate that there be 100 aeroplane with the british force on the continent the french army have hundred of aeroplane of various kind germany 's fleet of fly machine have be in action continuously and the aviator have prove a big aid in scout as well as in drop bomb and grenade on the enemy the newest french aeroplane be say to be equip with box fill with thousand of steel arrow these arrow be really steel bolt four inch long when the aviator sail over the enemy he open trapdoor of the arrow box with a simple device and let shower of bolt fall on the man below one of the arrow drop 2000 foot will go through a german helmet and a soldier 's head a shower of they would prove effective against a mass enemy on August 10 the correspondent of the london time in brussels describe the fight at liege say aerial fleet be use by both belgian and german the fighting in midair be desultory but deadly a huge zeppelin sail over liege during the early fighting the fighting in midair be desultory but deadly a huge zeppelin sail over liege during the early fighting but be pursue by a belgian aeroplanist who risk and lose he life in destroy it -lrb- illustration : the relative strength of some of the european nation in aeroplane and dirigible -- aero and hydro chicago -rrb- after the destruction of this zeppelin the german confine they aerial activity to the use of scout aeroplane several of which be destroy by shot from the fort attempt to reach the aeroplane with shell be often unsuccessful however owe to the inability to shoot high enough aviation camp in europe in the early day of the great war only a occasional flash of news be receive about the french and russian aero-military operation or those of the german corps along the russian and french frontier it be difficult to imagine that they be idle for the german-russian and the french-german frontier have be the location of many military aeronautical camp or fortress these be describe at the outbreak of hostility as follow : along the german frontier face russium be the important aero center of thorn and graudenz while the nearest aero base in russium be at riga farther north against german invasion there be french center at verdun nancy luneville and belfort the most important be at belfort sixty mile from the belgian frontier and 170 mile from liege be the great center at rheim with the even more important base at chalons-sur-marne only twenty-five mile distant seventy-five to 100 mile be the scout range of the military aeroplane while the dirigible will scout 500 to 1000 mile from the base accord to the duration efficiency the zeppelin might take some risk travel even farther with this take into consideration the fact that there be only two german aero center on the french frontier -- aix-la-chapelle and metz -- be not very significant the range of the vosge occupy the territory where there be no aero center back of the mountain along the rhone from dusseldorf to strasbourg there be a dozen aero station some of they devoted to aeroplane and dirigible other to dirigible alone the latest datum show that germany have sixty station include private dirigible hangar while france have thirty in most case of greater extent than those in germany russium eight month ago have ten but it be believe that this number have be increase twofold since that time -lrb- illustration : how german empire be fortify against aerial attack center from which kaiser william 's dirigible and aeroplane fleet operate only those city that have aerodrome be show on this map several belgian and french aerodrome also be show -rrb- the two principal belgian center be at brasschaet near antwerp and etterbeck near brussels the aviator operate in the early engagement have undoubtedly fly down from brussels and be in temporary camp at liege there be probably not more than four belgian escadrille or little fleet of four machine each on the scene while germany 's force be supposedly greater chapter xviii battle of the aisne _ most prolonged encounter in history between gigantic force -- a far-flung battle line -- german face french and british in the aisne valley and fight for week -- mighty army deadlock after a desperate and bloody struggle _ for a few day after the tide of battle in france turn in favor of the ally -lrb- September 9 -rrb- the german force continue to retreat to the north closely follow by the french and british army that have fight and win the battle of the marne as describe in a previous chapter this northward movement be mark by heavy german loss in man and munitions of war and last until Saturday September 12 when the german be find to be occupy a position of great defensive strength on the river aisne north of soisson at that time they hold both side of the river and have a formidable line of intrenchment on the hill to the north of eight road bridge and two railway bridge cross the aisne seven of the road bridge and both the railway bridge have be destroy the ally gain some high ground south of the aisne overlook the aisne valley east of soisson then begin -lrb- on Saturday September 12 -rrb- a action along the aisne which be destine to go down in history as the greatest and most prolonged battle of all time two day three day a week two week three four five week it last with vary fortune to the contend army but no decisive result german french and british literally by the thousand fall under the continuous hail of shrapnel the hurricane of machine-gun and rifle fire or in the desperate bayonet charge of daily occurrence but still the battle rage minor position be gain and lose town and village along the far-flung battle line be occupy and evacuate countless deed of heroism be work to be sing and celebrate by posterity in a dozen different land -- but the line on both side hold and victory refuse to perch on any banner modern scientific strategy exhaust its utmost effort flank and turn movement be plan attempt and fail huge mass of man be hurl against each other in every formation know to military skill myriad of life and million of money be sacrifice in historic endeavor to breach the enemy 's front -- but ever the foeman hold he ground and neither side could claim decide advantage intrenchment such as the world have never see before cover the countryside for fifty mile teuton gaul and anglo-saxon turco and hindu literally dig themselves in and refuse to budge a inch though hell itself in all its horror and its fury be loose against they and thus the battle of the aisne -- also aptly call from its extent and ramification the battle of the river -- continue through many week while all the world wonder and stand aghast at the slaughter and the single gleam of brightness that come out of that maelstrom of death and misery be the grow respect of frenchman german and briton for the individual and collective courage of each other and the death-defying devotion that be daily display by all fight continuous day and night beginning as a artillery duel in which the field-gun of the french and german be match against each other from opposite height as never before the battle of the aisne soon resolve itself into a series of daily action in which every arm of the oppose host engage there be little rest for the troops day or night artillery fire begin at daybreak and continue till dusk might break out again at any hour of the night the range of the enemy 's intrenchment be know frequently the artillery seem to open fire in the still watch of the night for no other reason than to prevent the enemy in he trench from get any sleep at all and many a man be bear to the rear on both side suffer from no wound but from utter exhaustion -- a state of collapse which be often as deadly as shrapnel to the soldier in the field for week at a time the only real rest for many of the troops engage along the line of battle come in snatch of a few hour when they be temporarily relieve by fresh troops bring up from the rear and these in they turn might be soon exhaust by the continuous strain of keep on the alert to repel attack -- or as frequently happen they rank might be decimate or worse when they be order to a charge officer and man suffer alike from the strenuous nature of the demand make upon they -- and so far as actual casualty be concern the battle be one in which officer of all rank in all the army suffer perhaps more severely in proportion to the number engage than in any previous battle hundred of british officer for example be among the victim whose bone lie rot in the valley of the aisne as whole page of they portrait in the london journal bear many of the best know name in the british empire testify in mute protest against the horror of war and both germany and france have a similar roll of honor report of the battle while the great battle of the river be in progress the most connected story of its daily development come through the british official news bureau and these be reproduce in part in the page that follow the author of these report be believe to be colonel swinton of field marshal french 's staff who be generally credit with have contribute to the literature of the war some of the most interesting and enlighten account of the operation of the british and french army in the field and these report be give here because of they general character of apparent truth and fairness and in the absence of any similar report from the other side opening of the great battle the follow report from the british headquarters cover the period when the ally ' forward movement be halt along the aisne and also describe the terrain or country in which the subsequent fighting occur : from Thursday September 10 the british army make -lrb- illustration : in the above view the river marne ourcq aisne oise and meuse be clearly show exaggerated in size for convenience of reference the

endeavor to drive back the enemy in co-operation with the french the country across which it have to force its way and will have to continue to do so be undulating and cover with patch of thick wood within the area which face the british before the advance commence right up to laon the chief feature of tactical importance be the fact that there be six river run across the direction of the advance

cross by we force on September 9 as a purely rearguard operation we passage of the ourcq be not contest the vesle be only lightly hold while resistance along the aisne both against the french and the british have be and still be of a determine character on Friday September 11 but little opposition be meet with along any part of we front and the direction of the advance be for the purpose of co-operate with we ally turn slightly to the northeast the day be spend in rush forward and gathering in various hostile detachment by nightfall we force have reach a line north of the ourcq extend from oulchy-le-chateau to longpont on this day there be also a general advance of the french along they whole line which end in a substantial success in one portion of the field duke albrecht of wuerttemburg 's army be drive back across the saulx and elsewhere the whole of the artillery of a german corps be capture several german color also be take it be only on this day that the full extent of the victory gain by the ally on September 8 -lrb- at the marne -rrb- be appreciate by they and the moral effect of this success have be enormous a order dated September 6 and 7 issue by the commander of the german seventh corps be pick up it state that the great object of the war be about to be attain since the french be go to accept battle and that upon the result of this battle would depend the issue of the war and the honor of the german army on Saturday the 12th the enemy be find to be occupy a very formidable position opposite we on the north of the line at soisson work from the west to the east we third army corps gain some high ground south of the aisne overlook the aisne valley to the east of soisson here a long-range artillery duel between we gun and those of the french on we left and the enemy 's artillery on the hill continue during the greater part of the day and do not cease until nearly midnight the enemy have a very large number of heavy howitzer in well-concealed position at braisne the first cavalry division meet with considerable opposition from infantry and machine-gun hold the town and guard the bridge with the aid of some of we infantry it gain possession of the town about midday drive the enemy to the north some hundred prisoner be capture around braisne where the german have throw a large amount of field-gun ammunition into the river where it be visible under two foot of water fateful encounter begin on we right the french reach the line of the river vesle on this day begin a action along the aisne which be not yet finish and which may be merely of a rearguard nature on a large scale or may be the commencement of a battle of a more serious nature it rain heavily on Saturday afternoon and all through the night which severely handicap transport on Sunday the 13th extremely strong resistance be encounter by the whole of we front which be some fifteen mile in length the action still consist for the most part of a long-range gunfire that of the german be to a great extent from they heavy howitzer which be firing from cleverly conceal position some of the actual crossing of the aisne be guard by strong detachment of infantry with machine-gun by nightfall portion of all we three army corps be across the river the cavalry return to the south side by early next morning three pontoon bridge have be build and we troops also manage to get across the river by means of the bridge carry the canal over the river on we leave the french press on but be prevent by artillery fire from build a pontoon bridge at soisson a large number of infantry however cross in single file the top girder of the railway bridge leave standing during the last three or four day many isolate party of german have be discover hide in the numerous wood a long way behind we line as a rule they seem glad to surrender and the condition of some of they may be gather from the follow incident : a officer proceed along the road in charge of a number of lead horse receive information that there be some of the enemy in the neighborhood he give the order to charge whereupon three german officer and 106 man surrender rheim occupy by german rheim be occupy by the enemy on September 3 it be reoccupy by the french after considerable fighting on September 13 on the 12th a proclamation a copy of which be in the possession of the british army be post all over the town a literal translation of this poster follow : ` proclamation -- in the event of a action be fight early today or in the immediate future in the neighborhood of rheim the inhabitant be warn that they must remain absolutely calm and must in no way try to take part in the fight they must not attempt to attack either isolate soldier or detachment of the german army the erection of barricade the take up of pave stone in the street in a way to hinder the movement of troops or in a word any action that may embarrass the german army be formally forbid ` with a idea to secure adequately the safety of the troops and to instill calm into the population of rheim the person name below have be seize as hostage by the commander-in-chief of the german army these hostage will be hang at the slightest attempt at disorder also the town will be totally or partially burn and the inhabitant will be hang for any infraction of the above ` by order of the german authority -lrb- sign -rrb- ` the mayor ' here follow the name of eighty-one of the principal inhabitant of rheim with they address include four priest and end with the word ` and some other ' how the battle develop the follow descriptive report from field marshal sir john french 's headquarters be issue September 22 : at the date of the last narrative September 14 the german be make a determine resistance along the river aisne the opposition have prove to be more serious than be anticipate the action now be fight by the german along they line be naturally on a scale which as to extent of ground cover and duration of resistance make it undistinguishable in its progress from what be know as a ` pitched battle ' so far as we be concern the action still be contest be the battle of the aisne the foe we be fight be just across that river along the whole of we front to the east and west the struggle be not confine to the valley of that river though it will probably bear its name on Monday the 14th those of we troops which have on the previous day cross the aisne after drive in the german rearguard on that evening find portion of the enemy 's force in prepared defensive position on the right bank and could do little more than secure a footing north of the river this however they maintain in spite of two counter-attack deliver at dusk and 10 pm in which the fighting be severe during the 14th strong reinforcement of we troops be pass to the north bank the troops cross by ferry by pontoon bridge and by the remains of permanent bridge close co-operation with the french force be maintain and the general progress make be good although the opposition be vigorous and the state of the road after the heavy rain make movement slow first corps make capture one division alone fail to secure the ground it expect to the first army corps after repulse repeat attack capture prisoner and twelve gun the cavalry also take a number of prisoner there be a heavy rain throughout the night of September 14th and during the 15th the situation of the british force undergo no essential change but it become more and more evident that the defensive preparation make by the enemy be more extensive than be at first apparent the german bombard we line nearly all day use heavy gun bring no doubt from before maubeuge as well as those with the corps all the german counter-attack however fail although in some place they be repeat six time one make on the fourth guard brigade be repulse with heavy slaughter further counter-attack make during the night be beat off rain come on towards evening and continue intermittently until 9 _ be _ on the 16th besides add to the discomfort of the soldier hold the line the wet weather to some extent hamper the motor transport service which be also hinder by broken bridge on Wednesday the 16th there be little change in the situation opposite the british the effort make by the enemy be less active than on the previous day though they bombardment continue throughout the morning and evening on Thursday the 17th the situation still remain unchanged in its essential the german heavy artillery fire be more active than on the previous day the only infantry attack make by the enemy be on the extreme right of we position and as have happen before they be repulse with heavy loss chiefly on this occasion by we field artillery nature of the fighting in order to convey some idea of the nature of the fight it may be say that along the greater part of we front the german have be drive back from the forward slope on the north of the river they infantry be hold strong line of trench amongst and along the edge of the numerous wood which crown the slope these trench be elaborately construct and cleverly conceal in many place there be wire entanglement and length of rabbit fencing both wood and open be carefully align so that they can be sweep by rifle fire and machine-gun which be invisible from we side of the valley the ground in front of the infantry be also as a rule under cross fire from the field artillery place on neighbor height and under high angle fire from piece place well back behind the wood on top of the plateau a feature of this action as of the previous fighting be the use by the enemy of numerous heavy howitzer with which they be able to direct long range fire all over the valley and right across it upon these they evidently place great reliance where we man be hold the forward edge of the high ground on the north side they be now strongly intrench they be well feed and in spite of the wet weather of the last week be cheerful and confident heavy bombardment by both side the bombardment by both side have be heavy and on Sunday Monday and Tuesday be practically continuous nevertheless in spite of the general din cause by the report of the immense number of heavy gun in action along we front on Wednesday the arrival of the french force act against the german right flank be at once announce on the east of we front some mile away by the continuous roar of they quick-firing artillery with which the attack be open so far as the british be concern the greater part of this week have be pass in bombardment in gain ground by degree and in beat back severe counter-attack with heavy slaughter we casualty have be severe but it be probable that those of the enemy be heavier the rain have cause a great drop in the temperature and there be more than a distant feeling of autumn in the air on we right and leave the french have be fight fiercely and have be gradually gain ground one village already have be capture and recapture twice by each side and at the time of writing remain in the hand of the german the fighting have be at close quarter and of the most desperate nature and the street of the village be fill with dead of both side cheer message to the french as a example of the spirit which be inspiring we ally the following translation of a _ ordre du jour _ -lrb- order of the day -rrb- publish on September 9 after the battle of montmirail by the commander of the french fifth army be give : ` soldier : upon the memorable field of montmirail of vauchamp of champaubert which a century ago witness the victory of we ancestor over blücher 's prussian you vigorous offensive have triumph over the resistance of the german hold on he flank he center break the enemy now be retreat towards the east and north by force march the most renowned army corps of old prussium the contingent of westphalium of hanover of brandenburg have retire in haste before you ` this first success be no more than the prelude the enemy be shake but not yet decisively beat you have still to undergo severe hardship to make long march to fight hard battle may the image of we country soil by barbarian always remain before you eye never be it more necessary to sacrifice all for she ` salute the hero who have fall in the fighting of the last few day my thought turn toward you the victor in the last battle forward soldier for france ' letter from a german soldier so many letter and statement of we wounded soldier have be publish in we newspaper that the follow epistle from a german soldier of the seventy-fourth infantry regiment tenth corps to he wife also may be of interest : ` my dear wife : i have just be live through day that defy imagination i should never have think that man could stand it not a second have pass but my life have be in danger and yet not a hair of my head have be hurt ` it be horrible it be ghastly but i have be save for you and for we happiness and i take heart again although i be still terribly unnerved god grant that i may see you again soon and that this horror may soon be over ` none of we can do any more human strength be at a end i will try to tell you about it on September 5 the enemy be report to be take up a position near st prix southeast of paris the tenth corps which have make a astonishingly rapid advance of course be attack on Sunday ` steep slope lead up to the height which be hold in considerable force with we weak detachment of the seventy-fourth and ninety-first regiment we reach the crest and come under a terrible artillery fire that mow we down however we enter st prix hardly have we do so than we be meet with shell fire and a violent fusillade from the enemy 's infantry we colonel be badly wound -- he be the third we have have fourteen man be kill around I we get away in a lull without my be hit ` the 7th 8th and 9th of September we be constantly under shell and shrapnel fire and suffer terrible loss i be in a house which be hit several time the fear of death of agony which be in every man 's heart and naturally so be a terrible feeling how often i have think of you my darling and what i suffer in that terrifying battle which extend along a front of many mile near montmirail you can not possibly imagine ` we heavy artillery be be use for the siege of maubeuge we want it badly as the enemy have theirs in force and keep up a furious bombardment for four day i be under artillery fire it be like hell but a thousand time worse ` on the night of the 9th the order be give to retreat as it would have be madness to attempt to hold we position with we few man and we should have risk a terrible defeat the next day the first and third army have not be able to attack with we as we have advance too rapidly we morale be absolutely break in spite of unheard-of sacrifice we have achieve nothing ' i can not understand how we army after fight three great battle and be terribly weaken be send against a position which the enemy have prepare for three week but naturally i know nothing of the intention of we chief they say nothing have be lose ` in a word we retire towards cormontreuil and rheim by force march by day and night we hear that three army be go to get into line intrench and rest and then start afresh we victorious march on pari it be not a defeat only a strategic retreat i have confidence in we chief that everything will be successful ` we first battalion which have fight with unparalleled bravery be reduce from 1200 to 194 man these number speak for themselves ' event from September 21 to the next report from the official chronicler at the front dated September 24 be in part as follow : the enemy be still maintain himself along the whole front and in order to do so be throw into the fight detachment compose of unit from the different formation the active army reserve and landwehr as be show by the uniform of prisoner recently capture we progress although slow on account of the strength of the defensive position against which we be press have in certain direction be continuous but the present battle may well last for some day more before a decision be reach since it now approximate nearly to siege warfare the nature of the general situation after the operation of the 18th 19th and 20th can not better be summarize than as express recently by a neighbor french commander to he corps : ` have repulse repeat and violent counterattack make by the enemy we have a feeling that we have be victorious ' so far as the british be concern the course of event during these three day can be describe in a few word during Friday the 18th artillery fire be keep up intermittently by both side during daylight at night the german counter-attack certain portion of we line support the advance of they infantry as always by a heavy bombardment but the stroke be not deliver with great vigor and cease about 2 _ be _ during the day 's fight a aircraft gun of the third army corps succeed in bring down a german aeroplane artillery fire become monotonous on Saturday the 19th the bombardment be resume by the german at a early hour and continue intermittently under reply from we gun which be a matter of normal routine rather than a event another hostile aeroplane be bring down by we and one of we aviator succeed in drop several bomb over the german line one incendiary bomb fall with considerable effect on a transport park near lafère a bury store of the enemy 's munitions of war also be find not far from the aisne ten wagonload of live shell and two wagon of cable be dig up trace be discover of large quantity of store have be burn -- all tend to show that as far back as the aisne the german retirement be hurry on Sunday the 20th nothing of importance occur until the afternoon when there be a interval of feeble sunshine which be hardly powerful enough to warm the soak troops the german take advantage of this brief spell of fine weather to make several attack against different point these be all repulse with loss to the enemy but the casualty incur by we be by no means light the offensive against one or two point be renew at dusk with no greater success the brunt of the resistance naturally have fall on the infantry in spite of the fact that they have be drench to the skin for some day and they trench have be deep in mud and water and in spite of the incessant night alarm and the almost continuous bombardment to which they have be subject they have on every occasion be ready for the enemy 's infantry when the latter attempt to assault indeed the sight of the troops come up have be a positive relief after long try hour of inaction under shell fire object of german attack the object of the great proportion of artillery the german employ be to beat down the resistance of they enemy by concentrated and prolonged fire -- to shatter they nerve with high explosive before the infantry attack be launch they seem to have rely on do this with we but they have not do so though it have take they several costly experiment to discover this fact from statement of prisoner it appear that they have be greatly disappoint by the moral effect produce by they heavy gun which despite the actual loss inflict have not be at all commensurate with the colossal expenditure of ammunition which have really be waste by this it be not imply that they artillery fire be not good it be more than good -- it be excellent but the british soldier be a difficult person to impress or depress even by immense shell fill with a high explosive which detonate with terrific violence and form crater large enough to act as grave for five horse the german howitzer shell be from eight to nine inch in calibre and on impact they send up column of greasy black smoke on account of this they be irreverently dub ` coal box ' ` black maria ' or ` jack johnson ' by the soldier man who take thing in this spirit be it seem likely to throw out the calculation base on loss of morale so carefully frame by the german military philosopher the german loss in officer be state by we prisoner to have be especially severe a brigade be state to be command by a major some company of foot guard by one-year volunteer while after the battle of montmirail one regiment lose fifty-five out of sixty officer letter find on german officer the follow letter which refer to the fighting on the aisne and be find on a german officer of the seventh reserve corps have be print and circulate to the troops : ` cerny south of paris sept 17 -- my dear parent : -- we corps have the task of hold the height south of cerny in all circumstance till the fourteenth corps on we left flank can grip the enemy 's flank on we right be other corps we be fight with the english guard highlander and zouave the loss on both side have be enormous for the most part this be due to the too-brilliant french artillery ` the english be marvelously train in make use of ground one never see they and one be constantly under fire the french airman perform wonderful feat we can not get rid of they as soon as a airman have fly over we ten minute later we get shrapnel fire in we position we have little artillery in we corps without it we can not get forward ` three day ago we division take possession of these height and dig itself in two day ago early in the morning we be attack by immensely superior english force -- one brigade and two battalion -- and be turn out of we position the fellow take five gun from we it be a tremendous hand-to-hand fight ` how i escape myself i be not clear i then have to bring up support on foot my horse be wound and the other be too far in the rear then come up the guard jager battalion fourth jager sixth regiment reserve regiment thirteen and landwehr regiment thirteen and sixteen and with the help of the artillery we drive the fellow out of the position again we machine-gun do excellent work the english fell in heap ` in we battalion three iron cross have be give let we hope that we shall be the lucky one the next time ` during the first two day of the battle i have only one piece of bread and no water i spend the night in the rain without my greatcoat the rest of my kit be on the horse which have be leave mile behind with the baggage and which can not come up into the battle because as soon as you put you nose up from behind cover the bullet whistle ` war be terrible we be all hope that a decisive battle will end the war we troops already have get round pari if we beat the english the french resistance will soon be break russium will be very quickly deal with of this there be no doubt ` we have receive splendid help from the austrian heavy artillery at maubeuge they bombard fort cerfontaine in such a way that there be not ten meter of parapet which do not show enormous crater make by the shell the armored turret be find upside down ` yesterday evening about 6 in the valley in which we reserve stand there be such a terrible cannonade that we see nothing of the sky but a cloud of smoke we have few casualty ' telephone a aid to spy espionage be carry on by the enemy to a considerable extent recently the suspicion of some of the french troops be arouse by come across a farm from which the horse have be remove after some search they discover a telephone which be connect by a underground cable with the german line and the owner of the farm pay the penalty in the usual way in war for he treachery after some case of village fighting which occur earlier in the war it be report by some of we officer that the german have attempt to approach to close quarter by force prisoner to march in front of they the german have recently repeat the same trick on a larger scale against the french as be show by the copy of a order issue by the french official it be therein refer to as a ruse but if that term can be accept it be a distinctly illegal ruse refer to rheim cathedral full detail of the actual damage do to the cathedral at rheim will doubtless have be cable so that no description of it be necessary the german bombard the cathedral twice with they heavy artillery one reason it catch fire so quickly be that on one side of it be some scaffolding which have be erect for restoration work straw have also be lay on the floor for the reception of german wound it be to the credit of the french that practically all the german wound be successfully extricate from the burning building there be no justification on military grounds for this act of vandalism which seem to have be cause by exasperation bear of failure -- a sign of impotence rather than of strength five more day of battle on September 29 field marshal french 's headquarters report as follow : the general situation as view on the map remain practically the same as that describe in the last letter and the task of the army have not change it be to maintain itself until there be a general resumption of the offensive no ground have be lose some have be gain and every counter-attack have be repulse -- in certain instance with very severe loss to the enemy of recent event a actual narrative will be carry on from the 25th to 29th inclusive during the whole of this period the weather have remain fine on Friday the 25th comparative quiet reign in we sphere of action the only incident worthy of special mention be the passage of a german aeroplane over the interior of we line it be fly high but draw a general fusillade from below with the result that the pilot be kill outright and the observer be wound the latter be capture by the french that night a general attack be make against the greater part of the ally ' position and it be renew in the early morning of Saturday the 26th the german be everywhere repulse with loss indeed opposite one portion of we line where they be catch in mass by we machine-gun and howitzer firing at different range it be estimate that they leave 1000 kill or wound the mental attitude of we troops may be gauge from the fact that the official report next morning from one corps of which one division have bear the brunt of the fight run thus laconically : ` the night be quiet except for a certain amount of shell both from the enemy and ourselves ' a all-day attack at 3:40 be a attack be make on we right at 5 be there be a general attack on the right of the -- th division but no really heavy firing further ineffectual effort to drive we back be make at 8 be and in the afternoon and the artillery fire continue all day the german come on in ` t ' formation several line shoulder to shoulder follow almost immediately by a column in support after a very few minute the man have close up into a mob which afford a excellent target for we fire on Sunday the 27th while the german heavy gun be in action they brass band could be hear play hymn tune presumably at divine service the enemy make a important advance on part of we line at 6 pm and renew it in strength at one point with however no better success than on the previous night snipe continue all day along the whole front on Monday the 28th there be nothing more severe than a bombardment and intermittent sniping and this inactivity continue during Tuesday the 29th except for a night attack against we extreme right a typical battle incident a incident that occur Sunday the 27th serve to illustrate the type of fight that have for the last two week be go on intermittently on various part of we line it also bring out the extreme difficulty of ascertain what be actually happen during a action apart from what seem to be happen and point to the value of good intrenchment at a certain point in we front we advance trench be on the north of the aisne not far from a village on a hillside and also within a short distance of german work be on a slope of a spur form by a subsidiary valley run north and a main valley of the river it be a calm sunny afternoon but hazy and from we point of vantage south of the river it be difficult exactly to locate on the far bank the well-concealed trench from far and near the sullen boom of gun echo along the valley and at interval in a different direction the sky be fleck with the almost motionless smoke of anti-aircraft shrapnel suddenly and without any warning for the report of the distant howitzer from which they be fire could not be distinguish from other distant report three or four heavy shell fall into the village send up huge cloud of dust and smoke which ascend in a brownish-gray column to this no reply be make by we side shortly afterwards there be a quick succession of report from a point some distance up the subsidiary valley on the side opposite we trench and therefore rather on they flank it be not possible either by ear or by eye to locate the gun from which the sound proceed almost simultaneously as it seem there be a corresponding succession of flash and sharp detonation in the line along the hillside along what appear to be we trench there be then a pause and several cloud of smoke rise slowly and remain stationary space as regularly as poplar again there be a succession of report from german quick-firer on the far side of the misty valley and like echo of detonation of high explosive then the row of expand smoke cloud be prolong by several new one another pause and silence except for the noise in the distance after a few minute there be a roar from we side of the main valley as we field gun open one after another in a more deliberate fire upon the position of the german gun after six report there be again silence save for the whirr of shell as they sing up the small valley then follow flash and ball of smoke -- one two three four five six -- as the shrapnel burst nicely over what in the haze look like some ruin building at the edge of the wood try to enfilade the trench again after a short interval the enemy 's gunner reopen with a burst still further prolong the smoke which be by now merge into one solid screen above a considerable length of the trench and again do we gun reply and so the duel go on for some time ignore we gun the german artilleryman probably rely on concealment for immunity be concentrate all they effort in a particularly forceful effort to enfilade we trench for they it must have appear to be the chance of a lifetime and with they customary prodigality of ammunition they continue to pour bouquet after bouquet of high explosive or combine shrapnel and common shell into we work occasionally with a roar a high angle projectile would sail over the hill and blast a gap in the village one could only pray that we man hold the trench have dig themselves in deep and well and that those in the village be in cellar in the hazy valley bath in sunlight not a man not a horse not a gun nor even a trench be to be see there be only flash and smoke and noise above against the blue sky several round white cloud be hang the only two visible human soul be represent by a glistening speck in the air on high also be to be hear more or less gentle report of the anti-aircraft projectile but the deepest impression create be one of sympathy for the man subject to the burst along that trench upon inquiry as to the loss sustain however it be find that we man have be able to take care of themselves and have dig themselves well in in that collection of trench on that Sunday afternoon be portion of four battalion of british soldier -- the dorset the west kent the king 's own yorkshire light infantry and the king 's own scottish borderer army in a deadlock later report from the aisne valley up to October 17 when the big battle have be five week in progress indicate little change in the general situation bombardment and artillery duel vary by general attack occur daily all along the line the main position of both army be firmly hold though the french have gain some ground north of rheim and continually threaten the german center the left of the ally ' line have creep north to and beyond arras where there be severe fighting for several day and at the end of the thirty-fifth day of this battle of the river the line of the oppose army extend almost continuously from beyond arras on the northwest south in a great curve to the aisne valley thence east to verdun where the crown prince 's army keep hammer away at that fortress without success and thence southwest to nancy and the alsatian border by this time the army of the center be in a species of deadlock the strain on both side have long promise to get beyond human endurance and the antagonist of the aisne be liken by a french officer to two exhaust pugilist who would soon be unable to inflict further punishment upon each other but there be no sign of throw up the sponge on either side though beyond the actual sphere of conflict it be feel that something must give way soon a blaze vale of death write on September 16 the fourth day of the battle a special correspondent behind the british line by senli and chantilly say : i have pass through a smile land to a land wear the mask of death through harvest field rich with great stack snugly build against the winter to the field of a braver harvest by jocund village where there be no break in the ebb and flow of everyday life to village and town that despoil hand have shatter in ruin and i have pass up this via dolorosa toward the very harvest itself -- toward those great plain stretch away on the bank of the river aisne where the second act of this drama of battle be at this moment be play detail of this fight which as i write reach its fourth day of duration be very scanty but partly from personal observation and partly from information which have reach I i know that the struggle so far have be a terrible one equal to if not greater than the struggle on the bank of the marne the event of Monday -lrb- September 14 -rrb- reveal a foe battle desperately for he life and this defense of general von kluck 's army demand of the ally they utmost strength and determination picture this battlefield which will assuredly take its place with that of the marne as one of the greatest combat of the greatest war through the middle of it flow the great river pass from the east to the west the bank of the river here be very steep above the plain which sweep away from the northern bank rise the massif of laon it be a ideal area for great movement and for artillery work direct upon the valley of the river pass eastward a little there be the height behind the city of rheim and above the vesle a tributary of the aisne here again nature have build a stronghold easy to defend difficult exceedingly to attack i know of heroic work against these great line work that will live with the most momentous of this struggle i know of smash attack the thought of which take one 's breath away i have hear narrative of the trench and of the bridge -- these engineer french and english have indeed ` play the game ' -- which no man can hear unmoved how the column go down again and again to the blaze death of the valley and how man work building and gird in a very inferno -- work with the furious speed of those whose time of work be short heroism in the trench and in the trench too the tale of heroism unfold itself hour by hour here be a example one among ten thousand the story of a wounded private : ` we lay together my friend and ithe order to fire come we shoot and shoot till we rifle burn we still they swarm on towards we we take careful aim all the while ah good do you see that i turn to my friend and as i do so hear a terrible dull sound like a spade striking upon newly turn earth he head be fall forward i speak i call he by name he be moan a little then i turn to my work again they be advance quickly now ah how cool i be i shoot so slowlyso very slowly ` and then -- do you know what it feel like to be wound i rise just a little too high on my elbow a sting that pierce my arm like a hot wire -- too sharp almost to be sore i feel my arm go away from I -- it seem like that -- and then my rifle fall i believe i be a little dazed i look at my friend presently he be dead ' the grim story of senli so on these green river bank and across these fair wooded plain the german make they great stand -- the stand that if they be defeat will be they last in france and meanwhile behind they lie the waste field and the broken village it be impossible adequately to describe the scene which i have witness on the line of the great retreat but here and there event have have place which in truth cry to high heaven for report of such be the grim story of senli i spend many hour in senli and i will recount that story as i see it and as i hear it from those who live through the dreadful procession of day on Saturday September 5 the german reach this beautiful old cathedral town and enter into occupation they issue a proclamation to the inhabitant call upon they to submit and to offer no sort of resistance on pain of severe reprisal but the inhabitant of senli have already taste the bitter draft of war make the people have become bitter to the point of lose care of they own safety they be reckless drive to distraction bitter be the price exact for the recklessness the trouble begin when exasperate beyond measure by they insolence a brave tobacconist declare to a couple of the prussian : ' i serve man not bully ' he follow he word with a blow deliver fiercely from the shoulder the infuriate soldier drag he from he shop and hurl he on he knee in front of the door he wife rush out shriek for mercy mercy as well ask it of a stone a shot ring outanotherman and wife lay dead immediately the news of this murderous act fly through the town outraged and furious the conqueror march instantly to the house of the mayor -- they hostage -- and arrest he they convey he without a moment 's delay to the military

the space of a square mile sometimes it be just outside the town that they fall try to find the french troops lie there in they trench wait to go forward to the attack of the hill when they artillery should have prepare the way the cathedral tower make a wonderful grand stand from which to watch this appalling game of destruction it be under the protection of the red cross flag for directly the shell begin to hit the cathedral in the morning some german wound be bring in from a hospital nearby and lay on straw in the nave while abbé andreaux and a red cross soldier pluckily climb to the top of the tower and hang out two geneva flag the crescendo scream the shell make have something fiendish in it that would be thrilling apart from the danger of which it be the sign you hear it a full second before the shell strike and in that time you can tell instinctively the direction of its flight then come the crash of the explosion which be like all the breakage you ever hear gather into one simultaneous smash save the german wound a few of the german shell strike the cathedral and set it on fire the scene be thus describe by abbé camu a priest of rheim : it be all over in a hour there be two separate fire we put the first out with four bucket of water all we have in the place but soon another shell strike the roof and the wind drive the flame along the rafter inside of the nave we rush up but it be flame all along and as we could do nothing we hurry down there be hole in the ceiling of the nave and spark begin to fall through they into a great heap of straw ten foot high and twenty yard long which the german have pile along the north aisle we try to catch the spark in we hand as they fall and such of the german wound as be able to walk help we but the first spark that fall on the pile set it blaze there be time to think of nothing but get out the wound they scream horribly we carry many of those that could not walk while other drag themselves painfully along to the side door in the north aisle those who have only hand and arm wound help they comrade we get out all except thirteen whose body be leave behind when at last i come out of the flaming building i find the whole body of wounded huddle together around the door opposite to they be a furiously hostile crowd of civilian of the town and a number of soldier with they rifle already level i spring forward ` what be you do ' i cry ` they shall all burn ' shout the soldier in answer ` they shall go back and burn with the cathedral or we will shoot they here ' ` you be mad ' i exclaimed in reply ` think of what this mean all the world will hear of the crime the german have commit here and if you shoot these man the world will know that france have be as criminal in she turn anyhow ' i say ` you shall shoot I first for i will not move ' unwillingly the soldier lower they rifle and i turn to six german officer who be among the wound and ask if they would do what i tell they to they say they would and i ask they to tell they man to do the same then i form they up in a solid body those who could walk unaided carry or help those who could not i put myself at the head and we set off to the hotel de ville which be only a few hundred yard away well then the crowd mad with grief and rage set on we i can not describe it you have never see anything so dreadful as that scene they beat some of the german and some of they they get down ` can not you help I ' i call to a french officer i catch sight of ` you will never get to the hotel de ville like this ' he reply so i force my wound through the gateway of a private house and we manage to close the gate after we they have be roughly handle some of they and they stay there a day and a night before we could move they again -lrb- the damage do to the cathedral at rheim by the way though by no means slight inexpressibly sad and truly regrettable be not nearly so great as be indicate by many early report the friend of architectural art and beauty hope to see the cathedral fully restore at no distant date -rrb- slaughter at soisson much of the fighting during the battle of the aisne center around soisson on September 16 a correspondent

great column of smoke mark several point at which house be burn the center of the fighting lie where the british and french pontoon corps be try to keep the bridge they have succeed in throw across the river man who have come from the front line tell I that the combat there have be a positive slaughter they say that the unremitting and desperate firing of these four day and night put anything else in modern warfare into the shade that river crossing be as great a objective on one side to take and keep as on the other to destroy seven day of hell a wounded soldier on be bring back to the hospital at pari after only one week in the valley of the aisne say in a dazed sort of way : each day be like the other it begin at 6 o'clock in the morning with heavy shellfire there be a short interval at which it stop about 5:30 every day then in the night come the charge and one night i could not count they it be awful -- kill kill kill and still they come on shove one another over on to we seven day and night of it and some night only a hour 's sleep it be just absolute hell none of the wound find another word to describe the battle and the sight of the man bear it out muddy to the eye wet often with blood cake on they many be suffer from the curious aphasia produce by continue trouble and the concussion of shell burst some be daze and speechless some deafen and yet strange to say say a correspondent no face wear the terrible animal war look they seem to have be soften instead of harden by they awful experience chapter xix fall of antwerp _ great seaport of belgium besiege by a large german force _ -- _ fort batter by heavy siege gun _ -- _ final surrender of the city _ -- _ belgian and british defender escape _ -- _ exodus of inhabitant _ -- _ german reach the sea _ when the battle of the marne end in favor of the ally and the german retire to take up a defensive position along the aisne the belgian army renew its activity against the invader with the fortified city of antwerp as they base the belgian begin -lrb- on September 10 -rrb- a active campaign have for its object the reoccupation of they city and town which have be take and garrison by german troops in some case they be successful in regain possession of point which they have be force to abandon during the german advance in August and there be many hot encounter with the german who be leave to hold open the german line of communication through belgium but the force of the kaiser be too numerous and too mobile for successful opposition and soon the belgian army despite the most gallant effort be compel once more to retire behind the outer fort of antwerp and there await the come of a enemy who be approach in force great credit must be give to the belgian army for the patriotic manner in which it meet the sudden invasion by the german and for its continued resistance against tremendous odds inspire by the example of king albert and he devoted queen who spend most of they time with the belgian force in the field and share with they the vicissitude of war the defender of belgium fight with the utmost pertinacity the resistance of the belgian when invade and the success of the ally in halt the advance upon pari and turn it into a retreat at the marne appear to have inflamed the german general with a desire to crush belgium completely under a iron heel a object lesson of the power and possibility of the great fighting machine must be give somewhere halt in france by the franco-british army and meeting with vary fortune against the russian host in the eastern campaign germany choose to make belgium once more the international cockpit and hurl a army against antwerp this move if successful -lrb- as it prove to be -rrb- would serve two purpose -- first the further punishment of belgium for she unexpected resistance and second the striking of a direct blow at great britain the possession of antwerp be strategically regard as a pistol level at the head of london the siege of antwerp in the third week of September the german have mass a force believe to be sufficient for the capture of antwerp bring up they heavy krupp siege gun which have be use successfully at liège and namur and plant they within they seven-mile range so as to command the outer belt of fort east and south of the city -lrb- see map of the fortification of antwerp on page 102 -rrb- these huge howitzer be reinforce by heavy siege gun furnish by austrium the fortification system of antwerp be believe by its builder to be practically impregnable but they have not reckon with the tremendous shatter power and great range of the latest krupp siege gun for antwerp be destine to fall she outer and inner defens break down within ten day from the time the siege begin in earnest british marine aid defender the number of german troops engage before antwerp be variously estimate at from 80000 to 200000 the siege proper begin on Tuesday September 29 for more than a week previously there have be daily engagement in the suburb of the city and on several occasion the belgian make a sortie in force only to encounter overwhelming number of the german enemy before whom they be compel to retire behind the shelter of the fort in all these engagement the belgian give a good account of themselves and inflict severe loss on the enemy but the odds against they be too great and then when the great siege gun begin to thunder it be soon realize that the city be in imminent danger king albert do all in he power to encourage the defense and by he presence among he troops on the firing line around the city add greatly to he reputation as a patriotic soldier a force of several thousand british marine come from ostend aid the belgian defense in the last day of the siege but all effort be unavail one by one the fort succumb to the german fire with which the belgian gun could not cope and german troops penetrate nearer and nearer to the doomed city finally on October 9 when the inhabitant be in a state of terror as a result of the long-continued bombardment of the fort and the shell of the city further resistance be see to be useless the defend force belgian and british make they escape to ostend or into the neutral territory of holland the city formally capitulate through the burgomaster and occupation by the german follow immediately the bulk of the british marine make they way back to ostend but a rearguard consist of 2000 british together with some belgian be cut off by the advance of the german across the scheldt and rather than surrender to they march across the border into holland and surrender arm to the dutch authority the man be intern and will be hold in holland till the end of the war it be probable that this rearguard be deliberately sacrifice to enable the anglo-belgian army to make good its retreat the fate of antwerp show what might have happen to paris have the german be able to bring up they great siege gun to the outer fortification of the french capital and protect they while they perform they tremendous task of batter the defens to piece the wreck of antwerp 's outer and inner fort in ten day prove that solid massive concrete chill steel and well-planned earthwork afford little or no security against the monstrous cannon of the kaiser 's army there appear to be but one way of withstand they as seem to have be demonstrate in the valley of the aisne they be apparently ineffective against field force deeply intrenched in a far-flung line the fight outside antwerp early on Tuesday morning October 6 one of the fiercest of the engagement outside antwerp end with the cross of the river nethe by the german and they approach to the inner fort Monday have be the sixth day of the siege and the belgian army be fight with reckless courage to save antwerp as a precaution the boiler of all the german ship lie in the harbor be explode on Sunday in order to prevent if possible use of these ship as transport for german troops across the north sea or elsewhere the detonation of the burst boiler resounding through the city set the excite Sunday crowd very near to a panic this be accelerate by the constant fear of airship attack and most of the population that be not already in active flight from the city seek safety in cellar the entire war have present no greater picture of desolation than that of the host flee from the last belgian stronghold for forty-eight hour before the city fall great crowd of the citizen dumb with terror as the huge german shell hurtle over they head be flee toward england and holland in such number that the hospitality of those country be likely to be tax to the utmost the suburban town of lierre be bombard early in the week the church be destroy and a number of citizen kill and wound the next day the village of duffel be bombard and the population flee into antwerp many still have confidence in the ability of the antwerp fort to withstand the german attack although the german succeed in cross the nethe they repeat attempt to effect a passage over the scheldt be repulse and they then concentrate they attention on a approach to antwerp from the southeast in they trench the belgian resist gallantly to the last most wonderful say a american observer on October 7 be the patient unfaltering courage of the average belgian soldier who have be fight for nine week tire with hollow eye unkempt unwashed and provide with hasty though ample meal he be spend most of the time in the trench king albert the equal of any soldier in he devotion to duty daily expose himself to personal danger while the queen be devote she time to the hospital the effect of the german siege artillery be especially destructive near vosburg several village suffer heavily and the barracks at contich be wreck the fort at waelhem and wavre-st catherine be totally destroy by the terrific shell fire most of the fight around antwerp be a battle of krupp against man every day and night the fight continue with deadly effect against the fort while the shrapnel and shell make many of the trench untenable as fast as the belgian be compel to withdraw from a position the german move up and occupy it the belgian fight stubbornly with infantry and frequently they repulse the german but these repulse always mean a renewal of the artillery attack by the german with the eventual retirement of the belgian until the end of endurance be reach and the city defens be evacuate by they brave garrison a instance of the tenacity with which the infantry stick to they position be report from the berlaere where the command officer and he aid-de-camp be in one of the most expose position sandbag protect they for some time but at last the aid-de-camp be strike by shrapnel and have he face virtually blow away unperturbed by this terrible proof of the danger of he position the command officer stick to he post and for further shelter place the body of he junior over he body in this position he lay firing whenever possible from o'clock in the morning until 4 in the afternoon fierce fight to cross nethe the cross of the river nethe be attend by great loss to the german they hurl they infantry recklessly against the belgian trench and while they lose enormous number eventually succeed in cross the river one of the unsuccessful attempt be describe by a independent observer as follow : the german succeed in get a pontoon complete and they come down to the river bank in solid mass to cross it as they come every belgian gun that could be turn on the spot be concentrate on they and they be blow away block of they at a time and still the mass come on the belgian officer speak with enthusiasm of the steadiness and gallantry with which as each german company be sweep away another push into its place but it be a dreadful sight nevertheless at last the bridge go shatter and blow to bit the belgian gun continue for a while to search the opposite river bank but the german fall back and no more mass of man come down to where the pontoon have be allow for all exaggeration there can be no doubt that the german loss must have be extremely heavy near termonde on Wednesday the 7th the fighting be just as fierce the belgian have four battery of field gun there which succeed in destroy the lock of the river -lrb- the scheldt -rrb- thus flood a part of the river and block the german later they engage in a hot duel with the german artillery two of the belgian battery be completely destroy early in the action and all of the man serve they be kill not until the last of the remain gun be put out of action do the belgian withdraw of the casualty in and around antwerp during the siege it be possible only to make a estimate it be say after the german enter the city that they total loss in kill wound and miss be near forty-five thousand man german officer be credit before the attack with say that they would sacrifice 100000 man if necessary to take antwerp it be probable that the german casualty number at least twenty-five thousand while the belgian loss in actual kill and wound be probably five thousand the latter fight from entrenched position while the heavy german loss be sustain in the open and at the river crossing the casualty among the british marine who arrive only a day or two before the city capitulate be comparatively insignificant story of a eyewitness -- harrowing scene attend the fall of antwerp and the exodus of its people a vivid picture of the pathetic scene attend the fall of antwerp be give by lucien a jone correspondent of the london daily chronicle who write on October 11th as follow : antwerp have be surrender at last the bitterest blow which have fall upon belgium be full of permanent tragedy but the tragedy be lighten by the gallantry with which the city be defend only at last to save the historic building and precious possession of the ancient port be its further defense abandon already much of it have be shatter by the long-range german gun and prolonged resistance against these tremendous engine of war be impossible owe to this the siege be perhaps the shortest in the annals of war that a fortified city have ever sustained heroic effort be make by the belgian to stem the tide of the enemy 's advance but the end could not long be delay when the siege gun begin the bombardment it be at three minute past noon on Friday October 9th that the german enter the city which be formally surrender by burgomaster j de vos antwerp have then be under a devastating and continuous shell fire for over forty hour it be difficult to ascertain precisely how the german attack be plan but the final assault consist of a continuous bombardment of two hour ' duration from half past 7 o'clock in the morning to half-past 9 during that time there be a continuous rain of shell and it be extraordinary to notice the precision with which they drop where they would do the most damage the german use captive balloon whose officer signal the point in the belgian defense at which they should aim german gun conceal the german gun too be conceal with such cleverness that they position could not be detect by the belgian against such method and against the terrible power of the german gun the belgian artillery seem quite ineffective firing come to a end at 930 on Friday and the garrison escape leave only ruin behind they in order to gain time for a orderly retreat a heavy fire be maintain against the german up to the last minute and the fort be then blow up by the defender as the german come in at the gate of maline i be lucky enough to escape by the river to the north in a motorboat the bombardment have then cease though many building be still blaze and while the little boat speed down the scheldt one could imagine the procession of the kaiser 's troops already goose-step they way through the well-nigh desert street many harrowing scene those forty hour of shatter noise almost without lull seem to I now a fantastic nightmare but the sorrowful sight i witness in many part of the city can not be forget it be Wednesday night that the shell begin to fall into the city from then onward they must have average about ten a minute and most of they come from the largest gun which the german possess ` black maria ' as tommy atkin have christen they before the bombardment have be long in operation the civil population or a large proportion of it fall into a panic it be impossible to blame these peaceful quiet-living burgher of antwerp for the fear that possess they when a merciless rain of german shell begin to fall into the street and on the roof of they house and public building the burgomaster have in he proclamation give they excellent advice to remain calm for instance and he certainly set they a admirable example but it be impossible to counsel perfection to the belgian who know what have happen to they fellow-citizen in other town which the german have pass through fight to get on the boat immense crowd of they -- man woman and child -- gather along the quayside and at the railway station in a effort to make a hasty exit from the city they condition be pitiable in the extreme family party make up the biggest proportion of this vast crowd of broken man and woman there be husband and wife with they group of scared child unable to understand what be happen yet dimly conscious in they childish way that something unusual and terrible and perilous have come into they life there be fully 40000 of they assemble on the long quay and all of they be inspire by the sure and certain hope that they would be among the lucky one who would get on board one of the few steamer and the fifteen or twenty tugboat available as there be no one to arrange they systematic embarkation a wild struggle follow amongst the frantic people to secure a place man woman and child fight desperately with each other to get on board and in that moment of supreme anguish human nature be see in one of its worst mood but who can blame these stricken people appal by the horror of war they be flee from _ les barbares _ ' and shell that be destroy they home and give they beloved town to the flame be scream over they head they trade be not war they be merchant shopkeeper comfortable citizen of middle age or more there be many woman and child among they and this horror have come upon they in a more appalling shape than any in which horror have visit a civilized community in modern time there be a scarcity of gangway to the boat and the only means of board they be by narrow plank slope at dangerous angle up these the fugitive struggle and the strong elbow the weak out of they way in a mad haste to escape by 2 o'clock Thursday most of the tugboat have get away but there be still some 15000 people who have not be able to escape and have to await whatever fate be in store for they a great exodus of inhabitant at the central railway station incident of a similar kind be happen there as down by the river immense throng of people have assemble and they be fill with dismay at the announcement that no train be run in they despair they prepare to leave the city on foot by cross the pontoon bridge and march towards the dutch frontier i should say the exodus of refugee from the city must have total 200000 man woman and child of all age or very nearly that vast number out of a population which in normal time be 321800 i now return to the event of Thursday October 8th at 1230 in the afternoon when the bombardment have already last over twelve hour through the courtesy of a belgian officer i be able to ascend to the roof of the cathedral and from that point of vantage i look down upon the scene in the city all the southern portion of antwerp appear to be desolate ruin whole street be ablaze and the flame be rise to a height of twenty and thirty foot from my elevated position i have a excellent view also of the great oil tank on the opposite side of the scheldt they have be set on fire by four bomb from a german taube aeroplane and a huge thick volume of black smoke be ascend two hundred foot into the air it be like a bit of gustave doré 's idea of the infernal region city almost desert the city by this time be almost desert and no attempt be make to extinguish the fire that have break out all over the southern district indeed there be no means of deal with they for ten day the water supply from the reservoir ten mile outside the city have be cut off and this be the city 's main source of supply the reservoir be just behind fort waelthen and a german shell have strike it do great mischief it leave antwerp without any regular inflow of water and the inhabitant have to do they best with the artesian well great effort be make by the belgian from time to time to repair the reservoir but it be always thwart by the german shell fire kill before he wife 's eye after leave the cathedral i make my way to the southern section of the city where shell be burst at the rate of five a minute with great difficulty and not without risk i get as far as rue lamoiere there i meet a terror-stricken belgian woman the only other person in the street besides myself in hysterical gasp she tell I that the bank nationale and palais de justice have be strike and be in flame and that she husband have be kill just five minute before i come upon the scene he mangled remains be lie not one hundred yard away from where we be stand except for the lurid glare of burn building which light up the street the city be in absolute darkness and near the quay i lose my way try to get to the hotel wagner for the second time that day i narrowly escape death by shell one burst with terrific force about twenty-five yard from I i hear its warning whirr and rush into a neighbor porch whether it be from the concussion of the shell or in my anxiety to escape i caromed against the door and tumble down and as i lay on the ground a house on the opposite side crash in ruin i remain still for several minute feel quite sick and unable to get up then i pull myself together and run at full speed until i come to a street which i recognize take refuge in cellar how many of the inhabitant of antwerp remain in the city that night it be impossible to say but they be all in the cellar of they house or shop the burgomaster m de vo have in one of he several proclamation make many suggestion for safety during the bombardment for the benefit of those who take refuge in cellar among the most useful of they perhaps be that which recommend means of escape to a adjoining cellar the power of modern artillery be so tremendous that a cellar might very well become a tomb if a shell fall on the building overhead sleep be impossible that night in the noise cause by the explosion of shell in twenty different quarter of the town about 6 o'clock i be tell that it be time we get out as the german be enter the city we hurry from the hotel and find the street completely desert i walk down to the quay-side and there i come across many wounded soldier who have be unable to get away in the hospital boat on the quay pile of equipment have be abandon a broken-down motor-car kit-bag helmet rifle and knapsack be litter in heap ammunition have be dump there and render useless the belgian have evidently attempt to set fire to the whole lot the pile of stuff be still smolder i wait there for half a hour and during that time hundred of belgian soldier pass in the retreat just about this time a pontoon bridge which have be the means of the belgian retreat be blow up to prevent pursuit by the german at 8 o'clock a shell strike the town hall and about 8:15 another shell shatter the upper story and break every window in the place burgomaster parley with german that be the german way of tell the burgomaster to hurry up a quarter of a hour later m de vos go out in he motor-car toward the german line to discuss the condition on which the city should be surrender at 9:30 o'clock the bombardment of the city suddenly cease and we understand that the burgomaster have by this time reach the german headquarters still we wait painfully anxious to learn what would be the ultimate fate of antwerp belgian soldier hurry by and at 10 : proclamation be post on the wall of the town hall urge all in the city to surrender any arm in they possession and beg all to remain calm in the event of the german ' occupation a list be also post of several prominent citizen who be appoint to look after the interest of those belgian who remain the

appoint military governor of antwerp it be expect that the city would become the base for zeppelin attack upon england and also for a german naval campaign in which mine and submarine would play a important part this be intimate in dispatch from berlin follow the german occupation of the city the german general staff in announce the capture add that they could not estimate the number of prisoner take we take enormous quantity of supplies of all kind say the official statement chapter xx the wound and prisoner _ typical precaution use by the german army _ -- _ the soldier ' first-aid outfit _ -- _ system in hospital arrangement _ -- _ how prisoner of war be treat _ -- _ be humane and fair to all concerned _ modern army take the best possible care of they wound and none have bring this department of warfare to greater perfection than the germany army one detail of this work show the german army at its best every soldier have sew under a corner of he coat a strip of rubber cloth under this strip be a piece of antiseptic gauze a strip of bandage and plaster and cloth for the outer bandage this cloth bear in simple picture direction for dress every sort of wound when a soldier be wound either he or some comrade rip open this package and apply at once the life save dress which will last at any rate until the soldier be bring to a station where the first scientific attention be give through this simple and inexpensive device thousand upon thousand of german soldier who have be slightly wound in battle have return to they comrade within a few day completely well and have take they place in the rank once more without this care a large percentage of the wound would become inflamed as have be the case with hundred of wounded french prisoner capture by the german the ordinary procedure of care for the wound in the german army be for the sanitary corps which be well provide with stretcher and bandage to gather up the wound on or near the firing line and bring they to a gathering point a little way behind the line here the army surgeon be ready to begin work at once upon the most urgent case they be assist by member of the corps who remove the temporary bandage and put on dressing which will last until the soldier reach a hospital then from this first gathering point the wounded soldier be put on stretcher in red cross wagon and carry to the field hospital a few mile farther back where doctor and nurse be at work hospital in village church these hospital be usually establish in village church or town hall one room be clear and arrange for a operating room where bullet and piece of shell be remove and amputation be make if necessary i have just visit such a field hospital say a correspondent with the right wing of the german army in france write on September 28 it be in a little whitewashed village church heat by a stove everywhere be white bed make of straw and cover with sheet perhaps twenty wound be here include two capture irishman they lay quite still when the army doctor usher we in for they be too seriously wound to pay much attention to anything near this hospital be another in a town hall while we be there a consulting surgeon arrive to investigate the condition of a seriously wounded lieutenant whose leg might need amputation two orderly put the patient on a stretcher and he be take into the next room for examination later in the day the amputation be perform move to hospital in city from these little field hospital as soon as the man can be move they be take to some general hospital in the nearest large city where several thousand can be care for such a hospital exist in this neighborhood in the building of a normal college where every corner be use in housing wound man i make a quick trip through this building and the memory of it be one of the most heartrending picture i have of the war room after room be fill with the victim of the conflict every man be seriously wound some have suffer amputation and the head of other be so bandaged that no feature could be see only a tube to the nose permit breathing horror in hospital sight in one room a surgeon have a soldier on the operating table and be pull piece of shell from a huge hole in the inner side of one of he leg on a stretcher on the floor wait for he turn to come under the surgeon 's care be a officer he face be cover with blood he be wave he arm wildly and gasp for air this scene leave a impression of the utmost horror upon I slightly wound soldier whom it be not necessary to leave for a while in the field hospital be send directly to these larger hospital and thence after a short convalescence be load into red cross train and send home for recovery later they return to take they place in the regiment such train can be see daily along any main line of railroad in some case freight car with straw bedding be use one of the finest example of charity give during the war be a splendid red cross train entirely equip as a modern hospital even have a first class operating room this be give to the german army by the citizen of wilmersdorff who also employ a excellent surgeon score of life will be save through a small outlay of money graveyard on battlefield near the large hospital i visit be a graveyard where there be score of neatly marked fresh grave each bear a cross or tablet with the name of the soldier and he regiment division and corps mark on it in some case comrade have add a word or two of scripture the death be too numerous for a impose ceremony at each burial but for every one a army chaplain read scripture and offer a short prayer while a few comrade stand by with bare head the identity of each soldier be easily determine from the name plate which he wear in a little leather purse suspend from around the neck after a battle these plate be gather from the dead and from these the death list be make out -lrb- it be say that after the battle of the marne no fewer than 68000 of these name plate or tag be find collect in one place -- ed -rrb- after a battle where the death mount into the thousand some field will be shut off for a cemetery and there the body be bury each grave receive some kind of a cross wherever it be possible but here no name can be attach there will be many home in which there will be vacant place and where it will not even be know where the absent one be bury kaiser insist on enter while here i hear a touching story about a lieutenant who be die in the hospital while the kaiser be inspect it the kaiser come to the room where the officer lay and the attendant ask he not to enter as a man be die the kaiser immediately push he way in go up to the lieutenant put he hand on the officer 's shoulder and say in german : ` hello here i be ' the lieutenant begin murmur with he eye close ' i have be dream and i dream that my kaiser come to I put he hand on my shoulder and speak to I ' ` open you eye ' say the kaiser the lieutenant obey smile a smile of recognition and then close he eye in the final sleep surgeon win iron cross so far accord to official announcement there have be between 50000 and 60000 wound and immediately after a great battle the sanitary corps have be unable to cope quickly enough with the work but under ordinary circumstance the provision make have be ample the number of the sanitary corps be determine upon the experience in the russo-japanese war in which the loss be by no means so heavy as they have be in this war but where in a few case number have be lack the surgeon and they assistant have put forth herculean effort many

that 30000 russian have be take prisoner by the german soldier after heavy battle in east prussium particularly around ortelsburg hohenstein and tannenburg the statement mention the fact that among the prisoner be many russian officer of high rank what be do with these prisoner how they be handle and treat and whether high official be punish more severely than mere private be question frequently

the declaration of london contain provision that provide expressly what manner of treatment shall be accord prisoner of hostile nation who be take in battle if these provision of international law be live up to the lot of the prisoner of war be not so hard as many people have be lead to believe after the first year of the war however story of ill-treatment of prisoner in german prison camp begin to be tell and before long there be many well-authenticated case of the kind inhuman treatment be report by english and canadian prisoner and protest be duly make by the british government through neutral channel the grow shortage of food in germany be allege as the cause of some of the complaint but case of actual brutality involve cowardly physical abuse and even kill be also report the nation which capture its enemy 's soldier and make prisoner of they be hold entirely responsible for whatever happen and shoulder at once a responsibility that be commensurate with the number of prisoner who be take and detain the law of warfare say that a prisoner must be as fair with he captor as they be with he he must be humanely treat so it be prescribe and when he be question by he captor he must give he true name and the rank he hold in the army which have be defeat and of which he be once a part contrary to general belief he be not strip of everything and throw into a dungeon and feed on a crust of bread and a mug of stale water he captor do not deprive he of he personal possession except weapon horse and military papers furthermore they must give he complete religious liberty and it be specifically decree that he must be give opportunity to attend a church of the denomination to which he belong and there he may pray as much for the success of he own nation or the much-desired relief from detention as the state of he mind dictate prisoner may be confine the prisoner of war may be intern in a town or a fort or even a camp accord to the convenience of he captor but the enemy may not confine he except the law say as a indispensable measure of safety and then only as long as the circumstance make it necessary of course the law give the commanding officer considerable leeway in such matter for he be leave to determine when the indispensable occasion arise at other time when the prisoner be at liberty he be subject to all the rule and regulation of the army of the government that capture he and if he refuse to obey the rule or act in a insubordinate manner toward the officer in command he may be punish and discipline accord to he offense and here it be again leave to the discretion of he captor as to what measure of punishment shall be inflict upon he attempt at escape if a prisoner of war attempt to escape and he captor be vigilant to the extent of retake he before he leave the territory they occupy or before he have a chance to rejoin he own army he may be severely punish on the other hand if he elude he captor and make a clean getaway and he army be again unfortunate and he be capture the second time the perfectly good escape from previous captivity must go unpunished and he must be treat as a prisoner of war just as though he have not make the successful dash for liberty and further glory the government that hold prisoner of war be chargeable with they maintenance and must provide they with food clothing and shelter as good as that provide for its own troops the officer of the captor be require to keep record of all the prisoner under they charge and if relief society which have be extensively form by the woman of europe and many american woman as well wish to minister to they need and comfort the officer in command must afford they every possible facility and if the friend of prisoner or the welfare society see fit to send they present and clothing medicine and other necessity such goods must be admit to they free of any war duty that might be impose by the nation hold they and the railroad own by the government be bind to carry such supplies free of transportation charge captive must be pay for work prisoner of war may be put to work by the government that capture they and the duty must be assign with a view to they aptitude fitness and rank the task must not be unduly severe so as to border on cruelty and they must have no bearing whatever on the operation of the war the prisoner must be pay for the work they do moreover at a rate equal to that be pay to the soldier of the national army and prisoner may be authorize to work for the public service for private person or on they own account the wages of these prisoner the law say must go toward improve they condition and the balance must be pay they after they release with the proper deduction for they board and keep when officer of hostile army who be capture be put to work they must get the same wage rate as be pay to the corresponding officer of the government whose captive they be all these money must be ultimately refund by they own government to they captor after the war be over peace be declare and the intricate problem of indemnity come up for solution a prisoner of war may even be parole by he captor and this be do sometimes when he be disabled or there be circumstance that prompt he enemy to let he go to those who be near and dear to he when parole be grant to a prisoner he make a solemn pledge and promise that he will live up to the term under which he be release and even he own nation may not ask he to perform a service that be inconsistent with that pledge breaker of a parole it go hard with the prisoner on parole who be catch fight against the nation that release he for he be not entitle to be treat as a prisoner of war and the judgment mete out to he be as terrible as it be sure certain code of honor be suppose to be observe even in international warfare and a soldier who break he word of honor be consider the most despicable of man chapter xxi horror of the war _ american relief for war-stricken people of europe _ -- _ million of dollar contribute in cash and gift _ -- canada aid the belgian _ -- devastation of poland even greater and more terrible they that of belgium _ soon after the world become aware of the fact that the german army 's progress through belgium on its dash to pari in August of 1914 have result in the absolute devastation of the little buffer state a enterprising and

of a useful character for the little one of all the belligerent nation the response be immediate and most truly generous newspaper and civic organization all over the united state join in gathering from young and old the contribution that freight a united state warship with a cargo of gift worth over two million dollar and at yuletide these gift be systematically distribute among the innocent victim of the war in all the country concern the idea of the christmas ship be nobly conceive and splendidly execute ruler of the belligerent nation recognize the beauty of the idea and pause awhile in they martial activity to welcome and thank the american commissioner who enact the role of a international santa claus but the slaughter on the fighting line of eastern and western europe go on unabated and the peaceful symbolism of the christmas ship be soon forget in the daily recurrence of battle and bloodshed awful condition in poland while the frightful state of belgium command the sympathy of the civilized world in the winter of 1914-15 the condition in poland be even worse at the end of march the great polish pianist ignace paderewskus pay a visit to london on behalf of the

committee which soon succeed in raise a large sum for the relief of the most urgent distress in poland while in london on he mission of mercy mr paderewskus say : be it the death agony or only the birth pang that be the question which every pole throughout the world be ask himself as tragedy follow tragedy in the long martyrdom of we beloved nation you have only hear the detail of belgium but i tell you they be as nothing with what have happen in poland the scene of operation in poland be seven time larger than that of belgium and she have have to endure seven time the torture remember the battle of europe be be fight in the east not in the west and while the tide of battle have reach a sort of ebb along the trench about the frontier of alsace and flander the great wave roll backward and forward from germany to russium and break always on poland we country in fact be just as belgium be call -- the cockpit of europe and it may now be call the battlefield of the world if not of civilization it be only perhaps we pole who have know to its utmost depths what this war have really mean it be not only that there be 10000 human being on the verge of starvation nay actually perish there be worse than that remember that both belgium and poland be still under the yoke the russian it be true occupy some fifteen thousand mile of we country but this be really nothing for the german occupy five-sixth of it and the desolation pass all comprehension call it compulsory suicide as to actual battle i can hardly speak of they it be torture even to think of they only consider we one nation be divide as it be into three section which be thrust each against the other to work out they destruction it be parricide it be fratricide nay suicide compulsory suicide that be what it be listen to what it mean to we all i be tell by a man from austrium that a army doctor a pole by birth who be depute to go over the austrian battlefield and verify identification mark on the body find among the 14000 dead hardly any but polish name he look in vain for any other and in the end go mad with horror at the thought of it another story that come to I the other day tell of another case of the tragedy of poland which be almost too terrible for the human mind to contain the incident take place during a charge both army have be order to attack and the pole as usual be in the front line as they meet in the shock they recognize each other one poor fellow as he be strike through by a bayonet cry out in he death agony ` jesu maria i have five child jesu marium ' the word go as straight to the brain of he conqueror as a dagger to the heart and kill he reason somewhere among the madhouse of europe there be a lunatic he be not violent but he never laugh he only wander about with the word of he die victim ` ah jesu maria i have five child jesu marium ' the promise of grand duke nichola that poland shall be a nation once again go straight to the very heart of every one of we 25000 fellow countryman that one promise have be sufficient to change the whole mentality of the nation and fill they soul with new hope it have clear up any doubt that might have exist in the mind of the pole in austrium and prussium as to what it be that the ally be fight for -- namely : the principle of nationality for which we have suffer ah how many century million of pole destitute the ruin work by war in belgium affect 7000000 people in poland more than twice that number have be render destitute not less than 15000 village have be lay waste burn or damage in russian poland alone the loss in property have be estimate at $ 500000000 but may reach double that sum in galicium the condition be report to be equally appalling though the smashup have not be as complete because the russian have be able to maintain they position more permanently than they have in the district west and northeast of the polish capital the greater part of poland lie in a broad sweep of country west southwest and northeast of warsaw have be sweep over and batter to piece by shot and shell like the strip of flander on both side of the yser river without any direct interest in the present great conflict the unhappy pole find themselves impressed into the army of these three great power and fight against they own racial brethren that mean that brother be to fight against brother and as the stress of the war increase and the age limit be raise to 38 year and even higher nearly every able-bodied pole be impress into service almost the first move of the russian at the outbreak of hostility be to invade galicium this bring with it instantly all the most frightful horror of war embrace as it do a large part of the grain-growing district of the polish people the devastation of galicium mean suffer for

reinforcement be be rush to the front german effort to break through the ally ' line be concentrate on the main center at verdun and on the right flank of the ally ' left wing above its elbow between noyon and arras while powerful coincidal movement be in progress on the extreme western end of the line in belgium and on the southeastern wing in alsace at verdun continuous fighting of the fiercest character have be go on for over sixty day surpass in time and severity any individual battle in history the army of the crown prince have be unable to force the french position in the vicinity of verdun and the check sustain by the german at this point early in the campaign constitute a principal cause of general von kluck 's failure in he dash toward paris all along the tremendous battle front the ally ' line as a rule hold firm in the thirteenth week of the war when the great conflict have enter upon what may well be call its fourth stage the third stage may be say to have end with the fall of antwerp and the subjugation of all belgium but a small portion of its southwestern territory on the main front the ally be maintain the offensive at some vital point while repulse the german assault at other one or two of the french fort command verdun have fall but the main position remain in the hand of the french and all along the line it be a case of daily give-and-take fierce fighting in flander after capture antwerp the german push on to ostend a open or unfortified town and occupy it with slight resistance from the belgian army which be reform its broken rank to the

bloody engagement be fight at nieuport dixmude deynze and la bassée at this time the battle line form almost a perpendicular from noyon in france north to the belgian coast south of ostend a battle rage for several day in west flander and northern france and both side claim success the loss of the ally and the german be estimate in the thousand and the wound be send back to the rear by the trainful in the flemish territory the flat nature of the terrain with its numerous canal and almost total absence of natural cover make the loss especially severe the passage of the yser cost the german dearly and dixmude be strew with they dead and they advance could get no farther the necessity of hold the french port dunkirk and calai be fully realize by the ally who throw large reinforcement into they northern line the german also draw heavily on they center and leave wing to reinforce the right and for a while the force oppose one another at the extreme western end of the battle front be greater than at any other point the german be firmly hold on a line run from south of ostend to thourout rouler and menin the last mention place be on the border north of lille flanking attack be no longer possible as the western flank of both army rest on the north sea the german be compel to make a frontal assault along the line form by the belgian frontier as the belgian

possible egress the situation try the patience of the people of both country and there be frequent demand for action by the great and costly naval armament but the german apparently be not ready to risk a general engagement and the british could not force they to come out and fight the british admiral therefore have perforce to pursue a policy of watchful wait irksome as it be to all concerned and the tireless vigil in the north sea as it be term by mr asquith be maintained day and night no sea captain becalm in the doldrums ever whistle for a wind more earnestly than the british jack tar pray for a chance at the enemy during those three month of play the cat to germany 's mouse and on the other hand the german sailor be no doubt equally desirious of a chance to demonstrate the fight ability of they brand-new battleship all be equally on the _ qui vive _ for any hour might bring to the german the order to put to sea and to the british the welcome cry of enemy in sight caring for belgian refugee the plight of the belgian people include the refugee in holland england and france be pitiable in the extreme and by the end of October have rouse the sympathy of the entire world a

spare no effort to lessen they suffering more canadian for the front it be announce in ottawa canada on October 19 that the dominion government have decide to put 30000 more man in training in canada to be despatch to england when ready as soon as the first unit of 15 be embark probably in December another 15000 man would be enlist to replace they the plan be to keep 30000 man continuously in training to be draw upon in unit of 10000 or 15000 as soon as equip during the continuance of hostility in europe thus with the 32000 canadian volunteer already land in england and 8000 under arm guard strategic point in the dominion canada would soon raise 100000 man as part of she contribution to imperial defense but this be only a beginning later in the war canada stand ready to furnish half a million man to the cause of the empire if require nearly 360000 of that number have be enlist when the war be two year old the greatest problem be encounter in the first year or rather in the first six month of the war after which time effort be systematize the military machine work smoothly and the dominion 's splendid response to the call to arm be maintain throughout general prosperity in the face of adverse condition happily attend this record of patriotic achievement and the predominant spirit in canada be one of buoyant optimism as to the inevitable outcome of the great conflict the emden drive ashore a wreck during the first three month of the war the german cruiser emden operate principally in the indian ocean play havoc with british merchantman sink over twenty vessel

appalling loss of life on both side the german occupy dixmude November 11 only to lose it on November 13 after a fierce attack by reinforce british troops daily cost of war the daily cost of the present war to the nation engage in the struggle be estimate at not less than $ 54000000 a day -- a sum which fairly stagger the imagination this enormous cost of the army in the field give a decide advantage to the nation best supply with the sinew of war and may contribute to a shorten of hostility war be indeed a terrible drain upon the resource of a nation and only a few there be that can stand many month of war expenditure like those of august-october 1914 amounting in the grand aggregate to nearly five billion of dollar -lrb- $ 5000000000 -rrb- turkey enter the war on October 29 a act which be regard in russium as equivalent to a declaration of war by turkey be commit at theodosium the crimean port when that town be bombard without notice by the cruiser breslau fly the turkish

the heaviest loss to all the nation concern but make little change in the general situation along the aisne the battle begin early in September continue intermittently both side literally dig themselves in and along the battle line in many place the hostile trench be separate by only a few yard at the end of the month the burrowing have be succeed by tunneling and both side prepare for a winter of spasmodic action it be a military deadlock but a deadlock full of danger for the side that first develop a weak point in its far-flung front with the utmost fairness and impartiality it can be say that at the beginning of December both the ally army and the german force face they from the belgian coast east and south to the border of alsace-lorraine be exhaust by the strenuous effort of the campaign by December 5 the 130th day of the war after a seven-week ' struggle by the german for the possession of the french and belgian coast there be a general cessation of offensive operation by both side and the indication be that this condition be due to pure physical weariness of leader and man the world have never before witness such strenuous military operation as those of the precede three month and the temporary exhaustion of the army therefore be not surprising in the last day of November the city of belgrade fall into the hand of the austrian after a siege that have last with continual bombardment since the war begin the city be finally take by storm at the point of the bayonet in a furious charge which fairly overwhelm the gallant defense of the servian in this month it begin to be generally realize that the war be likely to be of prolonged duration strenuous preparation for the winter campaign be make on both side and the recruiting for the new british army surpass all previous record the serious menace of the war be at last recognize the month of November be also mark by enormous contribution of cash and food stuff by the people of the united state for the relief of the impoverished and suffer belgian the people of chicago alone contribute over $ 500000 and this be but a sample of the manner in which american rise to the opportunity to alleviate the distress in belgium the united state have save we from starvation say a belgian official on December 1 the casualty of all the army in the field during the month of November exceed those of any previous period of the war base a estimate of the total casualty upon the same percentage as that employ in the table give on another page it be therefore safe to say that up to December 5 the total loss of the combatant nation in kill wound and miss aggregated not less than 3500000 man December in the trench the month of December 1914 the fifth month of the war register but little change in the relative position of the combatant nation in the west the line hold firm from the north sea to switzerland daily duel of artillery and daily assault here and there along the battle front prove unavailing so far as any change in general condition be concerned frequently the assault be of a desperate character especially in flander where in the middle of the month the ally assume the offensive all along the line and sturdily strive to push back the german front in belgium but the utmost valor and persistence in attack be invariably meet by resolute resistance both side be strongly entrenched and the gain of a few yard today be usually follow by the loss of a few yard tomorrow never before in the history of warfare have the science of entrenchment be develop to such a extent the german french british and belgian army literally burrow in the earth along a battle front of 150 mile in many place the hostile trench be separate by only a few yard and mining be frequently resort to tunneling toward each other both the contend force occasionally succeed in blow up the enemy 's trench and whole company of unsuspecting troops be sometimes annihilate in this way in the trench themselves scene unparalleled in warfare be witness with the arrival of winter the troops on either side proceed to secure what comfort they could by all manner of clever and unique device winter clothing be provide as far as possible but on both side there be inevitable suffering for lack of suitable supplies for the winter campaign and individual initiative have frequently to supply the deficiency of official forethought many unique feature of trench life be develop during the first month of winter warfare two-story trench become common on both side of the firing line bombproof underground quarter for staff and command officer be construct and these be fit up so as to provide all the comfort of the winter cantonment of old-time warfare the ever-necessary telephone be install at frequent point in trench that stretch for score of mile in practically unbroken line board roof be build and provision make for heat the dugout in which thousand of man pass many day and night before they relief arrive on the german side mile of trench be provide with stockade wall leave ample room inside for the rapid movement of troops the british build trench with lateral individual dugout at right angle to the main trench protect the man against flank fire -- and these arouse the admiration even of they enemy in the french trench the ingenuity of a french engineer provide a system of hot shower bath on the firing line and from all point along the deadlocked battle front come story of the remarkable manner in which the troops of all the army speedily accommodate themselves to unprecedented condition and maintain a spirit of cheerfulness truly marvelous under the circumstance especially as there be no cessation of the constant endeavor to gain ground from the enemy and no end to the daily slaughter in the german trench a correspondent with the german army who visit the firing line in the argonne forest late in November by special permission of the german crown prince describe the condition in the trench as follow : here in the now famous argonne forest -- the scene of some of the war 's most desperate fighting -- the german be trench and mine they way forward literally yard by yard this afternoon i reach the foremost trench south of grandpré about 160 foot ahead of I be the french trench picture to yourself a canebrake-like wood of fishpole range in size from half a inch to sapling of two and three inch thick and so dense that you can hardly see forty yard even now when the leaf have fall among these be a scattering of big tree the trunk of which be veritable mine of bullet irregular line of deep yellow clay trench zigzag for mile other trench run back from these to what look like a huge kansa ` prairie-dog town ' -- human burrow where thousand of soldier be literally live underground from the line of trench run parallel to one another come a constant spit sputter pop of rifle make the wood resound like a chinese new year in san francisco or a old-time fourth of July field gun and hand grenade furnish the ` cannon-cracker ' effect through the wood the high-noted ` zing zing ' of bullet sound like a swarm of angry bee while high overhead shrapnel and shell go shriek on they way here and there you may see spade full of earth be throw up as if by invisible hand mark the onward work of the german gopher-like pioneer in they subterranean warfare that be the argonne forest as the trench i be in be still in the hand of the french three day ago and as the crown prince be advance steadily the trench be temporary and contain little in the way of comfort in deep niche cut in the side the soldier rest play card or even sleep on damp ledge between fight the trench also serve as a cemetery when the enemy 's fire be so hot that it be impossible to stick you head out or to take the dead out to bury they the grave be make in a niche or a ledge cut into the side of the trench german advance halt the western operation in December make it clear that the german advance to the channel port of france have be definitely halt in the terrible battle of ypre in flander follow the prolonged engagement along the yser river the ally succeed in repulse the desperate german onslaught and the german offensive be bring to a full stop town and village in flander in artoi and in champagne that have be capture in the early german rush be retake one by one by the belgian french and british slowly but surely until the german be force to act upon the defensive along a line of entrenchment prepare to enable they to keep open they communication through belgium with they great base at aix-la-chapelle a incident of the desperate fighting at ypre in which british and french troops practically annihilate six german regiment include the crack second regiment of prussian guard have be graphically describe by a eye-witness as follow : a long valley stretch out before we and the little rise on which we stand -- about fifty foot above the plain -- command it the british gun be shoot almost horizontally at the german infantry trudge through the mud 2000 yard away i count easily five regiment together but further to the right a sixth one evidently ward off a flank attack on the part of the french colonial troops the lone regiment be the second prussian regiment of the guard the emperor 's own the elite of the kaiser 's army 2500 of the brawniest most disciplined man in the world it be now 1 o'clock in one hour only 300 of these man will leave the field a gust of wind bring to we ear the sound of music the guard ' band be encourage the man at the foot of the small hill on which we stand be twenty line of trench fill with scotch and english infantry the man be silently await the attack not a rifle be be fire the trench be the german ' goal these and the british battery once take the road into ypre be clear in the valley the german halt the range be only 1500 yard now and every british shot be tell the effect be appalling the gray mass move onward once more seem to hesitate but sharp bugle blast launch they forward again and on the run they come for the trench at 1000 yard we battery again stop they whole row be mow down vast space appear between the rank the company intermingle then the regiment themselves seem to amalgamate and melt into one another officer be see gallop along the side evidently try to bring order out of chaos the artilleryman work silently the perspiration streaming down they cheek and continue send on they messenger of death the second regiment of the guard alone off to the right seem untouched and on it come suddenly the sound of a bagpipe be hear the scot be awake from the trench a avalanche rush forward toward the disorder german at the double-quick scot and english a few foot apart yell like demon pounce on the attacker rifle be silent it be cold steel alone we battery captain cry ` stop firing ' there be a risk of shell we own man now we become spectator on the right the guard have suddenly turn toward the hill a bugle blast and the mass of man half turn and seem to be throw on the back of the british outflank the situation be desperate we artillery be useless listen over the valley rise louder and still louder come a song which the german have hear before a crash of brass a hoarse roar fill the air echo across the valley drown the shout and curse of the human wave fight below the ` marseillaise ' -- the english and scot have hear it ` hold tight the french be come ' we scream they can not hear we but we must shout -- the strain be too intense past we battery a company of spahis rush like a cyclone two more follow then the zouave rifle close to they hip bayonet low throw out over the valley its glorious anthem the human flood crash against the guard the line waver in a indescribable jumble of gray yellow blue and red uniform then seem to bounce back from the very force of the shock man appear raise from they foot and raise high in the air catch in a vise between the british and the french the guard alone remain ten time the shattered remnant of the kaiser 's proud regiment charge and ten time be throw back first against the french then against the british cry ` comrade comrade ' hundred begin throw they gun aside at 2 o'clock it be over the ally have lose 1200 man only prisoner remain of the second prussian regiment of the guard progress of the eastern campaign the campaign in the eastern theater of war attract the attention of the whole world in December when the german operation begin in November under field marshal von hindenburg the victor of tannenberg earlier in the war be continue with vary success early in the month the german capture lodz the second city and chief manufacturing center of russian poland with a population of about 500000 after a bombardment of a week 's duration the city be set on fire in many place the russian make a desperate resistance and the fight around lodz constitute the most bitter struggle of the entire war on this front a general russian retirement in the direction of warsaw follow but the german fail in they subsequent effort to envelop the flank of the russian army to the north and south russian reinforcement from warsaw come up promptly the german be in they turn compel to retire two german army corps be then practically cut off by the russian but make a successful retreat fight they way back to safety with the bayonet in one of the most brilliant exploit of the war thus the net result of the german campaign in poland in December leave the general situation there practically unchanged and the russian front unbroken while in east prussium too the russian invasion continue despite german effort to roll it back across the frontier the loss on both side in the eastern campaign in December be appalling the fight being of the fiercest possible nature a typical struggle occur a few mile west of lodz in the little churchyard of beschicus where the russian in one of the final phase of the struggle for the polish city show that in spite of they defeat and discouragement they know how to fight and die this churchyard lie on a small eminence which form a salient into the german line the german be able to make a attack from three side with infantry and artillery all the russian trench be enfilade by shrapnel from one direction or another but the russian cling to they position obstinately when the german finally capture the trench 878 russian corpse be find in a space about eighty yard square it be resistance of this nature which the german have to overcome in order to capture lodz later in December it become clear that russium be get she million into the field and that the strategy of the commander-in-chief the grand duke nichola would soon be aid by the weight of overwhelming number belgium thanks america during November and December madame vandervelde wife of a member of the belgian cabinet tour the united state solicit aid for she suffering fellow-countryman the response everywhere be extremely generous and in appreciation of the aid give the war victim of she country madame vandervelde pen the follow poem entitle belgium thanks america : but still we tell the story which once we love to tell good will good will we read it and peace -- we hear the name and crouch among the ruin and watch the cruel flame and hear the

grave to theirs the land of freedom from ours the land of slave what answer can we send they we can but kneel and pray : god grant -- god grant to they at least a happy christmas day grim reality of the war a vivid picture of the horrible reality of the war as see in a field hospital near the firing line be give in the new republic of November 28 by mr henry w nevinson who describe he experience at dixmude in belgium as follow : when i enter dixmude one night in the middle of October the first bombardment be over but from both side the heavy shell fly across the town from the end of the main street come a incessant noise of rifle and machine gun unaimed bullet wail through the air and patter as they strike the wall flame house shed a light upon the ruin street but only one house look inhabit and all the other which be not burn stand silent and empty expect destruction that one house be use as a outlying hospital or dressing-place nearest the firing line and the wound have to be lead or carry only two or three hundred yard to reach it they sit on the dining-room chair or lay helpless on the floor a few surgeon be at work upon they cut off loose finger and throw they into basin plug black hole that well up instantly through the plug strain bandage which in a minute cease to be white round leg and head the smell of fresh warm blood be thick on the air one man lay deep in he blood you could not have suppose that anyone have so much in he another 's head have lose on one side all human semblance and be a hideous pulp of eye and ear and jaw another with chest tear open lay gasping for the few minute leave of life and as i wait for the ambulance more be bring in and always more in a complacent and comfortable account of hospital work i lately read that ` death from wound be happily rare one surgeon put the number as low as 2 per cent ' happy hospital far away in pari or some isle of the blest the further from the front the fewer the death because so many have die already in the nearest hospital to the front half the wound and on some day more than half die where they be put often they die in the ambulance and one 's care in draw they out be waste for they will never feel again i find one always take the same care though the greenish-yellow of the expose hand or foot show the truth lay on the floor of the main hospital itself some scream or moan some whimper like sick child especially in they sleep some lay quiet with glaze eye out of which sight be pass mere fragment of mankind be there extend limb pound into mash head split open intestine hang out from gash do those bone -- do that exquisite network of live tissue and contrivance for life -- cost no more in the breeding than to be hew and smash and pulp like this shrapnel -- shrapnel

and as a reminder that the german navy be still to be reckon with the warship of the kaiser bring home to the people of the unite kingdom the meaning of the war as no previous incident have do and fear of further attack take possession of they this fear however soon turn to rage and then to a fierce determination to prosecute the war to a bitter end the attack stimulate recruit for lord

result in loss to both side but without materially change the general aspect of the conflict naval battle in the north sea one of the most important naval battle of the war take place on January 24 in the north sea between a british battle cruiser squadron under vice-admiral sir david beatty comprise the battle cruiser tiger lion princess royal new zealand and indomitable assist by a few light

the german battle cruiser have be damage two of vice-admiral beatty 's ship be seriously damaged namely the giant battle cruiser lion which be sir david 's flagship and the torpedo boat destroyer meteor one of the largest and fastest of this class afloat however both of these vessel be safely tow into port the loss in man on the british side be fourteen kill and twenty-nine wound while on the side of the german only 125 of the crew of 850 man on the bluecher be save the other 725 go down with the ship the loss of the bluecher be the hardest blow the german navy have sustain up to this time as she be one of the newest and best vessel of she class she be build at a cost of $ 6750000 she speed be slower than that of the other vessel in the german squadron which doubtless account for she loss the battle begin about 150 mile from heligoland and end within about fifty mile of this german naval base early in the month of February england threaten to put all foodstuff destine for german port on the contraband list in retaliation germany on February 4 through admiral von pohl chief of the admiralty staff issue a proclamation designate the water around great britain and ireland as a war area to become effective February 18 and to be enforce by a formidable fleet of submarine the object be to conduct war operation in this area for the purpose of destroy commercial ship of the enemy just at this time the great passenger steamship lusitanium in she passage from new york to liverpool hoist the american flag while sail through the irish sea and germany charge that the british admiralty have issue confidential order to captain of all british ship to sail under the star and stripe or other neutral flag when necessary to use this means of protection against destruction by the warship of the enemy this situation seriously menace the commerce of the united state as well as that of all other neutral nation and the american government therefore promptly issue a note of warn to both belligerent and demand in strong term the protection of american neutral rights on the high sea germany respond promptly and promise to use every precaution to protect neutral shipping but point out that the use of the american flag by british ship would make it difficult to distinguish neutral vessel from those of the enemy hence neutral shipping be urge to avoid the indicated war area great britain on the other hand claim the right to use neutral flag when necessary to protect human life and ship when endanger by the war vessel of the enemy and under the law of warfare and custom of the nation this contention be correct it can readily be see that this situation place the sea commerce of the united state as well as that of all other neutral country in a most dangerous position up to march 1 1915 about twenty merchant vessel of various nationality be destroy or damage in the war zone establish by germany include dutch norwegian danish american and british ship great german victory

russian invasion but to completely capture the russian tenth army he send one column in from the south to drive back the russian who occupy the mazurian lake gateway to east prussium and another column from the north be swing around in wide circle to the east and south aim to join hand with the southern german column thus cut off the russian retreat this movement would have succeed absolutely except for delay in pass through the swamp cause by mild weather which break up the ice a commander of one of the german corps say : nature have always help russia two day of hard frost and we should have have every man in the south also nature aid the russian there the german host attack the enemy in the face of a drive snowstorm from the north which hinder they operation but do not prevent they from gain a victory which result in free prussian territory from the invader ally force the dardanelle on march 1 a great ally fleet of forty british and french warship have reduce the fort at the entrance to the dardanelle be on its way through the strait and the sea of marmora to constantinople with the object of capture the city panic prevail in the turkish capital at the approach of the fleet while for the first time in history hostile flag fly over the fort at the mouth of the dardanelle the naval operation of the ally in the dardanelle which begin on February 17 proceed without any serious check for a month mine sweeper be in daily use to clear the channel of submerge and float mine and the fort at the narrow several mile inside the entrance of the strait be subject to

hand we have establish ourselves about 1200 yard beyond the enemy 's advanced trench during the 11th the enemy make repeat effort to recover the ground lose all he counter-attack be repulse with heavy loss we continue to make steady progress and hard fighting continue the local initiative display by we troops daily be admirable it say much for the spirit which animate the army the success achieve on the 10th and 11th be a striking example the end of the world a officer who be wound in the fight thus vividly describe the battle of neuve chapelle : modern warfare be such a infernal business that any man who be not kill ought to be cheerful it all seem like a wild dream to I i never hear such a row in all my life and the bullet and the shell -- it be like pass through the most awful hail storm we be in we trench at dawn when suddenly a most infernal din commence you never see such a sight you never hear such a noise i hear one of my man say ` this be the end of the world ' and i do not blame he for think so we could see in the distance great mass of flame earth and brick in great cloud of smoke all ascend together as enormous shell scream over we head and burst among the german entrenchment and the house of the village at the end of a half-hour 's bombardment the fire cease as suddenly as it have begin all this time we be await the order to advance towards auber at length we jump out into the open the air seem alive with bullet and shell there be a buzz noise such as you hear in a tropical forest on a hot summer day on we move until we come to a open stretch which be be sweep by a infernal shell fire we cross this in rush to gain the shelter of a few house lose some 40 or man there we remain for some little time reform the battalion and await further order when these

road to przasnysz with the bank of the river narew as its objective this be the main german attack and inaugurate one of the biggest battle of the war farther south on the pilica a german feint be in progress with the object of weaken the russian defense in the north but while petrograd seem to be resign itself to the idea of a second withdrawal from before przasnysz there be little doubt of the ultimate outcome of this german attempt to gain a firm footing on russian soil the german troops be move forward in close order and only in the daytime and be entirely dependent on what natural cover they could find between the rush as the ground be freeze too hard to permit the use of intrenching tool these tactic naturally involve very heavy loss the german casualty be also understand to have be extremely severe around simno especially on they extreme left where they lose the greater part of they transport it appear certain that the russian have fall back before a onrush of force of overwhelming numerical superiority but it be equally certain that with every yard of the german advance from they railway the shock of they impact weaken while the russian power of resistance be enhance british relieve the pressure just as the french attack the german in the western campaign when field marshal von hindenburg make he rush from east prussium in February so the british army operating in flander undertake the task of relieve the pressure on its russian ally when the russian again be attack in north poland this be part of the general plan of the ally general when one be attack the other attack so as to compel the german and austrian to keep strong force at every point and endeavor to prevent they from send new troops where they could do the most good in march the german be occupy in a attempt to crush the russian for this purpose they have a army estimate at nearly half a million man march along the road toward przasnysz to prevent this army from be further

have last 185 day surpass in duration only by the siege of gibraltar sebastopol vicksburg richmond and port arthur the news of the austrian ' surrender be the most important that have come from the eastern front in week for six month the stronghold have withstand assault remain a constant menace in the rear of the russian advance in galicium from 120000 to 150000 russian have be hold in the neighborhood by the necessity of mask the fortress numerous effort have be make to reach the beleaguered city by relieve army but each in turn prove unavailing though for a time in December it appear likely that a combined german and austrian army would succeed in raise the siege the fall of przemysl be precede by a sortie of the garrison in a last desperate attempt to hack its way through the enemy 's line after a seven hour ' battle they be compel to retreat with a loss of nearly 4000 prisoner only three day ' ration be leave in the surrender of the city the russian announce the taking of

force of russian the garrison of przemysl be force to surrender but fall with honor the gallant character of the defense under general von kusmanek be concede on all side the russian commander who receive the surrender be general seliwanoff in the early day of the siege a bulgarian general radko dimitrieff be in command of the investing force general seliwanoff command the russian force at vladivostok during the russo-japanese war of 1904-05 the duration of the siege compare with the length of time it take the german to capture such stronghold as liège namur and antwerp be due to two cause one be the desire of the russian to keep the loss of life among the besiege army at a minimum the other to the lack of great gun which the german have in belgium the investment be not a close one the garrison have have a radius of about twelve mile in which to move about a aeroplane post be maintain almost up to the last and it be say that even some scanty food supplies be carry in by aeroplane although the victory be a big one it cost the russian dearly it be estimate that 150000 russian be kill and wound during the month that the siege go on not only be many russian kill by the efficient fire of the austrian gunner but the fierce sortie where attacker and defender fight hand-to-hand result in heavy casualty przemysl be the greatest fortress in the austrian empire hill rock marsh and river combine to give it strength and the work of nature have be supplement by the labor of the finest military engineer in central europe the gallant defense which the garrison put up for day be record as austrium 's most noteworthy contribution to the war for a long time the fortress have face famine with the fall of przemysl the only important fortified town in austrian galicium which be not in the hand of the russian be cracow close to the german border a large russian army with artillery be release for action the russian left wing stretch from the province of bukowina on the southeast to tarnow and the vistulum river near cracow on the west on the eastern front on the eastern front of the stupendous battle line in march the most sanguinary fighting of the war occur loss on both side be appalling while the gain in territorial acquisition amount to little or nothing describe the enormous loss on both side in poland a neutral observer mr stanley washburn say in the american review of review : the german program contemplate take both warsaw and ivangorod and the hold for the winter of the line between the two form by the vistulum the russian take the offensive from ivangorod cross the river and after hideous fighting fairly drive austrian and german from position of great strength around the quaint little polish town of kozienice from this town for perhaps ten mile west and i know not how far north and south there be a belt of forest of fir and spruce near kozienice the russian infantry attack in flank and front fairly wrest the enemy 's position and drive he back into this jungle the russian simply send they troops in after they the fight be now over a front of perhaps twenty kilometer there be no strategy it be all very simple in this belt be german and austrian they be to be drive out if it take a month then begin the carnage day after day the russian feed troops in on they side of the wood company battalion regiment and even brigade be absolutely cut off from all communication none know what be go on anywhere but a few foot in front all know that the only thing require of they be to keep advance yard by yard the rank and line of the austrian be drive back but the nearer they retreat bring they to the open country west of the wood the hotter be the contest wage the last two kilometer of the woody belt be something incredible to behold there seem hardly a acre that be not sow like the scene of a paperchase -- only here with bloody bandage and bit of uniform man fight hand to hand with club musket and bayonet contest each tree and ditch the end be of course inevitable the troops of the dual alliance could not fill they loss and the russian could at last come the day when the dirty grimy bloody soldier of the czar push they antagonist out of the far side of the woodland -- and what a scene occur in that open bit of country with the quaint little village of augustowo at the crossroads once out in the open the hungry gun of the russian so long yap ineffectively without know what they shell be do have they chance down every road through the forest come the six-horse team with the gun jump and jingle behind with they accompany caisson heavy with death-charged shrapnel and the moment the enemy be in the clear these battery eight gun to a unit be unlimber on the fringe of the wood and pour out they death and destruction on the wretched enemy now retreat hastily across the open and the place where the russian first turn loose on the retreat be a place to remember dead horse bit of man blue uniform shatter transport overturn gun-carriage bone break skull and grisly bit of humanity strew every acre of the ground enormous loss on both side a russian officer who seem to be in authority on this gruesome spot volunteer the information that already they have bury at kozienice in the wood and on this open spot 16000 dead those that have fall in the open and along the road have be decently inter as the forest of cross for ten mile along that bloody way clearly indicate but back in the wood themselves be hundred and hundred of body that lay as they have fall sixteen thousand dead means at least 70 casualty all tell or 35000 on a side if loss be equally distribute and this figure on the basis of the 16000 dead already bury without allow for the number of the fall that still lie about in the wood and yet here be a battle the name of which be hardly more than know in america yet the loss on both side amount to more than the entire army that general meade command at the battle of gettysburg he who have the heart to walk about in this ghastly place can read the last sad moment of almost every corpse here one see a blue-coated austrian with leg shatter by a jagged bit of a shell the trouser perhaps have be rip open and clumsy attempt be make to dress the wound while a great splotch of red show where the fading strength be exhaust before the flow of life 's stream could be check here again be a body with a ghastly rip in the chest make perhaps by bayonet or shell fragment frantic hand now stiffen in death be see try to hold together great wound from which life must have flow in a few great spurt of blood and here it be no fiction about the ground be soak with gore one can see it -- coagulate like bit of raw liver while great chunk of sand and earth be in lump hold together by this human glue other body lie in absolute peace and serenity strike dead with a rifle ball through the heart or some other instantly vital spot these lie like man asleep and on they face be the peace of absolute rest and relaxation but of these alas there be few compare to the one upon whose pallid blood-stained face one read the last frantic agony of death the soldier themselves go on from battlefield to battlefield from one scene of carnage to another they see they regiment dwindle to nothing they officer decimate three-fourth of they comrade dead or wounded and yet each night they gather about they bivouac apparently undisturbed by it all one see they on the road the day after one of these desperate fight march cheerfully along singing song and laugh and joke with one another this be _ morale _ and it be of the stuff that victory be make and of such be the fiber of the russian soldier scatter over these hundred of mile of front to-day he exist in million and have abide faith in he companion in he officer and in he cause terrific fighting in midwinter writing of the desperate fighting in poland in midwinter when the german make a tremendous effort to pierce the russian line on the bzura and rawka front with warsaw as they objective point a american correspondent mr john f bass say : the fighting be terrific the detonation of the cannon come in such rapid succession that they sound like giant machine gun and the window of the dress station for the wound shake as if from a earthquake it be not possible to distinguish individual gun explosion from the battle of the infantry fire all be mingle in one inarticulate battle shriek at night as in a furious thunderstorm the darkness be pierce with the unintermittent flash of the gun while sickly green rocket shed a ghastly light over the fighting line the wounded bring in fill the hospital to overflow it be estimate by the russian that the german lose 60000 man i be tell by a officer that the body of german soldier be pile up before the russian trench in many of the assault so high that german shell burst among they throw mangled piece of human being into the trench among the russian at night under the glare of search-light the undulating mass of wound make effort to extricate themselves then toward 2 o'clock in the morning they move no more the winter cold have do its deadly work french make gain in march in the champagne country of northern france the month of march be mark by almost continuous fighting of the fiercest character french advice from chalons-sur-marne on march 29 be to the effect that 11000 german dead have be take from the trench win by the french in the previous twenty day and that the total german loss during that time in the champagne district exceed 50000 in kill wound and prisoner stir event of the spring all through the month of April the day be crowd with important occurrence east and west along the battle line the russian movement across the carpathian be press with vigor and some of the fiercest fighting of the war result as the combined german and austrian troops resist the russian advance into hungary early in the spring the british force gain a notable victory at neuve chapelle in the western theater of war then the german force in flander be heavily reinforce until it be estimate that they number not less than half a million man gather for the purpose of smash the line of the ally at the strategic point where the british and the belgian troops be in touch with one another here for three day the german succeed in push forward drive a wedge for several mile into the line of the ally army of england france and belgium and here too the canadian division of the british army cover itself with glory and once more demonstrate the value to the british empire of the lion 's whelp on one notable occasion destine to be record in history as a red-letter day for canadian arm the gallant fellow from the great dominion save the situation to quote from the report of field marshal french by a splendid charge during which they recapture from the german four of they field gun that have be lose the day before how canadian commander die lead ypre charge _ from sir max aitken 's official account of the battle of ypre _ it do not seem that any human being could live in the shower of shot and shell which begin to play on the advance troops they suffer terrible casualty for a short time every other man seem to fall but the attack be press even closer and closer the 4th canadian battalion at one moment come under a particularly withering fire for a moment it waver its most gallant commanding officer lieut-col birchall carry after a old fashion a light cane coolly and cheerfully rally he man and at the very moment when he example have infect they fall dead at the head of he battalion with a cry of anger they spring forward as if to avenge he death the astonishing attack which follow push home in the face of direct frontal fire make in broad daylight by battalion whose name should live forever in the memory of soldier be carry to the first line of german trench after a hand-to-hand struggle the last german who resist be bayonet and the trench be win it be clear that several german division be attempt to crush or drive back the third brigade and to sweep around and overwhelm we left wing the last attempt partially succeed german troops swing past the unsupported left of the brigade and slip in between the wood and st julien add to we torture anxiety by apparently isolate we from the

its original strength into action at the apex of the line which position the brigade hold all that day on Wednesday it be relieve and retire to the rear ` not a canadian gun be lose in the long battle of retreat ' conclude he account sir max write : the empire be engage in a struggle without quarter and without compromise against a enemy still superbly organize still immensely powerful still confident that its strength be the mate of its necessity to arm then and still to arm the graveyard of canada in flander be very large german drive to the coast before the beginning of the spring campaign it be realize by the ally that the german general staff be prepare for a determine drive to the coast through the british and belgian line that protect the approach to calai it be for this reason that the british take the offensive at neuve chapelle and at the important strategic point know as hill 60 the purpose of field marshal french be to strike the first blow and the attack be seemingly successful but later news from the front show that something go wrong at neuve chapelle which in a large measure upset the british plan at hill no 60 though the british capture that important position they be hold back from further advance then come the long-expected german attack in the direction of ypre which be consider as one of the key to the french seaport of calai by this attack the ally be force back from the ypre canal and the position gain by the german bring they within twenty-five mile of the coast at dunkirk the fighting at neuve chapelle hill 60 and ypre be probably the most sanguinary of the entire war up to that time the loss on both side be enormous german british belgian and french be kill literally by the thousand the british loss at neuve chapelle alone be estimate at 20000 while the german casualty in force the passage of the ypre canal a few day later exceed 9000 man praise for the canadian it be in the most furious conflict of the western campaign -- a battle between langemarcke and steenstrate in flander -- that the canadian troops save the british army from what seem almost inevitable defeat the canadian division be in the front line of the british force on April 23 when the german make they sudden assault and break through the line for a distance of five mile only the brilliant counter-charge of the canadian save the situation

the day of the landing of british troops on the grallipoli peninsula up to the end of November the fighting be continuous and bloody the british loss be tremendous while the turkish defender of the supposedly impregnable strait also suffer heavily but with mohammedan stoicism a terrible picture of the slaughter at seddul-bahr where the british troops land from transport under the gun of they fleet in the face of a awful turkish bombardment be paint on he return to england in November by lieutenant-commander josiah wedgwood a liberal member of parliament who have receive special mention for bravery at the front and the coveted stripe of the distinguished service order we school book tell we say commander wedgwood that the bloodiest battle in history be that between the confederate and federal at sharpsburg during the american civil war when one-third of all the man engage be leave on the field but sharpsburg be a joy ride compare with seddul-bahr pay a tribute to the enemy he say : the turk be the finest fighter in the world save only the canadian and australian and they prove to be humane they could easily have kill all those who go to succor the wound but i find they extraordinarily merciful as compare with the enemy in flander commander wedgwood 's first view of fight at the dardanelle be at the so-called v beach where a steamship the river clyde be run aground to furnish cover for the landing of the british troops this modern ` wooden horse of troy ' say commander wedgwood be run ashore on a beautiful Sunday morning 400 yard from the medieval castle of seddul-bahr i be on the vessel but never notice she grounding for the horror ahead of we in the shallow water on the beach five tow of five boat each load with man be go ashore alongside of we one moment it have be early morning in a peaceful country with rustic sight and sound and smell the next moment while the boat be just twenty yard from shore the blue sea around each boat be turn red it be truly horrible of all those brave man two-third die and hardly a dozen reach unwounded the shelter of the five-foot sand dune about 9 o'clock a dash across the row of lighter from the wooden horse be lead by gen napier and he brigade major would they ever get to the end of the lighter and jump into the shelter water no side by side they be see to sit down for one moment one thought they might be take cover then they leg slide out and they roll over it be the munster that charge first with a sprig of shamrock on they cap then the dublin the worcester the hampshire lie on the beach on the rock on the lighter they cry on the mother of god there now be midshipman drury swim to a lighter which have break loose with a line in he mouth and a wound in he head if ever a boy deserve he victorium cross that lad do and there be the captain of the river clyde now no longer a ship to be stick to but a part forever of gallipolus alone with a boat by the spit of rock try to lift in the wound under fire all these thing i see as in a dream column of smoke rise from the castle and town of seddul-bahr as the great shell from the fleet pass over we head and burst and in every lull we hear the wound at 1 o'clock the lancashire be appear over the ridge to the leave from ` lancashire landing ' we see fifteen man in a window in the castle on the right by the water they signal that they be all that remain of the dublin who have land at the camber at seddul-bahr at 3 o'clock we get 150 man alive to shore we watch we man work to the right and up into the castle ruin -- at each corner the officer crouching in front with revolver in rest when night come a house in seddul-bahr be burn brightly and there be a full moon we disembark man at once all around the wound cry for help and shelter against the bullet but there be no room on boat or gang-way for anything but the man to come to shore for two night no one have sleep and then another day dawn we be firmly ashore at lancashire landing and at du toit 's battery to the northeast and the australian be dig in at anzac a end have to be make of v beach the whole fleet collect and all morning blow the ridge and castle and town to piece and all the time that wonderful infantry go forward up the hill and through the ruin town the troops that go in that attack have already lose half they strength the officer that lead up those narrow street be nearly all kill dead beat at 1 o'clock before the final rush they hesitate then we last colonel a staff man col doughty wylie run ashore with a cane run right up the hill run through the last handful of man shelter under the crest take they with a rush into the turkish trench and fall with a bullet through he head but the turk run and the ridge be ours many week of bloody fighting follow and while there be talk early in November of a possible abandonment of the dardanelle campaign the end of the month find the struggle still in progress with no end in sight official figure make public October 15 show that the british casualty at the dardanelle up to October 9 be 96899 of whom 1185 be officer the casualty among the australian troops on the gallipoli peninsula up to the same date amount to 29121 officer and man the attitude of greece on September 23 act upon the advice of premier venizelo king constantine of greece order a general mobilization of the greek army as a measure of elementary prudence in view of the mobilization of bulgarium ten day later premier venizelo resign upon official notice that the king could not support he war policy which be believe to reflect the sentiment of the greek people and to support the ally king constantine then endeavor to form a coalition ministry the great point at issue be whether greece should support or oppose the passage of the ally through greek territory to the aid of serbium british and french troops to the number of 70000 have meanwhile be land at salonikus the great greek seaport and be be hurry to the support of the serbian in they central territory to oppose the incursion of the austro-german and the bulgarian in November king constantine and he military chief be visit by field-marshal earl kitchener the british secretary of war who make such demand upon they in the interest of the ally back by a temporary blockade of the greek coast by the british and french fleet that on November 25 it be announce that cordial relation between greece and the entente power have be establish the greek government give assurance that no attempt would be make to interfere with the ally ' troops should they under any contingency be force to cross the greek frontier but that railway and other facility would be afford they it be understand that the ally also promise greece a monetary indemnity after the war for any damage that might be do through the occupation of greek territory with the question of grecian intervention out of the way the ally then occupy themselves with the attitude of rumanium and the intervention of russium in behalf of serbium in order that the latter country might be save from the fate of belgium it be generally understand that rumanium could not afford to incur the enmity of germany by active interference in behalf of serbium even though the serbian and rumanian be natural ally against bulgarium on November 26 m pachitch the serbian premier receive a personal telegram from the russian emperor in which the latter promise the early appearance in bulgarium of russian troops and the italian government also promise the serbian to send to they aid a expeditionary force of 40000 man it be believe possible that the russian force might seek to advance through rumanium instead of force a landing on the black sea coast of bulgarium -- in which case the cross of rumanian territory by russian troops would bring rumanium into a serious situation both economically and politically and render it difficult if not impossible for she to preserve she neutrality at this time russium have concentrate a great army near the rumanian frontier and it be understand that a large number of heavy gun have arrive at odessa for its use the direction in which this russian army would move depend entirely upon the policy adopt by the rumanian government american loan to the ally on September 28 formal announcement be make in new york of the term of a american loan to great britain and france arrange by a commission of british and french financial authority after conference with american banker a bond issue of $ 500000000 be soon float draw 5 per cent interest and issue to the syndicate at 96 the money to remain in the united state and to be use only in payment for commodity late in November the french people be call upon to subscribe to a loan of victory the response from the people of pari alone in one day amount to $ 5000000000 thus exceed the record of all former popular war loan include british and german issue and typify the patriotic ardor of the french people and they determination to continue the war to a issue successful to ally arm the western campaign after a week 's heavy bombardment of the german line a important offensive movement be undertake on September 25 by the french and british against the german line on the western front the forward movement occur simultaneously in the champagne district between rheim and verdun by the french and in the artoi district between ypre and arras by combined british and french force while the ally do not succeed in gain much ground and both side suffer heavy loss it be claim by the french war office on September 29 that as a result of the four day ' assault of the anglo-french force the german suffer loss amount to the effective strength of 120 man while 23000 man and 120 cannon be capture from the teutonic enemy this constitute the result of what be describe as the great anglo-french drive of the autumn and the situation on the western front then settle down once more into a state of siege the first-line trench of the opposing force along a wide-flung front be within a short distance of each other a new method of warfare have be develop and the world begin to realize that all historic condition of war have be revolutionize by the use of scientific weapon of destruction like the machine gun which mow down man like hay and the high explosive shell that destroy protective work as if they be make of cardboard and fill the trench with dead and die body such be the situation on the western front in the beginning of December no let-up in the determination of either side no advance seemingly possible no attack that be not follow by a counter-attack no gain of any consequence anywhere no possibility seemingly of any decisive battle nothing in sight but a absolute deadlock on the eastern front late in September the german campaign against russium appear to lose most of its force continue attempt be make by field marshal von hindenburg to fight he way to riga but without avail and russian success at various point along the eastern battle front be numerous in October and November the russian declare on November 15 that they deem the city of riga safe and by November 26 it be apparent that the german be engage in a general retirement all along the river dvina the ally then become interested in the kaiser 's probable choice of a line of defense for the winter on the northern section of he russian front the breakdown of the german offensive be attribute by the ally to three thing -- the increase in the russian ammunition supply a german shortage of munitions and the weakening of the german line for the balkan campaign bulgarium enter the war on October 1 1915 it be evident that bulgarian force would shortly be employ on the side of the central power bulgarian troops from sofium be move on to the serbian frontier king ferdinand have order the mobilization of all man under sixty-five year of age and martial law be proclaimed no citizen under forty-five be allow to leave the country on October 4 russium send a ultimatum to bulgarium and the russian minister be order to leave sofia if by 4 pm October 5 bulgarium do not definitely break with germany austrium and turkey all the ally power support russium in this demand bulgarium do not reply within the time specify and the russian minister be report too ill to move from sofium thus indicate that the diplomat of the great contend power be still at work in a effort to secure the important support of bulgarium in the balkan campaign which be imminent on October 6 when bulgarium be say to have send a ultimatum to serbium demand the territory cede after the recent balkan war the envoy of the ally at sofia request they passport and bulgarium become a active participant in the war the bulgarian minister at nish the serbian capital receive he passport on October 8 and on the same day the bulgarian minister at paris be hand he passport on the follow day October 9 belgrade the former serbian capital be occupy by austro-german force and the invasion of serbium by austrium and germany from the north and by bulgarium from the east begin in earnest the serbian capital be remove the same day to ishtib in the south the serbian campaign when the great army of german and austrian enter serbium at belgrade and other point along the danube and begin to drive the serbian force to the south they meet with immediate and continue success bulgarian troops meanwhile press the serbian on the west and by the end of November it seem as if the entire territory of serbium be doom to the fate of belgium but on the south ally troops include a great body of french who have be land at salonikus in greece and make they way northward dispute the advance of the invader and at several point drive back the bulgarian thus hold the southern territory of serbium for they ally in the same manner that flander be be hold by the ally for belgium chapter xxv second winter of war in all the arena of the great struggle the winter campaign of 1915-16 the second winter of the war be accompany by unparalleled hardship and suffering it be in fact describe by major moraht military expert of the berliner tageblatt and the best know german military critic as the most terrific campaign in the world 's history hundred of thousand of man of all class in all the

belgium a year before be as nothing compare with the misery of poland amid the rigor of winter and the unhappy country clamor for the help of happier people it have become a land of grave and trench of ruin and destruction on a scale that have be work nowhere else by the war many of the abandon trench be the temporary home of countless refugee mostly woman and child who have be drive from they home in the burn and ruin village that dot the land and there be little or no relief in sight for the stricken pole innocent victim of a ruthless war and pitiful plaything of fate on the western front artillery fight with mortar and long-range cannon be a continuous performance during December and January in nearly every section of the western battle line every day ten of thousand of shell both high explosive and shrapnel be hurl at the trench and man be kill or wound by the score at a time to the war-hardened man behind the gun on both side this business of slaying and run the risk of be slay or cripple become so prolonged and monotonous that they think no more of it than of cut down a forest or build a pontoon bridge early in January the city of nancy just behind the french line be bombard for three day by german 15-inch gun much damage be do and a number of the inhabitant be kill and wound as a consequence there be a exodus from the city safe conduct be issue to more than 30000

compass they end arson to they be a commonplace and murder a incident in the day 's work the destruction of the parliament building may have be the result of a accident but the general belief at

early in September 1914 the force of the crown prince have be strive unsuccessfully to break through the french line north and east of verdun but the fortress have well maintain its reputation for impregnability and continue to bar the high road to pari for ten day the battle rage on the plain in the forest and on the hill before verdun and the loss of life be appalling on both side by February 26 after six day of continuous fight the german have penetrate the french line along several mile of front have occupy several village a few mile north of verdun drive the french from the peninsula of the meuse form by a bend of the river about six mile from the city and carry by storm the outlying fort of douaumont at the northeast corner of the verdun fortification but they advance be then halt by the french in a series of the most brilliant counter-attack and the german offensive appear to die down by march 1 when they loss in the ten day ' battle be estimate at 175000 include between 40000 and 50000 kill the french loss be heavy but the nature of the german attack in which huge mass of man be hurl against the french entrenchment expose the teuton force to the most withering and destructive fire from the french 75-centimeter and machine gun the battle exceed in violence and loss even the great battle of the yser earlier in the war heavy reinforcement have be bring to the verdun front by the german and it be estimate that they force engage in the attack number at least 500000 man support by numerous 15-inch and 17-inch austrian mortar with all the heavy german artillery use in the serbian campaign and part of that formerly employ on the russian front while the battle of verdun be in progress the german also make determine attack in the champagne region grain some ground but on march 1 the ally line be hold fast all along the western front wound soldier return from the front during the bloody struggle before verdun tell tragic tale of the fighting i watch the assault of the german upon the village of milancourt near the meuse say a wounded frenchman they come in solid rank without a word loading and reload they rifle without cessation we seventy-fives fall among they and then the mitrailleus enter into action it be no longer a battalion it be a few scattered group of man that one saw tear by a rain of shell and bullet squeeze close against each other as though for mutual protection on the border of montfaucon i see one of these group disappear at one blow as if they have be swallow into a marsh we shell what frightful work they do never will i forget those fragment of human being that fall just at my foot never can i forget that terrible picture i follow the attack on haumont and samogneux the field of battle be light as if in full day by star shell black mass of german advance protect by they artillery while ours remain silent finally we artillery begin and then the enemy rank waver halted and disappear we gun have wait until the german be in a little hollow all arrange for the massacre in a little while there lay the body of some 2000 or 3000 german they occupy some village but they attack on verdun have fail after terrible loss german submarine activity the sinking of british and french ship and sometimes neutral vessel by german and austrian submarine continue during the month of February on February 27 the

on march 1 the policy of sink without warn all ally merchant vessel believe to carry any armament for defensive purpose and the world wait with bated breath for fresh development of the teutonic campaign of frightfulness chapter xxvi climax of the war _ prolonged battle of verdun the most terrible in history -- enormous loss on both side -- _ submarine activity imperil relation of america and germany _ begin with the first infantry attack by the german on Monday February 21 after twenty-four hour of continuous bombardment the battle incident to the siege of verdun be fight at brief interval during the next two month down to the middle of April and mark the climax of the war the loss on both side be enormous and extraordinary and take as a whole the struggle on the semicircular front north and east of the great french stronghold fully justify its description as the most terrible battle in the world 's history when spring of 1916 arrive the struggle seem to be a pretty even draw but the end be not in sight both side show the greatest confidence in the outcome in france the confidence of the nation find expression in the voice of m alexandre ribot the veteran minister of finance who have verdun before he eye tell the chamber of deputy : we have reach the decisive hour we can say without exaggeration without illusion and without vain optimism that we now see the end of this horrible war but while the french be certain that victory would ultimately be theirs the german papers and people be just as fully persuade that this finest of the fortress of france would finally fall before the determine assault of the kaiser 's army which no fort have as yet stop both side recognize that this be the supreme moment of the war the german have gain by April 15 from three to five mile along a front of about 15 mile but have take only two of the ring of minor fort around verdun the french claim that the configuration of the ground occupy by the contend force at that time make they line impregnable although verdun be say by the german military expert to be only a incident in the german offensive which be plan to secure the final decision they realize the importance of verdun to they whole line on the western front and know its value too well not to make the most desperate and exhaustive effort for its conquest a terrific artillery duel for many week the battle for verdun be signalize by the most terrific artillery fire in history no word can tell of the ear-stunning roar of the gun or depict the horror of the ton of steel daily crash and splinter amid mass body of man while the softly-falling snow of late winter cover but could not conceal the ensanguined landscape modern warfare be see at verdun in all its panoply of terror amid fire and fury the rich and fertile countryside be transform into a vast scene of ruin and desolation while heroism and self-sacrifice abound on both side man be madden by the frenzy of the fight and the ghastly horror of night and day and death stalk gloatingly and glut but never surfeit over the bloody field the german attack follow one another so fast and so furiously that the week of fight become one prolonged battle and a description of one attack will almost serve for all thus a wounded french officer say of the seven day of continuous fighting which open the german offensive against verdun : the first symptom of the battle favorable to the french be the inability of the german to silence the french artillery the attack open with strong reconnoitering party advance wherein be note a unusually large proportion of officer for the first time the german officer be see to be lead they man into battle instead of drive they as have be the rule -- and this be say to be at the behest of the watch kaiser then come the infantry in great number during the next two day the fighting wax fiercer and fiercer at first fourteen german division be engage then sixteen and finally seventeen division -lrb- 340000 man -rrb- the french command at this point carry out a maneuver which will be record as a masterpiece in military history if the german have be only fifteen yard away the french could have be submerge by the attack provide the attack force be prepare to make any sacrifice but the distance be 1500 yard there be little chance for the german against the oppose artillery the french troops be accordingly swing back to position from which they could see the german approach over expose ground the effect be that the immediate front of the attack which be originally twenty-five mile in extent be reduce to nine mile but even this soon prove too wide the german loss be so great that the attack could not be keep up at all point and at the end of the seventh day the offensive dwindle to fragmentary attack -- but only to be renew with add vigor after a brief period of rest for the infantry on both side while the artillery keep up its daily and nightly duel without cease until the entire terrain become a earthly inferno thickly scatter over with the dead and the die the deadly mine in caure wood frightful in result too be the tragic stratagem play on the german in caure wood near the village of beaumont the whole wood have be mine by the french and be connect electrically with a station in the village when the german have advance fully a division strong to attack the wood the french regiment hold it run as if seize with panic back toward the village the german pursue they with shout of victory soon the last frenchman have emerge from the tree but the french commander wait until the german be all in the mine area they be just begin to debouch on the other side when he press the button there be a tremendous roar drown for a moment even the boom of the cannon the wood be cover with a cloud of smoke and even on the french trench in beaumont there rain a ghastly dew when the french re-enter the wood unopposed they find not a single german unwounded and hardly a score alive german loss at verdun the german success during the week of fight in the vicinity of verdun consist of a series of advance along the front without any decisive result so far as the strength of the defense of the main fortress be concern be gain at the cost of enormous loss in kill and wound these loss be estimate on April 7 to have reach the huge total of 200000 -- one of the greatest battle loss in the whole range of warfare during the period from February 21 when the battle of verdun begin to April 1 it be say that two german army corps have be withdraw from the front have lose in the first attack at least one-third of they force they subsequently reappear and again suffer like loss the german reinforcement be practically use up as fast as they be put in line declaration gather from prisoner and the observation of the french staff lead the latter to estimate that at least one-third of the total number of man engage be the minimum loss of the german infantry during the first forty day of the battle or 150000 man of the first fighting line alone concern the german loss before verdun col feyler a swiss military expert write on April 10 as follow : it be certain that the first great attack in February and march cause the german assailant very exceptional loss the 18th army corps lose 17000 man and the 3d corps lose 22000 these be figure which in the history of war will form a magnificent eulogy on the heroism of these troops it will become a classic example like that of the prussian guard at st privat france August 18 1870 it be probable that before verdun as at st privat the leader underestimate the defender ' strength especially in cannon and machine gun there be other example in the unfruitful attack on fort vaux the 7th reserve regiment be literally mow down by machine gun while the 60th regiment lose 60 per cent of its effective in the attack on the malancourt and avocourt wood march 20 three regiment of the 11th bavarian division whose record in this war seem to have be particularly praiseworthy lose about 50 per cent of they man loss of the french while the greater bulk of the total loss in kill and wound before verdun be sustain by the german however it must not be imagine for a instant that the french defender of the fortress escape lightly on the contrary they loss be likewise enormous be estimate by the german general staff at a total of not less than 110000 from February 20 to April 1 a considerable number of french troops officer and man be also capture by the german during the numerous attack in February march and April upon the french trench and other position before verdun a million man engage some idea of the tremendous force engage on both side in what will probably be call in history the siege of verdun may be gain from the brief summary make on April 1 by a observer present with the army of the crown prince of germany on the north front of the verdun battlefield from which point of vantage he telegraph as follow : probably not far from a million man be battle on both side around verdun never in the history of the world have such enormous mass of military be engage in battle at one point on the forty-mile semicircular firing-line around the french fortress from the river meuse above st mihiel to avocourt the german probably have several thousand gun at least 2500 in action or reserve be each gun fire only once a hour there would be a shot every second as probably half the gun be of middle and heavy caliber the average weight per shell be certain to be more than twenty-five pound it follow that even in desultory firing about 160000 pound of iron or from four to five carload be rain on the french position every hour and this be magnify many time when the fire be increase to the intensity which the artilleryman call ` drum ' the position of the enemy to the german gun must be add the tremendous amount of artillery use by the french in they defense estimate to be almost as large now as that of the german the conclusion be that more than 6000 cannon vary from 3-inch field gun to 42-centimeter -lrb- 16-inch -rrb- siege mortar be engage in hurl thousand of high explosive shell hourly in the never-ceasing thunderous artillery duel of the mighty battle of verdun from a german officer 's viewpoint the story tell by those who on the german side lay in trench under shell-fire before verdun for day at a time and week after week freezing thirst in mud and water between the dead and the die thrill the hearer with they pathos and devotion these be the man who like the wave of the sea beat almost incessantly against the obstinate fortification of verdun and there learn a new respect for the french enemy such a story be write from the front in April by a german officer name ross -- a man of scottish descent -- who before the war be editor of a newspaper in munich in the berlin vossische zeitung he say : it be a worthy embittered foe against whom this last decisive struggle be aim france be fight for she existence she be no weaker than we be in man gun or munitions only one thing decide between we -- will and nerve every doubt belittle word be a creep poison which kill joyful strong hope and do more damage than a thousand foe only if we be convince to we marrow that we shall win shall we conquer in this colossal combat where number and mechanical weapon be so utterly alike moral superiority be everything we have more than once have the experience that the effective result of a battle have depend upon who consider himself the victor and act accordingly often the merest remnant of will and nerve be the factor that influence the decision war which only smolder here and there during the endless trench fight like damp wood burn here with such all-consuming fire that division have to be call up after day and hour in the trench and be ground to piece and burn up into so many cinder and ash such intensity of battle as be here before verdun be unheard of no picture no comparison can give the remotest conception of the concentration of gun and shell with which the two antagonist be rage against each other i have see troops who have hold out in the fire for day and week to whom in expose position food could hardly be bring on whose body the clothes be not dry who yet reek with dirt and dampness have the nerve for new storm operation battle of caillette wood among the fiercer struggle before verdun the battle of caillette wood east of the fortress city will have a place in history as one of the most bloody and thrill the position of the wood to the right of douaumont be important as part of the french line it be carry by the german on Sunday morning April 2 after a bombardment of twelve hour which seem to break even the record of verdun for intensity the french curtain of fire have check they further advance accord to a special correspondent of the chicago herald and a savage countercharge in the afternoon have gain for the defender a corpse-strewn welter of splintered tree and shell-shattered ground that have be the southern corner of the wood further charge have break against a massive barricade the value of which as a defense pay good interest on the expenditure of german life which its construction demand a wonderful work have be accomplish that Sunday morning in the livid london-like fog and twilight produce by the lower cloud and battle smoke form a human chain under fire while the german assault column in the van fight the french hand to hand pick corps of worker behind they form a amazing human chain from the wood to the east over the shoulder of the center of the douaumont slope to the crossroads of a network of communicate trench 600 yard in the rear four deep be this human chain and along its line nearly 3000 man pass a unending stream of wooden billet sandbag chevaux-de-frise steel shelter and light mitrailleus -- in a word all the material for defensive fortification pass from hand to hand like bucket at a country fire despite the hurricane of french artillery fire the german commander have adopt the only possible means of rapid transport over the shell-torn ground cover with debris over which neither horse nor cart could go every moment count unless barrier rise swiftly the french counter-attack already mass would sweep the assailant back into the wood cover be disdain the worker stand at full height and the chain stretch openly across the hillock a fair target for the french gunner the latter miss no chance again and again great hole be tear in the line by the burst melinite but as coolly as at maneuver the iron-disciplined soldier of germany spring forward from shelter to take the place of the fall and the work go on apace use the dead as a shelter gradually another line double the chain of the worker as the upheaved corpse form a continuous embankment each additional dead man give greater protection to he comrade until the barrier begin to form shape along the diameter of the wood there other be digging and bury log deep in the earth install shelter and mitrailleus or feverishly build fortification at last the work be end at fearful cost but as the vanguard sullenly withdraw behind it from the whole length burst a havoc of flame upon the advance frenchman vainly the latter dash forward they could not pass and as the evening fall the barrier still hold cover the german work party burrow like mole in the mass of trench and boyeaux french plan to blast barricade -lrb- illustration : verdun -- the world 's

result so sound be the barricade pad with sandbag and earth-works that the artillery fire fall practically unavailing and the french general realize that the barrier must be breach by explosive as in napoleon 's battle it be 8 o'clock and already pitch dark in that blighted atmosphere when a special blast corps as devote as the german chain worker creep forward toward the german position the rest of the french wait sheltered in the ravine east of douaumont until a explosion should signal the assault in indian file to give the least possible sign of they presence to the hostile sentinel the french blaster advance in a long line at first with comparative rapidity only stiffen into the grotesque rigidity of simulated death when the searchlight play upon they and resume progress when the beam shift then as they approach the barrier they move slowly and more slowly when they arrive within forty yard the movement of the crawl man become imperceptible the blast corps lay at full length like hundred of other motionless form about they but all be work busily with a short trowel the file leader scuffle the earth from under he body take care not to raise he arm and gradually make a shallow trench deep enough to hide he the other follow he example until the whole line have sink beneath the surface then the leader begin scoop he way forward while he follower deepen the furrow already make thus literally inch by inch the file steal forward sheltered in a narrow ditch from the gust of german machine-gun fire that constantly sweep the terrain here and there the sentinel ' eye catch a suspicious movement or a incautiously raise head sink down pierce by a bullet but the stealthy molelike advance continue hour pass it be nearly dawn when the remnant of the blast corps reach the barricade at last and hurriedly put they explosive in position back they wriggle breathlessly a over-hasty movement mean death yet they must hurry lest the imminent explosion overwhelm they suddenly there be a roar that dwarf the cannonade and all along the barrier fountain of fire rise skyward hurl a rain of fragment upon what be leave of the blast party three out of four die the barricade be breach but 75 per cent of the devoted corps have give they life to do it as the survivor lay exhaust the attacker charge over they cheer in the melee that follow there be no room to shoot or wield the rifle some of the french fight with unfixed bayonet like the stab sword of the roman legion other have knife or club all be battle-frenzied as only frenchman can be the german break and as the first ray of dawn streak the sky only a small section of the wood be still in they hand there a similar barrier stop progress and it be evident that the night 's work must be repeat but the heart of the french soldier be leap with victory as they dig furiously to consolidate the ground they have gain strew with german body thick as leaf over 6000 german be count in a section a quarter of a mile square and the conqueror see why they cannonade have be so ineffective the german have pile a second barrier of corpse close behind the first so that the soft human flesh would act as a buffer to neutralize the force of the shell french defense truly heroic while all the german attack upon the french line in front of verdun be mark with the utmost valor and intensity of devotion the continuous defense make by the french under general petain be equally vigorous and often truly heroic volunteer frequently remain in the french trench from which the rest of the french defender have be compel to retire to telephone information about the advance enemy to the french battery and some of the heaviest loss of the german occur when they believe themselves successful in a attack the consequence of such devotion on the part of french volunteer be exemplify early in the morning of April 12 at a point call caurette wood along the northeastern slope of the hill know as le mort homme -lrb- dead man 's hill -rrb- where a french withdrawal have be carry out volunteer remain behind to signal information to the french battery and a eyewitness of the attack describe what follow thus : the french seventy-fives immediately concentrate on the hostile trench line the german suffer heavily but persevere and soon dense column appear amid the shell-torn brushwood on the southern fringe of the corbeaux wood pour down into the valley separate they from the former french position on the hillside think the french still hold the latter the german deploy with they latest trench-storming device in the form of liquid fire container with special group of four install two man work the pump and two direct the fire jet the grayness of the dawn be illuminate by sheet of green and red flame and black oily cloud roll along the valley toward the river like smoke from a burning ` gusher ' suddenly the air be fill with shrill whistle as shell of the seventy-fives be hurl against the attacker thanks to the devoted sentinel die at they post in the sea of fire the range be exact and the explode melinite shatter the charge column a appalling scene follow the shell have burst or overthrow the fire container and the german be see run wildly amid the flame which overwhelm hundred of wound and disabled french troops charge in this scene of confusion the french charge with bayonet despite the furnace heat and fume produce by the red-hot container fly in all direction the enemy offer little resistance it be like a slaughter of frenzied animal the french mitrailleuse corps press close on they comrade ' heel place weapon at vantage point that have escape the fire and shower a leaden hail upon the main body of german retreat up corbeaux hill hundred fight in a terror-stricken mob to hide in a hole that might have sheltered a score those beneath be stifle those above throw themselves scream into the air as the bullet pierce they or fall dead in a wild dash toward a safer refuge flush with success the french charge again right to the entrance of the wood and the slaughter recommence five of the heroic sentinel wonderful to say return with the french wave that ebb when victory be win for that day condition at verdun on April 20 several determine attack be deliver by the german on the french line at verdun between April 15 and 20 enormous mass of man sometimes as many as 100000 be hurl against point in the northeast sector of the battle front but the french defense hold firm although some trench be lose and a considerable number of french prisoner be take up to this time the total number of prisoner take by the german at verdun from the beginning of the offensive February 21 be claim to be 711 officer and 38155 man such be the condition before verdun on April 20 when with spring well under way on the western battle front there be daily expectation of a vigorous drive by the ally against the german line between verdun and the sea while both side express confidence in the outcome of the war no man could foretell with any degree of certainty what the final result of the great struggle would be zeppelin raid on england during the month of march and early in April a number of zeppelin raid upon various part of england do more or less damage though none of a important military character the east coast of scotland also suffer from a zeppelin visit in April report and figure issue by the british war office show that during the fifteen month from christmas 1914 to April 1 1916 no fewer than thirty-four separate aerial raid occur in great britain include those of aeroplane and zeppelin the total casualty suffer mainly by civilian man woman and child be 303 kill and 713 injure this record of result be interesting when it be remembered what they must have cost the german in money and man in view of the comparatively small amount of damage that seem to have be do germany however insist that she air raid have do more substantial harm to england than the war office would admit russian activity in the east with the approach of spring in 1916 new activity begin on the eastern front and the russian threaten a vigorous attack on the german line in the north after the thaw by the middle of the summer the russian expect accord to semi-official report to have twelve million man arm drill and equip for battle on April 1 the berlin government declare that in the russian offensive on the eastern front against field marshal von hindenburg which last from march 18 to march 30 the loss to the russian be 140000 out of the 500000 man engage this campaign be carry on mostly in the frozen terrain of the dvinsk marsh and along the dvina river and the german loss be also heavy although the russian attack be as a rule repulse fall of trebizond in asia minor however russian success of the winter be crown in the early spring by the fall of the baltic seaport of trebizond which be occupy on April 18 this city the most important turkish port on the black sea be capture by the russian army advance from erzerum aid by the russian black sea fleet the invader push past the last series of natural obstacle along the anatolian coast when on Sunday

loss be heavy the german battle fleet aid by low visibility avoid a prolonged action with we main force as soon as they appear on the scene the enemy return to port though not before receive severe damage from we battleship the battle be one in which no quarter be ask or even possible there be no surrender and the ship lose go down and carry with they virtually the whole crew only the warrior which be tow part way from the scene of battle to a british port be a exception of the thousand man on the queen mary only a corporal 's guard be account for the same be true of the invincible while there be no survivor report from the indefatigable the defense or the black prince tell of battle horror after the battle there be many story of ship sink with a great explosion : of crew go down sing the national anthem of merchant ship pass through a sea thick with float body from survivor come thrilling story of the horror and humanities of the battle the british destroyer shark act as a decoy to bring the german ship into the engagement it be batter to piece by gunfire and a half dozen sailor pick up cling to a buoy by a danish ship tell of its commander and two seaman serve its only remain gun until the last minute when the commander 's leg be blow off a lifeboat with german survivor from the german cruiser elbing rescue surgeon burton of the british destroyer tipperary he have sustain four wound the first official story the first account in detail of the battle be give by a high official of the british admiralty who say on June 4 : we be look for a fight when we fleet go out story that the fleet be decoy by the german be sheerest nonsense in a word with a inferior fleet we engage the entire german high sea fleet interrupt they plan and drive they back into they harbor in carry out the plan decide upon we sustain heavy loss which we expect but we also attain the expect result of force the enemy to abandon he plan and seek refuge after we have give battle in he own water near he coast with the exception of two division part of which be only partly engage the brunt of battle be bear by the battle-cruiser fleet and with one exception we battle fleet be ready for sea service i must admit that we have exceptionally hard luck with we battle-cruiser but the loss of three great ship do not in any measure cripple we control of the sea the great battle have four phase the first open at 3:15 p m when we battle-cruiser at a range of six mile join action with german battle-cruiser shortly afterward the second phase begin with the arrival on both side of battleship the german arrive first but before they arrival we three battle-cruiser have be blow up supposedly the result of gunfire although possibly they be victim of torpedo such close range fight with battle-cruiser might be criticize as bad tactic but we fleet follow the tradition of the navy go out to engage the enemy and on account of weather condition could do so only at short range the third phase be the engagement of battleship which never be more than partial this phase include a run fight as the german dreadnaught flee toward they basis all the big ship fighting be over by 9:15 p m enemy go by dawn then come one of the most weird feature of the battle as german destroyer make attack after attack like infantry follow artillery preparation on we big ship but these onslaught be futile not a single torpedo launch by they get home with the morning these attack end and the scene of battle be sweep by jellicoe 's fleet not a single enemy vessel remain in sight a incident of the great battle be the torpedoing of the super-dreadnaught marlborough which be now safely a harbor it must have strike a veritable hornet ' nest of submarine as by skillful maneuver it avoid three of these before it be finally hit early in the engagement accord to admiral beatty 's report a german battle-cruiser after be hotly engage blow up and break in two officer of the fleet also report pass a closely engage german battle-cruiser which be leave behind while the british pursue the german on they return this vessel be miss judge from its previous plight it must now be at the bottom of the sea this account for two of the enemy 's battle-cruiser and we have they admission that they have lose two battleship zeppelin do not play the important part attribute to they only one appear it remain in action a brief time retire under heavy fire evidently badly damage weather condition be such that it be doubtful whether any aircraft would have be of much service the enemy spring no surprise we see nothing of any 17-inch gun no trick be use which be not already know in naval warfare from the standpoint of actual strength the navy 's loss in personnel while great be not serious as we have plenty of man to replace they but the death of so many gallant officer and man have cause profound grief admiral hood go down with he flagship invincible in the word of admiral beaty 's report ` lead he division into action with the most inspiring courage ' he flag captain cay go down with he capt sowerby former british naval attaché at washington perish with he ship the indefatigable while capt prowse die on the queen mary body float in the sea from copenhagen it be report on June 3 that hundred of body many of they horribly mutilate by explosion and great quantity of debris be drift about in the north sea near the scene of the battle all steamer arrive at danish port report sighting float body and bit of wreckage the steamer para pick up a raft aboard which be three german survivor from the torpedo boat v-48 they have cling to the raft for forty-eight hour and be semi-conscious when rescue they report that ninety-nine of the v-48 crew perish and that in all about twenty german torpedo boat be destroy other german sailor rescue by scandinavian steamer describe the teutonic loss in the jutland battle as colossal a number of the crew of the cruiser wiesbaden and man from

jump into the ocean the german survivor say that several of they torpedo boat and submarine be capsize by the british shell and sink instantly body of both british and german sailor be wash ashore on the coast of jutland officer 's story of the fight survivor who arrive at edinburgh on June 5 from british destroyer which make a mass attack on a german battleship in the battle off jutland be convince that they send to the bottom the dreadnaught hindenburg the pride of the german navy these sailor say that the hindenburg be strike successively by four torpedo while the destroyer dash in alongside of its hull tear it to piece until the mighty ship reel and sink a officer from one of the british destroyer give the follow graphic account of the battle : the ship of the grand fleet go into action as if they be go into maneuver from every yardarm the white ensign fly the flag which be to the sailor as the tattered color be in day of old to a hard-pressed regiment that it go hard with the battle-cruiser be apparent but one ship can not fight a dozen they have fight a great fight a fight to be proud of a fight which will live longer than many a victory we fight close into the foe and if anything be certain in the uncertainty of naval battle it be that we give at least as good as we get we pass along the line of german ship some mile away and let off broadside after broadside the air be heavy with mass of smoke black yellow green and every other color which drift slowly between the opposing line hide sometimes friend and sometimes foe the enemy ship be firing very fast but watch the ship in front one come to the conclusion that the shooting be decidedly erratic again and again salvo of shell fall far short of the mark to be follow immediately by other which scream past high in the air roar op the gun terrific i watch the iron duke swing through the sea let off broadside after broadside wicked tongue of flame leap through cloud of smoke the din of battle be stunning stupendous deafening as hundred of the heaviest gun in the world roar out at once great mass of water rise in the air like waterspout reach as high as the mast as the salvo of german shell fall short or go over they target now and then a shell find its mark but it leave we absolutely cold as to its effect on each man at a time like this a dozen man may be knock out at one 's side it make no difference it be impossible to see what be happen among the ship of the foe the smoke obscure everything so effectually that one could only get a glimpse at interval when a kindly wind blow a lane through the pall it be apparent that the best ship of the enemy be engage but how many neither eye nor glass could make out the number be certainly large it be equally impossible to see what damage we be cause only the high command know fine progress of the battle that the damage inflict on the german ship be great do not admit of any doubt at one time two vessel red with fire gleam through the smoke flagship lose its wireless it be a curious feeling to be in the midst of a battle and not to know to which side fortune lean where only a few ship be engage it be different we own loss be know with some degree of exactness but even that be uncertain thus at one time it be think that the lion have be lose as it do not answer any call it transpire that its wireless have be destroy with the dusk come the great opportunity of the mosquito craft and both side make use of it to the full it be in this way that one of the saddest of many sad incident occur a destroyer true to its name dash for the big enemy ship it soon get into effective range and loose its torpedo and with deadly effect on a german battleship the ship go down and the destroyer race for safety the commander and officer standing on the bridge indulge in mutual congratulation at they success at that moment a shell hit the bridge and wipe out the entire group we fight what be in its way a great fight although it be not a sailor 's battle both the grand and the terrible be present to a almost overpowering degree as a spectacle it be magnificent awful how awful it be impossible to realize until the fever of action have subside until the gun be silent and the great ship some battered other absolutely untouched be plow home on the placid sea man thrill by battle fever after describe the battle itself the officer revert to incident precede it say : i shall never forget the thrill which pass through the man on the ship of the grand fleet when that inspiring message be receive from the battle-cruiser squadron many league away : ' i be engage with heavy force of the enemy ' one look on the face of he fellow and see that the effect be electrical the great ship swing around into battle order and the responsive sea rock and churn as the massive vessel race for what be virtually enemy water as the grand fleet draw near the scene of action the smoke of battle and mutter of gun come down on the wind the eagerness of the man become almost unbearably intense and it be a bless relief when we own gun give tongue russian troops land in france between April 20 and June 1 a large flotilla of transport arrive at marseille france bring russian soldier in large number to the support of the french line the transport be understand to have make the voyage of 10250 mile from vladivostok under convoy by the british navy earl kitchener kill at sea the british armored cruiser hampshire 10850 ton with earl kitchener the british secretary of state for war and he staff on board be sink shortly after nightfall on June 5 to the west of the orkney island either by a mine or a torpedo heavy sea be run and admiral jellicoe report that there be no survivor the crew number officer and man earl kitchener be on he way to russia for a secret conference with the military authority when the disaster occur he latest achievement be the creation from england 's untrained manhood of a army approximate 5000000 man of whom he be the military idol chapter xxviii battle east and west after gallantly hold they own for many month against repeat german attack the canadian troops hold that

canadian troops which in this action have its first real test in hand-to-hand fighting and come out of the trial like veteran with glory undimm the two-day ' fighting occur around the famous hill no 60 and sanctuary wood name destine to live in canadian history it be entirely a canadian battle and while the loss of the devoted troops from the dominion probably reach the regrettable total of over 6000 include a number of man capture by the german during the first day 's attack when they overrun the front trench they doggedly bomb and bayonet they way back to the wreck trench next day and regain nearly all they front the commanding officer be especially pleased that the newer canadian battalion have keep up the tradition of the first contingent establish in 1915 at st julien and elsewhere in france and flander by immediately turn upon the german with a counter-attack which be carry out both coolly and skilfully the ypre salient thus successfully defend by the canadian in one

of a most efficient artillery preparation which blow the austrian entanglement trench and earthwork into such a chaos that the bewildered occupant surrender in thousand when the russian infantry charge german reinforcement from the trench north of the pripet river try to stay the russian rush but in vain and many german be among the prisoner take at several point the russian cavalry lead the attack after the artillery have do its work a division of young russian by a impetuous attack capture a bridge-head on the styr and take 2 german and austrian troops and much rich booty in galicium the russian army cross the stripa and by June 10 be once more too near lemberg for the comfort of the austrian garrison at that time the total number of prisoner take in this drive be considerably over 100000 while the booty in gun rifle ammunition and supplies of all conceivable kind be enormous the ally be greatly hearten by these russian success on the eastern front and on June 15 germany be prepare to meet they by troop movement from the north where field marshal von hindenburgh be in command on russian territory the extent and rapidity of the russian success up to that time be without parallel in military history russium compel austrian retreat during the follow month the russian advance toward the carpathian for the second time in the war continue steadily it be apparent that general brusiloff unlike he predecessor in command be well supply with effective artillery and ammunition in plenty and that the vast resource of the russian empire have be at last successfully mobilize for attack gun and ammunition in immense quantity have be secure from japan among other source and this former enemy of russium now she strong and capable ally aid materially in change the

french simultaneously after a seven-day bombardment of the german trench in this preliminary bombardment more than one million shell be fire daily and the prolonged battle which ensue be the greatest of all time this offensive prove that the ally have not be shake from they determination to bide they time until they be thoroughly prepared and ready for the attack and be able to co-ordinate they effort in genuine teamwork against the powerful and strongly-entrenched enemy in the west while the russian offensive on the eastern front be also in progress this long-awaited movement be no isolate attack costly but ineffectual like those of the english at neuve chapelle and loo but a carefully study and deliberately prepared campaign of severe pressure upon germany at each of she battle front it prove that the war-council of the ally hold in pari and london in petrograd and rome be no mere conventional affair but be at last to bear fruit in concerted action that might decide the issue of the war the big push as it be popularly call in england be start by the british and french on both side of the river somme sixty mile north of pari at 7:30 o ` clock on the morning of July 1 and result on the same day in a great wedge be drive into the german line along a front of twenty-five mile with its sharp point penetrate nearly five mile the french advance be make in the direction of peronne a important center of transportation and distribution long hold by the german a eyewitness who watch the beginning of the battle from a hill say that overwhelming as be the power of the gun yet as the gathering of human and mechanical material proceed the grim and significant spectacle be the sight of detachment of infantry move forward in field-fighting equipment until finally the dugout be hive of khaki ready to swarm out for battle as the day of the bombardment pass the air of expectancy be noticeable everywhere through the british army command by sir dougla haig finally the word be pass that the infantry be to make the assault early the next morning then at 7:20 be the rapid-fire trench mortar add they shell to the deluge pour upon the first-line german trench after ten minute of this promptly at 7:30 o'clock the gun lift they fire to the second line of german trench as if they be answer to the pressure of a single electric button and the man of the new british army leap over they parapet and rush toward the wreckage the gun and mortar have work even close at hand they be visible for only a moment before be hide by the smoke of the german shell-curtain over what remain of the trench of the deadly work beneath that pall of smoke as steel meet steel and the new soldier of britain flesh they bayonet for the first time and fall by the thousand under the murderous fire of machine-gun history will tell the tale long after the survivor have cease to recount the deed of the day to they grandchild wherever the english tongue be speak each side give credit to the other for the utmost bravery and devotion during the battle the new english regiment fight like veteran and fully maintain the tradition of the british army for dogged bravery while the german fight with desperate tenacity valor and resourcefulness this last quality be display in the device which have be invent and be use to prevent or delay the ally advance it be indeed wonderful how well the german have protect they machine-gun from the devastating effect of the preliminary bombardment which tear trench to piece and utterly demolish barbed-wire entanglement but fail in many case to destroy the deep bomb-proof in which the teuton machine-gun be protect and conceal continuation of the great battle on July 2 and 3 the battle of the somme continue without cessation of infantry fighting while the big gun thunder on both side the british offensive take fricourt on the 2nd after a tremendous bombardment and occupy several village while the french advanced to within three mile

american army as the hinge of this ally offensive be direct toward the important railroad communication of the german army through mézières and sedan the enemy must hold fast to this part of he line or the withdrawal of he force with four year ' accumulation of plant and material would be dangerously imperil the german army have as yet show no demoralization and while the mass of its troops have suffer in morale its first-class division and notably its machine-gun defense be exhibit remarkable tactical efficiency as well as courage the german general staff be fully aware of the consequence of a success on the meuse-argonne line certain that he would do everything in he power to oppose we the action be plan with as much secrecy as possible and be undertake with the determination to use all

of the german horde press forward in serbium and push ahead through the balkan region meanwhile american strength be greatly augument in the west and at the same time american troops appear on the

of this vigorous and abundant american action emerge the condition that insure a peace of justice these thing be the quick work of the latter part of 1917 and the campaign of 1918 the achievement be gigantic but it have no effect in take attention or divert action from those movement that offer at once a advantage to we common cause while disintegrate the hoary tyranny of central and eastern europe change come fast and furious event in the field react with powerful effect upon autocratic austrium the austrian throne be build upon the back of vassal state all of which have yield thousand

furnish fund as well as moral support to they provisional government have support a independent czecho-slav army in russium with american reinforcement with clothing arm munitions and supplies and now at exactly the right juncture in August 1918 recognize the czecho-slav as a cobelligerent power lawfully at war against the central empire ferdinand fall from the war wagon this be the push that bring the break germany still have she army intact on the soil of other country and be a consolidated force tired though not beat but the fat and filthy czar ferdinand of bulgarium sit in voluntary exile eat like bread the ash of repentance and mingle he drink with weep so that he country yellow at best and frighten by the fear of be do to as it have do by serbium quit abruptly without shame almost without firing a shot with that defection the last wisp of germany 's long cherish dream of a boche middle-europe and a boche empire stretch from berlin to bagdad fade forever in October 1918 austrium consent to a reconstitute independent bohemian state and with apparent readiness grant self-government to hungary meantime in September and October 1918 the american and ally army chase the german

of term of peace this lead to four exchange of note in which germany 's expression be specious and assume a right to negotiate the last of these note be submit by president wilson to the ally council at paris and the council answer by refer the whole question of armistice to marshal foch and the ally military chief the crooked kamerad in those same month of September and October 1918 austrium and turkey make proffer of separate surrender this be the logical sequence of a crooked kamerad peace-offensive inaugurate by germany as soon as she find herself be roll helplessly toward the rhine it be at once the most vicious game that she genius for the vicious have ever prompt and it be put forward at the very time when the fourth liberty loan be in course of be float we soldier on all front have often suffer through a trick of false surrender by german soldier it be best describe by one of we boy who be lie on a table in a base hospital wait he turn to be operate upon when he hear another who be be wheel out from the operating room and be mutter through the ether fume : fire at I ten foot away he do point blank and then he drop he rifle and stick up he hand and call I ` kamerad ' kamerad the dirty crook do not i stick ` im pritty bill it have be a common thing on the western front for a group of boche to come run toward the american line unarmed with they hand in the air cry kamerad kamerad and then when we man go out to receive they fall flat to make way for a force of armed boche immediately behind they who open fire -- plain murder as ever be do so it be a crooked kamerad cry a peace offensive intend to sing we to sleep that germany launch in September 1918 of a sudden we newspaper be fill with what appear to be straight news dispatch date at amsterdam copenhagen stockholm london paris geneva and even berlin tell tale -lrb- that be not so -rrb- of starvation and disaffection in germany or broken morale in the german army and riotous demonstration demand peace the impression be immediate and come near to be disastrous many urgent request be be make just then for public help from america the gigantic fourth loan the need of the red cross the thousand and one thing big and little that have to be take care of and the very earnest and press call for a sharper realization of war 's awful fact be be drive with might and main all over the land and all be go well within three day before even the associated press discover the fraud these outrageous german lie have take effect subscription to the loan begin to slacken alarmingly interest in the battle news begin to fade people be tell each other the war be over prince max write a note then on October 6th 1918 come the note of the german chancellor prince maximilian of baden ask a armistice and a peace conference -- in essence a astounding request for time to reconsolidate the german army and bring up fresh gun and munitions america might have be fool into a frightful error if the great war-organization have not come forward with a roar counterblast the peace offensive fail more than that the people resent it in a prompt and highly practical way they oversubscribe the six billion loan most of they especially the smaller subscriber double they subscription in the last two day of the time allot for the flotation October 7th president wilson answer prince max 's request with a refusal but it be a fortunate thing for the ally cause that the peace offensive be make for its one effect be to create a profound distrust of all war news come out of amsterdam or copenhagen it reveal the fact that berlin have be closely censor all news dispatch that assume to disclose the state of affair in the central empire censor they rigorously and invent most of they germany have not yet learn that lie would not win the war but the rest of the world have learn that germany as a liar be so supernally endowed that she feeblest effort in that domain would have make anania baron munchausen and joe mulhatton look like a trio of supersaint choke with truth first hun cry for peace germany 's definite turn toward peace come in October 1918 in the form of further and very awkward

day aboard a staten island ferry boat it be not in any sense a act of war but mere and open piracy kill for the love of kill it be one of the most horrible act in a long long list of horror for which germany have learn she must account in the long reckoning she have be force to face virtue vice and violence at the same time strangely contrast with the virtuous attitude assume in the note town and city in france and belgium be be blow up before evacuation by the german they man be be march away to slavery in germany they woman and young girl assign as orderly in the service of german officer -- such orderly as turkey buy and sell for its harem the contrast between german profession of virtue and german bestiality of act be ghastly it be hard to believe that such thing could happen between
