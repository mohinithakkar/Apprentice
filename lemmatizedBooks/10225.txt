deliver she from she suffering when she father try to rescue she he be shoot and she mother be seriously wounded indeed it be certain destruction to any frenzied parent who try to defend he child a clergyman of dixmude say the burgomaster of handzaeme be shoot for try to protect he daughter and how many other case have occur we have not the heart to continue the list footnote : -lrb- 12 -rrb- see the report of the french commission -lrb- vol i page 35 -rrb- see also in the reply to the white book p 500 the move letter of cardinal mercier to von bissing : my conscience forbid my divulging to any tribunal the information alas only too well substantiate which i possess outrage on nun have be commit kill the wound there be _ great number _ of wound who on they solemn oath have relate how when lie on the field of battle they see they wounded comrade finish off by rifle or revolver shot or by blow from butt-end or by bayonet stab or kick to death by german soldier non-commissioned officer and even by officer -lrb- 13 -rrb- we can not pause to analyze these innumerable deposition there be other evidence how often when a counter-attack have put we in possession of ground lose the day before have we find poor fellow finish off -- with they throat cut as in the case of the two sergeant of the 31st chasseur at the pass of sainte-marie or with they own bayonet drive into they mouth like the poor little fellow of the 17th the enemy often run amok like this : -- on August 23rd the curé of réméréville tend lieutenant toussaint -lrb- who pass out first at the forestry school in July -rrb- when he fall in battle this young officer be bayonet by all the german who pass near he and he body be a mass of wound from head to foot at oudrigny a german officer meet a french vehicle show the red cross flag and load with ten wound he deploy he company and fire two volley at it at bonviller a officer murder nine french wounded stretch helpless in a barn by shoot they through the ear on 23rd August at montigny-le-tilleul m vital be catch in the act of tend a french soldier l sohier by name wound in the head and side such a crime deserve punishment and the wretch first shoot the orderly and then the patient at ethe they set a shed on fire and roasted more than twenty wound who be lie there we all know the celebrated order of general stenger in the region of thiaville -lrb- meurthe-et-moselle -rrb- : -- no prisoner be to be take all prisoner whether wound or not must be slaughter it be not only in lorraine that such order be give listen to the deposition of a german soldier : the same day we see eighteen other frenchman lieutenant n tell we to shoot they as he do not know what else to do with they read this letter find at l'éçouvillon in a german trench which we recapture : every day we take many prisoner but they be shoot at once as we no longer know where to put they think of the diary in which a german soldier near peronne record he impression of the day : they lay in heap of ten or twelve some dead and some still live those who could still walk be march off those who be wound in the head or lung and could not lift themselves up be finish off with a bullet that be the order which we get a german soldier while be nurse in a hospital at nancy confide to dr roemer that the wound in he stomach have be inflict on he by a german nco because he refuse to finish off a wound frenchman wound be not only massacre on the field of battle but field hospital be also the scene of atrocity at gomery in a casualty clearing station under dr sédillot there be numerous wound remain in the german line a german officer with twenty-five man visit the place and inspect it and retire say that all be in order but a nco and a party of soldier remain in the street outside they be excite and keep shout it be war to the death and make sign of cut throat they rush in and with they revolver shoot down dr sédillot -lrb- who happily survive with other to give evidence -rrb- and set fire to the place madden by the flame the wound -lrb- many of whom have have amputation perform on they that very morning -rrb- leap from the window on the first floor and fall into the garden where the executioner pick they up gather they in a bunch and shoot they in this way lieutenant jeannin and dr charette be murder and from one hundred to one hundred and twenty officer and soldier -- whose wound should have make they sacred -- perish from shot or fire after terrible suffering when all be say however it be better to kill wounded soldier by fire or sword than by starvation as the follow incident show : one hundred wound frenchman together with dr bender be bring to the stenay barracks and one hundred and eighty more come in shortly afterwards the latter have be leave out unattended on the battle-field for five day be in a terrible condition dr bender in vain beg the german for help in get the wound man out of the ambulance into the hospital the boche refuse and simply go on suck they pipe though wound himself the doctor with the aid of two male nurse -lrb- frenchman both -rrb- have to do the whole thing himself for several day the boche give they no food at all we poor fellow scream with hunger -lrb- 14 -rrb- say the doctor on oath and add i have sixty badly wound with I and beg the german army doctor to operate but he say he have no time i then ask he leave to operate myself but he reply be you be in the german line and must conform to we rule the doctor end he pathetic evidence with the word nearly all these unhappy man die of neglect we have see doctor like professor vulpius actually steal money but of all the type of boche doctor the most hideous be the hero of the follow tale take from the deposition of dr bender a french soldier at stenay be under my treatment he have a wound in he foot -- not very severe which do not need a operation at all what be my astonishment to find that a german army surgeon have amputate he thigh i could not help express my indignation and the surgeon 's only reply be he will be a man the less against we in the next war -lrb- 15 -rrb- they will deny these crime to-morrow but in 1914 they glory in they on the 18th of October a silesian newspaper publish a article send from the front by a nco in which he say man who be particularly tender-hearted give the french wound the ` coup de grace ' with a bullet but the other cut and thrust as much as possible we enemy fight bravely whether they be slightly or badly wound we brave fusilier spare the fatherland as far as possible the expensive trouble of look after numerous enemy in the evening with prayer of thanksgive on we lip we go to sleep be these mere boasting of crime no the article be submit to the captain of the company who certify it as correct and counter-signed it the nco the captain the silesian public the whole german nation be delighted to see this abominable story of murder and shame appear in the paper under the head a day of honor for we regiment -lrb- 16 -rrb- footnote : -lrb- 13 -rrb- report of the french commission vol iii -lrb- 14 -rrb- he add that certain orderly -- lorrainer belong to the german army -- supply they with food on the sly -lrb- 15 -rrb- french chivalry could hardly believe that a doctor would amputate a wounded enemy 's limb without absolute necessity and in mere revenge but such case be alas not rare see the awful tale of torture in the journal d'un grand blessé en allemagne by charle henneboi -lrb- pp 137 146 -rrb- and the statement of a german doctor -lrb- p 87 -rrb- you doctor in france perform amputation as they please on we wound the order have therefore be give to amputate without hesitation as reprisal every damage limb -lrb- 16 -rrb- let we quote to show the mental make-up of certain german the condition in which captain coustre of the 108th and captain lesourd of the 50th meet they death they be wander over the battle-field where the enemy have be repulse they hear a cry for help there be a soldier in one place and a officer in another who ask for a drink they stop and lean over they to give they a drink from they flask when the wound man blow they brain out shelter behind woman let we call to mind the innumerable instance when the boche put up they hand or wave a white flag and cry kamerad pretend to surrender : thus draw we unsuspecting man towards they and then suddenly move aside to leave the field open to a party of rifleman or a machine-gun hidden away behind they these be the trick of coward which be constantly employ at the beginning of the war and we man -lrb- at the cost of many victim -rrb- learn at last to guard against they but they have do even more cowardly thing than this there be the german officer who to protect himself from danger while take observation put three child round he at néry twenty-five person woman and child be compel to walk at the side of a boche column to protect it from be enfilade near maline six german soldier who be take with they five young girl on meet a belgian patrol place the girl all round they to prevent the enemy from firing at jodoigne they put a curé in front of they and make he walk with he arm fold and they do the same at hougaerde to another curé who be kill a similar fate befall several civilian at mon at senlis we man be firing to cover we retreat and the german take some inhabitant out of the house and make they walk in the middle of the street while they themselves keep along by the wall many of these unfortunate people be kill in numerous place say the belgian commission of enquiry the german make civilian -- man and woman -- walk in front of they in this way a german column pass through marchienne push ahead of they a body of several hundred civilian they take the road for montigny-le-tilleul where the first important battle with the french force take place at sempst during the fighting on the 25th August man and woman be place in the front rank of the firing line at erpe on the 12th September a german column attack by a belgian motor-machine-gun take out of the house twenty to twenty-five man and young people -lrb- include a child of thirteen -rrb- and make they walk in front in the middle of the road the machine-gunner see civilian in front of they cease firing at alost a german company attack the bridge in front march some thirty civilian with a machine-gun hide behind they at nimy with the butt-end of they rifle they drive in front of they 500 man woman and child towards the english who in consequence dare not fire and in this way the 84th and 85th schleswig regiment be able to continue they heroic march as far as maubeuge when they adversary can not actually see the human shield that they be use they send a warning on the 7th September 1914 the death 's head hussar shut up all the inhabitant of the village with they in the château of saint ouen-sur-morin and then to avoid be shell inform the english of they disposition they fire on anyone who try to escape at mouzon we see a number of civilian be push in front of the enemy with the butt-end of rifle and we stop firing the wretched people move suddenly to one side of the road uncover the german and then we fire the boche furious fire they first volley not at we but point blank at these non-combatant who be decimate the coward chiefly use civilian as shield but sometimes they also make use of prisoner at keyem they push one hundred belgian soldier in front of they some with they hand tie and other with they arm in the air at dixmude they advance under the shelter of forty disarm marine who have be take prisoner when they get in front of we line we marine shout for god 's sake fire these be german and these hero fall gloriously under the french bullet such deed be countless the boche will deny they later on but in 1914 they do not deny they but rather glory in they as a good idea we can see this from the letter of the bavarian lieutenant eberlein publish on the 7th October 1914 by a lead munich paper we have arrest three other civilian when a ` good idea ' strike I we make they sit on chair in the middle of the street -- supplication from they and blow with butt-end of rifle from we at last they be seat outside in the street with they hand convulsively clasp together i feel sorry for they but the plan work at once as i learn later the regiment which enter saint-dié further to the north of we have precisely similar experience to we own the civilian whom they have put in the same way in the middle of the street be kill by french bullet i see they dead body -lrb- 17 -rrb- footnote : -lrb- 17 -rrb- we have not so far come across any attempt justification by german author of these cowardly act but such we shall have without fail it be probable that the 93 intellectual whose manifesto we recall to memory a few page further on be prepare a fresh appeal to the civilized world with a view to explain that the german troops -- the representative and trustee of _ kultur _ -- be authorise by god himself to use _ every means _ for the protection of they precious life martyrdon of civilian prisoner after have burn we village -lrb- 18 -rrb- and shoot the inhabitant by dozen in some place and by hundred in other they frequently deport all or a part of the survivor to germany it be impossible at this moment to establish the number of those deport but they be send off by ten of thousand these unfortunate people man woman and child who have witness and survive fire and massacre who have see they house blaze and so many of those dear to they fall under the bullet of the assassin and who be force in some place to dig grave for they victim and in other to hold a light for the executioner while they be finish off the wound -- these poor wretch be despatch to germany -lrb- 19 -rrb- what a journey and what a place of residence let we quote one story among a thousand we escort be command by two german officer they be unapproachable anyone who try to speak to they be threaten with a revolver in order that we might get a drink we be make to collect empty meat tin which serve as we drinking cup until we reach cassel we be abused and threaten wherever we go sometimes they make sign to we that they be go to shoot we or hang we or cut we head off they throw filth at we head and spat in we face we be not go to stoop before they the disgrace be not ours it be they not we who be degrade a officer who be present when we march-past take place aim blow with a riding-whip at everyone within he reach until we arrive at the railway it be the same at every place where we meet soldier we reach marche after a nine hour ' journey we be conduct to a room mark as have accommodation for 100 soldier but they put 400 of we in there the people of the place send we slice of bread and butter but it be the german who eat they the latter give we crust of bread to eat we be abominably cramp a few manage to stretch themselves out but the air be so poisonous that they could not remain in that position at melreux station we change guard they drive we with the butt-end of they rifle to a spot where a train of cattle truck be stand in the yard and we have to get in the previous occupant have be cattle and the truck have be clean in a very perfunctory fashion there be neither straw nor seat off we go every time we stop at a station the soldier on guard there insult we it be even worse when once we arrive in germany they open the door on the platform side and if we be on a line between two platform they open the door on both side so as to rejoice german heart by the sight of we they treat we like wild beast in a menagerie and the officer and soldier set the example while the woman and child be not behindhand with abuse and make threatening gesture we guard be applaud as if they be do something heroic at one station we see a woman look out of she window and shout ` hurrah ' the journey take 35 hour and during the whole of that time we be only give food and drink once and that thanks only to the red cross -lrb- 20 -rrb- we arrive at wilhelmshöhe -lrb- cassel -rrb- at 3 be on the 28th August and be make to walk quickly through the street we arrival have be notify and in spite of the early hour a hostile crowd abusive and threatening line the route the old and the lame could not keep up the pace at which we march they companion help and drag they along constantly beat with butt-end at length we arrive at the gaol where they shut we in the cell in lot of three or four at a time m brichet -lrb- inspector of forest -rrb- want to take he son -lrb- aged 14 -rrb- with he but the gaoler say ` not the father and son together ' the prison authority show they surprise at the sort of criminal who have be entrust to they as the bulk of they be shopkeeper and artisan include in the number be the burgomaster of dinant a sheriff professor barrister and judge a imbecile a dozen child of about 13 and some old man -lrb- one of whom be 81 -rrb- make up the party at the end of a week we be assemble in a yard and tell that we be not under sentence but be detain in the interest of public safety in that prison the poor wretch be treat with much greater severity than ordinary prisoner for they be shut up in cell and have no air by climb on a chest one might open the window and see a little bit of the landscape the ordinary prisoner be allow to do this but we be forbid there be not a single chair there be the skeleton of a iron bed which be quite useless as there be no mattress there be four blanket and two bundle of straw which very soon crumble into dust one day a week we have a hour in the courtyard and there we walk round and round in single file be forbid to walk two by two there be a guard with fix bayonet always with we the food be absolutely inadequate -lrb- 21 -rrb- and we suffer continually from hunger there be a certain croibien who have be slightly wound at dinant by a bullet in he arm he wound neglect during the journey have become septic and in spite of all he suffering nothing be do for he it be not until after several day that it be decide to take he to the infirmary where he arm be amputate he die the next day although he father and brother be intern with he they be not allow to see he again alive or dead m tschoffen public prosecutor at dinant the high official who write these line finish he deposition with these word : they have no reason whatever for we arrest and i do not see any reason that they could have for set we at liberty one fine day they tell we that we be go to leave here be another illustration : before the 28th February 1915 more than 10000 person old man woman and child who have be deport from france to germany have be repatriate by way of switzerland all those who receive they on they return be alarm at they ragged condition and weakness which be so great that the french commission of enquiry receive special instruction to question these victim they take the evidence of over 300 witness in 28 different locality to do justice to they case one ought to quote the whole report -- child brutally tear away from they mother poor wretch crowd for day together in carriage so tightly pack that they have to stand up case of madness occur among these half-stifled crowd howl with hunger but we must confine we quotation to a few item of kultur while the man of combre set out for germany the woman and child be shut up in the village church they be keep there for a month and pass they night seat in the pew dysentery and croup rage among they the woman be allow to carry excrement only just outside the church into the churchyard -- at least four of the prisoner be massacre because they could not keep up with the column be completely exhaust -- fortin aged 65 and infirm could not go any further they tie a rope to he and two horseman hold the end so that he have to keep the pace of the horse as he keep fall down at every moment they make he get up by poke he with they lance the poor wretch cover with blood pray they to kill he 189 inhabitant of sinceny who be send to erfurt arrive there after a journey of 84 hour during which each of they get nothing but a single morsel of bread weigh less than four ounce another convoy spend four day on the railway journey and be only feed once and be beat with stick and fist and with knife handle the same brutality be experience in the german city through which they pass and very few of the civilian prisoner escape be buffet by the infuriate crowd or be spit upon so much for the journey now for what happen to they after they arrival the declaration make to we show clearly that the bulk of the prisoner almost collapse from hunger after food have be distribute when anything be leave you see some of they rush to the neighborhood of the kitchen hustle and beat by the sentry these unfortunate risk blow and abuse to try and pick up some additional morsel of the sickening food you see man die of hunger pick up herr head and the grounds of the morning 's decoction at parchim where 2000 french civilian from 12 to 77 year of age be intern two starve prisoner who ask for the scrap leave over be beat with the butt-end of rifle to such a extent that they die of they wound the young son of one of they who try to protect he father be tie to a stake for a week on end on oath dr page depose : those who have no money almost die of hunger when a little soup be leave a crowd of unfortunate rush to get it and the non-commissioned officer get rid of they at last by let the dog loose on they but what be the need of all these detail and of all this evidence look at the 10000 who come back after be repatriate and see what the bandit have do to they reader summon up you courage and peruse to the bitter end the conclusion of the official commission of enquiry it be impossible to conceal the melancholy and indignation we feel on see the state of the ` hostage ' -lrb- 22 -rrb- whom the german have return to we after they have kidnap they in defiance of the rights of nation during we enquiry we never cease hear the perpetual cough that rent they we see number of young people whose cheerfulness have disappear apparently for ever and whose pale and emaciated face betray physical damage probably beyond repair in spite of ourselves we could not help think that scientific germany have apply she methodical way to try and spread tuberculosis in we country nor be we less profoundly move to think by the sight of woman mourn they desolate hearth and miss or captive child or by the moral impression leave on the face and bearing of many prisoner by the hateful regime which be intend to destroy in those who be subject to it the feeling of human dignity and self-respect -lrb- 23 -rrb- footnote : -lrb- 18 -rrb- _ prisoner _ as well as wound have very often be massacre on the field of battle as to the treatment that prisoner -- french belgian russian and english -- have undergo in german camp it be a pitiful tale that we do not intend to begin here some day it must be write with the actual evidence before we the lot of the german prisoner in england russium and france must be compare with that of ours in germany the most indifferent reader will feel he heart stir within he and will hesitate to say whether we be generous or whether we be fool -lrb- 19 -rrb- we speak of those who have leave -- but what of those who have remain in belgium and france under the german heel the time have not yet come for write this piece of history but we can not refrain from refer to the suffering of these child of the north boy and girl tear from they family carry off like band of slave to other invade region to be employ on force labor france have apprise the neutral country of these fact : will they remain silent -lrb- 20 -rrb- further on it will be see that much worse happen on numerous other journey -lrb- 21 -rrb- we get one pound of black sour bread per diem in the morning we have a tepid decoction intend for coffee at mid-day a pint and a half of thick soup and at night rather less than a pint of thin soup on three occasion only do we get potato but never once meat cabbage soup be the usual thing and after a certain time it turn we stomach certain prisoner be employ in chop up the cabbage to make sauerkraut and they have to keep the broken leaf as these be use up for we soup -lrb- 22 -rrb- through a old habit the commission make use of this word they be not hostage of course -lrb- 23 -rrb- it must also be note that when the commissioner make the enquiry see the repatriate people they have have some time in which to recover first in switzerland and then in france the arrival of these pitiable draft give rise -lrb- even among those of the swiss people who be in principle the least hostile to germany -rrb- to such a feeling of horror for they executioner that the kaiser take warning and think it wiser to suspend the repatriation for several month for the welcome and the kind care which we poor martyr receive at the hand of the swiss we grateful thanks and salutation be due german excuse : lie and calumny the boche have take up three position in succession in the first place in they speech in they writings and by commemorative picture and medal _ they have glory in they misdeed _ thus declare that kultur be above morality -lrb- as state by they writer thoma mann -rrb- and that the right of german might be above everything then in the second place when they discover that in the world outside they there be something know as a moral conscience not understand by they but still to be reckon with _ they cynically deny the charge _ finally when they be drive from this second trench when simple negation become impossible _ they have perforce to explain they crime _ they commonest explanation be this civilian fire on we -lrb- 24 -rrb- the french commission of enquiry come to the follow conclusion on this point : this allegation be false and those who put it forward have be powerless to give it the appearance of truth even though it have be they custom to fire shot in the neighborhood of dwelling in order to be able to affirm that they have be attack by innocent inhabitant on whose ruin or massacre they have resolve enquiry conduct by high magistrate have establish the fact that german official be very frequently guilty of premeditated lie it be probable all the same that many german soldier on enter belgium or france be obsess by the idea of civilian firing on they the cry of a soldier tremble with fear drunk or thirsting for pillage -- man hat geschossen -lrb- they have fire -rrb- -- be enough for a locality to be deliver up at once to the wildest fury when a inhabitant have fire on a regiment say a soldier at louvain the place belong to the regiment what a temptation for a boche soldier to fire a shot that will at once unloose pillage and massacre some mistake have _ possibly _ be make which could have be avoid by the least enquiry read this admission record in he diary by a saxon officer : the lovely village of gué-d'hossus have be give over to the flame though innocent in my opinion i hear that a cyclist fall off he machine and that he fall cause he rifle to go off of itself as a consequence there be firing in he direction then the male inhabitant be simply hurl straight away into the flame such horror will not be repeat we must hope there ought to be some compulsion to verify suspicion of guilt in order to put a check on this indiscriminate shooting of people the only shot fire at they inside or in the neighborhood of village have be those of french or belgian soldier cover they retreat sometimes this have be discover but too late and they have continue they crime -- in order to justify they here be the statement of a neutral : in one village they find corpse of german soldier with the finger cut off and instantly the officer in command have the house set on fire and the inhabitant shoot in the same district a german officer be billet with a famous flemish poet the officer behave courteously be treat with consideration and allow himself to talk freely : he complaint be the misdeed of he soldier near haelen he tell he host he have to have a soldier shot on finding in he knapsack some finger cover with ring : the man on be question admit that he have cut they off the body of the german dead -lrb- 25 -rrb- in exceptional case a enquiry be hold and in every such instance the truth be discover and massacre prevent at the end of August liebknecht -lrb- 26 -rrb- a member of the reichstag set out in he car for louvain he come to a village where there be considerable excitement go on the german have just find three of they man lie dead on the road and accuse the peasant of be responsible for the deed liebknecht examine they and be not long in obtain proof that the german have be kill by belgian rifleman at huy there be shot in the night two soldier wound the populace accuse the mayor arrest and condemn to death but he know that there be no ally troops in the neighborhood and also that he own people have not fire a shot shoot I if you like he say calmly but not before extract the bullet from the wound the officer less of a brute than some give he consent to this the bullet in the wound be german bullet but the german do not even require a pretext to take action they first crime to we knowledge be on August 4th some officer dash up to herve in a car challenge two civilian while cross the bridge and without give they time to answer shot they down with revolver in they private diary they accuse one another each throw on he neighbor the responsibility for crime commit a cavalryman write : it be unfortunately true that the worst element of we army feel themselves authorise to commit any sort of infamy this charge apply particularly to the asc a bombing officer : _ rethel _ September 2nd discipline become lax brandy looting the blame lie with the _ infantry _ a infantry officer : discipline in we company excellent -- a contrast with the rest the _ pioneer _ be not worth much as for the _ artillery _ they be a band of brigand a final extract seem to be the only one that give the truth : brin _ troops of all arm _ be engage in looting it have be possible sometimes to prove premeditation on the 17th August a german officer be billet with a belgian magistrate they talk turn on dinant dinant say the officer be a condemn town m x of dinant happen to be in another town make the acquaintance of a german officer who say to he on August 20th you come from dinant do not go back it be a bad place and will be destroy troops on they march towards andenne announce in village through which they pass that they be go to burn the town and massacre the inhabitant at louvain a german officer treat generously by a middle-class family and appreciate they courtesy rush to they house on the 25th at 11 o'clock in the morning -lrb- 27 -rrb- and earnestly press he host to leave without delay refuse to give they any explanation the family puzzle and perturb by he appeal go off and so escape \* \* \* \* \* in the eye of the moralist the worst of all they crime will perhaps be this that the wretch try to dishonor belgium after first assassinate she they have dare to say write and proclaim publicly and affirm to neutral that belgian woman and girl have mutilate german wounded soldier blind they with scissors or with boiling water the report of the belgian commission of enquiry have be reply to in a counter report -lrb- 28 -rrb- publish as a german white book this enquiry and these document will live in history in century to come they will hang as a heavy weight on the kaiser 's memory and the conscience of germany listen to the pathetic conclusion of the belgian reply : before god and before man the belgian government have no hesitation in give this as its opinion of the conduct of the german government towards the belgian nation : ` he be twice guilty who violate the rights of other and then attempt with singular audacity to justify himself by impute to he victim fault that be never commit ' -lrb- 29 -rrb- it still remain to be explain how by what means by what deadly influence this german nation consist of man who as individual be not all brigand have reach and be lead to this state of savagery in the preparation for this _ collective madness _ of a people what part have be play by its leader of thought and its politician by race and by education this be a disturbing phenomenon which student of mental disease -lrb- 30 -rrb- will study later but on the examination of which we can not here embark it be not for we to seek the pathological cause for this moral decay -- this decadence we have only to note its _ effect _ footnote : -lrb- 24 -rrb- need it be note here that even if in any locality a imprudent civilian have fire a shot it would still remain -- in accordance with the hague convention international law and plain morality -- a veritable crime to massacre in a heap haphazard and without enquiry so many innocent soul -lrb- 25 -rrb- lh grondij les allemands en belgique p cxix -lrb- pari berger-levrault publisher -rrb- -lrb- 26 -rrb- liebknecht be too honest

it may be recall that commission of enquiry at which _ both _ side should be represent be offer by belgian socialist to german socialist by belgian freemason to german freemason by belgian bishop to german bishop three proposal three refusal -lrb- 29 -rrb- france have suffer from similar calumny we allude above -lrb- note p 37 -rrb- to the declaration of a german army doctor that order be give to amputate as a reprisal all wounded limb so _ we _ be say to have do that a monstrous lie which will be spurn indignantly by all who know the honorable tradition of we ambulance and of we french doctor the _ method of systematic lie _ have be show to the life in connection with the use of asphyxiate gas the boche make immense preparation for the use of this gas when they organization be complete they take care before act to publish each day for a week in they communique little note announce that the enemy be make wide use of this new method of warfare -- a statement contrary to fact and know by they to be so but one that be calculate to mislead public opinion when they consider that public opinion be sufficiently prepare they launch they deadly gas and they flaming liquid and we need a long time need also to overcome we moral hesitation to make sure of we defense and we reply _ cynical lie _ with the german be not only admit but _ glory in _ when it be completely prove that in order to start the war of 1870 bismarck have commit _ forgery _ professor han delbrück exclaimed bless be the hand that forge the em despatch -lrb- 30 -rrb- who except the specialist in mental disease can

most high i be he sword woe and death unto those who resist my will woe and death unto those who believe not in my mission the german appeal appeal to the civilised world now that we have reach the close of this book of horror let we impanel the 93 german of light and learning and confront they with the word of they own manifesto : as representative of german science and art we the undersigned declare that : -- it be not true that germany provoke this war it be not true that we have criminally violate the neutrality of belgium it be not true that we soldier have make any attack on the life or property of a single belgian citizen without be force to it by sheer necessity it be not true that we troops brutally destroy louvain it be not true that we have conduct warfare in defiance of international law we soldier commit neither undisciplined act nor cruelty in this struggle we shall continue to the end to act as a civilised nation to whom the heritage of a goethe a beethoven or a kant be as sacred as we own hearth and home we answer for that in we own name and on we honor -lrb- 31 -rrb- and since irony be more powerful than abuse let we set down here without a word of comment a few german utterance : -- the kaiser : we be the salt of the earth god create we to civilise the world the cardinal-archbishop of cologne : it be with god that we soldier set out for this war that have be inflict upon we and in which we be fight for the sacred treasure of christianity and for its own particular gift kultur dryander a protestant minister and preacher to the royal court at berlin : on we side we be fight with a self-control a conscience and a gentleness unexampled perhaps in the history of the world professor lasson : we characteristic be humanity gentleness conscience -- the christian virtue in a world of evil we stand for love and god be with we and finally this older and memorable saying of they great philosopher hegel : the destiny of the german race be to supply the sustain pillar of christian teaching footnote : -lrb- 31 -rrb- speaking of honor it be as well to recall here the reply make by a german officer to the schoolmaster at chanteheux the schoolmaster quite simply pledge he word of honor that no inhabitant have fire : you french pig the brute shout do not talk of honor -- you have none appeal by belgian workman 800000 copy of this pamphlet have already be send out when the world ring with the tragic appeal of the belgian workman to they brother worker in other land this appeal ought to be fix on the door of every factory and workshop every worker every citizen should study it we regret that we can not reprint it here in full but the following extract will at least give a idea of this new crime commit by germany : -- worker -- in the name of the international bond that unite all workman the working class of belgium -- threaten without exception with slavery deportation and force labor for the enemy 's gain -- send to the work class in other land a supreme appeal germany as you know attack and terrorise belgium in 1914 for have defend she right to neutrality and she faith and honor germany have be martyrize belgium she have from that moment onward turn the land into a prison : the frontier be arm against belgian like a battle front all we constitutional liberty have be abolish there be no longer safety anywhere the life of we citizen be at the mercy of the policeman -- arbitrary limitless pitiless belgian industrial idleness have be the creation of the german maintain by they for they own profit -lrb- 32 -rrb- to these 500000 unemployed they have for the last month be say : ` either you will sign a contract to work for germany or you will be reduce to slavery ' in either case it mean exile deportation force labor in the interest of the enemy and against the interest of we country : formidable punishment the cruellest ever invent by tyranny for the punishment of crime -- and what _ be _ the crime allege on the western front belgian workman -- you brother and ours -- be be force to dig trench to build aviation camp to fortify the german line and when the victim in spite of everything be firm in they refusal to take part in work forbid by international law they be starve and beat into illness wound and sometimes even _ kill _ in germany they be turn on to work in mine and at lime-kiln quite regardless of they age profession or trade youth of seventeen old man of seventy be deport in haphazard mass _ be not this a revival of ancient slavery with all its horror _ do you know brother what the german throw to they victim by way of pay 30 pfennig -lrb- 3d -rrb- a day worker : _ never forget that the soldiers-who be _ _ act as the torturer or we belgian workman be themselves german worker _ in the depths of we distress we count on you it be for you to act for ourselves even if brute force succeed for the moment in reduce we body to servitude we shall never give we consent a final word : whatever torture we may undergo we do not wish for peace except with the independence of we country and the triumph of justice the workman of belgium footnote : -lrb- 32 -rrb- by levy on belgium a war contribution which already exceed # 40000000 -- by transport to germany food merchandise and various product to the value of more than # 200000000 -- by seize and despatch to they own country the greater portion of we raw material machine and accessory -- by issue threatening edict to prevent locality from use the unemployed on they own important work of public utility conclusion what be we object be it to incite we soldier to commit if chance arise atrocity like theirs we repudiate with horror a thought such as that _ defensive _ reprisal -lrb- asphyxiate gas liquid fire etc -rrb- be sometimes indispensable reprisal for _ revenge _ would be unworthy of we but -- without speaking of personal punishment demand by outraged conscience and essential in order that the two indivisible principle of right and of responsibility may still exist in the world -- we must make it absolutely impossible for the wild beast to break out again and how when the settle time draw near and in spite of weariness a new effort be need to realize condition of peace with guarantee for the future -- how could the ally nation accept the sacrifice still demand of they if they remain in ignorance it be not enough for these crime to be know by government and by a few hundred people with leisure and inclination to read collection of great volume they must be know by everybody by the entire people by the people who -- in we proud and free country -- control support direct they government and be the sole master of they own destiny we people ought to know the crime commit in the name of kultur in order at all cost to take the precaution necessary to prevent for ever they return that be we first object the second be this : to all we martyr we have a sacred duty -- that of remembrance there where they fall we shall doubtless carve they name in stone or bronze but what of a time further away when after the long suffering of this war free humanity take up again its work of peace we shall see the german reappear in every land at every cross-road -- man of commerce industry finance science man of the people and of society -- in every place where those of all country all race and all color meet and rub elbow and what be we attitude to be we answer be this : so long as the nation in whose name and by whose hand these atrocity have be commit have not herself solemnly cast from she the scoundrel who drag she into such decadence we shall consider that it would betray we martyr for we even to rub shoulder with they executioner and that until the day arrive -- if it ever do arrive
