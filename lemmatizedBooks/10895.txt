it have be the true glory of the united state to cultivate peace by observe justice and to entitle themselves to the respect of the nation at war by fulfil they neutral obligation with the most scrupulous impartiality if there be candor in the world the truth of these assertion will not be question posterity at least will do justice to they this unexceptionable course could not avail against the injustice and violence of the belligerent power in they rage against each other or impel by more direct motive principle of retaliation have be introduce equally contrary to universal reason and acknowledge law how long they arbitrary edict will be continue in spite of the demonstration that not even a pretext for they have be give by the united state and of the fair and liberal attempt to

correspondent disposition to maintain sincere neutrality toward belligerent nation to prefer in all case amicable discussion and reasonable accommodation of difference to a decision of they by a

as internal commerce to favor in like manner the advancement of science and the diffusion of information as the best aliment to true liberty to carry on the benevolent plan which have be so meritoriously apply to the conversion of we aboriginal neighbor from the degradation and wretchedness of savage life to a participation of the improvement of which the human mind and manners be susceptible in a civilized state -- as far as sentiment and intention such as these can aid the fulfillment of my duty they will be a resource which can not fail I it be my good fortune moreover to have the path in which i be to tread light by example of illustrious service successfully render in the most try difficulty by those who have march before I of those of my immediate predecessor it might least become I here to speak i may however be pardon for not suppress the sympathy with which my heart be full in the rich reward he enjoy in the benediction of a beloved country gratefully bestow for exalted talent zealously devote through a long career to the advancement of its highest interest and happiness but the source to which i look for the aid which alone can supply my deficiency be in the well-tried intelligence and virtue of my fellow-citizen and in the counsel of those represent they in the other department associate in the care of the national interest in these my confidence will under every difficulty be best place next to that which we have all be encourage to feel in the guardianship and guidance of that almighty be whose power regulate the destiny of

the future march 4 1809 special session message _ fellow-citizen of the senate and of the house of representative _ : on this first occasion of meeting you it afford I much satisfaction to be able to communicate the commencement of a favorable change in we foreign relation the critical state of which induce a session of congress at this early period in consequence of the provision of the act interdict commercial intercourse with great britain and france we minister at london and paris be without delay instruct to let it be understand by the french and british government that the authority vest in the executive to renew commercial intercourse with they respective nation would be exercise in the case specify by that act soon after these instruction be dispatch it be find that the british government anticipate from early proceedings of congress at they last session the state of we law which have have the effect of place the two belligerent power on a footing of equal restriction and rely on the conciliatory disposition of the united state have transmit to they legation here provisional instruction not only to offer satisfaction for the attack on the frigate _ chesapeake _ and to make know the determination of he britannic majesty to send a envoy extraordinary with power to conclude a treaty on all the point between the two country but moreover to signify he willingness in the meantime to withdraw he order in council in the persuasion that the intercourse with great britain would be renew on the part of the united state these step of the british government lead to the correspondence and the proclamation now lay before you by virtue of which the commerce between the two country will be renewable after the 10th day of June next whilst i take pleasure in do justice to the council of he britannic majesty which no longer adhering to the policy which make a abandonment by france of she decree a prerequisite to a revocation of the british order have substitute the amicable course which have issue thus happily i can not do less than refer to the proposal heretofore make on the part of the united state embrace a like restoration of the suspend commerce as a proof of the spirit of accommodation which have at no time be intermit and to the result which now call for we congratulation as corroborate the principle by which the public council have be guide during a period of the most try embarrassment the discontinuance of the british order as they respect the united state have be thus arrange a communication of the event have be forward in one of we public vessel to we minister plenipotentiary at pari with instruction to avail himself of the important addition thereby make to the consideration which press on the justice of the french government a revocation of its decree or such a modification of they as that they shall cease to violate the neutral commerce of the united state the revision of we commercial law proper to adapt they to the arrangement which have take place with great britain will doubtless engage the early attention of congress it will be worthy at the same time of they just and provident care to make such further alteration in the law as will more especially protect and foster the several branch of manufacture which have be recently institute or extend by the laudable exertion of we citizen under the exist aspect of we affair i have think it not inconsistent with a just precaution to have the gunboat with the exception of those at new orlean place in a situation incur no expense beyond that requisite for they preservation and conveniency for future service and to have the crew of those at new orlean reduce to the number require for they navigation and safety i have think also that we citizen detach in quota of militia amounting to 100000 under the act of march 1808 might not improperly be relieve from the state in which they be hold for immediate service a discharge of they have be accordingly direct the progress make in raise and organize the additional military force for which provision be make by the act of April 1808 together with the disposition of the troops will appear by a report which the secretary of war be prepare and which will be lay before you of the additional frigate require by a act of the last session to be fit for actual service two be in readiness one nearly so and the fourth be expect to be ready in the month of July a report which the secretary of the navy be prepare on the subject to be lay before congress will shew at the same time the progress make in officering and man these ship it will shew also the degree in which the provision of the act relate to the other public armed ship have be carry into execution it will rest with the judgment of congress to decide how far the change in we external prospects may authorize any modification of the law relate to the army and navy establishment the work of defense for we seaport town and harbor have proceed with as much activity as the season of the year and other circumstance would admit it be necessary however to state that the appropriation hitherto make be find to be deficient a further provision will claim the early consideration of congress the whole of the 8 per cent stock remain due by the united state amount to $ 5300000 have be reimburse on the last day of the year 1808 and on the 1st day of April last the sum in the treasury exceed $ 9500000 this together with the receipt of the current year on account of former revenue bond will probably be nearly if not altogether sufficient to defray the expense of the year but the suspension of export and the consequent decrease of importation during the last twelve month will necessarily cause a great diminution in the receipt of the year 1810 after that year should we foreign relation be undisturbed the revenue will again be more than commensurate to all the expenditure aware of the inconvenience of a protracted session at the present season of the year i forbear to call the attention of the legislature to any matter not particularly urgent it remain therefore only to assure you of the fidelity and alacrity with which i shall cooperate for the welfare and happiness of we country and to pray that it may experience a continuance of the divine blessing by which it have be so signally favor jame madison may

representative _ : at the period of we last meeting i have the satisfaction of communicate a adjustment with one of the principal belligerent nation highly important in itself and still more so as presage a more extended accommodation it be with deep concern i be now to inform you that the favorable prospect have be overcloud by a refusal of the british government to abide by the act of its minister plenipotentiary and by its ensue policy toward the united state as see through the communication of the minister send to replace he whatever plea may be urge for a disavowal of engagement form by diplomatic functionary in case where by the term of the engagement a mutual ratification be reserve or where notice at the time may have be give of a departure from instruction or in extraordinary case essentially violate the principle of equity a disavowal could not have be apprehend in a case where no such notice or violation exist where no such ratification be reserve and more especially where as be now in proof a engagement to be execute without any such ratification be contemplate by the instruction give and where it have with good faith be carry into immediate execution on the part of the united state these consideration not have restrain the british government from disavow the arrangement by virtue of which its order in council be to be revoke and the event authorize the renewal of commercial intercourse have thus not take place it necessarily become a question of equal urgency and importance whether the act prohibit that intercourse be not to be consider as remain in legal force this question be after due deliberation determine in the affirmative a proclamation to that effect be issue it could not but happen however that a return to this state of thing from that which have follow a execution of the arrangement by the united state would involve difficulty with a view to diminish these as much as possible the instruction from the secretary of the treasury now lay before you be transmit to the collector of the several port if in permit british vessel to depart without give bond not to proceed to they own port it should appear that the tenor of legal authority have not be strictly pursue it be to be ascribe to the anxious desire which be feel that no individual should be injure by so unforeseen a occurrence and i rely on the regard of congress for the equitable interest of we own citizen to adopt whatever further provision may be find requisite for a general remission of penalty involuntarily incur the recall of the disavow minister have be follow by the appointment of a successor hope be indulge that the new mission would contribute to alleviate the disappointment which have be produce and to remove the cause which have so long embarrassed the good understanding of the two nation it could not be doubt that it would at least be charge with conciliatory explanation of the step which have be take and with proposal to be substitute for the reject arrangement reasonable and universal as this expectation be it also have not be fulfil from the first official disclosure of the new minister it be find that he have receive no authority to enter into explanation relative to either branch of the arrangement disavow nor any authority to substitute proposal as to that branch which concern the british order in council and finally that he proposal with respect to the other branch the attack on the frigate _ chesapeake _ be found on a presumption repeatedly declare to be inadmissible by the united state that the first step toward adjustment be due from they the proposal at the same time omit even a reference to the officer answerable for the murderous aggression and assert a claim not less contrary to the british law and british practice than to the principle and obligation of the united state the correspondence between the department of state and this minister will show how unessentially the feature present in its commencement have be vary in its progress it will show also that forget the respect due to all government he do not refrain from imputation on this which require that no further communication should be receive from he the necessity of this step will be make know to he britannic majesty through the minister plenipotentiary of the united state in london and it would indicate a want of the confidence due to a government which so well understand and exact what become foreign minister near it not to infer that the misconduct of its own representative will be view in the same light in which it have be regard here the british government will learn at the same time that a ready attention will be give to communication through any channel which may be substitute it will be happy if the change in this respect should be accompany by a favorable revision of the unfriendly policy which have be so long pursue toward the united state with france the other belligerent whose trespass on we commercial rights have long be the subject of we just remonstrance the posture of we relation do not correspond with the measure take on the part of the united state to effect a favorable change the result of the several communication make to she government in pursuance of the authority vest by congress in the executive be contain in the correspondence of we minister at paris now lay before you by some of the other belligerent although profess just and amicable disposition injury materially affect we commerce have not be duly control or repress in these case the interposition deem proper on we part have not be omit but it well deserve the consideration of the legislature how far both the safety and the honor of the american flag may be consult by adequate provision against that collusive prostitution of it by individual unworthy of the american name which have so much favor the real or pretended suspicion under which the honest commerce of they fellow-citizen have suffer in relation to the power on the coast of barbary nothing have occur which be not of a nature rather to inspire confidence than distrust as to the continuance of the exist amity with we indian neighbor the just and benevolent system continue toward they have also preserved peace and be more and more advance habit favorable to they civilization and happiness from a statement which will be make by the secretary of war it will be see that the fortification on we maritime frontier be in many of the port complete afford the defense which be contemplate and that a further time will be require to render complete the work in the harbor of new york and in some other place by the enlargement of the work and the employment of a greater number of hand at the public armory the supply of small arm of a improve quality appear to be annually increase at a rate that with those make on private contract may be expect to go far toward provide for the public exigency the act of congress provide for the equipment of we vessel of war have be fully carry into execution i refer to the statement of the secretary of the navy for the information which may be proper on that subject to that statement be add a view of the transfer of appropriation authorize by the act of the session precede the last and of the grounds on which the transfer be make whatever may be the course of you deliberation on the subject of we military establishment i should fail in my duty in not recommend to you serious attention the importance of give to we militia the great bulwark of we security and resource of we power a organization the best adapt to eventual situation for which the united state ought to be prepare the sum which have be previously accumulate in the treasury together with the receipt during the year end on the 30th of September last -lrb- and amount to more than $ 9000000 -rrb- have enable we to fulfill all we engagement and to defray the current expense of government without recur to any loan but the insecurity of we commerce and the consequent diminution of the public revenue will probably produce a deficiency in the receipt of the ensue year for which and for other detail i refer to the statement which will be transmit from the treasury in the state which have be present of we affair with the great party to a disastrous and protracted war carry on in a mode equally injurious and unjust to the united state as a neutral nation the wisdom of the national legislature will be again summon to the important decision on the alternative before they that these will be meet in a spirit worthy the council of a nation conscious both of its rectitude and of its rights and careful as well of its honor as of its peace i have a entire confidence and that the result will be stamp by a unanimity become the occasion and be support by every portion of we citizen with a patriotism enlighten and invigorate by experience ought as little to be doubt in the midst of the wrong and vexation experience from external cause there be much room for congratulation on the prosperity and happiness flow from we situation at home the blessing of health have never be more universal the fruit of the season though in particular article and district short of they usual redundancy be more than sufficient for we want and we comfort the face of we country everywhere present the evidence of laudable enterprise of extensive capital and of durable improvement in a cultivation of the material and the extension of useful manufacture more especially in the general application to household fabric we behold a rapid diminution of we dependence on foreign supplies nor be it unworthy of reflection that this revolution in we pursuit and habit be in no slight degree a consequence of those impolitic and arbitrary edict by which the contend nation in endeavor each of they to obstruct we trade with the other have so far abridged we means of procure the production and manufacture of which we own be now take the place recollect always that for every advantage which may contribute to distinguish we lot from that to which other be doom by the unhappy

the revocation of they be such that they cease at that date to violate we neutral commerce the fact as prescribe by law be announce by a proclamation bearing date the 2d day of November it would have well accord with the conciliatory view indicate by this proceeding on the part of france to have extend they to all the grounds of just complaint which now remain unadjusted with the united state it be particularly anticipate that as a further evidence of just disposition toward they restoration would have be immediately make of the property of we citizen seize under a misapplication of the principle of reprisal combine with a misconstruction of a law of the united state this expectation have not be fulfil from the british government no communication on the subject of the act have be receive to a communication from we minister at london of a revocation by the french government of its berlin and milan decree it be answer that the british system would be relinquish as soon as the

pledge although it do not necessarily import do not exclude the intention of relinquish along with the order in council the practice of those novel blockade which have a like effect of interrupt we neutral commerce and this further justice to the united state be the rather to be look for inasmuch as the blockade in question be not more contrary to the established law of nation than inconsistent with the rule of blockade formally recognize by great britain herself could have no alleged basis other than the plea of retaliation allege as the basis of the order in council under the modification of the original order of November 1807 into the order of April 1809 there be indeed scarcely a nominal distinction between the order and the blockade one of those illegitimate blockade bear date in

important subject depend between the united state and that government no progress have be make from which a early and satisfactory result can be rely on in this new posture of we relation with those power the consideration of congress will be properly turn to a removal of doubt which may occur in the exposition and of difficulty in the execution of the act above cite the commerce of the united state with the north of europe heretofore much vex by licentious cruiser particularly under the danish flag have latterly be visit with fresh and extensive depredation the measure pursue in behalf of we injured citizen not have obtain justice for they a further and more formal interposition with the danish government be contemplate the principle which have be maintain by that government in relation to neutral commerce and the friendly profession of he danish majesty toward the united state be valuable pledge in favor of a successful issue among the event grow out of the state of the spanish monarchy we attention be imperiously attract to the change develop itself in that portion of west florida which though of right appertaining to the united state have remain in the possession of spain await the result of negotiation for its actual delivery to they the spanish authority be subvert and a situation produce expose the country to ulterior event which might essentially affect the rights and welfare of the union in such a conjuncture i do not delay the interposition require for the occupancy of the territory west of the river perdido to which the title of the united state extend and to which the law provide for the territory of orlean be applicable with this view the proclamation of which a copy be lay before you be confide to the governor of that territory to be carry into effect the legality and necessity of the course pursue assure I of the favorable light in which it will present itself to the legislature and of the promptitude with which they will supply whatever provision may be due to the essential rights and equitable interest of the people thus bring into the bosom of the american family we amity with the power of barbary with the exception of a recent occurrence at tuni of which a explanation be just receive appear to have be uninterrupted and to have become more firmly establish with the indian tribe also the peace and friendship of the united state be find to be so eligible that the general disposition to preserve both continue to gain strength i feel particular satisfaction in remark that a interior view of we country present we with grateful proof of its substantial and increase prosperity to a thriving agriculture and the improvement relate to it be add a highly interesting extension of useful manufacture the combined product of professional occupation and of household industry such indeed be the experience of economy as well as of policy in these substitute for supplies heretofore obtain by foreign commerce that in a national view the change be justly regard as of itself more than a recompense for those privation and loss result from foreign injustice which furnish the general impulse require for its accomplishment how far it may be expedient to guard the infancy of this improvement in the distribution of labor by regulation of the commercial tariff be a subject which can not fail to suggest itself to you patriotic reflection it will rest with the consideration of congress also whether a provident as well as fair encouragement would not be give to we navigation by such regulation as would place it on a level of competition with foreign vessel particularly in transport the important and bulky production of we own soil the failure of equality and reciprocity in the exist regulation on this subject operate in we port as a premium to foreign competitor and the inconvenience must increase as these may be multiply under more favorable circumstance by the more than countervail encouragement now give they by the law of they respective country whilst it be universally admit that a well-instructed people alone can be permanently a free people and whilst it be evident that the means of diffusing and improve useful knowledge form so small a proportion of the expenditure for national purpose i can not presume it to be unseasonable to invite you attention to the advantage of superad to the means of education provide by the several state a seminary of learn institute by the national legislature within the limit of they exclusive jurisdiction the expense of which might be defray or reimburse out of the vacant grounds which have accrue to the nation within those limit such a institution though local in its legal character would be universal in its beneficial effect by enlighten the opinion by expand the patriotism and by assimilate the principle the sentiment and the manners of those who might resort to this temple of science to be redistribute in due time through every part of the community source of jealousy and prejudice would be diminish the feature of national character would be multiply and greater extent give to social harmony but above all a well-constituted seminary in the center of the nation be recommend by the consideration that the additional instruction emanate from it would contribute not less to strengthen the foundation than to adorn the structure of we free and happy system of government among the commercial abuse still commit under the american flag and leave in force my former reference to that subject it appear that american citizen be instrumental in carry on a traffic in enslaved african equally in violation of the law of humanity and in defiance of those of they own country the same just and benevolent motive which produce the interdiction in force against this criminal conduct will doubtless be feel by congress in devise further means of suppress the evil in the midst of uncertainty necessarily connect with the great interest of the united state prudence require a continuance of we defensive and precautionary arrangement the secretary of war and secretary of the navy will submit the statement and estimate which may aid congress in they ensue provision for the land and naval force the statement of the latter will include a view of the transfer of appropriation in the naval expenditure and the grounds on which they be make the fortification for the defense of we maritime frontier have be prosecute accord to the plan lay down in 1808 the work with some exception be complete and furnish with ordnance those for the security of the city of new york though far advance toward completion will require a further time and appropriation this be the case with a few other either not complete or in need of repair the improvement in quality and quantity make in the manufacture of cannon and small arm both at the public armory and private factory warrant additional confidence in the competency of these resource for supply the public exigency these preparation for arm the militia have thus far provide for one of the object contemplate by the power vest in congress with respect to that great bulwark of the public safety it be for they consideration whether further provision be not requisite for the other contemplated object of organization and discipline to give to this great mass of physical and moral force the efficiency which it merit and be capable of receive it be indispensable that they should be instruct and practice in the rule by which they be to be govern toward a accomplishment of this important work i recommend for the consideration of congress the expediency of institute a system which shall in the first instance call into the field at the public expense and for a give time certain portion of the commission and noncommissioned officer the instruction and discipline thus acquire would gradually diffuse through the entire body of the militia that practical knowledge and promptitude for active service which be the great end to be pursue experience have leave no doubt either of the necessity or of the efficacy of competent military skill in those portion of a army in fitting it for the final duty which it may have to perform the corps of engineer with the military academy be entitle to the early attention of congress the building at the seat fix by law for the present academy be so far in decay as not to afford the necessary accommodation but a revision of the law be recommend principally with a view to a more enlarged cultivation and diffusion of the advantage of such institution by provide professorship for all the necessary branch of military instruction and by the establishment of a additional academy at the seat of government or elsewhere the means by which war as well for defense as for offense be now carry on render these school of the more scientific operation a indispensable part of every adequate system even among nation whose large standing army and frequent war afford every other opportunity of instruction these establishment be find to be indispensable for the due attainment of the branch of military science which require a regular course of study and experiment in a government happily without the other opportunity seminary where the elementary principle of the art of war can be teach without actual war and without the expense of extensive and standing army have the precious advantage of unite a essential preparation against external danger with a scrupulous regard to internal safety in no other way probably can a provision of equal efficacy for the public defense be make at so little expense or more consistently with the public liberty the receipt into the treasury during the year end on the 30th of September last -lrb- and amount to more than $ 8500000 -rrb- have exceed the current expense of the government include the interest on the public debt for the purpose of reimburse at the end of the year $ 3750000 of the principal a loan as authorize by law have be negotiate to that amount but have since be reduce to $ 2750000 the reduction be permit by the state of the treasury in which there will be a balance remain at the end of the year estimate at $ 2000000 for the probable receipt of the next year and other detail i refer to statement which will be transmit from the treasury and which will enable you to judge what further provision may be necessary for the ensue year reserve for future occasion in the course of the session whatever other communication may claim you attention i close the present by express my reliance under the blessing of divine providence on the judgment and patriotism which will guide you measure at a period particularly call for unite council and inflexible exertion for the welfare of we country and by assure you of the fidelity and alacrity with which my cooperation will be afford jame madison special message December 12 1810 _ to the senate

intimate relation of the country adjoining the united state eastward of the river perdido to they security and tranquillity and the peculiar interest they otherwise have in its destiny i recommend to the consideration of congress the seasonableness of a declaration that the united state could not see without serious inquietude any part of a neighbor territory in which they have in different respects so deep and so just a concern pass from the hand of spain into those of any other foreign power i recommend to they consideration also the expediency of authorize the executive to take temporary possession of any part or part of the say territory in pursuance of arrangement which may be desire by the spanish authority and for make provision for the government of the same during such possession the wisdom of congress will at the same time determine how far it may be expedient to provide for the event of a subversion of the spanish authority within the territory in question and a

power toward this country which might the more unite the national council in the measure to be pursue at the close of the last session of congress it be hope that the successive confirmation of the extinction of the french decree so far as they violate we neutral commerce would have induce the government of great britain to repeal its order in council and thereby authorize a removal of the exist obstruction to she commerce with the united state instead of this reasonable step toward satisfaction and friendship between the two nation the order be at a moment when least to have be expect put into more rigorous execution and it be communicate through the british envoy just arrive that whilst the revocation of the edict of france as officially make know to the british government be deny to have take place it be a indispensable condition of the repeal of the british order that commerce should be restore to a footing that would admit the production and manufacture of great britain when own by neutral into market shut against they by she enemy the united state be give to understand that in the meantime a continuance of they non importation act would lead to measure of retaliation at a later date it have indeed appear that a communication to the british government of fresh evidence of the repeal of the french decree against we neutral trade be follow by a intimation that it have be transmit to the british plenipotentiary here in order that it might receive full consideration in the depend discussion this communication appear not to have be receive but the transmission of it hither instead of found on it a actual repeal of the order or assurance that the repeal would ensue will not permit we to rely on any effective change in the british cabinet to be ready to meet with cordiality satisfactory proof of such a change and to proceed in the meantime in adapt we measure to the view which have be disclose through that minister will best consult we whole duty in the unfriendly spirit of those disclosure indemnity and redress for other wrong have continue to be withhold and we coast and the mouth of we harbor have again witness scene not less derogatory to the dearest of we national rights than vexatious to the regular course of we trade among the occurrence produce by the conduct of british ship of war hover on we coast be a encounter between one of they and the american frigate command by captain rodger render unavoidable on the part of the latter by a fire commence without cause by the former whose commander be therefore alone chargeable with the

correspondence relate to the florida in which congress will be make acquaint with the interposition which the government of great britain have think proper to make against the proceeding of the united state the justice and fairness which have be evince on the part of the united state toward france both before and since the revocation of she decree authorize a expectation that she government would have follow up that measure by all such other as be due to we reasonable claim as well as dictate by its amicable profession no proof however be yet give of a intention to repair the other wrong do to the united state and particularly to restore the great amount of american property seize and condemn under edict which though not affect we neutral relation and therefore not enter into question between the united state and other belligerent be nevertheless found in such unjust principle that the reparation ought to have be prompt and ample in addition to this and other demand of strict right on that nation the united state have much reason to be dissatisfy with the rigorous and unexpected restriction to which they trade with the french dominion have be subject and which if not discontinue will require at least corresponding restriction on importation from france into the united state on all those subject we minister plenipotentiary lately send to paris have carry with he the necessary instruction the result of which will be communicate to you and by ascertain the ulterior policy of the french government toward the united state will enable you to adapt to it that of the united state toward france we other foreign relation remain without unfavorable change with russium they be on the best footing of friendship the port of sweden have afford proof of friendly disposition toward we commerce in the council of that nation also and the information from we special minister to denmark shew that the mission have be attend with valuable effect to we citizen whose property have be so extensively violate and endanger by cruiser under the danish flag under the ominous indication which command attention it become a duty to exert the means commit to the executive department in provide for the general security the work of defense on we maritime frontier have accordingly be prosecute with a activity leave little to be add for the completion of the most important one and as particularly suit for cooperation in emergency a portion of the gunboat have in particular harbor be order into use the ship of war before in commission with the addition of a frigate have be chiefly employ as a cruise guard to the rights of we coast and such a disposition have be make of we land force as be think to promise the service most appropriate and important in this disposition be include a force consist of regular and militia embody in the indiana territory and march toward we northwestern frontier this measure be make requisite by several murder and depredation commit by indian but more especially by the menacing preparation and aspect of a combination of they on the wabash under the influence and direction of a fanatic of the shawanese tribe with these exception the indian tribe retain they peaceable disposition toward we and they usual pursuit i must now add that the period be arrive which claim from the legislative guardian of the national rights a system of more ample provision for maintain they notwithstanding the scrupulous justice the protracted moderation and the multiply effort on the part of the united state to substitute for the accumulate danger to the peace of the two country all the mutual advantage of reestablish friendship and confidence we have see that the british cabinet persevere not only in withhold a remedy for other wrong so long and so loudly call for it but in the execution bring home to the threshold of we territory of measure which under exist circumstance have the character as well as the effect of war on we lawful commerce with this evidence of hostile inflexibility in trample on rights which no independent nation can relinquish congress will feel the duty of put the united state into a armor and a attitude demand by the crisis and correspond with the national spirit and expectation i recommend accordingly that adequate provision be make for fill the rank and prolong the enlistment of the regular troops for a auxiliary force to be engage for a more limited term for the acceptance of volunteer corps whose patriotic ardor may court a participation in urgent service for detachment as they may be want of other portion of the militia and for such a preparation of the great body as will proportion its usefulness to its intrinsic capacity nor can the occasion fail to remind you of the importance of those military seminary which in every event will form a valuable and frugal part of we military establishment the manufacture of cannon and small arm have proceed with due success and the stock and resource of all the necessary munitions be adequate to emergency it will not be inexpedient however for congress to authorize a enlargement of they you attention will of course be draw to such provision on the subject of we naval force as may be require for the service to which it may be best adapt i submit to congress the seasonableness also of a authority to augment the stock of such material as be imperishable in they nature or may not at once be attainable in contemplate the scene which distinguish this momentous epoch and estimate they claim to we attention it be impossible to overlook those develop themselves among the great community which occupy the southern portion of we own hemisphere and extend into we neighborhood a enlarged philanthropy and a enlighten forecast concur in impose on the national council a obligation to take a deep interest in they destiny to cherish reciprocal sentiment of good will to regard the progress of event and not to be unprepared for whatever order of thing may be ultimately establish under another aspect of we situation the early attention of congress will be due to the expediency of further guard against evasion and infraction of we commercial law the practice of smuggling which be odious everywhere and particularly criminal in free government where the law be make by all for the good of all a fraud be commit on every individual as well as on the state attain its utmost guilt when it blend with a pursuit of ignominious gain a treacherous subserviency in the transgressor to a foreign policy adverse to that of they own country it be then that the virtuous indignation of the public should be enable to manifest itself through the regular animadversion of the most competent law to secure greater respect to our-mercantile flag and to the honest interest which it cover it be expedient also that it be make punishable in we citizen to accept licens from foreign government for a trade unlawfully interdict by they to other american citizen or to trade under false color or papers of any sort a prohibition be equally call for against the acceptance by we citizen of special licens to be use in a trade with the united state and against the admission into particular port of the united state of vessel from foreign country authorize to trade with particular port only although other subject will press more immediately on you deliberation a portion of they can not but be well bestow on the just and sound policy of secure to we manufacture the success they have attain and be still attain in some degree under the impulse of cause not permanent and to we navigation the fair extent of which be at present abridged by the unequal regulation of foreign government besides the reasonableness of save we manufacture from sacrifice which a change of circumstance might bring on they the national interest require that with respect to such article at least as belong to we defense and we primary want we should not be leave in unnecessary dependence on external supplies and whilst foreign government adhere to the exist discrimination in they port against we navigation and a equality or lesser discrimination be enjoy by they navigation in we port the effect can not be mistaken because it have be seriously feel by we shipping interest and in proportion as this take place the advantage of a independent conveyance of we product to foreign market and of a grow body of mariner train by they occupation for the service of they country in time of danger must be diminish the receipt into the treasury during the year end on the 30th of September last have exceed $ 13500000 and have enable we to defray the current expense include the interest on the public debt and to reimburse more than $ 5000000 of the principal without recur to the loan authorize by the act of the last session the temporary loan obtain in the latter end of the year 1810 have also be reimburse and be not include in that amount the decrease of revenue arise from the situation of we commerce and the extraordinary expense which have and may become necessary must be take into view in make commensurate provision for the ensue year and i recommend to you consideration the propriety of insure a sufficiency of annual revenue at least to defray the ordinary expense of government and to pay the interest on the public debt include that on new loan which may be authorize i can not close this communication without express my deep sense of the crisis in which you be assemble my confidence in a wise and honorable result to you deliberation and assurance of the faithful zeal with which my cooperate duty will be discharge invoke at the same time the blessing of heaven on we beloved country and on all the means

british cruiser have be in the continue practice of violate the american flag on the great highway of nation and of seize and carry off person sail under it not in the exercise of a belligerent right found on the law of nation against a enemy but of a municipal prerogative over british subject british jurisdiction be thus extend to neutral vessel in a situation where no law can operate but the law of nation and the law of the country to which the vessel belong and a self-redress be assume which if british subject be wrongfully detain and alone concerned be that substitution of force for a resort to the responsible sovereign which fall within the definition of war could the seizure of british subject in such case be regard as within the exercise of a belligerent right the acknowledged law of war which forbid a article of capture property to be adjudge without a regular investigation before a competent tribunal would imperiously demand the fairest trial where the sacred rights of person be at issue in place of such a trial these rights be subject to the will of every petty commander the practice hence be so far from affect british subject alone that under the pretext of search for these thousand of american citizen under the safeguard of public law and of they national flag have be tear from they country and from everything dear to they have be drag on board ship of war of a foreign nation and expose under the severity of they discipline to be exile to the most distant and deadly clime to risk they life in the battle of they oppressor and to be the melancholy instrument of take away those of they own brethren against this cry enormity which great britain would be so prompt to avenge if commit against herself the united state have in vain exhaust remonstrance and expostulation and that no proof might be want of they conciliatory disposition and no pretext leave for a continuance of the practice the british government be formally assure of the readiness of the united state to enter into arrangement such as could not be reject if the recovery of british subject be the real and the sole object the communication pass without effect british cruiser have be in the practice also of violate the rights and the peace of we coast they hover over and harass we enter and depart commerce to the most insulting pretension they have add the most lawless proceedings in we very harbor and have wantonly spill american blood within the sanctuary of we territorial jurisdiction the principle and rule enforce by that nation when a neutral nation against armed vessel of belligerent hover near she coast and disturbing she commerce be well know when call on nevertheless by the united state to punish the greater offens commit by she own vessel she government have bestow on they commander additional mark of honor and confidence under pretended blockade without the presence of a adequate force and sometimes without the practicability of apply one we commerce have be plunder in every sea the great staple of we country have be cut off from they legitimate market and a destructive blow aim at we agricultural and maritime interest in aggravation of these predatory measure they have be consider as in force from the date of they notification a retrospective effect be thus add as have be do in other important case to the unlawfulness of the course pursue and to render the outrage the more signal these mock blockade have be reiterate and enforce in the face of official communication from the british government declare as the true definition of a legal blockade that particular port must be actually invest and previous warning give to vessel bind to they not to enter not content with these occasional expedient for lay waste we neutral trade the cabinet of britain resort at length to the sweeping system of blockade under the name of order in council which have be mold and manage as might best suit its political view its commercial jealousy or the avidity of british cruiser to we remonstrance against the complicated and transcendent injustice of this innovation the first reply be that the order be reluctantly adopt by great britain as a necessary retaliation on decree of she enemy proclaim a general blockade of the british isle at a time when the naval force of that enemy dare not issue from he own port she be remind without effect that she own prior blockade unsupported by a adequate naval force actually apply and continue be a bar to this plea that execute edict against million of we property could not be retaliation on edict confessedly impossible to be execute that retaliation to be just should fall on the party set the guilty example not on a innocent party which be not even chargeable with a acquiescence in it when deprive of this flimsy veil for a prohibition of we trade with she enemy by the repeal of he prohibition of we trade with great britain she cabinet instead of a corresponding repeal or a practical discontinuance of its order formally avow a determination to persist in they against the united state until the market of she enemy should be lay open to british product thus assert a obligation on a neutral power to require one belligerent to encourage by its internal regulation the trade of another belligerent contradict she own practice toward all nation in peace as well as in war and betray the insincerity of those profession which inculcate a belief that have resort to she order with regret she be anxious to find a occasion for put a end to they abandon still more all respect for the neutral rights of the united state and for its own consistency the british government now demand as prerequisite to a repeal of its order as they relate to the united state that a formality should be observe in the repeal of the french decree nowise necessary to they termination nor exemplify by british usage and that the french repeal besides include that portion of the decree which operate within a territorial jurisdiction as well as that which operate on the high sea against the commerce of the united state should not be a single and special repeal in relation to the united state but should be extend to whatever other neutral nation unconnected with they may be affect by those decree and as a additional insult they be call on for a formal disavowal of condition and pretension advance by the french government for which the united state be so far from have make themselves responsible that in official explanation which have be publish to the world and in a correspondence of the american minister at london with the british minister for foreign affair such a responsibility be explicitly and emphatically disclaim it have become indeed sufficiently certain that the commerce of the united state be to be sacrifice not as interfere with the belligerent rights of great britain not as supply the want of she enemy which she herself supplies but as interfere with the monopoly which she covet for she own commerce and navigation she carry on a war against the lawful commerce of a friend that she may the better carry on a commerce with a enemy -- a commerce polluted by the forgery and perjury which be for the most part the only passport by which it can succeed anxious to make every experiment short of the last resort of injured nation the united state have withhold from great britain under successive modification the benefit of a free intercourse with they market the loss of which could not but outweigh the profit accrue from she restriction of we commerce with other nation and to entitle these experiment to the more favorable consideration they be so frame as to enable she to place she adversary under the exclusive operation of they to these appeal she government have be equally inflexible as if willing to make sacrifice of every sort rather than yield to the claim of justice or renounce the error of a false pride nay so far be the attempt carry to overcome the attachment of the british cabinet to its unjust edict that it receive every encouragement within the competency of the executive branch of we government to expect that a repeal of they would be follow by a war between the united state and france unless the french edict should also be repeal even this communication although silencing forever the plea of a disposition in the united state to acquiesce in those edict originally the sole plea for they receive no attention if no other proof exist of a predetermination of the british government against a repeal of its order it might be find in the correspondence of the minister plenipotentiary of the united state at london and the british secretary for foreign affair in 1810 on the question whether the blockade of may 1806 be consider as in force or as not in force it have be ascertain that the french government which urge this blockade as the ground of its berlin decree be willing in the event of its removal to repeal that decree which be follow by alternate repeal of the other offensive edict might abolish the whole system on both side this invite opportunity for accomplish a object so important to the united state and profess so often to be the desire of both the belligerent be make know to the british government as that government admit that a actual application of a adequate force be necessary to the existence of a legal blockade and it be notorious that if such a force have ever be apply its long discontinuance have annul the blockade in question there could be no sufficient objection on the part of great britain to a formal revocation of it and no imaginable objection to a declaration of the fact that the blockade do not exist the declaration would have be consistent with she avowed principle of blockade and would have enable the united state to demand from france the pledge repeal of she decree either with success in which case the way would have be open for a general repeal of the belligerent edict or without success in which case the united state would have be justify in turn they measure exclusively against france the british government would however neither rescind the blockade nor declare its nonexistence nor permit its nonexistence to be infer and affirm by the american plenipotentiary on the contrary by represent the blockade to be comprehend in the order in council the united state be compel so to regard it in they subsequent proceedings there be a period when a favorable change in the policy of the british cabinet be justly consider as establish the minister plenipotentiary of he britannic majesty here propose a adjustment of the difference more immediately endanger the harmony of the two country the proposition be accept with the promptitude and cordiality corresponding with the invariable profession of this government a foundation appear to be lay for a sincere and lasting reconciliation the prospect however quickly vanish the whole proceeding be disavow by the british government without any explanation which could at that time repress the belief that the disavowal proceed from a spirit of hostility to the commercial rights and prosperity of the united state and it have since come into proof that at the very moment when the public minister be hold the language of friendship and inspiring confidence in the sincerity of the negotiation with which he be charge a secret agent of he government be employ in intrigue have for they object a subversion of we government and a dismemberment of we happy union in review the conduct of great britain toward the united state we attention be necessarily draw to the warfare just renew by the savage on one of we extensive frontier -- a warfare which be know to spare neither age nor sex and to be distinguish by feature peculiarly shocking to humanity it be difficult to account for the activity and combination which have for some time be develop themselves among tribe in constant intercourse with british trader and garrison without connect they hostility with that influence and without recollect the authenticate example of such interposition heretofore furnish by the officer and agent of that government such be the spectacle of injury and indignity which have be heap on we country and such the crisis which its unexampled forbearance and conciliatory effort have not be able to avert it might at least have be expect that a enlighten nation if less urge by moral obligation or invite by friendly disposition on the part of the united state would have find in its true interest alone a sufficient motive to respect they rights and they tranquillity on the high sea that a enlarged policy would have favor that free and general circulation of commerce in which the british nation be at all time interested and which in time of war be the best alleviation of its calamity to herself as well as to other belligerent and more especially that the british cabinet would not for the sake of a precarious and surreptitious intercourse with hostile market have persevere in a course of measure which necessarily put at hazard the invaluable market of a great and grow country dispose to cultivate the mutual advantage of a active commerce other counsel have prevail we moderation and conciliation have have no other effect than to encourage perseverance and to enlarge pretension we behold we seafaring citizen still the daily victim of lawless violence commit on the great common and highway of nation even within sight of the country which owe they protection we behold we vessel freight with the product of we soil and industry or return with the honest proceeds of they wrest from they lawful destination confiscate by prize court no longer the organ of public law but the instrument of arbitrary edict and they unfortunate crew disperse and lose or force or inveigle in british port into british fleet whilst argument be employ in support of these aggression which have no foundation but in a principle equally support a claim to regulate we external commerce in all case whatsoever we behold in fine on the side of great britain a state of war against the united state and on the side of the united state a state of peace toward great britain whether the united state shall continue passive under these progressive usurpation and these accumulate wrong or oppose force to force in defense of they national rights shall commit a just cause into the hand of the almighty disposer of event avoid all connection which might entangle it in the contest or view of other power and preserve a constant readiness to concur in a honorable reestablishment of peace and friendship be a solemn question which the constitution wisely confide to the legislative department of the government in recommend it to they early deliberation i be happy in the assurance that the decision will be worthy the enlighten and patriotic council of a virtuous a free and a powerful nation have present this view of the relation of the united state with great britain and of the solemn alternative grow out of they i proceed to remark that the communication last make to congress on the subject of we relation with france will have shewn that since the revocation of she decree as they violate the neutral rights of the united state she government have authorize illegal capture by its privateer and public ship and that other outrage have be practice on we vessel and we citizen it will have be see also that no indemnity have be provide or satisfactorily pledge for the extensive spoliation commit under the violent and retrospective order of the french government against the property of we citizen seize within the jurisdiction of france i abstain at this time from recommend to the consideration of congress definitive measure with respect to that nation in the expectation that the result of unclosed discussion between we minister plenipotentiary at paris and the french government will speedily enable congress to decide with greater advantage on the course due to the rights the interest and the honor of we country jame madison June 30 1812 _ to the senate and

sorry to have to state that the measure which you appear to have adopt for obtain possession of amelium island and other part of bast florida be not authorize by the law of the united state or the instruction found on it under which you have act you be authorize by the law a copy of which be communicate to you and by you instruction which be strictly conformable to it to take possession of east florida only in case one of the follow contingency should happen : either that the governor or other exist local authority should be dispose to place it amicably in the hand of the united state or that a attempt should be make to take possession of it by a foreign power should the first contingency happen it would follow that the arrangement be amicable would require no force on the part of the united state to carry it into effect it be only in case of a attempt to take it by a foreign power that force could be necessary in which event only be you authorize to avail yourself of it in neither of these contingency be it the policy of the law or purpose of the executive to wrest the province forcibly from spain but only to occupy it with a view to prevent its fall into the hand of any foreign power and to hold that pledge under the exist peculiarity of the circumstance of the spanish monarchy for a just result in a amicable negotiation with spain have the united state be dispose to proceed otherwise that intention would have be manifest by a change of the law and suitable measure to carry it into effect and as it be in they power to take possession whenever they might think that circumstance authorize and require it it would be the more to be regret if possession should be effect by any means irregular in themselves and subject the government of the united state to unmerited censure the view of the executive respect east florida be further illustrate by you instruction as to west florida although the united state have think that they have a good title to the latter province they do not take possession until after the spanish authority have be subvert by a revolutionary proceeding and the contingency of the country be throw into foreign hand have force itself into view nor do they then nor have they since dispossess the spanish troops of the post which they occupy if they do not think proper to take possession by force of a province to which they think they be justly entitle it could not be presume that they should intend to act differently in respect to one to which they have not such a claim i may add that although due sensibility have be always feel for the injury which be receive from the spanish government in the last war the present situation of spain have be a motive for a moderate and pacific policy toward she in communicate to you these sentiment of the executive on the measure you have lately adopt for take possession of east florida i add with pleasure that the utmost confidence be repose in you integrity and zeal to promote the welfare of you country to that zeal the error into which you have fall be imputed but in consideration of the part which you have take which differ so essentially from that contemplated and authorize by the government and contradict so entirely the principle on which it have uniformly and sincerely act you will be sensible of the necessity of discontinue the service in which you have be employ you will therefore consider you power as revoke on the receipt of this letter the new duty to be perform will be transfer to the governor of georgium to whom instruction will be give on all the

importance to the united state circumstance with which you be in some degree acquaint but which will be fully explain by the inclosed papers have make it necessary to revoke the power heretofore commit to general matthew and to commit they to you the president be persuade that you will not hesitate to undertake a trust so important to the nation and peculiarly to the state of georgium he be the more confident in this belief from the consideration that these new duty may be discharge without interfere as he presume with those of the station which you now hold by the act of the 15th of January 1811 you will observe that it be not contemplate to take possession of east florida or any part thereof unless it should be surrender to the united state amicably by the governor or other local authority of the province or against a attempt to take possession of it by a foreign power and you will also see that general matthew 's instruction of which a copy be likewise inclose correspond fully with the law by the document in possession of the government it appear that neither of these contingency have happen that instead of a amicable surrender by the governor or other local authority the troops of the united state have be use to dispossess the spanish authority by force i forbear to dwell on the detail of this transaction because it be painful to recite they by the letter to general matthew which be inclose open for you perusal you will fully comprehend the view of the government respect the late transaction and by the law the former instruction to the general

east florida as may have be take possession of in the name of the united state there be another object to which you particular attention will be due in the measure lately adopt by general matthew to take possession of that territory it be probable that much reliance have be place by the people who act in it on the countenance and support of the united state it will be improper to expose these

respect it of this assurance you will duly apprise the party interested and of the confidence which you repose in it it be hope that on this delicate and very interesting point the spanish governor

united state in case of the absence or disability of the judge thereof which bill be present to I on the 25th of march past i now return the same to the house of representative in which it originate with the follow objection : because the additional service impose by the bill on the justice of the supreme court of the united state be to be perform by they rather in the quality of other judge of other court namely judge of the district court than in the quality of justice of the supreme court they be to hold the say district court and to do and perform all act relate to the say court which be by law require of the district judge the bill therefore virtually appoint for the time the justice of the supreme court to other distinct office to which if compatible with they original office they ought to be appoint by another than the legislative authority in pursuance of legislative provision authorize the appointment because the appeal allow by law for the decision of the district court to the circuit court whilst it corroborate the construction which regard a judge of one court as clothe with a new office by be constitute a judge of the other submit for correction erroneous judgment not to superior or other judge but to the err individual himself act as sole judge in the appellate court because the additional service to be require may by distance of place and by the casualty contemplate by the bill become disproportionate to the strength and health of the justice who be to perform they the additional service be moreover entitle to no additional compensation nor the additional expense incur to reimbursement in this view the bill appear to be contrary to equity as well as a precedent for modification and extension of judicial service encroach on the constitutional tenure of judicial office because by refer to the president of the united state question of disability in the district judge and of the unreasonableness of delay the suit or cause pend in the district court and leave it with he in such cause to require the justice of the supreme court to perform additional service the bill introduce a unsuitable relation of member of the judiciary department to a

which the earth have reward the labor bestow on it in the successful cultivation of other branch of industry and in the progress of general improvement favorable to the national prosperity there be just occasion also for we mutual congratulation and thankfulness with these blessing be necessarily mingle the pressure and vicissitude incident to the state of war into which the united state have be force by the perseverance of a foreign power in its system of injustice and aggression previous to its declaration it be deem proper as a measure of precaution and forecast that a considerable force should be place in the michigan territory with a general view to its security and in the event of war to such operation in the uppermost canada as would intercept the hostile influence of great britain over the savage obtain the command of the lake on which that part of canada border and maintain cooperate relation with such force as might be most conveniently employ against other part brigadier-general hull be charge with this provisional service have under he command a body of troops compose of regular and of volunteer from the state of ohio have reach he destination after he knowledge of the war and possess discretionary authority to act offensively he pass into the neighbor territory of the enemy with a prospect of easy and victorious progress the expedition nevertheless terminate unfortunately not only in a retreat to the town and fort of detroit but in the surrender of both and of the gallant corps command by that officer the cause of this painful reverse will be investigate by a military tribunal a distinguish feature in the operation which precede and follow this adverse event be the use make by the enemy of the merciless savage under they influence whilst the benevolent policy of the united state invariably recommend peace and promote civilization among that wretched portion of the human race and be make exertion to dissuade they from take either side in the war the enemy have not scruple to call to he aid they ruthless ferocity arm with the horror of those instrument of carnage and torture which be know to spare neither age nor sex in this outrage against the law of honorable war and against the feeling sacred to humanity the british commander can not resort to a plea of retaliation for it be commit in the face of we example they can not mitigate it by call it a self-defense against man in arm for it embrace the most shocking butchery of defenseless family nor can it be pretend that they be not answerable for the atrocity perpetrate since the savage be employ with a knowledge and even with menace that they fury could not be control such be the spectacle which the depute authority of a nation boast its religion and morality have not be restrain from present to a enlighten age the misfortune at detroit be not however without a consoling effect it be follow by signal proof that the national spirit rise accord to the pressure on it the loss of a important post and of the brave man surrender with it inspire everywhere new ardor and determination in the state and district least remote it be no sooner known than every citizen be ready to fly with he arm at once to protect he brethren against the bloodthirsty savage let loose by the enemy on a extensive frontier and to convert a partial calamity into a source of invigorated effort this patriotic zeal which it be necessary rather to limit than excite have embody a ample force from the state of kentucky and ohio and from part of pennsylvanium and virginium it be place with the addition of a few regular under the command of brigadier-general harrison who possess the entire confidence of he fellow-soldier among whom be citizen some of they volunteer in the rank not less distinguish by they political station than by they personal merit the greater portion of this force be proceed on its destination toward the michigan territory have succeed in relieve a important frontier post and in several incidental operation against hostile tribe of savage render indispensable by the subserviency into which they have be seduce by the enemy -- a seduction the more cruel as it could not fail to impose a necessity of precautionary severity against those who yield to it at a recent date a attack be make on a post of the enemy near niagara by a detachment of the regular and other force under the command of major-general van rensselaer of the militia of the state of new york the attack it appear be order in compliance with the ardor of the troops who execute it with distinguish gallantry and be for a time victorious but not receive the expected support they be compel to yield to reenforcement of british regular and savage we loss have be considerable and be deeply to be lament that of the enemy less ascertain will be the more feel as it include among the kill the commanding general who be also the governor of the province and be sustain by veteran troops from unexperienced soldier who must daily improve in the duty of the field we expectation of gain the command of the lake by the invasion of canada from detroit have be disappointed measure be instantly take to provide on they a naval force superior to that of the enemy from the talent and activity of the officer charge with this object everything that can be do may be expect should the present season not admit of complete success the progress make will insure for the next a naval ascendency where it be essential to we permanent peace with and control over the savage among the incident to the measure of the war i be constrain to advert to the refusal of the governor of massachusett and connecticut to furnish the require detachment of militia toward the defense of the maritime frontier the refusal be found on a novel and unfortunate exposition of the provision of the constitution relate to the militia the correspondence which will be lay before you contain the requisite information on the subject it be obvious that if the authority of the united state to call into service and command the militia for the public defense can be thus frustrated even in a state of declare war and of course under apprehension of invasion precede war they be not one nation for the purpose most of all require it and that the public safety may have no other resource than in those large and permanent military establishment which be forbid by the principle of we free government and against the necessity of which the militia be mean to be a constitutional bulwark on the coast and on the ocean the war have be as successful as circumstance inseparable from its early stage could promise we public ship and private cruiser by they activity and where there be occasion by they intrepidity have make the enemy sensible of the difference between a reciprocity of capture and the long confinement of they to they side we trade with little exception have safely reach we port have be much favor in it by the course pursue by a squadron of we frigate under the command of commodore rodger and in the instance in which skill and bravery be more particularly try with those of the enemy the american flag have a auspicious triumph the frigate _ constitution _ command by captain hull after a close and short engagement completely disabled and capture a british frigate gain for that officer and all on board a praise which can not be too liberally bestow not merely for the victory actually achieve but for that prompt and cool exertion of command talent which give to courage its highest character and to the force apply its full effect prove that more could have be do in a contest require more anxious to abridge the evil from which a state of war can not be exempt i lose no time after it be declare in convey to the british government the term on which its progress might be arrest without await the delay of a formal and final pacification and we charg d'affaire at london be at the same time authorize to agree to a armistice found upon they these term require that the order in council should be repeal as they affect the united state without a revival of blockade violate acknowledged rule and that there should be a immediate discharge of american seaman from british ship and a stop to impressment from american ship with a understanding that a exclusion of the seaman of each nation from the ship of the other should be stipulate and that the armistice should be improve into a definitive and comprehensive adjustment of depend controversy although a repeal of the order susceptible of explanation meet the view of this government have take place before this pacific advance be communicate to that of great britain the advance be decline from a avowed repugnance to a suspension of the practice of impressment during the armistice and without any intimation that the arrangement propose with respect to seaman would be accept whether the subsequent communication from this government afford a occasion for reconsider the subject on the part of great britain will be view in a more favorable light or receive in a more accommodate spirit remain to be know it would be unwise to relax we measure in any respect on a presumption of such a result the document from the department of state which relate to this subject will give a view also of the proposition for a armistice which have be receive here one of they from the authority at halifax and in canada the other from the british government itself through admiral warren and of the grounds on which neither of they could be accept we affair with france retain the posture which they hold at my last communication to you notwithstanding the authorize expectation of a early as well as favorable issue to the discussion on foot these have be procrastinate to the latest date the only intervene occurrence merit attention be the promulgation of a french decree purport to be a definitive repeal of the berlin and milan decree this proceeding although make the ground of the repeal of the british order in council be render by the time and manner of it liable to many objection the final communication from we special minister to denmark afford further proof of the good effect of he mission and of the amicable disposition of the danish government from russium we have the satisfaction to receive assurance of continued friendship and that it will not be affect by the rupture between the united state and great britain sweden also profess sentiment favorable to the subsist harmony with the barbary power except that of algier we affair remain on the ordinary foot the consul-general reside with that regency have suddenly and without cause be banish together with all the american citizen find there whether this be the transitory effect of capricious despotism or the first act of predetermined hostility be not ascertain precaution be take by the consul on the latter supposition the indian tribe not under foreign instigation remain at peace and receive the civilizing attention which have prove so beneficial to they with a view to that vigorous prosecution of the war to which we national faculty be adequate the attention of congress will be particularly draw to the insufficiency of exist provision for fill up the military establishment such be the happy condition of we country arise from the facility of subsistence and the high wages for every species of occupation that notwithstanding the augmented inducement provide at the last session a partial success only have attend the recruiting service the deficiency have be necessarily supply during the campaign by other than regular troops with all the inconvenience and expense incident to they the remedy lie in establish more favorably for the private soldier the proportion between he recompense and the term of he enlistment and it be a subject which can not too soon or too seriously be take into consideration the same insufficiency have be experience in the provision for volunteer make by a act of the last session the recompense for the service require in this case be still less attractive than in the other and although patriotism alone have send into the field some valuable corps of that description those alone who can afford the sacrifice can be reasonably expect to yield to that impulse it will merit consideration also whether as auxiliary to the security of we frontier corps may not be advantageously organize with a restriction of they service to particular district convenient to they and whether the local and occasional service of mariner and other in the seaport town under a similar organization would not be a provident addition to the means of they defense i recommend a provision for a increase of the general officer of the army the deficiency of which have be illustrate by the number and distance of separate command which the course of the war and the advantage of the service have require and i can not press too strongly on the earliest attention of the legislature the importance of the reorganization of the staff establishment with a view to render more distinct and definite the relation and responsibility of its several department that there be room for improvement which will materially promote both economy and success in what appertain to the army and the war be equally inculcate by the example of other country and by the experience of we own a revision of the militia law for the purpose of render they more systematic and better adapt they to emergency of the war be at this time particularly desirable of the additional ship authorize to be fit for service two will be shortly ready to sail a third be under repair and delay will be avoid in the repair of the residue of the appropriation for the purchase of material for shipbuilding the greater part have be apply to that object and the purchase will be continue with the balance the enterprising spirit which have characterize we naval force and its success both in restrain insult and depredation on we coast and in reprisal on the enemy will not fail to recommend a enlargement of it there be reason to believe that the act prohibit the acceptance of british licens be not a sufficient guard against the use of they for purpose favorable to the interest and view of the enemy further provision on that subject be highly important nor be it less so that penal enactment should be provide for case of corrupt and perfidious intercourse with the enemy not amount to treason nor yet embrace by any statutory provision a considerable number of american vessel which be in england when the revocation of the order in council take place be laden with british manufacture under a erroneous impression that the nonimportation act would immediately cease to operate and have arrive in the united state it do not appear proper to exercise on unforeseen case of such magnitude the ordinary power vest in the treasury department to mitigate forfeiture without previously afford to congress a opportunity of make on the subject such provision as they may think proper in they decision they will doubtless equally consult what be due to equitable consideration and to the public interest the receipt into the treasury during the year end on the 30th of September last have exceed $ 16500000 which have be sufficient to defray all the demand on the treasury to that day include a necessary reimbursement of near three million of the principal of the public debt in these receipt be include a sum of near $ 5850000 receive on account of the loan authorize by the act of the last session the whole sum actually obtain on loan amount to $ 11000000 the residue of which be receivable subsequent to the 30th of September last will together with the current revenue enable we to defray all the expense of this year the duty on the late unexpected importation of british manufacture will render the revenue of the ensue year more productive than could have be anticipate the situation of we country fellow-citizen be not without its difficulty though it abound in animate consideration of which the view here present of we pecuniary resource be a example with more than one nation we have serious and unsettled controversy and with one powerful in the means and habit of war we be at war the spirit and strength of the nation be nevertheless equal to the support of all its rights and to carry it through all its trial they can be meet in that confidence above all we have the inestimable consolation of know that the war in which we be actually engage be a war neither of ambition nor of vainglory that it be wage not in violation of the rights of other but in the maintenance of we own that it be precede by a patience without example under wrong accumulate without end and that it be finally not declare until every hope of avert it be extinguish by the transfer of the british scepter into new hand cling to former council and until declaration be reiterate to the last hour through the british envoy here that the hostile edict against we commercial rights and we maritime independence would not be revoke nay that they could not be revoke without violate the obligation of great britain to other power as well as to she own interest to have shrink under such circumstance from manly resistance would have be a degradation blast we best and proudest hope it would have strike we from the high rank where the virtuous struggle of we father have place we and have betray the magnificent legacy which we hold in trust for future generation it would have acknowledge that on the element which form three-fourth of the globe we inhabit and where all independent nation have equal and common rights the american people be not a independent people but colonist and vassal it be at this moment and with such a alternative that war be choose the nation feel the necessity of it and call for it the appeal be accordingly make in a just cause to the just and all-powerful be who hold in he hand the chain of event and the destiny of nation it remain only that faithful to ourselves entangled in no connection with the view of other power and ever ready to accept peace from the hand of justice we prosecute the war with unite counsel and with the ample faculty

accompany by a circular instruction to the colonial governor which confines license importation from port of the united state to the port of the eastern state exclusively the government of great britain have already introduce into she commerce during war a system which at once violate the rights of other nation and rest on a mass of forgery and perjury unknown to other time be make a unfortunate progress in undermine those principle of morality and religion which be the best foundation of national happiness the policy now proclaim to the world introduce into she mode of warfare a system equally distinguish by the deformity of its feature and the depravity of its character have for its object to dissolve the tie of allegiance and the sentiment of loyalty in the adversary nation and to seduce and separate its component part the one from the other the general tendency of these demoralizing and disorganizing contrivance will be reprobate by the civilized and christian world and the insulting attempt on the virtue the honor the patriotism and the fidelity of we brethren of the eastern state will not fail to call forth all they indignation and resentment and to attach more and more all the state to that happy union and constitution against which such insidious and malignant artifice be direct the better to guard nevertheless against the effect of individual cupidity and treachery and to turn the corrupt project of the enemy against himself i recommend to the consideration of congress the expediency of a effectual prohibition of any trade whatever by citizen or

of so distinguish a confidence and of the responsibility unite with it the impression on I be strengthen by such a evidence that my faithful endeavor to discharge my arduous duty have be favorably estimate and by a consideration of the momentous period at which the trust have be renew from the weight and magnitude now belong to it i should be compel to shrink if i have less reliance on the support of a enlighten and generous people and feel less deeply a conviction that the war with a powerful nation which form so prominent a feature in we situation be stamp with that justice which invite the smile of heaven on the means of conduct it to a successful termination may we not cherish this sentiment without presumption when we reflect on the character by which this war be distinguish it be not declare on the part of the united state until it have be long make on they in reality though not in name until argument and expostulation have be exhaust until a positive declaration have be receive that the wrong provoke it would not be discontinue nor until this last appeal could no longer be delay without break down the spirit of the nation destroy all confidence in itself and in its political institution and either perpetuate a state of disgraceful suffering or regain by more costly sacrifice and more severe struggle we lose rank and respect among independent power on the issue of the war be stake we national sovereignty on the high sea and the security of a important class of citizen whose occupation give the proper value to those of every other class not to contend for such a stake be to surrender we equality with other power on the element common to all and to violate the sacred title which every member of the society have to its protection i need not call into view the unlawfulness of the practice by which we mariner be force at the will of every cruise officer from they own vessel into foreign one nor paint the outrage inseparable from it the proof be in the record of each successive administration of we government and the cruel suffering of that portion of the american people have find they way to every bosom not dead to the sympathy of human nature as the war be just in its origin and necessary and noble in its object we can reflect with a proud satisfaction that in carry it on no principle of justice or honor no usage of civilized nation no precept of courtesy or humanity have be infringe the war have be wage on we part with scrupulous regard to all these obligation and in a spirit of liberality which be never surpass how little have be the effect of this example on the conduct of the enemy they have retain as prisoner of war citizen of the united state not liable to be so consider under the usage of war they have refuse to consider as prisoner of war and threaten to punish as traitor and deserter person emigrate without restraint to the united state incorporate by naturalization into we political family and fight under the authority of they adopt country in open and honorable war for the maintenance of its rights and safety such be the avowed purpose of a government which be in the practice of naturalize by thousand citizen of other country and not only of permit but compelling they to fight its battle against they native country they have not it be true take into they own hand the hatchet and the knife devote to indiscriminate massacre but they have let loose the savage arm with these cruel instrument have allure they into they service and carry they to battle by they side eager to glut they savage thirst with the blood of the vanquish and to finish the work of torture and death on maim and defenseless captive and what be never before see british commander have extort victory over the unconquerable valor of we troops by present to the sympathy of they chief captive await massacre from they savage associate and now we find they in further contempt of the mode of honorable warfare supply the place of a conquer force by attempt to disorganize we political society to dismember we confederated republic happily like other these will recoil on the author but they mark the degenerate counsel from which they emanate and if they do not belong to a series of unexampled inconsistency might excite the greater wonder as proceed from a government which found the very war in which it have

would be resheathe still more precise advance be repeat and have be receive in a spirit forbid every reliance not place on the military resource of the nation these resource be amply sufficient to bring the war to a honorable issue we nation be in number more than half that of the british isle it be compose of a brave a free a virtuous and a intelligent people we country abound in the necessaries the art and the comfort of life a general prosperity be visible in the public countenance the means employ by the british cabinet to undermine it have recoil on themselves have give to we national faculty a more rapid development and drain or divert the precious metal from british circulation and british vault have pour they into those of the united state it be a propitious consideration that a unavoidable war should have find this seasonable facility for the contribution require to support it when the public voice call for war all know and still know that without they it could not be carry on through the period which it might last and the patriotism the good sense and the manly spirit of we fellow-citizen be pledge for the cheerfulness with which they will bear

part of the united state time only can decide that the sentiment of great britain toward that sovereign will have produce a acceptance of he offer mediation must be presume that no adequate motive exist to prefer a continuance of war with the united state to the term on which they be willing to close it be certain the british cabinet also must be sensible that with respect to the important question of impressment on which the war so essentially turn a search for or seizure of british person or property on board neutral vessel on the high sea be not a belligerent right derive from the law of nation and it be obvious that no visit or search or use of force for any purpose on board the vessel of one independent power on the high sea can in war or peace be sanction by the law or authority of another power it be equally obvious that for the purpose of preserve to each state its seafaring member by exclude they from the vessel of the other the mode heretofore propose by the united state and now enact by they as a article of municipal policy can not for a moment be compare with the mode practice by great britain without a conviction of its title to preference inasmuch as the latter leave the discrimination between the mariner of the two nation to officer expose by unavoidable bias as well as by a defect of evidence to a wrong decision under circumstance preclude for the most part the enforcement of control penalty and where a wrong decision besides the irreparable violation of the sacred rights of person might frustrate the plan and profit of entire voyage whereas the mode assume by the united state guard with study fairness and efficacy against error in such case and avoid the effect of casual error on the safety of navigation and the success of mercantile expedition if the reasonableness of expectation draw from these consideration could guarantee they fulfillment a just peace would not be distant but it become the wisdom of the national legislature to keep in mind the true policy or rather the indispensable obligation of adapt its measure to the supposition that the only course to that happy event be in the vigorous employment of the resource of war and painful as the reflection be this duty be particularly enforce by the spirit and manner in which the war continue to be wage by the enemy who uninfluence by the unvaried example of humanity set they be add to the savage fury of it on one frontier a system of plunder and conflagration on the other equally forbid by respect for national character and by the established rule of civilized warfare as a encouragement to persevere and invigorated exertion to bring the contest to a happy result i have the satisfaction of be able to appeal to the auspicious progress of we arm both by land and on the water in continuation of the brilliant achievement of we infant navy a signal triumph have be gain by captain lawrence and he companion in the _ hornet _ sloop of war which destroy a british sloop of war with a celerity so unexampled and with a slaughter of the enemy so disproportionate to the loss in the _ hornet _ as to claim for the conqueror the highest praise and the full recompense provide by congress in precede case we public ship of war in general as well as the private armed vessel have continue also they activity and success against the commerce of the enemy and by they vigilance and address have greatly frustrated the effort of the hostile squadron distribute along we coast to intercept they in return into port and resume they cruise the augmentation of we naval force as authorize at the last session of congress be in progress on the lake we superiority be near at hand where it be not already establish the event of the campaign so far as they be know to we furnish matter of congratulation and show that under a wise organization and efficient direction the army be destine to a glory not less brilliant than that which already encircle the navy the attack and capture of york be in that quarter a presage of future and greater victory while on the western frontier the issue of the late siege of fort meig leave we nothing to regret but a single act of inconsiderate valor the provision last make for fill the rank and enlarge the staff of the army have have the best effect it will be for the consideration of congress whether other provision depend on they authority may not still further improve the military establishment and the means of defense the sudden death of the distinguished citizen who represent the united state in france without any special arrangement by he for such a contingency have leave we without the expect sequel to he last communication nor have the french government take any measure for bring the depend negotiation to a conclusion through its representative in the united state this failure add to delay before so unreasonably spin out a successor to we deceased minister have be appoint and be ready to proceed on he mission the course which he will pursue in fulfil it be that prescribe by a steady regard to the true interest of the united state which equally avoid a abandonment of they just demand and a connection of they fortune with the system of other power the receipt in the treasury from the 1st of October to the 31st day of march last include the sum receive on account of treasury note and of the loan authorize by the act of the last and the precede session of congress have amount to $ 15412000 the expenditure during the same period amount to $ 15920000 and leave in the treasury on the 1st of April the sum of $ 1857000 the loan of $ 16000000 authorize by the act of the 8th of February last have be contract for of that sum more than $ 1000000 have be pay into the treasury prior to the 1st of April and form a part of the receipt as above state the remainder of that loan amount to near $ 15000000 with the sum of $ 5000000 authorize to be issue in treasury note and the estimate receipt from the custom and the sale of public land amount to $ 9300000 and make in the whole $ 29300000 to be receive during the last nine month of the present year will be necessary to meet the expenditure already authorize and the engagement contract in relation to the public debt these engagement amount during that period to $ 10500000 which with near one million for the civil miscellaneous and diplomatic expense both foreign and domestic and $ 17800000 for the military and naval expenditure include the ship of war building and to be build will leave a sum in the treasury at the end of the present year equal to that on the 1st of April last a part of this sum may be consider as a resource for defray any extraordinary expense already authorize by law beyond the sum above estimate and a further resource for any emergency may be find in the sum of $ 1000000 the loan of which to the united state have be authorize by the state of pennsylvanium but which have not yet be bring into effect this view of we finances whilst it show that due provision have be make for the expense of the current year show at the same time by the limited amount of the actual revenue and the dependence on loan the necessity of provide more adequately for the future supplies of the treasury this can be best do by a well-digested system of internal revenue in aid of exist source which will have the effect both of abridge the amount of necessary loan and on that account as well as by place the public credit on a more satisfactory basis of improve the term on which loan may be obtain the loan of sixteen million be not contract for at a less interest than about 71\/2 per cent and although other cause may have have a agency it can not be doubt that with the advantage of a more extended and less precarious revenue a lower rate of interest might have suffice a longer postponement of this advantage could not fail to have a still greater influence on future loan in recommend to the national legislature this resort to additional tax i feel great satisfaction in the assurance that we constituent who have already display so much zeal and firmness in the cause of they country will cheerfully give any other proof of they patriotism which it call for happily no people with local and transitory exception never to be wholly avoid be more able than the people of the united state to spare for the public want a portion of they private means whether regard be have to the ordinary profit of industry or the ordinary price of subsistence in we country compare with those in any other and in no case could stronger reason be feel for yield the requisite contribution by render the public resource certain and commensurate to the public exigency the constitute authority will be able to prosecute the war the more rapidly to its proper issue every hostile hope found on a calculated failure of we resource will be cut off and by add to the evidence of bravery and skill in combat on the ocean and the land and alacrity in supply the treasure necessary to give they they fullest effect and demonstrate to the world the public energy which we political institution combine with the personal liberty distinguish they the best security will be provide against future enterprise on the rights or the peace of the nation the contest in which the united state be engage appeal for its support to every motive that can animate a uncorrupted and enlighten people -- to the love of country to the pride of liberty to a emulation of the glorious founder of they independence by a successful vindication of its violate attribute to the gratitude and sympathy which demand security from the most degrading wrong of a class of citizen who have prove themselves so worthy the protection of they country by they heroic zeal in its defense and finally to the sacred obligation of transmit entire to future generation that precious patrimony of national rights and independence which be hold in trust by the present from the goodness of divine providence be aware of the inconvenience to which a protracted session at this season would be liable i limit the present communication to object of primary importance in special message which may ensue regard will be have to the same consideration jame madison special message may 29 1813 _ to the senate of the united state _ : the swedish government have repeatedly manifest a desire to interchange a public minister with the united state and have lately appoint one with that view and other consideration concur to render it advisable at this period to make a correspondent appointment i nominate jonathan russell of rhode island to be minister plenipotentiary of the united state to sweden jame madison washington _ July 6 1813 _ _ to the senate of the united state _ : i have receive from the committee appoint by the resolution of the senate of the 14th day of June a copy of that resolution which authorize the committee to confer with the president on the subject of the nomination make by he of a minister plenipotentiary to sweden conceive it to be my duty to decline the propose conference with the committee and it be uncertain when it may be convenient to explain to the committee and through they to the senate the grounds of my so do i think it proper to address the explanation directly to the senate without enter into a general review of the relation in which the constitution have place the several department of the government to each other it will suffice to remark that the executive and senate in the case of appointment to office and of treaty be to be consider as independent of and coordinate with each other if they agree the appointment or treaty be make if the senate disagree they fail if the senate wish information previous to they final decision the practice keep in view the constitutional relation of the senate and the executive have be either to request the executive to furnish it or to refer the subject to a committee of they body to communicate either formally or informally with the head of the proper department the appointment of a committee of the senate to confer immediately with the executive himself appear to lose sight of the coordinate relation between the executive and the senate which the constitution have establish and which ought therefore to be maintain the relation between the senate and house of representative in whom legislative power be concurrently vest be sufficiently analogous to illustrate that between the executive and senate in make appointment and treaty the two house be in like manner independent of and coordinate with each other and the invariable practice of each in appoint committee of conference and consultation be to commission they to confer not with the coordinate body itself but with a committee of that body and although both branch of the legislature may be too numerous to hold conveniently a conference with committee be they to be appoint by either to confer with the entire body of the other it may be fairly presume that if the whole number of either branch be not too large for the purpose the objection to such a conference be against the principle as derogate from the coordinate relation of the two house would retain all its force i add only that i be entirely persuade of the purity of the intention of the senate in the course they have pursue on this occasion and with which my view of the subject make it my duty not to accord and that they will be cheerfully furnish with all the suitable information in possession of the executive in any mode deem consistent with the principle of the constitution and the settle practice under it jame madison washington _ July 20 1813 _ _ to the senate and house of representative of the united state _ : there be sufficient ground to infer that it be the purpose of the enemy to combine with the blockade of we port special licens to neutral vessel or to british vessel in neutral disguise whereby they may draw from we country the precise kind and quantity of export essential to they want whilst its general commerce remain obstruct keep in view also the insidious discrimination between the different port of the united state and as such a system if not counteract will have the effect of diminish very materially the pressure of the war on the enemy and encourage a perseverance in it at the same time that it will leave the general commerce of the united state under all the pressure the enemy can impose thus subject the whole to british regulation in subserviency to british monopoly i recommend to the consideration of congress the expediency of a immediate and effectual prohibition of export limit to a convenient day in they next session and removable in the meantime in the event of a cessation of the blockade of we port jame madison proclamation -lrb- from nile 's weekly register vol 4 p 345 -rrb- a proclamation whereas the congress of

representative _ : in meeting you at the present interesting conjuncture it would have be highly satisfactory if i could have communicate a favorable result to the mission charge with negotiation for restore peace it be a just expectation from the respect due to the distinguished sovereign who have invite they by he offer of mediation from the readiness with which the invitation be accept on the part of the united state and from the pledge to be find in a act of they legislature for the liberality which they plenipotentiary would carry into the negotiation that no time would be lose by the british government in embrace the experiment for hasten a stop to the effusion of blood a prompt and cordial acceptance of the mediation on that side be the less to be doubt as it be of a nature not to submit rights or pretension on either side to the decision of a umpire but to afford merely a opportunity honorable and desirable to both for discuss and if possible adjust they for the interest of both the british cabinet either mistake we desire of peace for a dread of british power or mislead by other fallacious calculation have disappoint this reasonable anticipation no communication from we envoy have reach we no information on the subject have be receive from that source but it be know that the mediation be decline in the first instance and there be no evidence notwithstanding the lapse of time that a change of disposition in the british council have take place or be to be expect under such circumstance a nation proud of its rights and conscious of its strength have no choice but a exertion of the one in support of the other to this determination the best encouragement be derive from the success with which it have please the almighty to bless we arm both on the land and on the water whilst proof have be continue of the enterprise and skill of we cruiser public and private on the ocean and a new trophy gain in the capture of a british by a american vessel of war after a action give celebrity to the name of the victorious commander the great inland water on which the enemy be also to be encounter have present achievement of we naval arm as brilliant in they character as they have be important in they consequence on lake erie the squadron under command of captain perry have meet the british squadron of superior force a sanguinary conflict end in the capture of the whole the conduct of that officer adroit as it be daring and which be so well second by he comrade justly entitle they to the admiration and gratitude of they country and will fill a early page in its naval annals with a victory never surpass in luster however much it may have be in magnitude on lake ontario the caution of the british commander favor by contingency frustrate the effort of the american commander to bring on a decisive action captain chauncey be able however to establish a ascendency on that important theater and to prove by the manner in which he effect everything possible that opportunity only be want for a more shine display of he own talent and the gallantry of those under he command the success on lake erie have open a passage to the territory of the enemy the officer command the northwestern army transfer the war thither and rapidly pursue the hostile troops flee with they savage associate force a general action which quickly terminate in the capture of the british and dispersion of the savage force this result be signally honorable to major general harrison by whose military talent it be prepare to colonel johnson and he mount volunteer whose impetuous onset give a decisive blow to the rank of the enemy and to the spirit of the volunteer militia equally brave and patriotic who bear a interesting part in the scene more especially to the chief magistrate of kentucky at the head of they whose heroism signalize in the war which establish the independence of he country seek at a advanced age a share in hardship and battle for maintain its rights and its safety the effect of these success have be to rescue the inhabitant of michigan from they oppression aggravate by gross infraction of the capitulation which subject they to a foreign power to alienate the savage of numerous tribe from the enemy by whom they be disappointed and abandon and to relieve a extensive region of country from a merciless warfare which desolate its frontier and impose on its citizen the most harassing service in consequence of we naval superiority on lake ontario and the opportunity afford by it for concentrate we force by water operation which have be provisionally plan be set on foot against the possession of the enemy on the st lawrence such however be the delay produce in the first instance by adverse weather of unusual violence and continuance and such the circumstance attend the final movement of the army that the prospect at one time so favorable be not realize the cruelty of the enemy in enlist the savage into a war with a nation desirous of mutual emulation in mitigate its calamity have not be confine to any one quarter wherever they could be turn against we no exertion to effect it have be spare on we southwestern border the creek tribe who yield to we persevere endeavor be gradually acquire more civilized habit become the unfortunate victim of seduction a war in that quarter have be the consequence infuriate by a bloody fanaticism recently propagate among they it be necessary to crush such a war before it could spread among the contiguous tribe and before it could favor enterprise of the enemy into that vicinity with this view a force be call into the service of the united state from the state of georgium and tennessee which with the nearest regular troops and other corps from the mississippus territory might not only chastise the savage into present peace but make a lasting impression on they fear the progress of the expedition as far as be yet know correspond with the martial zeal with which it be espouse and the best hope of a satisfactory issue be authorize by the complete success with which a well-planned enterprise be execute against a body of hostile savage by a detachment of the volunteer militia of tennessee under the gallant command of general coffee and by a still more important victory over a larger body of they gain under the immediate command of major general jackson a officer equally distinguish for he patriotism and he military talent the systematic perseverance of the enemy in court the aid of the savage in all quarter have the natural effect of kindle they ordinary propensity to war into a passion which even among those best disposed toward the united state be ready if not employ on we side to be turn against we a departure from we protracted forbearance to accept the service tender by they have thus be force upon we but in yield to it the retaliation have be mitigate as much as possible both in its extent and in its character stop far short of the example of the enemy who owe the advantage they have occasionally gain in battle chiefly to the number of they savage associate and who have not control they either from they usual practice of indiscriminate massacre on defenseless inhabitant or from scene of carnage without a parallel on prisoner to the british arm guard by all the law of humanity and of honorable war for these enormity the enemy be equally responsible whether with the power to prevent they they want the will or with the knowledge of a want of power they still avail themselves of such instrument in other respects the enemy be pursue a course which threaten consequence most afflict to humanity a standing law of great britain naturalize as be well know all alien comply with condition limit to a shorter period than those require by the united state and naturalized subject be in war employ by she government in common with native subject in a contiguous british province regulation promulgate since the commencement of the war compel citizen of the united state be there under certain circumstance to bear arm whilst of the native emigrant from the united state who compose much of the population of the province a number have actually bear arm against the united state within they limit some of whom after have do so have become prisoner of war and be now in we possession the british commander in that province nevertheless with the sanction as appear of he government think proper to select from american prisoner of war and send to great britain for trial as criminal a number of individual who have emigrate from the british dominion long prior to the state of war between the two nation who have incorporate themselves into we political society in the mode recognize by the law and the practice of great britain and who be make prisoner of war under the banner of they adopt country fight for its rights and its safety the protection due to these citizen require a effectual interposition in they behalf a like number of british prisoner of war be put into confinement with a notification that they would experience whatever violence might be commit on the american prisoner of war send to great britain it be hope that this necessary consequence of the step unadvisedly take on the part of great britain would have lead she government to reflect on the inconsistency of its conduct and that a sympathy with the british if not with the american sufferer would have arrest the cruel career open by its example this be unhappily not the case in violation both of consistency and of humanity american officer and noncommissioned officer in double the number of the british soldier confine here be order into close confinement with formal notice that in the event of a retaliation for the death which might be inflict on the prisoner of war send to great britain for trial the officer so confine would be put to death also it be notify at the same time that the commander of the british fleet and army on we coast be instruct in the same event to proceed with a destructive severity against we town and they inhabitant that no doubt might be leave with the enemy of we adherence to the retaliatory resort impose on we a correspondent number of british officer prisoner of war in we hand be immediately put into close confinement to abide the fate of those confine by the enemy and the british government have be apprise of the determination of this government to retaliate any other proceedings against we contrary to the legitimate mode of warfare it be as fortunate for the united state that they have it in they power to meet the enemy in this deplorable contest as it be honorable to they that they do not join in it but under the most imperious obligation and with the humane purpose of effectuate a return to the established usage of war the view of the french government on the subject which have be so long commit to negotiation have receive no elucidation since the close of you late session the minister plenipotentiary of the united state at paris have not be enable by proper opportunity to press the object of he mission as prescribe by he instruction the militia be always to be regard as the great bulwark of defense and security for free state and the constitution have wisely commit to the national authority a use of that force as the best provision against a unsafe military establishment as well as a resource peculiarly adapt to a country have the extent and the exposure of the united state i recommend to congress a revision of the militia law for the purpose of secure more effectually the service of all detachment call into the employment and place under the government of the united state it will deserve the consideration of congress also whether among other improvement in the militia law justice do not require a regulation under due precaution for defray the expense incident to the first assemble as well as the subsequent movement of detachment call into the national service to give to we vessel of war public and private the requisite advantage in they cruise it be of much importance that they should have both for themselves and they prize the use of the port and market of friendly power with this view i recommend to congress the expediency of such legal provision as may supply the defect or remove the doubt of the executive authority to allow to the cruiser of other power at war with enemy of the united state such use of the american port as may correspond with the privilege allow by such power to american cruiser during the year end on the 30th of September last the receipt into the treasury have exceed $ 37500000 of which near twenty-four million be the produce of loan after meet all demand for the public service there remain in the treasury on that day near $ 7000000 under the authority contain in the act of the 2d of August last for borrow $ 7500000 that sum have be obtain on term more favorable to the united state than those of the precede loan make during the present year further sum to a considerable amount will be necessary to be obtain in the same way during the ensue year and from the increase capital of the country from the fidelity with which the public engagement have be keep and the public credit maintain it may be expect on good grounds that the necessary pecuniary supplies will not be want the expense of the current year from the multiply operation fall within it have necessarily be extensive but on a just estimate of the campaign in which the mass of they have be incur the cost will not be find disproportionate to the advantage which have be gain the campaign have indeed in its latter stage in one quarter be less favorable than be expect but in addition to the importance of we naval success the progress of the campaign have be fill with incident highly honorable to the american arm the attack of the enemy on craney island on fort meig on sackett harbor and on sandusky have be vigorously and successfully repulse nor have they in any case succeed on either frontier excepting when direct against the peaceable dwelling of individual or village unprepared or undefended on the other hand the movement of the american army have be follow by the reduction of york and of fort george erie and maiden by the recovery of detroit and the extinction of the indian war in the west and by the occupancy or command of a large portion of upper canada battle have also be fight on the border of the st lawrence which though not accomplish they entire object reflect honor on the discipline and prowess of we soldiery the best augury of eventual victory in the same scale be to be place the late success in the south over one of the most powerful which have become one of the most hostile also of the indian tribe it would be improper to close this communication without express a thankfulness in which all ought to unite for the numerous blessing with which we beloved country continue to be favor for the abundance which overspread we land and the prevail health of its inhabitant for the preservation of we internal tranquillity and the stability of we free institution and above all for the light of divine truth and the protection of every man 's conscience in the enjoyment of it and although among we blessing we can not number a exemption from the evil of war yet these will never be regard as the greatest of evil by the friend of liberty and of the rights of nation we country have before prefer they to the degraded condition which be the alternative when the sword be draw in the cause which give birth to we national independence and none who contemplate the magnitude and feel the value of that glorious event will shrink from a struggle to maintain the high and happy ground on which it place the american people with all good citizen the justice and necessity of resist wrong and usurpation no longer to be bear will sufficiently outweigh the privation and sacrifice inseparable from a state of war but it be a reflection moreover peculiarly console that whilst war be generally aggravate by they baneful effect on the internal improvement and permanent prosperity of the nation engage in they such be the favored situation of the united state that the calamity of the contest into which they have be compel to enter be mitigate by improvement and advantage of which the contest itself be the source if the war have increase the interruption of we commerce it have at the same time cherish and multiply we manufacture so as to make we independent of all other country for the more essential branch for which we ought to be dependent on none and be even rapidly give they a extent which will create additional staple in we future intercourse with foreign market if much treasure have be expend no inconsiderable portion of it have be apply to object durable in they value and necessary to we permanent safety if the war have expose we to increase spoliation on the ocean and to predatory incursion on the land it have develop the national means of retaliate the former and of provide protection against the latter demonstrate to all that every blow aim at we maritime independence be a impulse accelerate the growth of we maritime power by diffuse through the mass of the nation the element of military discipline and instruction by augment and distribute warlike preparation applicable to future use by evince the zeal and valor with which they will be employ and the cheerfulness with which every necessary burden will be bear a greater respect for we rights and a longer duration of we future peace be promise than could be expect without these proof of the national character and resource the war have prove moreover that we free government like other free government though slow in its early movement acquire in its progress a force proportion to its freedom and that the union of these state the guardian of the freedom and safety of all and of each be strengthen by every occasion that put it to the test in fine the war with all its vicissitude be illustrate the capacity and the destiny of the united state to be a great a flourish and a powerful nation worthy of the friendship which it be dispose to cultivate with all other and authorize by its own example to require from all a observance of the law of justice and reciprocity beyond these they claim have never extend and in contend for these we behold a subject for we congratulation in the daily testimony of increase harmony throughout the nation and may humbly repose we trust in the smile of heaven on so righteous a cause jame madison special message December 9 1813 _ to the senate and house of representative of the united state _ : the tendency of we commercial and navigation law in they present state to favor the enemy and thereby prolong the war be more and more develop by experience supplies of the most essential kind and they way not only to british port and british army at a distance but the army in we neighborhood with which we own be contend derive from we port and outlet a subsistence attainable with difficulty if at all from other source even the fleet and troops infest we coast and water be by like supplies accommodate and encourage in they predatory and incursive warfare abuse have a like tendency take place in we import trade british fabric and product find they way into we port under the name and from the port of other country and often in british vessel disguise as neutral by false color and papers to these abuse it may be add that illegal importation be openly make with advantage to the violator of the law produce by undervaluation or other circumstance involve in the course of the judicial proceedings against they it be find also that the practice of ransom be a cover for collusive capture and a channel for intelligence advantageous to the enemy to remedy as much as possible these evil i recommend : that a effectual embargo on export be immediately enact that all article know to be derive either not at all or in any immaterial degree only from the production of any other country than great britain and particularly the extensive article make of wool and cotton material and ardent spirit make from the cane be expressly and absolutely prohibit from whatever port or place or in whatever vessel the same may be bring into the united state and that all violation of the nonimportation act be subject to adequate penalty that among the proof of the neutral and national character of foreign vessel it be require that the master and supercargo and three-fourth at least of the crew be citizen or subject of the country under whose flag the vessel sail that all person concern in collusive capture by the enemy or in ransom vessel or they cargo from the enemy be subject to adequate penalty to shorten as much as possible the duration of the war it be indispensable that the enemy should feel all the pressure that can be give to it and the restraint have that tendency will be bear with the greater cheerfulness by all good citizen as the restraint will affect those most who be most ready to sacrifice the interest of they country in pursuit of they own jame madison January 6 1814 _ to the senate and house of representative of the united state _ : i transmit for the information of

the treasury might be supply as that no delay might happen in provide for the result of the negotiation on foot with great britain whether it should require arrangement adapt to a return of peace or further and more effective provision for prosecute the war that result be not yet know if on the one hand the repeal of the order in council and the general pacification in europe which withdraw the occasion on which impressment from american vessel be practice suggest expectation that peace and amity may be reestablish we be compel on the other hand by the refusal of the british government to accept the offer mediation of the emperor of russium by the delay in give effect to its own proposal of a direct negotiation and above all by the principle and manner in which the war be now avowedly carry on to infer that a spirit of hostility be indulge more violent than ever against the rights and prosperity of this country this increase violence be best explain by the two important circumstance that the great contest in europe for a equilibrium guarantee all its state against the ambition of any have be close without any check on the overbearing power of great britain on the ocean and it have leave in she hand disposable armament with which forget the difficulty of a remote war with a free people and yield to the intoxication of success with the example of a great victim to it before she eye she cherish hope of still further aggrandize a power already formidable in its abuse to the tranquillity of the civilized and commercial world but whatever may have inspire the enemy with these more violent purpose the public council of a nation more able to maintain than it be to acquire its independence and with a devotion to it render more ardent by the experience of its blessing can never deliberate but on the means most effectual for defeat the extravagant view or unwarrantable passion with which alone the war can now be pursue against we in the event of the present

american force under major-general brown and brigadier scott and gaine have gain for these hero and they emulate companion the most unfading laurel and have triumphantly test the progressive

continue also to follow the american standard the bold and skillful operation of major-general jackson conduct troops draw from the militia of the state least distant particularly of tennessee have subdue the principal tribe of hostile savage and by establish a peace with they precede by recent and exemplary chastisement have best guard against the mischief of they cooperation with the british

gallant band press upon he on the lake so much contest throughout the war the great exertion for the command make on we part have be well repay on lake ontario we squadron be now and have be for some time in a condition to confine that of the enemy to he own port and to favor the operation of we land force on that frontier a part of the squadron on lake erie have be extend into lake huron and have produce the advantage of display we command on that lake also one object of the expedition be the reduction of mackinaw which fail with the loss of a few brave man among whom be a officer justly distinguish for he gallant exploit the expedition ably conduct by both the land and the naval commander be otherwise highly valuable in its effect on lake champlain where we superiority have for some time be undisputed the british squadron lately come into action with the american command by captain macdonough it issue in the capture of the whole of the enemy 's ship the best praise for this officer and he intrepid comrade be in the likeness of he triumph to the illustrious victory which immortalize another officer and establish at a critical moment we command of another lake on the ocean the pride of we naval arm have be amply support a second frigate have indeed fall into the hand of the enemy but the loss be hide in the blaze of heroism with which she be defend captain porter who command she and whose previous career have be distinguish by daring enterprise and by fertility of genius maintain a sanguinary contest against two ship one of they superior to he own and under other

gallantry and good conduct which entitle they and they companion to a just share in the praise of they country in spite of the naval force of the enemy accumulate on we coast we private cruiser also have not cease to annoy he commerce and to bring they rich prize into we port contribute thus with other proof to demonstrate the incompetency and illegality of a blockade the proclamation of which be make the pretext for vex and discourage the commerce of neutral power with the united state to meet the extended and diversified warfare adopt by the enemy great body of militia have be take into service for the public defense and great expense incur that the defense everywhere may be both more convenient and more economical congress will see the necessity of immediate measure for fill the rank of the regular army and of enlarge the provision for special corps mount and unmounted to be engage for longer period of service than be due from the militia i earnestly renew at the same time a recommendation of such change in the system of the militia as by class and discipline for the most prompt and active service the portion most capable of it will give to that great resource for the public safety all the requisite energy and efficiency the money receive into the treasury during the nine month end on the 30th day of June last amount to $ 32000000 of which near eleven million be the proceeds of the public revenue and the remainder derive from loan the disbursement for public expenditure during the same period exceed $ 34000000 and leave in the treasury on the 1st day of July near $ 5000000 the demand during the remainder of the present year already authorize by congress and the expense incident to a extension of the operation of the war will render it necessary that large sum should be provide to meet they from this view of the national affair congress will be urge to take up without delay as well the subject of pecuniary supplies as that of military force and on a scale commensurate with the extent and the character which the war have assume it be not to be disguise that the situation of we country call for its greatest effort we enemy be powerful in man and in money on the land and on the water avail himself of fortuitous advantage he be aim with he undivided force a deadly blow at we grow prosperity perhaps at we national existence he have avow he purpose of trample on the usage of civilized warfare and give earnest of it in the plunder and wanton destruction of private property in he pride of maritime dominion and in he thirst of commercial monopoly he strike with peculiar animosity at the progress of we navigation and of we manufacture he barbarous policy have not even spare those monument of the art and model of taste with which we country have enriched and embellish its infant metropolis from such a adversary hostility in its greatest force and in its worst form may be look for the american people will face it with the undaunted spirit which in they revolutionary struggle defeat he unrighteous project he threat and he barbarity instead of dismay will kindle in every bosom a indignation not to be extinguish but in the disaster and expulsion of such cruel invader in provide the means necessary the national legislature will not distrust the heroic and enlighten patriotism of its constituent they will cheerfully and proudly bear every burden of every kind which the safety and honor of the nation demand we have see they everywhere pay they tax direct and indirect with the greatest promptness and alacrity we see they rush with enthusiasm to the scene where danger and duty call in offer they blood they give the surest pledge that no other tribute will be withhold have forborne to declare war until to other aggression have be add the capture of nearly a thousand american vessel and the impressment of thousand of american seafaring citizen and until a final declaration have be make by the government of great britain that she hostile order against we commerce would not be revoke but on condition as impossible as unjust whilst it be know that these order would not otherwise cease but with a war which have last nearly twenty year and which accord to appearance at that time might last as many more have manifest on every occasion and in every proper mode a sincere desire to arrest the effusion of blood and meet we enemy on the ground of justice and reconciliation we beloved country in still oppose to he persevere hostility all its energy with a undiminished disposition toward peace and friendship on honorable term must carry with it the good wish of the impartial world and the best hope of support from a omnipotent and kind providence jame madison special message September 26 1814 _ to the senate and house

duly exchange while perform this act i congratulate you and we constituent upon a event which be highly honorable to the nation and terminate with peculiar felicity a campaign signalize by the most brilliant success the late war although reluctantly declare by congress have become a necessary resort to assert the rights and independence of the nation it have be wage with a success which be the natural result of the wisdom of the legislative council of the patriotism of the people of the public spirit of the militia and of the valor of the military and naval force of the country peace at all time a blessing be peculiarly welcome therefore at a period when the cause for the war have cease to operate when the government have demonstrate the efficiency of its power of defense and when the nation can review its conduct without regret and without reproach i recommend to you care and beneficence the gallant man whose achievement in every department of the military service on the land and on the water have so essentially contribute to the honor of the american name and to the restoration of peace the feeling of conscious patriotism and worth will animate such man under every change of fortune and pursuit but they country perform a duty to itself when it bestow those testimonial of approbation and applause which be at once the reward and the incentive to great action the reduction of the public expenditure to the demand of a peace establishment will doubtless engage the immediate attention of congress there be however important consideration which forbid a sudden and general revocation of the measure that have be produce by the war experience have teach we that neither the pacific disposition of the american people nor the pacific character of they political institution can altogether exempt they from that strife which appear beyond the ordinary lot of nation to be incident to the actual period of the world and the same faithful monitor demonstrate that a certain degree of preparation for war be not only indispensable to avert disaster in the onset but afford also the best security for the continuance of peace the wisdom of congress will therefore i be confident provide for the maintenance of a adequate regular force for the gradual advancement of the naval establishment for improve all the means of harbor defense for add discipline to the distinguished bravery of the militia and for cultivate the military art in its essential branch under the liberal patronage of government the resource of we country be at all time competent to the attainment of every national object but they will now be enriched and invigorate by the activity which peace will introduce into all the scene of domestic enterprise and labor the provision that have be make for the public creditor during the present session of congress must have a decisive effect in the establishment of the public credit both at home and abroad the revive interest of commerce will claim the legislative attention at the earliest opportunity and such regulation will i trust be seasonably devise as shall secure to the united state they just proportion of the navigation of the world the most liberal policy toward other nation if meet by correspond disposition will in this respect be find the most beneficial policy toward ourselves but there be no subject that can enter with greater force and merit into the deliberation of congress than a consideration of the means to preserve and promote the manufacture which have spring into existence and attain a unparalleled maturity throughout the united state during the period of the european war this source of national independence and wealth i anxiously recommend therefore to the prompt and constant guardianship of congress the termination of the legislative session will soon separate you fellow citizen from each other and restore you to you constituent i pray you to bear with you the expression of my sanguine hope that the peace which have be just declare will not only be the foundation of the most friendly intercourse between the united state and great britain but that it will also be productive of happiness and harmony in every section of we beloved country the influence of you precept and example must be everywhere powerful and while we accord in grateful acknowledgment for the protection which providence have bestow upon we let we never cease to inculcate obedience to the law and fidelity to the union as constitute the palladium of the national independence and prosperity jame madison washington _ February 22 1815 _ _ to the senate and house of representative of the united state _ : i lay before congress copy of two ratify treaty which be enter into on the part of the united state one on the 22d day of July 1814 with the several tribe of indian call the wyandot delaware shawanee senaka and miamy the other on the 9th day of August 1814 with the creek nation of indian it be refer to the consideration of congress how far legislative provision may be necessary for carry any part of these stipulation into effect jame madison washington _ February 23 1815 _ _ to the senate and house of representative of the united state _ : congress will have see by the communication from the consul-general of the united state at algier lay before they on the 17th of November 1812 the hostile proceedings of the dey against that functionary these have be follow by act of more overt and direct warfare against the citizen of the united state trade in the mediterranean some of whom be still detain in captivity notwithstanding the attempt which have be make to ransom they and be treat with the rigor usual on the coast of barbary the consideration which render it unnecessary and unimportant to commence hostile operation on the part of the united state be now terminate by the peace with great britain which open the prospect of a active and valuable trade of they citizen within the range of the algerine cruiser i recommend to congress the expediency of a act declare the existence of a state of war between the united state and the dey and regency of algier and of such provision as may be requisite for a vigorous prosecution of it to a successful issue jame madison washington _ February 25 1815 _ _ to the senate and house of representative of the united state _ : peace have happily take place between the united state and great britain it be desirable to guard against incident which during period of war in europe might tend to interrupt it and it be believe in particular that the navigation of american vessel exclusively by american seaman either native or such as be already naturalized would not only conduce to the attainment of that object but also to increase the number of we seaman and consequently to render we commerce and navigation independent of the service of foreigner who might be recall by they government under circumstance the most inconvenient to the united state i recommend the subject therefore to the consideration of congress and in decide upon it i be persuade that they will sufficiently estimate the policy of manifest to the world a desire on all occasion to cultivate harmony with other nation by any reasonable accommodation which do not impair the enjoyment of any of the essential rights of a free and independent people the example on the part of the american government will merit and may be expect to receive a reciprocal attention from all the friendly power of europe jame madison veto message washington _ January 30 1815 _ _ to the senate of the united state _ : have bestow on the bill entitle a act to incorporate the subscriber to the bank of the united state of america that full consideration which be due to the great importance of the subject and dictate by the respect which i feel for the two house of congress i be constrain by a deep and solemn conviction that the bill ought not to become a law to return it to the senate in which it originate with my objection to the same waive the question of the constitutional authority of the legislature to establish a incorporated bank as be preclude in my judgment by repeat recognition under varied circumstance of the validity of such a institution in act of the legislative executive and judicial branch of the government accompany by indication in different mode of a concurrence of the general will of the nation the propose bank do not appear to be calculate to answer the purpose of revive the public credit of provide a national medium of circulation and of aid the treasury by facilitate the indispensable anticipation of the revenue and by afford to the public more durable loan 1 the capital of the bank be to be compound of specie of public stock and of treasury note convertible into stock with a certain proportion of each of which every subscriber be to furnish himself the amount of the stock to be subscribe will not it be believe be sufficient to produce in favor of the public credit any considerable or lasting elevation of the market price whilst this may be occasionally depress by the bank itself if it should carry into the market the allow proportion of its capital consist of public stock in order to procure specie which it may find its account in procure with some sacrifice on that part of its capital nor will any adequate advantage arise to the public credit from the subscription of treasury note the actual issue of these note nearly equal at present and will soon exceed the amount to be subscribe to the bank the direct effect of this operation be simply to convert fifteen million of treasury note into fifteen million of 6 per cent stock with the collateral effect of promote a additional demand for treasury note beyond what might otherwise be negotiable public credit might indeed be expect to derive advantage from the establishment of a national bank without regard to the formation of its capital if the full aid and cooperation of the institution be secure to the government during the war and during the period of its fiscal embarrassment but the bank propose will be free from all legal obligation to cooperate with the public measure and whatever might be the patriotic disposition of its director to contribute to the removal of those embarrassment and to invigorate the prosecution of the war fidelity to the pecuniary and general interest of the institution accord to they estimate of it might oblige they to decline a connection of they operation with those of the national treasury during the continuance of the war and the difficulty incident to it temporary sacrifice of interest though overbalance by the future and permanent profit of the charter not be requirable of right in behalf of the public might not be gratuitously make and the bank would reap the full benefit of the grant whilst the public would lose the equivalent expect from it for it must be keep in view that the sole inducement to such a grant on the part of the public would be the prospect of substantial aid to its pecuniary means at the present crisis and during the sequel of the war it be evident that the stock of the bank will on the return of peace if not sooner rise in the market to a value which if the bank be establish in a period of peace would authorize and obtain for the public a bonus to a very large amount in lieu of such a bonus the government be fairly entitle to and ought not to relinquish or risk the needful service of the bank under the press circumstance of war 2 the bank as propose to be constitute can not be rely on during the war to provide a circulate medium nor to furnish loan or anticipation of the public revenue without a medium the tax can not be collect and in the absence of specie the medium understand to be the best substitute be that of note issue by a national bank the propose bank will commence and conduct its operation under a obligation to pay its note in specie or be subject to the loss of its charter without such a obligation the note of the bank though not exchangeable for specie yet rest on good pledge and perform the use of specie in the payment of tax and in other public transaction would as experience have ascertain qualify the bank to supply at once a circulate medium and pecuniary aid to the government under the fetter impose by the bill it be manifest that during the actual state of thing and probably during the war the period particularly require such a medium and such a resource for loan and advance to the government note for which the bank would be compellable to give specie in exchange could not be keep in circulation the most the bank could effect and the most it could be expect to aim at would be to keep the institution alive by limited and local transaction which with the interest on the public stock in the bank might yield a dividend sufficient for the purpose until a change from war to peace should enable it by a flow of specie into its vault and a removal of the external demand for it to derive its contemplated emolument from a safe and full extension of its operation on the whole when it be consider that the propose establishment will enjoy a monopoly of the profit of a national bank for a period of twenty year that the monopolize profit will be continually grow with the progress of the national population and wealth that the nation will during the same period be dependent on the note of the bank for that species of circulate medium whenever the precious metal may be want and at all time for so much thereof as may be a eligible substitute for a specie medium and that the extensive employment of the note in the collection of the augmented tax will moreover enable the bank greatly to extend its profitable issue of they without the expense of specie capital to support they circulation it be as reasonable as it be requisite that the government in return for these extraordinary concession to the bank should have a greater security for attain the public object of the institution than be present in the bill and particularly for every practicable accommodation both in the temporary advance necessary to anticipate the tax and in those more durable loan which be equally necessary to diminish the resort to tax in discharge this painful duty of state objection to a measure which have undergo the deliberation and receive the sanction of the two house of the national legislature i console myself with the reflection that if they have not the weight which i attach to they they can be constitutionally overrule and with a confidence that in a contrary event the wisdom of congress will hasten to substitute a more commensurate and certain provision for the public exigency jame madison proclamation by the president of the united state a proclamation the two house of the national legislature have by a joint resolution express they desire that in the present time of

he hasten to the port of algier where peace be promptly yield to he victorious force in the term stipulate the rights and honor of the united state be particularly consult by a perpetual relinquishment on the part of the dey of all pretension to tribute from they the impression which have thus be make strengthen as they will have be by subsequent transaction with the regency of tuni and of tripolus by the appearance of the larger force which follow under commodore bainbridge the chief in command of the expedition and by the judicious precautionary arrangement leave by he in that quarter afford a reasonable prospect of future security for the valuable portion of we commerce which pass within reach of the barbary cruiser it be another source of satisfaction that the treaty of peace with great britain have be succeed by a convention on the subject of commerce conclude by the plenipotentiary of the two country in this result a disposition be manifest on the part of that nation correspond with the disposition of the united state which it may be hope will be improve into liberal arrangement on other subject on which the party have mutual interest or which might endanger they future harmony congress will decide on the expediency of promote such a sequel by give effect to the measure of confine the american navigation to american seaman -- a measure which at the same time that it might have that conciliatory tendency would have the further advantage of increase the independence of we navigation and the resource for we maritime defense in conformity with the article in the treaty of ghent relate to the indian as well as with a view to the tranquillity of we western and northwestern frontier measure be take to establish a immediate peace with the

to chastise into peace have latterly show a restlessness which have call for preparatory measure for repress it and for protect the commissioner engage in carry the term of the peace into execution the execution of the act for fix the military peace establishment have be attend with difficulty which even now can only be overcome by legislative aid the selection of officer the payment and discharge of the troops enlist for the war the payment of the retain troops and they reunion from detach and distant station the collection and security of the public property in the quartermaster commissary and ordnance department and the constant medical assistance require in hospital and garrison render a complete execution of the act impracticable on the 1st of may the period more immediately contemplate as soon however as circumstance would permit and as far as it have be practicable consistently with the public interest the reduction of the army have be accomplish but the appropriation for its pay and for other branch of the military service have prove inadequate the earliest attention to that subject will be necessary and the expediency of continue upon the peace establishment the staff officer who have hitherto be provisionally retain be also recommend to the consideration of congress in the performance of the executive duty upon this occasion there have not be want a just sensibility to the merit of the american army during the late war but the obvious policy and design in fix a efficient military peace establishment do not afford a opportunity to distinguish the aged and infirm on account of they past service nor the wound and disable on account of they present suffering the extent of the reduction indeed unavoidably involve the exclusion of many meritorious officer of every rank from the service of they country and so equal as well as so numerous be the claim to attention that a decision by the standard of comparative merit could seldom be attain judge however in candor by a general standard of positive merit the army register will it be believe do honor to the establishment while the case of those officer whose name be not include in it devolve with the strongest interest upon the legislative authority for such provision as shall be deem the best calculate to give support and solace to the veteran and the invalid to display the beneficence as well as the justice of the government and to inspire a martial zeal for the public service upon every future emergency although the embarrassment arise from the want of a uniform national currency have not be diminish since the adjournment of congress great satisfaction have be derive in contemplate the revival of the public credit and the efficiency of the public resource the receipt into the treasury from the various branch of revenue during the nine month end on the 30th of September last have be estimate at $ 12500000 the issue of treasury note of every denomination during the same period amount to the sum of $ 14000000 and there be also obtain upon loan during the same period a sum of $ 9000000 of which the sum of $ 6000000 be subscribe in cash and the sum of $ 3000000 in treasury note with these means add to the sum of $ 1500000 be the balance of money in the treasury on the 1st day of January there have be pay between the 1st of January and the 1st of October on account of the appropriation of the precede and of the present year -lrb- exclusively of the amount of the treasury note subscribe to the loan and of the amount redeem in the payment of duty and tax -rrb- the aggregate sum of $ 33500000 leave a balance then in the treasury estimate at the sum of $ 3000000 independent however of the arrearage due for military service and supply it be presume that a further sum of $ 5000000 include the interest on the public debt payable on the 1st of January next will be demand at the treasury to complete the expenditure of the present year and for which the exist way and means will sufficiently provide the national debt as it be ascertain on the 1st of October last amount in the whole to the sum of $ 120000000 consist of the unredeemed balance of the debt contract before the late war -lrb- $ 39000000 -rrb- the amount of the funded debt contract in consequence of the war -lrb- $ 64000000 -rrb- and the amount of the unfunded and float debt include the various issue of treasury note $ 17000000 which be in a gradual course of payment there will probably be some addition to the public debt upon the liquidation of various claim which be depend and a conciliatory disposition on the part of congress may lead honorably and advantageously to a equitable arrangement of the militia expense incur by the several state without the previous sanction or authority of the government of the united state but when it be consider that the new as well as the old portion of the debt have be contract in the assertion of the national rights and independence and when it be recollect that the public expenditure not be exclusively bestow upon subject of a transient nature will long be visible in the number and equipment of the american navy in the military work for the defense of we harbor and we frontier and in the supplies of we arsenal and magazine the amount will bear a gratifying comparison with the object which have be attain as well as with the resource of the country the arrangement of the finances with a view to the receipt and expenditure of a permanent peace establishment will necessarily enter into the deliberation of congress during the present session it be true that the improve condition of the public revenue will not only afford the means of maintain the faith of the government with its creditor inviolate and of prosecute successfully the measure of the most liberal policy but will also justify a immediate alleviation of the burden impose by the necessity of the war it be however essential to every modification of the finances that the benefit of a uniform national currency should be restore to the community the absence of the precious metal will it be believe be a temporary evil but until they can again be render the general medium of exchange it devolve on the wisdom of congress to provide a substitute which shall equally engage the confidence and accommodate the want of the citizen throughout the union if the operation of the state bank can not produce this result the probable operation of a national bank will merit consideration and if neither of these expedient be deem effectual it may become necessary to ascertain the term upon which the note of the government -lrb- no longer require as a instrument of credit -rrb- shall be issue upon motive of general policy as a common medium of circulation notwithstanding the security for future repose which the united state ought to find in they love of peace and they constant respect for the rights of other nation the character of the time particularly inculcate the lesson that whether to prevent or repel danger we ought not to be unprepared for it this consideration will sufficiently recommend to congress a liberal provision for the immediate extension and gradual completion of the work of defense both fix and float on we maritime frontier and a adequate provision for guard we inland frontier against danger to which certain portion of it may continue to be expose as a improvement in we military establishment it will deserve the consideration of congress whether a corps of invalid might not be so organize and employ as at once to aid in the support of meritorious individual exclude by age or infirmity from the exist establishment and to procure to the public the benefit of they stationary service and of they exemplary discipline i recommend also a enlargement of the military academy already establish and the establishment of other in other section of the union and i can not press too much on the attention of congress such a classification and organization of the militia as will most effectually render it the safeguard of a free state if experience have shew in the recent splendid achievement of militia the value of this resource for the public defense it have shewn also the importance of that skill in the use of arm and that familiarity with the essential rule of discipline which can not be expect from the regulation now in force with this subject be intimately connect the necessity of accommodate the law in every respect to the great object of enable the political authority of the union to employ promptly and effectually the physical power of the union in the case designate by the constitution the signal service which have be render by we navy and the capacity it have develop for successful cooperation in the national defense will give to that portion of the public force its full value in the eye of congress at a epoch which call for the constant vigilance of all government to preserve the ship now in a sound state to complete those already contemplate to provide amply the imperishable material for prompt augmentation and to improve the exist arrangement into more advantageous establishment for the construction the repair and the security of vessel of war be dictate by the soundest policy in adjust the duty on import to the object of revenue the influence of the tariff on manufacture will necessarily present itself for consideration however wise the theory may be which leave to the sagacity and interest of individual the application of they industry and resource there be in this as in other case exception to the general rule besides the condition which the theory itself imply of a reciprocal adoption by other nation experience teach that so many circumstance must concur in introduce and mature manufacturing establishment especially of the more complicated kind that a country may remain long without they although sufficiently advance and in some respects even peculiarly fit for carry they on with success under circumstance give a powerful impulse to manufacture industry it have make among we a progress and exhibit a efficiency which justify the belief that with a protection not more than be due to the enterprising citizen whose interest be now at stake it will become at a early day not only safe against occasional competition from abroad but a source of domestic wealth and even of external commerce in select the branch more especially entitle to the public patronage a preference be obviously claim by such as will relieve the united state from a dependence on foreign supplies ever subject to casual failure for article necessary for the public defense or connect with the primary want of individual it will be a additional recommendation of particular manufacture where the material for they be extensively draw from we agriculture and consequently impart and insure to that great fund of national prosperity and independence a encouragement which can not fail to be reward among the means of advance the public interest the occasion be a proper one for recall the attention of congress to the great importance of establish throughout we country the road and canal which can best be execute under the national authority no object within the circle of political economy so richly repay the expense bestow on they there be none the utility of which be more universally ascertain and acknowledge none that do more honor to the government whose wise and enlarged patriotism duly appreciate they nor be there any country which present a field where nature invite more the art of man to complete she own work for he accommodation and benefit these consideration be strengthened moreover by the political effect of these facility for intercommunication in bring and bind more closely together the various part of we extended confederacy whilst the state individually with a laudable enterprise and emulation avail themselves of they local advantage by new road by navigable canal and by improve the stream susceptible of navigation the general government be the more urge to similar undertaking require a national jurisdiction and national means by the prospect of thus systematically complete so inestimable a work and it be a happy reflection that any defect of constitutional authority which may be encounter can be supply in a mode which the constitution itself have providently point out the present be a favorable season also for bring again into view the establishment of a national seminary of learn within the district of columbium and with means draw from the property therein subject to the authority of the general government such a institution claim the patronage of congress as a monument of they solicitude for the advancement of knowledge without which the blessing of liberty can not be fully enjoy or long preserve as a model instructive in the formation of

tendency the cause in its present extent can not be of very long duration the evil will not however be view by congress without a recollection that manufacture establishment if suffer to sink too low or languish too long may not revive after the cause shall have cease and that in the vicissitude of human affair situation may recur in which a dependence on foreign source for indispensable supplies may be among the most serious embarrassment the depressed state of we navigation be to be ascribe in a material degree to its exclusion from the colonial port of the nation most extensively connect with we in commerce and from the indirect operation of that exclusion previous to the late convention at london between the united state and great britain the relative state of the navigation law of the two country grow out of the treaty of 1794 have give to the british navigation a material advantage over the american in the intercourse between the american port and british port in europe the convention of london equalize the law of the two country relate to those port leave the intercourse between we port and the port of the british colony subject as before to the respective regulation of the party the british government enforce now regulation which prohibit a trade between its colony and the united state in american vessel whilst they permit a trade in british vessel the american navigation lose accordingly and the loss be augment by the advantage which be give to the british competition over the american in the navigation between we port and british port in europe by the circuitous voyage enjoy by the one and not enjoy by the other the reasonableness of the rule of reciprocity apply to one branch of the commercial intercourse have be press on we part as equally applicable to both branch but it be ascertain that the british cabinet decline all negotiation on the subject with a disavowal however of any disposition to view in a unfriendly light whatever countervail regulation the united state may oppose to the regulation of which they complain the wisdom of the legislature will decide on the course which under these circumstance be prescribe by a joint regard to the amicable relation between the two nation and to the just interest of the united state i have the satisfaction to state generally that we remain in amity with foreign power a occurrence have indeed take place in the gulf of mexico which if sanction by the spanish government may make a exception as to that power accord to the report of we naval commander on that station one of we public armed vessel be attack by a overpowering force under a spanish commander and the american flag with the officer and crew insult in a manner call for prompt reparation this have be demand in the meantime a frigate and a smaller vessel of war have be order into that gulf for the protection of we commerce it would be improper to omit that the representative of he catholic majesty in the united state lose no time in give the strongest assurance that no hostile order could have emanate from he government and that it will be as ready to do as to expect whatever the nature of the case and the friendly relation of the two country shall be find to require the posture of we affair with algier at the present moment be not know the dey draw pretext from circumstance for which the united state be not answerable address a letter to this government declare the treaty last conclude with he to have be annul by we violation of it and present as the alternative war or a renewal of the former treaty which stipulate among other thing a annual tribute the answer with a explicit declaration that the united state prefer war to tribute require he recognition and observance of the treaty last make which abolish tribute and the slavery of we capture citizen the result of the answer have not be receive should he renew he warfare on we commerce we rely on the protection it will find in we naval force actually in the mediterranean with the other barbary state we affair have undergo no change the indian tribe within we limit appear also dispose to remain at peace from several of they purchase of land have be make particularly favorable to the wish and security of we frontier settlement as well as to the general interest of the nation in some instance the title though not support by due proof and clash those of one tribe with the claim of another have be extinguish by double purchase the benevolent policy of the united state prefer the augmented expense to the hazard of do injustice or to the enforcement of justice against a feeble and untutored people by means involve or threaten a effusion of blood i be happy to add that the tranquillity which have be restore among the tribe themselves as well as between they and we own population will favor the resumption of the work of civilization which have make a encouraging progress among some tribe and that the facility be increase for extend that divide and individual ownership which exist now in movable property only to the soil itself and of thus establish in the culture and improvement of it the true foundation for a transit from the habit of the savage to the art and comfort of social life as a subject of the highest importance to the national welfare i must again earnestly recommend to the consideration of congress a reorganization of the militia on a plan which will form it into class accord to the period of life more or less adapt to military service a efficient militia be authorize and contemplate by the constitution and require by the spirit and safety of free government the present organization of we militia be universally regard as less efficient than it ought to be make and no organization can be better calculate to give to it its due force than a classification which will assign the foremost place in the defense of the country to that portion of its citizen whose activity and animation best enable they to rally to its standard besides the consideration that a time of peace be the time when the change can be make with most convenience and equity it will now be aid by the experience of a recent war in which the militia bear so interesting a part congress will call to mind that no adequate provision have yet be make for the uniformity of weight and measure also contemplate by the constitution the great utility of a standard fix in its nature and found on the easy rule of decimal proportion be sufficiently obvious it lead the government at a early stage to preparatory step for introduce it and a completion of the work will be a just title to the public gratitude the importance which i have attach to the establishment of a university within this district on a scale and for object worthy of the american nation induce I to renew my recommendation of it to the favorable consideration of congress and i particularly invite again they attention to the expediency of exercise they exist power and where necessary of resort to the prescribe mode of enlarge they in order to effectuate a comprehensive system of road and canal such as will have the effect of draw more closely together every part of we country by promote intercourse and improvement and by increase the share of every part in the common stock of national prosperity occurrence have take place which shew that the statutory provision for the dispensation of criminal justice be deficient in relation both to place and to person under the exclusive cognizance of the national authority a amendment of the law embrace such case will merit the earliest attention of the legislature it will be a seasonable occasion also for inquire how far legislative interposition maybe further requisite in provide penalty for offens designate in the constitution or in the statute and to which either no penalty be annex or none with sufficient certainty and i submit to the wisdom of congress whether a more enlarged revisal of the criminal code be not expedient for the purpose of mitigate in certain case penalty which be adopt into it antecedent to experiment and example which justify and recommend a more lenient policy the united state have be the first to abolish within the extent of they authority the transportation of the native of africa into slavery by prohibit the introduction of slave and by punish they citizen participate in the traffic can not but be gratify at the progress make by concurrent effort of other nation toward a general suppression of so great a evil they must feel at the same time the greater solicitude to give the fullest efficacy to they own regulation with that view the interposition of congress appear to be require by the violation and evasion which it be suggest be chargeable on unworthy citizen who mingle in the slave trade under foreign flag and with foreign port and by collusive importation of slave into the united state through adjoining port and territory i present the subject to congress with a full assurance of they disposition to apply all the remedy which can be afford by a amendment of the law the regulation which be intend to guard against abuse of a kindred character in the trade between the several state ought also to be render more effectual for they humane object to these recommendation i add for the consideration of congress the expediency of a remodification of the judiciary establishment and of a additional department in the executive branch of the government the first be call for by the accrue business which necessarily swell the duty of the federal court and by the great and widen space within which justice be to be dispense by they the time seem to have arrive which claim for member of the supreme court a relief from itinerary fatigue incompatible as well with the age which a portion of they will always have attain as with the research and preparation which be due to they station and to the juridical reputation of they country and consideration equally cogent require a more convenient organization of the subordinate tribunal which may be accomplish without a objectionable increase of the number or expense of the judge the extent and variety of executive business also accumulate with the progress of we country and its grow population call for a additional department to be charge with duty now overburden other department and with such as have not be annex to any department the course of experience recommend as another improvement in the executive establishment that the provision for the station of attorney-general whose residence at the seat of government official connection with it and the management of the public business before the judiciary preclude a extensive participation in professional emolument be make more adequate to he service and he relinquishment and that with a view to he reasonable accommodation and to a proper depository of he official opinion and proceedings there be include in the provision the usual appurtenance to a public office in direct the legislative attention to the state of the finances it be a subject of great gratification to find that even within the short period which have elapse since the return of peace the revenue have far exceed all the current demand upon the treasury and that under any probable diminution of its future annual product which the vicissitude of commerce may occasion it will afford a ample fund for the effectual and early extinguishment of the public debt it have be estimate that during the year 1816 the actual receipt of revenue at the treasury include the balance at the commencement of the year and exclude the proceeds of loan and treasury note will amount to about the sum of $ 47000000 that during the same year the actual payment at the treasury include the payment of the arrearage of the war department as well as the payment of a considerable excess beyond the annual appropriation will amount to about the sum of $ 38000000 and that consequently at the close of the year there will be a surplus in the treasury of about the sum of $ 9000000 the operation of the treasury continue to be obstruct by difficulty arise from the condition of the national currency but they have nevertheless be effectual to a beneficial extent in the reduction of the public debt and the establishment of the public credit the float debt of treasury note and temporary loan will soon be entirely discharge the aggregate of the funded debt compose of debt incur during the war of 1776 and 1812 have be estimate with reference to the 1st of January next at a sum not exceed $ 110000000 the ordinary annual expense of the government for the maintenance of all its institution civil military and naval have be estimate at a sum less than $ 20000000 and the permanent revenue to be derive from all the exist source have be estimate at a sum of about $ 25000000 upon this general view of the subject it be obvious that there be only want to the fiscal prosperity of the government the restoration of a uniform medium of exchange the resource and the faith of the nation display in the system which congress have establish insure respect and confidence both at home and abroad the local accumulation of the revenue have already enable the treasury to meet the public engagement in the local currency of most of the state and it be expect that the same cause will produce the same effect throughout the union but for the interest of the community at large as well as for the purpose of the treasury it be essential that the nation should possess a currency of equal value credit and use wherever it may circulate the constitution have intrust congress exclusively with the power of create and regulate a currency of that description and the measure which be take during the last session in execution of the power give every promise of success the bank of the united state have be organize under auspices the most favorable and can not fail to be a important auxiliary to those measure for a more enlarged view of the public finances with a view of the measure pursue by the treasury department previous to the resignation of the late secretary i transmit a extract from the last report of that officer congress will perceive in it ample proof of the solid foundation on which the financial prosperity of the nation rest and will do justice to the distinguish ability and successful exertion with which the duty of the department be execute during a period remarkable for its difficulty and its peculiar perplexity the period of my retire from the public service be at little distance i shall find no occasion more proper than the present for express to my fellow-citizen my deep sense of the continue confidence and kind support which i have receive from they my grateful recollection of these distinguish mark of they favorable regard can never cease and with the consciousness that if i have not

which those who love they country most will best appreciate i shall behold it bless with tranquillity and prosperity at home and with peace and respect abroad i can indulge the proud reflection that the american people have reach in safety and success they fortieth year as a independent nation that for nearly a entire generation they have have experience of they present constitution the offspring of they undisturbed deliberation and of they free choice that they have find it to bear the trial of adverse as well as prosperous circumstance : to contain in its combination of the federate and elective principle a reconcilement of public strength with individual liberty of national power for the defense of national rights with a security against war of injustice of ambition and of vainglory in the fundamental provision which subject all question of war to the will of the nation itself which be to pay its cost and feel its calamity nor be it less a peculiar felicity of this constitution so dear to we all that it be find to be capable without lose its vital energy of expand itself over a spacious territory with the increase and expansion of the community for whose benefit it be establish and may i not be allow to add to this gratifying spectacle that i shall read in the character of the american people in they devotion to true liberty and to the constitution which be its palladium sure presage that the destine career of my country will exhibit a government pursue the public good as its sole object and regulate its means by the great principle consecrate in its charter and by those moral principle to which they be so well ally a government which watch over the purity of election the freedom of speech and of the press the trial by jury and the equal interdict against encroachment and compact between religion and the state which maintain inviolably the maxim of public faith the security of person and property and encourage in every authorize mode that general diffusion of knowledge which guarantee to public liberty its permanency and to those who possess the blessing the true enjoyment of it a government which avoid intrusion on the internal repose of other nation and repel they from its own which do justice to all nation with a readiness equal to the firmness with which it require justice from they and which whilst it refine its domestic code from every ingredient not congenial with the precept of a enlighten age and the sentiment of a virtuous people seek by appeal to reason and by its liberal example to infuse into the law which govern the civilized world a spirit which may diminish the frequency or circumscribe the calamity of war and meliorate the social and beneficent relation of peace a government in a word whose conduct within and without may bespeak the most noble of all ambition -- that of promote peace on earth and good will to man these contemplation sweeten the remnant of my day will animate my prayer for the happiness of

apart and pledge fund for construct road and canal and improve the navigation of water course in order to facilitate promote and give security to internal commerce among the several state and to render more easy and less expensive the means and provision for the common defense i be constrain by the insuperable difficulty i feel in reconcile the bill with the constitution of the united state to return it with that objection to the house of representative in which it originate the legislative power vest in congress be specify and enumerate in the eighth section of the first article of the constitution and it do not appear that the power propose to be exercise by the bill be among the enumerated power or that it fall by any just interpretation within the power to make law necessary and proper for carry into execution those or other power vest by the constitution in the government of the united state the power to regulate commerce among the several state can not include a power to construct road and canal and to improve the navigation of water course in order to facilitate promote and secure such a commerce without a latitude of construction depart from the ordinary import of the term strengthen by the known inconvenience which doubtless lead to the grant of this remedial power to congress to refer the power in question to the clause to provide for the common defense and general welfare would be contrary to the established and consistent rule of interpretation as render the special and careful enumeration of power which follow the clause nugatory and improper such a view of the constitution would have the effect of give to congress a general power of legislation instead of the define and limit one hitherto understand to belong to they the term common defense and general welfare embrace every object and act within the purview of a legislative trust it would have the effect of subject both the constitution and law of the several state in all case not specifically exempt to be supersede by law of congress it be expressly declare that the constitution of the united state and law make in pursuance thereof shall be the supreme law of the land and the judge of every state shall be bind thereby anything in the constitution or law of any state to the contrary notwithstanding such a view of the constitution finally would have the effect of exclude the judicial authority of the united state from its participation in guard the boundary between the legislative power of the general and the state government inasmuch as question relate to the general welfare be question of policy and expediency be unsusceptible of judicial cognizance and decision a restriction of the power to provide for the common defense and general welfare to case which be to be provide for by the expenditure of money would still leave within the legislative power of congress all the great and most important measure of government money be the ordinary and necessary means of carry they into execution if a general power to construct road and canal and to improve the navigation of water course with the train of power incident thereto be not possess by congress the assent of the state in the mode provide in the bill can not confer the power the only case in which the consent and cession of particular state can extend the power of congress be those specify and provide for in the constitution i be not unaware of the great importance of road and canal and the improve navigation of water course and that a power in the national legislature to provide for they might be exercise with signal advantage to the general prosperity but see that such a power be not expressly give by the constitution and believe that it can not be deduce from any part of it without a inadmissible latitude of construction and a reliance on insufficient precedent believe also that the permanent success of the constitution depend on a definite partition of power between the general and the state government and that no adequate landmark would be leave by the constructive extension of the power of congress as propose in the bill i have no option but to withhold my signature from it and to cherish the hope that its beneficial object may be attain by a resort for the necessary power to the same wisdom and virtue in the nation which establish the constitution in its actual form and providently mark out in the instrument itself a safe and practicable mode of improve it as experience might suggest jame madison proclamation -lrb- from annals of congress fourteenth congress
