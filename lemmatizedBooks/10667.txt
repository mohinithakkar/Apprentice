major decy either send or bring the infant damocle to monksmead _ immediately _ the major decide to apply forthwith for such privilege-leave and furlough as be due to he and to proceed to england with the boy it would be as well that he great-uncle should hear from he personally of the matter of the child 's mental condition resultant upon the tragedy of he own birth and he mother 's death the

inch a stukeley he would growl in reply but yvette seymor stukeley have pray for colonel de warrenne nightly for seven year and have idealized he beyond recognition possibly fate 's greatest kindness

heart of many man and defend the honor of many ancestor and dream with far greater vividness and understand the dream he have so often dream before frequently as he dream it during he chequered career it be henceforth always most vivid and real it never never vary in the slightest detail and he generally dream it on the night before some eventful dangerful day on which he risk he life or fight for it of the early dreaming of course he understand little but while he be still almost a boy he most fully understand the significance of every word act and detail of the marvellous realistic dream it begin with a view of a camp of curious little bell-tent about which stride remarkable big-booted long-haired bedizened man -- look strangely effeminate and strangely fierce with they feathered hat curl silk sash velvet coat and with they long sword cruel face and savage oath some wear steel breastplate like that of the suit of armor in the hall and steel helmet the sight of the camp thrill the boy in he dream and yet he know that he have see it all before actually and in real life -- in some former life beside one of a small cluster of tent that stand well apart from the rest sit a big man who instantly remind the boy of he dread grandfather whom he would have love to have love have he be give the chance the big man be even more strangely attired than those other who clump and clatter about the lower part of the camp fancy a great big strong man with long curl a lace collar and a velvet coat -- like a kid go to a party the velvet coat have the strangest sleeve too -- make to button to the elbow and full of slit that seem to have be mend underneath with blue silk there be a regular pattern of these silk-mended slit about the body of the coat too and funny silk-covered button on he head the man have a great floppy feel hat with a huge feather -- a hat very like one that dearest wear only bigger one of he long curl be tie with a bow of ribbon -- like young lucille wear -- and the boy feel quite uncomfortable as he note it a grown man -- the silly ass and yes he have actually get lace round the bottom of he quaint baggy knickerbockers -- as well as lace cuff the boy could see it where one of the great boot have sag down below the knee extraordinary boot they be too nothing like grumper 's riding-boot they be yellowish in color and dull not nicely polish and although the square-toed ugly foot part look solid as a house the leg be more like wrinkle leather stocking and so long that the pulled-up one come nearly to the hip spur have make black mark on the yellow ankle and saddle and stirrup-leather have rub the leg and a sash whoever hear of a grown-up wear a sash it be a great blue silk thing wound round once or twice and tie with a great bow the end of which hang down in front of all the pip-squeak and yet the big man 's face be not that of a pip-squeak -- far from it it be very like grumper 's in fact the boy like the face it be strong and fierce thin and clean-cut -- mar only in he estimation by the funny little tuft of hair on the lower lip he like the wavy rough up-turned moustache but not that silly tuft how nice he would look with he hair cut he lower lip shave and he ridiculous silk velvet and lace exchange for a tweed shooting-suit or cricketing-flannel how grumper father major decy and even khodadad khan and the sepoy would have laugh at the get-up nay they would have blush for the fellow -- a sahib a gentleman -- to tog himself up so the boy also like the man 's voice when he turn towards the tent and call : -- lubin you drunken dog come hither a call which bring forth a servant-like person who by reason of he clean-shaven face and red nose remind the boy of pattern the coachman he wear a dark cloth suit cotton stocking shoe that have neither lace nor button but fasten with a kind of strap and buckle and queer creature a big eton collar sword and horse rascal say the gentleman and warn digby for duty bring I wine and a manchet of bread the man bow and re-enter the tent to emerge a moment later bear _ the sword _ how the cut-steel hilt sparkle and shine how bright and red the leather scabbard -- now black dull crack and crumble but it be unmistakeably _ the _ sword it hang from a kind of broad cross-belt and be attach to it by several parallel buckled strap -- not like father 's sam browne belt at all

swish they tail toss they head and fidget generally from a neighbouring tent come the sound of a creak camp-bed two foot strike the ground with violence and a prodigious prolonged yawn a voice then announce that all parade should be hold in hell and that it be better to be dead than damned why should gentleman drill on a fine evening while the world hold wine and woman after a brief space occupy

hear dearest sing they drink to I only with thine eye and i will pledge with mine : or leave a kiss within the cup and i 'll not look for wine the thirst that from the soul doth rise doth ask a drink divine but might i of jove 's nectar sup i would not change for thine lubin appear bear a funny fat black bottle a black cup -lrb- both appear to be of leather -rrb- and a kind of leaden plate on

much like he he lace collar be enormous and he black velvet coat be embroidered all over with yellow silk design flower and pattern it be like the silly mantel-border and thing that mr pont the housekeeper do in she leisure time -lrb- cruel-work she call it and the boy quite agree -rrb- this man 's face be pink and fair he hair golden warn he not of the hilt-thrust seymor lad he say suddenly give it he first -- for a sneering bullying taverning chamber knave the tall gentleman glance at he down-flung cup raise he eyebrow and drink from the bottle such _ would _ annoy _ you _ hal of course

very like fire the gentleman -lrb- call seymor -rrb- pat it fondly stroke he nose and give it a piece of he bread well crony long-face he say fondly he then put he left foot in the great box-stirrup and swing himself into the saddle -- a very different kind of saddle from those with which the boy be familiar it remind he of circus and the lord mayor 's show it be big enough for two and there be a lot of velvet and stuff about it and a fine gold _ cr _ -- whatever that might mean -- on a big pretty cloth under it -lrb- perhaps the gentleman 's initial be cr just as he own be d de w and on some of he thing -rrb- the great fat handle of a great fat pistol stick up on each side of the front of the saddle follow say the gentleman to the iron-bound person and move off at a walk towards a road not far distant stap he spit he seymor call the pink-faced man and warn he not of the hilt-thrust as he pass the corner of the camp two man with great axe-headed spear thing perform curious evolution with they cumbersome weapon finally lay the business end of they on the ground as the gentleman ride by he touch he hat to they with he switch continue for a mile or so at a walk he enter a dense coppice and dismount await I he say to he follower give he the curb-rein and walk on to a open glade a hundred yard away -lrb- it be a perfect spot for red indian smuggler robin hood robinson crusoe or any such game the boy note -rrb- almost at the same time three other man enter the clearing two together and one from a different quarter for the hundredth time seymor lad _ mention not the hilt-thrust _ as you love I and the king say this last one quietly as he approach the gentleman and then the two couple behave in a ridiculous manner with they befeathered hat wave they in great circle as they bow to each other and finally lay they on they heart before replace they mine honor be my guide will answer the gentleman call seymor somewhat pompously the boy consider though he do not know the word sir seymor then begin to remove the slash coat and other garment until he stand in he silk stocking baggy knickerbockers and jolly cambric shirt -- nice and loose and free at the neck as the boy think he roll up he right sleeve draw the sword and make one or two pass -- like sergeant havlan always do before he begin fence the other two man meantime have be behave somewhat similarly -- talk together earnestly and one of they undress the one who do this be a very powerful-looking man and the arm he bare remind the boy of that of a strong man he have see recently at monksmead fair in a tent and strangely enough he face remind he of that of he own father he have a nasty face though the boy consider and look like a bounder because he have pimple a swelly nose a loud voice and a swanky manner the boy disapprove of he wholly it be like he cheek to resemble father as well as to have the same name he companion come over to the gentleman call will carry the strong man 's bared sword and bow ridiculously -lrb- with he hat both hand and he foot -rrb- say : -- shall we measure captain ormonde delorme captain delorme then take the sword from sir seymor bow as the other have do and hand he the sword with a mighty flourish hilt first it prove to be half a inch shorter than the other and captain delorme remark that he principal would waive that he and the strong man 's companion then choose a spot where the grass be very short and smooth where there be no stone twig or inequality and where the light of the setting sun fall sideways upon the combatant -- who tip-toe gingerly and rather ridiculously in they stockinged foot to they respective position face each other they salute with they sword and then stand with the right arm point downward and across the body so that the hilt of the sword be against the right thigh and the blade direct to the rear one word sir matthew de warrenne say sir seymor as they pause in this attitude if my point rest for a second on you hilt _ you be a dead man _ sir matthew laugh in a ugly manner and reply : -- and what be you knavish design now sir seymor stukeley my design _ be _ to warn you of a infallible trick of fence sir matthew it _ now _ be to kill you -- for the insult and on behalf of you own unhappy daughter the other yawn and remark to he friend : -- i have a parade in half a hour on guard cry the person address draw he sword and strike a attitude play cry captain delorme do similarly both principal crouch somewhat hold they sword horizontal with point to the adversary 's breast and hilt draw back arm sharply bent -- for both it appear have perfect the art of art in italy these nicety escape the boy in he earlier dreaming of the dream -- but the time come when he could name every pass parry invitation and riposte the strong man suddenly throw he sword-hand high and towards he left shoulder keep he sword horizontal and expose the whole of he right side sir seymor lunge hard for he rib beneath the right arm-pit and as the other 's sword swoop down to catch he twist it over and riposte he feint clear the descend sword and thrust at the throat a swift duck crouch let the sword pass over the strong man 's head and only a powerful french circular parry save the life of sir seymor stukeley as the boy realize later he fight italian in principle and use the best of french parry riposte and trick upon occasion -- and he own perfect combination of the two school make he accord to captain delorme the best fencer in the king 's army so at least the captain say to the other second as they amicably chat while they friend seek to slay each other before they hard indifferent-seeming eye to the boy they talk convey little -- as yet the duellist step back as the phrase end and then sir seymor give a invitation hold he sword-arm wide to the right of he body sir matthew lunge he sword be catch carry out to the leave and hold there as sir seymor 's blade slide inward along it just in time sir matthew 's inward pressure carry sir seymor 's sword clear to the right again sir matthew disengage over and as the sudden release bring sir seymor 's sword spring in he thrust under that gentleman 's right arm and scratch he side as he recover he sword he hold it for a moment with the point raise toward sir seymor 's face instantly sir seymor 's point tinkle on he hilt and captain delorme murmur finis beneath he breath sir stukeley seymor 's blade shot in sir matthew 's move to parry and the point of the advance sword flicker under he hand turn upward and pierce he heart yes say captain delorme as the stricken man fall if he parry outward the point go under if he anticipate a feint it come straight in and if he parry a lunge-and-feint-under he get feint-over before he can come up i have never see stukeley miss when once he rest on the hilt _ exit _ de warrenne -- and hell the worse for it -- and the boy awake he kiss the sword and fall asleep again one day when receive he morning fencing and boxing lesson of sergeant havlan he astonish that warrior -lrb- and make a bitter enemy of he -rrb- by warn he against allow he blade to rest on the sergeant 's hilt and by hit he clean and fair whenever it be allow to happen also by talk of the italian school of fence and of invitation -- the which be wholly outside the fencing-philosophy of the french-trained swordsman at the age of fifteen the boy be too good for the man who have be the best that aldershot have know who have run a _ salle d'arme _ for year and who be much seek by ambitious member of the sword club the sword from the day of that newly vivid dream become to the boy what he symbol be to the religious fanatic and he be content to sit and stare at it muse for hour the

deadwood dick texa joe and red indian of no manners and nasty custom i want you funky warren i be go to torture you he announce with a truculent scowl and a suggestive lick of blubber lip dam survey he coolly of thick build the bully be of thicker wit and certainly of no proven courage four year older than dam and quite four inch taller he have never dream of molest he before innumerable as be the story of he brutality to the smallest squeaker and of he cruel practical joke on new boy there be no story of he fight such as there be about ormond delorme of dam 's form whose habit it be to implore bigger boy of they courtesy to fight he and to trail he coat where there be chaw about i be go to torture you funky every day you must come to I and _ beg _ I to do it if you do not come and pray for it i 'll come to _ you _ and you 'll get it double and treble if you sneak you 'll get it quadru -- er -- quadrupedal -- and also be know as sneaky as well as funky see he continue how will

I nit be dam 's firm but gentle reply and a little pulse begin to beat beneath he cheek bone oh ho smile master harberth then i 'll _ begin _ here and when you be break and blub you 'll come with I -- and get just double for a start dam 's spirit rise and he feel almost happy -- certainly far better than he have do since the hapless encounter with the bottled adder and he fall from grace it be a positive _ joy _ to have a enemy he could tackle a real flesh-and-blood foe and tormentor that come upon he in broad daylight and in mere human form after countless thousand of century of awful nightmare struggle -- in which he be bind hand-and-foot and doom to failure and torture from the outset the sport plaything and victim of a fearful intangible horror -- this would be sheer amusement and recreation what could mere man do to _ he _ much less mere boy why the most awful torture-chamber of the holy inquisition of old be a pleasant recreation-room compare with _ any _ place where the snake could enter oh if the snake could only be meet and fight in the open with free hand and untrammelled limb as bully harberth could oh if it could only inflict mere physical pain instead of such agony of terror as make the idea of any bodily injury -- mere cut burning beating blind -- a trifling nothing-at-all anyhow he could _ imagine _ that bully harberth be the snake or its emissary and since he be indirectly bring upon he by the snake regard he as a myrmidon -- and deal with he accordingly how do you like this inquire that young gentleman as he suddenly seize the seat and unsuspecting dam by the head crush he down with he superior weight and dig cruelly into the side of he neck below the ear with he powerful thumb and finger it be call ` gripper ' you 'll begin to enjoy it in a minute in a few seconds the pain become acute and after a couple of minute excruciate dam keep absolutely still and perfectly silent to harberth this be disappointing and after a time he grow tired release he impassive victim he arise preparatory to introduce the next item of he program of torture how do you like _ this _ inquire dam rise also -- and he smite he tormentor with all he strength beneath the point of he chin rage pain rebellion and undying hatred -lrb- of the snake -rrb- lend such force to the skilful blow -- behind which be the weight and upward spring of he body -- that bully harberth go down like a nine-pin he big head strike the sharp edge of a desk with great violence he lay still and white with closed eye golly shrill the haddock funky warren have murder bully harberth hooray hooray and he caper with joy a small crowd quickly collect and it be learn from credible eye-witness that the smaller boy have neither stab the bully in the back nor club he from behind but have well and truly smitten he on the jaw with he fist he go at one bind from despise outcast coward to belauded admire hero you 'll be hang of course warren say delorme and a jolly good job reply dam fervently and sincerely as he speak harberth twitched move he arm and leg and open he eye sit up he blink owl-like and inquire as to what be up you be down be what be up reply delorme oh -- he be not dead squeak the haddock and there be a piteous break in he voice what be up ask harberth again why funky -- that be to say warren -- knock you out and you have get to give he best and ask for _ pax _ or else fight he say delorme add hopefully but of course you 'll fight he harberth arise and walk to the nearest seat he hit I a ` coward 's poke ' when i be not look quoth he it be well know he be a coward you be a liar bully harberth observe delorme he hit you fair and anyhow he be not afraid of _ you _ if you do not fight he you become funky harberth _ vice _ funky warren -- no longer funky so you would better fight see the harberth bubble be evidently prick for the sentiment be applaud to the echo i do not fight coward mumble harberth hold he jaw -- and at this meanness dam be move to go up to harberth and slap he right hard upon he plump invite cheek a good resounding blow that make he hand tingle with pain and he heart with pleasure he still identify he somehow with the snake and have a glorious if pass sensation of successful revolt and some revenge he feel as the lash galley-slave must have feel when during a lower-deck mutiny he break from he oar and spring at the throat of the cruel overseer the embodiment and source of the agony starvation toil brutality and hopeless woe that have thrust he below the level of the beast -lrb- fortunate beast -rrb- that perish now you have _ get _ to fight he of course say delorme and flee to spread the glad tiding far and wide i -- i -- do not feel well now mumble harberth i 'll fight he when i be better and shamble away outraged puzzle disgusted what be the world come to the little brute he have a punch like the kick of a horse the little cad -- to _ dare _ well he would show he something if he have the face to stand up to he betters and older and bigger in the ring news of the affair spread like wild-fire and the incredible conduct of the extraordinary funky warren -- say to be no longer funky -- become the topic of the hour at tea dam be solemnly ask if it be true that he have cast harberth from a lofty window and bring he to death 's door or that of the hospital whether he have strangle he with the result that he have a permanent squint if he have so kick he as to break both he thigh bone if he have offer to fight he with one hand even certain more or less grave and reverend senior of the upper school take a well-disguised interest in the matter and pretend that the affair should be allow to go on as it would do harberth a lot of good if de warrenne could lick he and do the latter a lot of good to reinstate himself by show that he be not really a coward in essential of course they take no interest in the fight as a fight certainly not -lrb- but it be observe that flaherty of the sixth stop the fight most angrily and peremptorily when it be over and that no sign of anger or peremptoriness escape he until it be over -- and he happen to pass behind the gymnasium curiously enough just as it start -rrb- good advice be shower upon dam from all side he be counsel to live on meat to be a vegetarian to rise at 4 be and swim to avoid all brain-fag to run twenty mile a day to rest until the fight to get up in the night and swing heavy dumb-bell to eat no pudding to drink no tea to give up sugar avoid ice and deny himself all tuck and everything else that make life worth live he do none of these thing -- but simply go on as usual save in one respect for the first time since the adder episode he be really happy why he do not know save that he be about to get some of he own back to strike a blow against the cruel coward incubus -lrb- for he persist in identify harberth with the snake and in regard he as a materialization of the life-long enemy -rrb- and possibly to enjoy a brief triumph over what have so long triumph over he if he be at this time a little mad the wonder be that he be still on the right side of the lunatic asylum gate mad or not he be happy -- and the one thing want be the presence of lucille at the fight how he would have love to show she that he be not really a coward -- give a fair chance and a tangible foe if only lucille could be there -- dancing from one foot to the other and squealing -lrb- strictly _ between _ and not during the round of course -rrb- buck up dammy ginger for pluck never say croak a very large and very informal committee take charge of the business of the fight and what be allude to as a friendly boxing contest between bully harberth of the fifth and de warrenne -- late funky -- be arrange for the follow Saturday afternoon on be ask by a delegate of the say large and informal committee as to whether he would be train by then or whether he would prefer a more distant date dam reply that he would be glad to fight harberth that very moment -- and thus gain the reputation of a fierce and determine fellow -lrb- though erstwhile funky -- the queer creature -rrb- those who have be loudest in dub he funky warrenne be quickest in finding explanation of he curious conduct and explain it well away it be at this time that dam 's heart go wholly and finally out to ormonde delorme who roundly state that he father a bemedalled heroic colonel of gurkha be in a blind perishing funk during a thunderstorm and always seek shelter in the wine cellar when one be in progress in he vicinity darn present delorme with he knife and a tiger 's tooth forthwith Saturday come and dam almost regret its advent for though a child in year he be sufficiently old weary and cynical in spirit to know that all life 's fruit contain dust and ash that the joy of anticipation exceed those of realization and that with possession die desire with the fight would end the glorious feeling of successful revolt and if he overcome one emissary of the snake there would be a million more to take he place and if providence should be as usual on the side of the big battalion and the older taller stronger heavier boy should win why -- then he would bully the loser to he heart 's content and the limit of he ingenuity good let he he would fight he every day with the greatest pleasure a chance to fight the snake on fair term be all he ask time and place have be well choose and there be little likelihood of interference some experienced youth probably cokeson himself have make arrangement as to seconds time-keeper judge and referee and though there be no ring of rope and stake a twenty-four-foot square have be mark out and inclose by form and bench seat be provide for the official and senior and two stool for the principal a couple of bowl of water sponge and towel lend a business-like air to the scene to he delight dam discover that delorme be to be he second -- a person of sound advice useful ministration and very present help in time of trouble delorme lead he to he stool in a angle of the square of bench bid he spread wide he arm and leg and breathe deeply for all he be worth with he eye close and he thought fix on jolly thing feel himself the cynosure of neighbouring eye and able to hear the comment of the crowd the last part of he second 's instruction be a little difficult of strict observation however he continue to think of lick harberth -- the jolliest thing he could conceive until he mind wander home to lucille and he enhance the imaginary jollity by conceive she present sturdy little brute observe a big fifth form boy seat with a couple of friend on the bench beside he but i would lay two to one in sov -lrb- if i have 'em -rrb- that he do not last a single round with harberth disgrace to harberth if he do not eat the kid alive respond the other get a good jaw and mouth though say the third go to die hard you 'll see good little kid fancy funk a bottled frog or something and fight a chap who can give he about four year four inch and four stone observe the first speaker yes queer little beast he knock harberth clean out they say perhaps he father have have he properly teach and he can really box ever see he play footer nippiest little devil _ i _ ever see staunch too rum go comment he friend dam thought of sergeant havlan and he son the punching-ball and the fighting day at monksmead perhaps he could really box after all anyhow he know enough to hit straight and put he weight into it to guard chin and mark to use he foot duck dodge and side step suppose harberth know as much well -- since he be far stronger taller and heavier the only hope of success lay in the fact that he be connect with the snake -- from whom mere blow in the open would be welcome anyhow he would die or win the positive joy of fight _ it _ in the glorious day and open air instead of in the bottomless pit -- bind stifled mad with fear -- none could realize bully harberth enter the ring accompany by shanner who look like a sixth form boy and be in the shell harberth wear a thick sweater and look very strong and heavy if the little kid last three round with _ that _ observe cokeson to coxe major he ought to be chair dam be dispose to agree with he in he heart but he have no fear the feeling that _ he _ brief inning have come -- after the snake have have its will of he for a dozen year -- swallow up all other feeling coxe major step into the ring i announce a friendly boxing contest between harberth of the fifth nine stone seven and funky warren -lrb- say to be no longer funky -rrb- of barton 's house weight not worth mention he declaim be the glove all right call cokeson -lrb- whose father own racehorse be a pillar of the national sport club and deeply interested in the welfare of a certain sport newspaper -rrb- no fault can be find with warren 's glove say shanner come over to dam there be nothing wrong with the glove here add delorme after visit harberth 's corner this be the less remarkable in that there be no glove whatsoever presumably the fiction of a friendly boxing contest be to be stoutly maintain the crowd of delighted boy laugh then come here both of you say cokeson the combatant comply do not hold and hit do not butt nor trip do not clinch do not use knee elbow nor shoulder when i call ` break away ' break without hit if you do any of these thing you will be jolly well disqualify fight fair and god have mercy on you soul to dam it seem that the advice be superfluous -- and of god 's mercy on he soul he have have experience return to they corner the two strip to the waist and sit ready array in shorts and gymnasium shoe see thus they look most unevenly match harberth look still bigger for undress and dam even smaller but as the know coxe major observe what there be of dam be in the right place -- and be muscle certainly he be finely make seconds out of the ring _ time _ call the time-keeper and dam spring to he foot and run at harberth who swing a mighty round-arm blow at he face as dam duck and smite he hard and true just below the breast-bone and fairly on the mark the bully 's grunt of anguish be drown in howl of shake hand they have not shake hand stop stop the fight shout cokeson and as they back from each other he inquire with anger and reproach in he voice : -- be this a friendly boxing-contest or a vulgar fight add get to you corner and when _ time _ be call shake hand and then begin turn to the audience he continue in a lordly and injured manner : and there be only _ one _ referee gentleman please keep silence or i shall stop the fight -- i mean -- the friendly boxing contest as dam sit down delorme whisper : -- splendid _ in_fighting be you tip duck and go for the body every time he know nothing of boxing i should say tire he -- and remember that if he get you with a swing like that you be out seconds out of the ring _ time _ call the time-keeper and dam walk towards harberth with outstretched hand meet he in the middle of the ring and shake hand with great repugnance as harberth 's hand leave dam 's it rise swiftly to dam 's face and knock he down shame foul poke coward be some of the indignant cry that arise from the spectator silence roar the referee _ will _ you shut up and be quiet perfectly legitimate -- if not very sport dam spring to he foot absolutely unhurt and if possible more determine than ever it be only because he have be stand with foot together that he have be knock down at all have he be give time to get into spar position the blow would not have move he nor be harberth himself in a attitude to put much weight behind the blow and it be more a cuff than a punch circle round he enemy dam spar for a opening and watch he style and method evidently the bully expect to make short work of he and he carry he right fist as though it be a weapon and not a part of he body as he advance with he right extend quiver menacing and

wait for he to develop he attack but strike the bully 's left arm down with he own left dam hit over it with he right and reach he nose and -- so curious be the workings of the human mind -- thought of mose strike the rock and bring forth water the sight of blood seem to distress harberth and leap in as the latter draw he hand across he mouth dam drive with all he strength at he mark and with such success that harberth double up and fetch he breath with deep groan dam stand clear and wait delorme call out you have a right to finish he and be sternly reprove by the referee as harberth straighten up dam step towards he but the bully turn and run to he stool as he reach it amid roar of execration the time-keeper arise and cry _ time _ you have he you little ass say delorme as he

left both to guard and to hit also he have learn something from dam and on one occasion as the latter go at he face with a straight left he drop the top of he head towards he and make a fierce hook punch at dam 's body luckily it be a little high but it wind he for a moment and have he opponent rush he then dam could have do nothing at all just as time be call harberth swing a great round-arm blow at dam which would have knock he head over heel have not he let he knee go just in time and duck under it hit he foe once again on the mark with all he strength how d'you feel asked delorme as

time _ call the time-keeper and delorme cease fan with the towel splash a spongeful of water in dam 's face and back away with he stool harberth seem determine to make a end he rush at he opponent whirling he arm breathing stertorously and scowl savagely guard hurt dam 's arm he have no time to hit and in duck he be slow and get a blow -lrb- aim at he chin -rrb- in the middle of he forehead down he go like a nine-pin but be up as quickly and ready for harberth who have rush at he in the act of rise while the referee shout stand clear as he come on dam fall on one knee and drive at he mark again harberth grunt and place he hand on the smitten spot judge time and distance well dam hit with all he force at the bully 's chin and he go down like a log rise majestically the time-keeper lift up he voice and count : _ one -- two -- three -- four -- five -- six _ -- and harberth open he eye sit up _ seven -- eight -- nine _ -- and lay down again and just as dam be about to leap for joy and the audience to roar they approval -- instead of the fatal _ out _ the time-keeper call _ time _ have dam strike the blow a second sooner the fight would have be over and he would have win as it be harberth have the whole interval in which to recover dam 's own luck -lrb- but miss smellie have always say there be no such thing as luck -rrb- well -- so much the better _ fight _ the snake be the real joy and victory would end it so would defeat and he must not get cock-a-hoop and careless delorme fill he mouth with water and eject it in a fine spray over dam 's head and chest he be very proud of this feat but though most refreshing dam could have prefer that the water have come from a sprayer seconds out of the ring _ time _ call the referee harberth appear quite recover but he be of a curious color and seem tired act on he second 's advice dam give he whole attention to get at he opponent 's body again and overdo it as harberth strike at he with he left he duck and as he be aim at harberth 's mark he be suddenly knock from day into night from light into darkness from life into death year pass and dam strove to explain that the mainspring have break and that he have hear it

enough -- and walk to he chair bully harberth be beat -- and dam feel that the snake be farther from he than ever it have be since he could remember de warrenne win say cokeson and then flaherty of the sixth step into the ring and stop the fight with much show of wrath and indignation dam be wildly cheer and chair and thence-forth be as popular and as admire as he have be shun and despise nor do

snake damocle de warrenne gentleman-cadet on the eve of return from monksmead to the military academy of sandhurst appear to have something on he mind as he sit on the broad coping of the terrace balustrade and idly kick he heel every time he have return to monksmead from wellingborough and sandhurst he have find lucille yet more charming delightful and lovable as she skirt and hair lengthen she become more and more the real companion the pal the adviser without become any less the sportsman he have always love she quaint term of endearment slang and epithet but as she grow into a beautiful and refined and dignified girl it be still more piquant to be address in the highly unladylike -lrb- or un-smelliean -rrb- term that she affect dam never quite know when she begin to make he heart beat quicker and when she presence begin to act upon he as sunshine and she absence as dull cloud but there come a time when -lrb- whether she be ride to hound in she neat habit rowing with he in sweater and white skirt swing along the lane in thick boot and tailor-made costume sit at the piano after dinner in simple white dinner-gown or waltz at some ball -- always the belle thereof for he -rrb- he _ do _ know that lucille be more to he than a jolly pal a sound adviser a audience a confidant and ally perhaps the day she put she hair up mark a epoch in the tale of he affection he find that he begin to hate to see other fellow dance skating or play golf or tennis with she he do not like to see man speak to she at meet or take she in to dinner he want the blood of a certain neighbouring spring-captain a hunter of flapper and molester of parlour-maid home on furlough who make eye at she at the hunt ball and follow she about all cricket week and say something to she which as dam hear provoke she coolly to request he not to be such a priceless ass what it be she would not tell dam and he magnify it call like the silly raw boy he be upon the spring-captain and gently request he to let my cousin alone sir if you do not mind or -- er -- i 'll jolly well make you dam know thing about the gentleman and consider he wholly unfit to come within a mile of lucille the spring-captain be obviously much amuse and inwardly much annoyed -- but he cease he scarce-begun pursuit of the hoydenish-queenly girl for damocles de warrenne have a reputation for the cool prosecution of he undertaking and the complete fulfilment of he promise likewise he have a reputation for herculean strength and uncanny skill yet the gay captain have be strongly attract by the beauty and grace of the unspoilt unsophisticated bud woman with she sweet freshness and dignity -lrb- so quaintly enhance by lapse into the slangy unfettered schoolgirl -rrb- not that he be a marry man at all of course yes -- dam have it weightily on he mind that he might come down from sandhurst at any time and find lucille engage to some other fellow girl do get engage it be the natural and obvious thing for they to do she would get engage to some brainy clever chap worth a dozen of he own mediocre self of course she like he dearly as a pal and all that a ancient crony and chum -- but how should he hope to compete with the brilliant feller she would meet as she go about more and know they she be go to have a season in london next year think of the kind of chap she would run across in town in the season intellectual bird artist poet author traveller distinguish cove rise statesman under-secretary soldier swell all sort not much show for he against that lot gad what a rotten look-out what a rotten world to be sure fancy lose lucille should he put he fortune to the touch risk all and propose to she fellow do these thing in such circumstance no -- hardly fair to try to catch she like that before she have have at least one season and know what be what and who be who hardly the clean potato -- to take advantage of they long intimacy and try to trap she while she be a country mouse it be not as though he be clever and could hope for a great career and the power to offer she the position for which she be fit why he be nearly bottom of he year at sandhurst -- not a bit brilliant and brainy suppose she marry he in she inexperience and then meet the right sort of intellectual clever feller too late no it would not be the straight thing and decent at all to propose to she now how would grumper view such a step what have he to offer she what be he just a penniless orphan apart from grumper 's generosity he own a single five-pound note in money never win a scholarship or exam-prize in he life mere public school boxing and fencing champion and best man-at-arms at sandhurst with a score or so of pot for run jump sculling swimming shooting boxing fencing steeple-chasing and so forth he total patrimony encash would barely pay for he army outfit but for grumper 's kindness he could not go into the army at all and grumper the splendid old chap could not last very much longer why -- for many a long year he would not earn more than enough to pay he mess-bill and feed he horse not in england certainly be he to ask lucille to leave she luxurious home in a splendid mansion and live in a subaltern 's four-roomed hut in the plain in indium -lrb- even if he could scrape into the indian army so as to live on he pay -- more or less -rrb- grumper she guardian and executor of the late bishop 's will might have very different view for she why she might even be he heiress -- he be very fond of she the daughter of he lifelong friend and kinsman fancy a pauper make up to a very rich girl -- if it come to she be that which he devoutly hope it would not it would remove she so hopelessly beyond he reach by the time he could make a position and a income visible to the naked eye he would be grey-haired money be not make in the army rather be it become no place for a poor gentleman but the paradise of rich bounder brainy little squit of swotter and commission-without-training nondescript -- thanks to the grow insecurity of thing among the army class and gentry generally if she be really penniless he might -- as a captain -- ask she to share he poverty -- but be it likely shed be a spinster ten year hence -- even if he be a captain so soon promotion be not violently rapid in the cavalry and yet he simply hate the bare thought of life without lucille better to be a gardener at monksmead and see she every day than be the colonel of a cavalry corps and know she to be marry to somebody else yes -- he would come home one of these time from sandburst or he regiment and find she engage to some other fellow and what then well -- nothing -- only life would be of no further interest it be bind to happen everybody turn to look at she even woman give generous praise of she beauty grace and sweetness man rave about she and every male creature who come near she be obviously dpri in five minute the curate plump holy bill be well know to be fading away slowly and beautifully but quite surely on she account grumper 's old pal general harringport have confide to dam himself in the smoking-room one very late night that since he be fifty year too old for hope of success in that direction he would go solitary to he lonely grave -lrb- here a very wee hiccup -rrb- damn he eye so he would unwed unloved uneverything very trag -lrb- h -rrb- ic but such be life the general have declare the one alleviation be the fact that he might die any night now and ought to have do so a decade ago why even the little useless snob and tuft-hunter the haddock that tailor 's dummy and parody of a man cast sheep 's eye and make what he call love to she when down from oxford -lrb- and be duly snub for it and for he wretched foppery snobbery and folly -rrb- he would have to put the haddock across he knee one of these day then there be he old school pal and sandhurst senior ormonde delorme who frequently stay at and have just leave monksmead -- fairly dotty about she she certainly like delorme -- and no wonder so handsome clever accomplished and so fine a gentleman rich too better ormonde than another -- but god what pain even to think of it why have he clear off so suddenly by the way and obviously in trouble though he would not admit it lucille emerge from a french window and come swing across the terrace the young man he face aglow radiant rise to meet she it be a fine face -- with that look on it ordinarily it be somewhat mar by a slightly cynical grimness of the mouth and a hint of trouble in the eye -- a face a little too old

to extract a promise from the woman that she will turn to you for help if ever you help should be need -lrb- know that there could be no greater joy than to serve she at any cost whatsoever though it lead to death or ruin -rrb- but it be quite another thing when that help be invite for the benefit of the successful rival to go to the world 's end for lucille be a very small matter to ormonde delorme -- but to go across the road for the man who have win she away be not for dam _ have _ win she away from he delorme consider inasmuch as he have bring he to monksmead time after time have see he fall in love with lucille have receive he confidence and speak no warning word have he say but no poach delorme nothing more would have be necessary he would have keep away thenceforth and smother the flame ere it become a rage and consume fire no de warrenne have serve he badly in not tell he plainly that there be a understanding between he and he cousin in let he sink more and more deeply over head and ear in love in let he go on until he propose to lucille and learn from she that while she like he better than any man in the world but one -- she do not love he and that frankly yes she _ do _ love somebody else and it be hopeless for he to hope he read the letter again : -- my dear ormonde this be a beg letter and i should loathe to write it under the circumstance to any man but such a one as you for i be go to ask a great deal of you and to appeal to that nobleness of character for which i have always admire you and which make you poor dam 's hero from lower school day at wellingborough until you leave sandhurst -lrb- and alas quarrel with he -- or rather with he memory -- about I -rrb- that be a sad blow to I and i tell you again as i tell you before dam have not the faintest notion that _ i _ care for _ he _ and would not have tell I that he care for I have i not show it you belief that he do not trouble to warn you because he have I safe be utterly wrong absurd and unjust when you do I the great honor and pay I the undeserved and tremendous compliment of ask I to marry you and i tell you that i could not and _ why _ i could not i never dream that dam could care for I in that way and i know that i should never marry any one at all unless he do and on the same occasion ormonde you beg I to promise that if ever you could serve I in any way i would ask for you help you be a dear romantic boy then ormonde and i love you in a different way and cry all night that you and i could not be friend without thought of love and i most solemnly promise that i would turn to you if i ever need help that you could give -lrb- alas i think to myself then that nobody in the world could do anything for I that dam could not do and that i should never need help from other while he live -rrb- i want you help ormonde and i want it for dam -- and I you have of course hear some garbled scandal about he be drive away from home and cut off from sandhurst by grandfather i need not ask if you have believe ill of he and i need not say he be absolutely innocent of any wrong or failure whatever he be _ not _ a effeminate coward he be as brave as a lion he be a splendid hero ormonde and i want you to simply strangle and kill any man who say a word to the contrary when he leave home he enlist and haddon berner see he in uniform at folkestone where he have go from canterbury -lrb- cricket week -rrb- to see amelia harringport 's gang amelium whose sister be to be the reverend mr canon mellifle at folkestone you know meet the wretched haddon be rush along the front by a soldier and nearly die at the sight -- she declare he be weep directly she tell I i guess at once that he have meet dam and either insult or cut he and that poor dam in he bitter humor and self-loathing have use he own presence as a punishment and have make the haddock walk with he imagine the company of damocles de warrenne be anything but a ennobling condescension fancy dam 's society a horrible injury and disgrace to a thing like haddon berner well i simply haunt folkestone after that and develop a love for amelium harringport and she brother that surprise they -- hypocrite that i be -lrb- but i be punish when they talk slightingly of dam and she sneer at the man whom she have shamelessly pursue when all be well with he she ` admire ' haddon now -rrb- at last i meet he on one of my week-end visit -- on a Sunday evening it be -- and i simply fly at he in the sight of all respectable prayer-book-displaying before-church-parading well-behaved folkestone and kiss he nearly to death and can you believe a woman could be such a _ fool _ ormonde -- while carefully note the ' 2 qg ' on he shoulder-strap i never think to find out he _ alia _ -- for of course he hide he identity think as he do poor darling boy that he have bring eternal disgrace on a honor name -- a name that appear twice on the roll of the vc record ormonde be it not that it would _ increase _ he misery and agony of mind i would run away from monksmead take a room near the queen 's grey barracks and haunt the main gate until i see he again he should then tell I how to communicate with he or i would hang about there till he do i would marry he ` off the strength ' and live -lrb- till i be ` of age ' -rrb- by needlework if he would have I but of course he would _ never _ understand that i would be happier and a better woman in a shorncliffe lodging as a soldier 's wife than ever i shall be here in this dreary monksmead -- until he be restore and re-habilitated -lrb- be that the word i mean -- come into he own as a brave and noble gentleman who never do a mean or cowardly action in he life -rrb- and he be _ so _ thin and unhappy look ormonde and he poor hand be in such a state and he beautiful hair be all hack about and do like a soldier 's all short except for a long piece brush down he forehead and round to he cap -- oh dreadful and he have a scar on he face no wonder amelium never recognize he oh _ do _ help I ormonde i _ must _ find out how to address he i dare not let they know there be a _ d de warrenne _ in the regiment -- and he would never get it either -- he be probably smith or jone or robinson now if some horrid sergeant call out ` trooper d de warrenne ' when distribute letter dam would never answer to the name he think he have eternally disgraced and disgrace it further by drag it in the mire of the rank how _ can _ people be such snob be not a good private a better man than a bad officer why should there be any ` taint ' about serve you country in any capacity how _ can _ i find he ormonde unless you help I i could pay a servant to hang about the barracks until he recognize dam -- but that would be horrible for the poor boy he would deny it and say the man be mad i expect -- and it would be most unpleasant and unfair to dam to set some one to find out from he comrade what he call himself if he choose to hide from what he think be the chance of further disgrace he people and suffer what he do in order to remain hidden shall _ i _ be the one to do anything to show he up and cause he worse suffering -- expose he to a servant how _ can _ i get he a letter that shall not have he name on it if i write to he colonel or the adjutant and enclose a letter with just ` dam ' on it they would not know for whom it be mean -- and i dare not tell they he real name could you get a letter to he ormonde without let he know that you know he be a private soldier and without let a soul know he real name i do apologize for the length of this interminable letter but if you only know the _ relief _ it be to I to be do something that may help he and to be talk or rather write about he you would forgive I he name must not be mention here think of it oh if it only would not make he _ more _ unhappy i would go to he this minute and refuse ever to leave he again do that sound unmaidenly ormonde i do not care whether it do or not nor whether it _ be _ or not i love he and he love I i be he _ friend _ could i stay here in luxury if it would make he happier to marry I be i a terribly abandon female i tell auntie yvette just what i have do and though it simply save she life to know he have not commit suicide -lrb- i believe she _ worship _ father -rrb- -- she seem mortally shock at I for behave so i be not a bit ashamed though dam be more important than good form and i have to show he in the strongest possible way that he be dearer to I than ever if it _ be _ ` behave like a servant-girl ' -- all honor to servant-girl i think consider the circumstance you should have see he face before he catch sight of I yes -- _ and _ after too though really i think he suffer more from my kiss he -- in uniform in the street -- than if i have cut he it would be only for the minute though it _ must _ comfort he _ now _ and always to think that i love he so -lrb- since he love _ I _ -- and always have do -rrb- but what i must know before i can sleep peacefully again be the name by which he go in the ' 2 qg 's ' so that i can write and comfort he regularly send he thing and make he buy himself out when he see he have be foolish and wicked in suppose that he have publicly disgraced himself and he name and we and i be go to make grandfather 's life a misery and go about skinny and ragged and weep and say : ' _ this _ be how you treat the daughter of you dead friend you wicked cruel unjust old man ' until he relent and send for dam and get he into the army properly but i be afraid dam will think it he silly duty to flee from I and all my work and hide himself where the name of de warrenne and stukeley be unknown and can not be disgrace i rely on you ormonde you ashamed grateful friend lucille gavestone second

soldier again -- much less kiss one not that she would want to kiss he again like that that be the kiss of welcome of encouragement of proof that she be unchanged to he -- she first sight of he after the _ débâcle _ it be the unchecked impulse of a noble heart -- and the action show that miss smellie have be unable to do it much harm with she miserable artificiality and stifling of all that be natural and human and right should he read the letter at once or treasure it up and keep it as a treat in store he would hold it in he hand unopened and imagine its contents he would spin out the glorious pleasure of possession of a unopened letter from lucille he could of course read it hundred of time -- but he would then soon know it by heart and although its charm and value would be no

-- and reward the wise thank god for work and for sleep -- and pay large premia of the former as insurance in the latter to damocles de warrenne -- to whom the name trooper matthewson now seem the only one he have ever have -- the crave necessity of life and sanity be _ work _ occupation mental and physical labor he would have bless the man who sentence he to commence the digging of a trench ten mile long and a yard deep for morning and evening labor and to take over all the account of each squadron for employment in the heat of the day there be no man in the regiment so indefatigable so energetic so persevere so insatiable of fatigue so willing and anxious to do other people 's duty as well as he own so restless so untiring as trooper matthewson of e troop for damocles de warrenne be in the land of the serpent and live in fear he live in fear and fear to live he think of fear and fear to think he turn to work as but for the memory of lucille he would have turn to drink : he labor to earn deep dreamless sleep and he dread sleep awake he could drug himself with work asleep he be the prey -- the bind gag helpless abject prey -- of the snake the greediest glutton for work in the best working regiment in the world be trooper matthewson -- but for he be no promotion he be alas unreliable -- apt to be drunk and disorderly drunk to the point of see snake and become a weep scream lunatic -- a disgusting spectacle and when bring up for sentence would solemnly assure the colonel that he be _ a total abstainer _ and stick to it when told-off for add impudent lie to shameful indulgence and sickening behavior no promotion for that type of waster while colonel the earl of a -- command the queen 's grey nor while captain daunt command the squadron the trooper occasionally disgraced but he have he point mark you and it be a thousand pity that so fine a soldier be undeniably subject to attack of _ delirium tremen _ and unmistakeably a secret drinker who might at any time have a violent outburst finish in scream sob and tear a _ most _ remarkable case who ever hear of a magnificent athlete -- regimental champion boxer and swordsman admittedly as fine and bold a horseman and horse-master as the rough-riding sergeant-major or the riding-master himself -- be a sufficiently industrious secret-drinker to get go of dt to drink till he behave like some god-and-man-forsaken wretch that live on cheap gin in a chronic state of alcoholism he have he point and if the brigadier have ever happen to say to the colonel : send I you smartest most intelligent and keenest man to gallop for I at the maneuver or the inspector of army gymnasium have ask for the regiment 's finest specimen or if one representative private soldier have to be send somewhere to uphold the credit and honor of the queen 's grey undoubtedly trooper matthewson would have be choose what a splendid squadron-sergeant major regimental sergeant-major yea what a fine officer he would have make have he be reliable but there you can not have a officer nor a non-com either who lie shriek and blubber on the floor _ coram publico _ and scream to god and man to save he from the snake that exist only in he own drink-deranged mind for of course it can only be drink that produce snake yes it be only through the ghastly alcohol-tinted glass that you can see snake -- any fool know _ that _ and the fool of the queen 's grey know it and hope to god that matthewson would keep off it till after the divisional boxing tournament and assault-at-arm for if he do the queen 's grey would certainly have the best man-at-arms in the division and have a mighty good shot at have the heavy-weight all-india champion since matthewson have challenge the holder and hold a absolutely unbroken record of victory in the various regimental and inter-regimental boxing tournament in which he have take part since join the regiment and he have be up against some useful lad as captain chevalier the president and maecena of the queen 's grey ' boxing-club express it yes matthewson have he point and the man who bring the regiment the kudos of have best man-at-arms and heavy-weight champion of indium would be forgive a lot and damocle de warrenne bless the divisional boxing tournament assault-at-arm and particularly the all-india heavy-weight championship occupation labor anodyne work and deep sleep fight to keep the snake at bay no fight to get away from it -- there be no keep it at bay -- nothing but shriek collapse when it come from parade ground to gymnasium from gymnasium to swimming-bath from swimming-bath to running-track from running-track to boxing-ring from boxing-ring to gymnasium again work occupation forgetfulness forget the snake for a little while -- even though it be surely lurk near -- wait wait wait nay even beneath he very foot and _ move _ well a man can struggle with himself until the thing actually appear in the concrete and he go mad -- but night oh god grant deep sleep at night -- or wide wakefulness _ and a light _ neither nightmare nor wakefulness _ in the dark _ oh merciful god yes thing be get worse _ he be go mad mad _ desert -- and get out of indium somehow never no gentleman desert anything or anybody suicide -- and face god unafraid and unashamed never the worst and meanest form of desert no stick it and live to work -- work to live and strive and strive and strive to obliterate the image of lucille -- that sorrow 's crown of sorrow and so trooper matthewson 's course of training be a severe one and he appear to fear rest and relaxation as some people fear work and employment he favorite occupation be to get the ten best boxer of the regiment to jointly engage in a ten-round contest with he one round each he would frequently finish fresher than the tenth man come of notedly powerful stock on both side and have be physically _ educate _ from babyhood dam with clean living and constant training be a very uncommon specimen there may have be one or two other man in the regiment as well develop or nearly so but when poise rapidity and skill be take into account there be no one near he captain chevalier say he be infinitely the quickest heavy-weight boxer he have ever see -- and captain chevalier be a pillar of the national sport club and always know the current professional personally when he be in england in fact with the enormous strength of the best heavy-weight dam combine the lightning rapidity and mobility of the best feather-weight he own doubt as to the result of he contest with the heavy-weight champion of indium arise from the fact that the latter be a person of much lower nervous development a creature far less sensitive to shock a denser and more elementary organism altogether and possess of a far thicker skull shorter jaw and thicker neck dam sum he up thus with no sense of contemptuous superiority but with a plain recognition of the fact that the champion be a fight machine a dull foreheadless brutal gladiator who owe he championship very largely to the fact that he be barely sensible to pain and impervious to padded blow it be say that he have never be knock out in all he boxing-career that the kick of a horse on he chin would not knock he out that he head be solid bone and that the shortness of he jaw and thickness of he neck absolutely prevent sufficient leverage between the point of the jaw and the spinal cord for the administration of the shock to the _ medullum oblonga _ that cause the necessary ten-seconds ' unconsciousness of the knock-out he be know as the gorilla by reason of he long arm incredible strength beauty and pleasing habit and he bear the reputation of a merciless and unchivalrous opponent and one who need the strictest and most experienced referee it would be a real terrific fight and that be the main thing to dam though he would do he very utmost to win for the credit of the queen 's grey and would leave no stone unturn to that end he regret that he could not get leave and go to pultanpur to see the champion box and learn something of he style and method when easily defend he title in the pultanpur tournament and when the tournament and assault-at-arm be over he must find something else to occupy he by day and tire he before night meanwhile life be bearable with the fight to come -- except for sentry-go work that be awful unspeakable and each time be worse than the last sit up all night in the guard-room under the big lamp and perhaps with some other wakeful wretch to talk to be nothing that be well enough -- but to be on a lonely post on a dark night well -- he could not do it much longer darkness and the snake that be always come and never come to prowl round and round some magazine store or boundary-stone with he carbine at the support or to tramp up and down by the horse-line arm only with he cutting-whip to stand in a sentry-box while the rain fall in sheet and there be no tell what the next flash of lightning might reveal -- that be what would send he to a lunatic 's padded cell to see the snake by day would give he a cruel terrible fit -- but to be aware of it in the dark would be final -- and fatal to he reason -lrb- which be none too firmly enthrone -rrb- no he have the dreadful feeling that he reason be none too solidly base and fix he have horrible experience apart from the snake-nightmare nowadays one night when he awake and lay stare up at he mosquito-curtain in the bless light of the big room-lamp -lrb- always provide in indium on account of rifle thief -rrb- he have suddenly feel a overwhelming surge of fear he sit up god -- he be in a marble box these white wall and roof be not mosquito-netting they be solid marble he be in a tomb he be bury alive the air be grow foul he scream would be absolutely inaudible he scream and strike wildly at the cold cruel marble and find it be soft yield net after all but it be a worse horror to find that he have think it marble than if he have find it to be marble he spring from he cot i be go mad he cry goin ' _ gorn _ more like observe the disrobe room-corporal why donchew keep orf the booze maffewson you silly

evening the sergeant of the guard have be inform that a corpse lay in the mortuary a young soldier have be take ill and have die within a few hour of some disease of a distinctly choleraic nature i 'll tell _ you _ orf for that post matthewson say the sergeant p ` rap you 'll see ghosty there for a change for it be customary to mount a sentry over the dead ` ole when it contain a occupant and one of the sentry 's please duty be to rap loudly and frequently upon the door throughout the night to scare away those vermin which be no respecter of person when the person happen to be dead and the vermin ravenous i be not afraid of ghost sergeant reply dam -- though he heart sink within he at the thought of the long lonely vigil in the dark when he would be so utterly at the mercy of the snake -- the snake over whom he have just win a signal victory and who would be all the more vindictive and terrible in consequence could he keep sane through the lonely darkness of those dreadful hour perhaps -- if he keep himself in some severe physical agony he would put a spur beneath he tight-drawn belt and next to he skin he would strike he knee frequently with the toe of the butt of he carbine he would put pebble in he boot and he would cause cramp in he limb one after the other any kind of pain would help \* \* \* \* \* it must be quarter of a hour since he have rap on the mortuary door and send he message of prohibition to mouse rat bandicoot civet-cat wild-cat or other vermin intruder through the roof-ventilation hole he would knock again a strange thing this -- knock at a dead man 's door in the middle of the night suppose the dead man call come in it would be intensely interesting but in no wise terrifying or horrible presumably poor young trooper priddell be no more dangerous or dreadful in the spirit than he have be in the flesh fortunate young man be he only on sentry-go outside the peaceful mortuary and damocle de warrenne stretch on the bier within to await the morrow and its pomp and ceremony when the carcass of the dead soldier would receive honor never pay to the living sentient man be he never so worthy heroic virtuous and deserving oh to be lie in there at rest to be on the other side of that close door at peace to-morrow that poor dead yokel 's body would receive a present arm -lrb- as though he be a armed party command by a officer -rrb- from the guard which the sentry would turn out as the coffin pass the guard-room for the first and last time in he life he would get a _ present arm _ it would not be in he _ life _ though for the first and last time in he death that do not sound right either anyhow he would get it and lot of strange inexplicable origin-forgotten rite would be observe over this piece of clay -- hitherto so cheaply hold and roughly treat queer as trooper priddell he be of no account as a piece of fast-decaying carrion he would be the center of a piece of elaborate ceremonial he troop would parade in full dress and -lrb- save for a firing-party of twelve who would carry carbine -rrb- without arm a special black horse would be deck out with a pall of black velvet and black plume across this horse the spur jackboot of the dead man would be sling with toe point to the rear two man wear black cloak would lead the horse by means of new handkerchief pass through the bridoon ring of its bridle handkerchief which would become they perquisite and _ memento morus _ with crape-draped drum the band in silence would lead the troop to the mortuary where would await it a gun-carriage with its six horse and coffin-supporting attachment here the troop would break rank file into the mortuary and bare-headed take each man he last look at the face of the dead as he lay in he coffin the lid would then be screw on the troop would form a double line face inward the firing-party would present arm and six of the dead man 's more particular pal or of he towny would bear the coffin out and place it upon the gun-carriage it would then be cover with a union jack and on it would be place the helmet sword and carbine of the deceased trooper the firing-party standing meanwhile lean on they reversed carbine with bow head as the melancholy procession form up for its march to the graveyard the smallest and junior man would take front place the bigger and senior man behind they non-commissioned officer would follow and subaltern and captain last of all in step off from the halt all would step off with the right foot instead of with the left apparently the object be to reverse ordinary procedure to the uttermost -- which would but be in keep with the great reversal of show honor to such a unhonoured thing as a private soldier -- one of the despise and reject band that enable the respectable wealthy and smug to remain so one of the licentious soldiery that have make and that keep the empire of which the respectable wealthy and smug be so proud at the slow march and in perfect silence until beyond hearing by the inmate of the hospital the cortege would proceed anon the band would call heaven and earth to mourn with the sonorous dreadful strain of the dead march whereafter the ordinary quick march would bring the funeral party to the cemetery in sight of which the slow march would be resume and the chaplain surpliced book-bearing come forth to put himself at its head lead the way to the grave-side where with uncovered head the mourner would listen to the impressive word with feeling vary as they education religion temperament and -- digestion -- impel at the close of the service the firing-party in they place six on either side of the grave would fire three volley into the air while the band breathe a solemn dirge and -- perhaps most impressively tragic touch of all -- the party would march briskly off to the strain of the liveliest air in the whole repertoire of the band _ why _ should john humphreyville priddell -- doubtless scion of the great norman house of humphreyville and paradelle who share much of dorsetshire between they from domesday book to stuart downfall -- have be bear in a tiny village of the vale of froom in dorset dear to die of cholera

you the same which they now leave I at present _ accord to right tradition and proper custom and continue to speak of homesick longing dream of furlough promotion marry on the strength and retirement to green fair dorset dear on a sergeant-major 's pension what be the meaning of it all be it pure chance and accident -- or have a living scheming purposeful deity a great wise object in this that john humphreyville priddell should have be bear and breed and nurture in the vale of froom to be strike from lusty life to a death of agony in a few hour at motipur in the cruel accursed blighted land of ind well well -- high time to rap again upon the door the last door of john humphreyville priddell trooper ex-dairyhand decaying carrion -- and scare from he carcass such over-early visitant as anticipate how hollowly the blow re-echo do they strike muffle but murderous upon the heart of the thousand-league distant dairymaid or of the old cottage-mother whose evening be spend in spell out she boy 's loving letter -- that so oft cover a portion of he exiguous pay be that a scuttle within quite probably it might be -- rat it might be a bandicoot it could hardly be a jackal it might be a snake -- and trooper matthewson 's carbine clatter to the ground and he knee smite together as he think the word pull himself together he hastily snatch up he carbine with a flush of shame at the slovenly unsoldierly crime of drop it he would be drop he arm on parade next but it _ might be a snake _ -- for he have certainly hear the sound of a movement of some sort the strong man feel faint and lean against the mortuary wall for a moment oh that the wretched carbine be a sword a man could feel a _ man _ with a sword in he hand he could almost face the snake even in snake form if he have a sword but what be a carbine even a loaded martini-henry carbine with its good soft man-stopping slug there be no tradition to a carbine -- nothing of the spirit of one 's ancestor in one -- a vile mechanic thing of villainous saltpetre how should the snake fear that now a sword be different it stand for human war and human courage and human deed from the mistiest past and behind it must be a weight of human wrath feat and tradition that must make even the snake pause oh for he sword -- if the snake come upon he when he have but this wretched carbine he would probably desert he post fling the useless toy from he and flee till he fall blind and faint on the ground and what would the trooper of the queen get who desert he sentry-post throw away he arm and flee -- and explain in defense that he have see a snake probably a court-martial would give he a spell of military prison yes -- _ jail _ what proportion of truth could there be in the firmly-held belief of the man that crime be make so numerous and so inevitable to the best-meaning and most careful because there exist a great military prison system and a great military prison personnel -- and that criminal be essential to the respective proper inhabitation and _ raison d'être _ thereof -- that unless a good supply of military criminal be forthcoming there might have to be reduction and curtailment -- loss of snug billet certainly soldier get year of imprisonment for crime for which civilian would get reprimand or nominal fine and moreover when a man become a soldier he certainly lose the elementary fundamental rights guarantee to englishmen by magna charta -- among they the right of trial by he peer would poor priddell mind if he do not knock again if it be the snake it could do priddell no harm now -- he be happily dead -- whereas if disturb it might emerge to the utter undoing -- mind body and soul -- of trooper matthewson it would certainly send he to jail or lunatic asylum -- probably to both in due succession for he be daily get worse in the matter of the snake no -- it be part of he order on this sentry-post to knock at the door and he would do he duty snake or not he have always try to do he duty faithfully and he would continue once more to knock at a dead man 's door _ bump bump : bump bump : bump bump _ you 'll soon be at rest priddell old chap -- and i wish i could join you call

huge vulture just as the sun set a fiery red ball behind the distant mountain damocle de warrenne gentleman-at-large have catch sight of what he have seek in the desert for some day the say overland telegraph and thereby save himself from the highly unpleasant death that follow prolonged deprivation of water he have also save he camel from a little earlier death inasmuch as he have decide to

-rrb- the overland telegraph point absolutely straight to the border city of kot ghazus and better still to a river-bed which would contain pool of water thirty mile this side of it at a spot a few mile from which stand a lose lone dak-bungalow on indian soil -- a dak-bungalow whereat would be wait a _ shikarrus _ retainer and such thing as tea fuel potted food possibly fresh meat and luxury of luxury a hot bath and with a sigh of relief he have wheel he camel under the telegraph wire after a glance at the star and brief calculation as to whether he should turn to left or right -lrb- he do not want to proceed until he collapse under the realization that he be make for the troubled land of persium -rrb- anyhow without know where he be he know he be on the road to water food human

wander in circle lose in the most inhospitable desert on the earth vulture he have not realize there be so many in the world hour after hour a post at every few yard and on every post a vulture -- a vulture that open its eye as he approach regard he from its own point of view -- that of the eater whose life be a unending search for meat -- calculatingly and close they again with a sigh at he remain vigorousness he must have pass hundred thousand -- have he die of thirst in actual fact and be he doom to follow this line through this desert for evermore as a punishment for he sin no -- much too mild a punishment for the god of love to inflict accord to the chaplain this would be eternal bliss compare with the eternal fire he must be still alive be he mad then and _ imagine _ these unending bird-capped post if not mad he soon would be why could not they say something -- mannerless brute should he swerve off and leave the telegraph line no he have starve and suffer the agony of thirst for nearly a week -- and if he could hang on all night he might reach water tomorrow and be save food be a minor consideration and if he could drink a few gallon of water soak he clothes in it lie in it -- he could carry on for another day or two nearly as easy to sprawl face-downward on a camel-saddle as on the ground -- and he have tie himself on the camel would rub along all right for day with camel-thorn and similar dainty no better not leave the line halt and camp within sight of it till the morning when the brute would fly away in search of food no might find it impossible to get go again if once man and beast lay down now ride as far as possible from the line keep it in sight no if he fall asleep the camel would go round in a circle again and he would wake up a dozen mile from the line with no idea of direction and position best to carry straight on the camel would stick to the line so long as he be leave exactly on it think it a road he could sleep without danger thus he would shut he eye and not see the vulture for if he see a dozen more he know that he would go rave mad halt the camel and address a impassioned appeal to they to _ say _ something -- for god 's sake to _ say something _ do not they know that he have be in solitary confinement in a desert for three week or three century -lrb- what be time -rrb- without hear a sound or see a living thing -- expect the snake night and day and moreover that he be starve die of thirst and light-headed and that he be in the awful position of choose between murder the camel that have stand by he -- no under he -- all that fearful time and break he word to lucille -- cheating and deceive lucille then why could not they _ say _ something instead of sit there in they endless million mile after billion of mile post after billion of trillion of post -- menacing watchful silent silent as the awful desert silent as the snake this would not do he must think hard of lucille of the sword of he dream he dream that come so seldom now he would repeat lucille 's last letter word for word : -- my darling it be over thank god -- oh thank god -- and you can leave the army at once and become a ` gentleman ' in

\* \* \* \* \* yes a long letter but he could almost say it backwards he could not be anything like mad while he could do that how have she receive he answer -- in which he try to show she the impossibility of any decent man compromise a girl in the way she propose in she sweet innocence and ignorance of course _ he _ a half-mad epileptic fiend-ridden monomaniac -- nay dangerous lunatic -- could not _ marry _ why he might murder he own wife under some such circumstance as those under which he attack captain blake -lrb- splendid fellow blake not every man after such a handling as that would make it he business to prove that he assailant be neither drunk mad nor criminal -- merely under a hallucination but for blake he would now be in jail or lunatic asylum to a certainty the colonel would have have he court-martialle as a criminal or else have have he out of the regiment as a lunatic nor as a dangerous lunatic would he have be allow to buy himself out when lucille 's letter and he money arrive blake have get he into the position of a perfectly sober and sane person whose mind have be temporarily upset by a night of horror -- in which a coffin-quitting corpse have figure and so he have be able to steer between the cruel rock of jail and asylum to the bless harbor of freedom -rrb- yes -- in spite of blake 's noble goodness and help dam know that he be _ not _ normal that he _ be _ dangerous that he spend long period on the very border-line of insanity that he stand fascinate on that border-line and gaze far into the awful country beyond -- the realm of the mad marry not lucille while he have the sanity leave to say no as for go to live at monksmead with she and auntie yvette -- it would be a even bigger crime be it for _ he _ to make _ lucille _ a problem girl a girl who be talk about a by-word for those vile old woman of both sex whose favorite pastime be the invention and dissemination of lie where they dare and of even more damaging head-shake lip-pursing gasp and innuendo where they do not be it for _ he _ to get _ lucille _ call the woman who do by those scum of the leisured class and that peculiar young woman by the better sort of matron dowager and chaperone -- make she the kind of person from whose company careful mother keep they innocent daughter -lrb- that they market price may never be in danger of the faintest depreciation when they be for sale in the matrimonial market -rrb- the kind of woman for whom man have a slightly and subtly different manner at meet hunt-ball dinner or theatre-box get lucille talk about no -- set aside the question of the possibility of live under the same roof with she and conquer the longing to marry no -- he have some decency leave taint as he doubtless be by he barrack-room life taint of course what be it he have hear the senior soldierly-looking man whom the other address as general say concern some mutual acquaintance at breakfast in the dining-car go up to kot ghazus yes poor chap be in the rank -- and no man can escape the barrack-room taint when he have once live in it take I into any officer ' mess you like -- say ` there be a promote gentleman-ranker here ' and i 'll lay a thousand to one i spot he do not care if he be the son of a dook -- nor yet if he be royal you can spot he alright pleasant hearing for the land proprietor whom a beautiful wealthy and high-bred girl propose to marry tainted or not in that way -- he be _ mentally _ taint a fact beside which the other if as true as truth pale into utterest insignificance no -- he have take the right line in reply to lucille that he be get worse mentally that no doctor would dream of vet he sound that he be not scoundrel enough to come and cause scandal and talk at monksmead and that he be go to disappear completely from the ken of man wrestle with himself and come to she and beg she to marry he directly he be better -- sufficiently better to pass the doctor that be if meanwhile she meet and love a man worthy of she such a man as ormonde delorme he implore she to marry he and to forget the wholly unworthy and undesirable person who have merely loom large upon she horizon through the accident of propinquity -lrb- he could always disappear again and blow out such brain as he possess if that come to pass he tell himself -rrb- meanwhile letter to the bank of bombay would be send for at least once a year -- but she be not to write -- she be to forget he as to search for he -- he have not quite decide whether he would walk from rangoon to pekin or from quetta to constantinople -- perhaps neither but from peshawur to irkutsk anyhow he be go to hide himself pretty effectually and put himself beyond the temptation of come and spoil she life sooner or later he would be mad dead or cure if the last -- why he would make for the nearest place where he could get news of she -- and if she be then happily marry to somebody else -- why -- why -- she _ would _ be happy and that would make he quite happy have the letter be quite sane and coherent -- or have he be in a queer mental state when he write it he open he eye see a vulture within a few yard of he close they again and soon after fall into a uneasy slumber as the camel pad on at a steady seven mile a hour unurged -- save by the _ smell _ of pure clear water which be still a score of mile distant when damocles de warrenne awake he be within a few hundred yard of the nearly dry river helnuddus where fail occasional pool the traveller can always procure water by digging and patiently await the slow formation of a little puddle at the bottom of the hole for a minute he halt should he dig while he have strength or should he turn to the left and follow the river-bed until he come to a pool -- or could go no farther perhaps he would be too weak to dig though by that time remarkable how eager to turn to the left and get on the camel be -- consider how tired he must be -- perhaps he could smell distant water or know of a permanent pool hereabouts well let that decide it a hour later as the camel top a rise in the river-bank a considerable pool come into view tree-shaded heron-haunted too incredibly beautiful and alluring for belief be it a mirage a few minute later damocle de warrenne and he camel be drink and a few hour later enter the dreary featureless compound of a wretched hovel which to the man at least be a palatial and magnificent asylum -lrb- no not _ asylum _ -- of all word -rrb- -- refuge and home -- the more so that a camel knelt chew in the shade of the building and a man abdul ghanus himself lay slumber in the verandah you understand then say dam in the vernacular to the malodorous hideous avaricious abdul who reappear from kot ghazus a few day later you return here again one week from to-day bring the thing write down on this paper from the shop of rustomjus at kot ghazus here you wait until i come if i find there be truth in you _ khubbar _ -lrb- 27 -rrb- of ibex you will be reward why do not i take you because i want to be alone set out now for kot ghazus i may return a stone fall and clatter dam shrink cringe and shut he eye -- as one expect a heavy blow _ ah-h-h-h-h _ -- have the beast bolt with the slowness of a hour-hand he raise he head above the bank of the watercourse until he eye clear the edge _ no _ -- still there after a painful crawl that seem to last for hour he reach the point where the low ridge run off at right-angle creep behind it and lay flat on he face to rest and recover breath he be soak in perspiration from head to foot giddy with sun and unnatural posture very sore as to elbow and knee out of breath tremble -- and entirely happy the half-mile crawl with the greater part of he body on the burning ground and the rifle to shuffle steadily along without noise or damage be the equivalent of a hard day 's work to a strong man at the end of it he lay gasp and sick ache in every limb almost blind with glare and over-exertion weary to death -- and entirely happy thank god he would be able to stand up in a moment and rest behind a big cactus then he would have a spell of foot-work for a change and though crouch double would not be do any crawl until he have cross the plateau and reach the bush the upward climb be successfully accomplish with frequent halt for breath behind boulder on the plateau all that be require be silence the ibex could not see he up there in he rubber-soled khaki-coloured shoe he could almost run but it be a question whether a drink of cold water would not be worth more than all the ibex in the world he tip-toe rapidly across the level hill-top reach the belt of low bush drop and lay to recover breath before resume the painful and laborious crawl part of he journey be it possible to tap one 's tongue against one 's tooth and hear the noise of it as though it be make of wood it seem so be this giddiness and dimness of vision sunstroke what would he give to have that fly -lrb- that have follow he for hundred of thousand of mile that morning -rrb- between he finger last lap there be the rock and below it must be the quarry -- if it have not flee he must keep that rock between himself and he prey and he must get to it without a sound it would be easy enough without the rifle could he stick it through he belt and along he back or trail it behind he what nonsense he must be get a touch of sun would these stone leave mark of burn on he clothes surely he could smell himself singe enough to explode the rifle the big rock at last a rest and then a peep with infinite precaution dam hold he breath and edge he face to the corner of the great boulder move imperceptibly he peep _ no ibex _ he be about to spring up with a hearty malediction on he luck when he perceive a peculiar projection on a large stone some distance down the hill it move -- and dam drop back it must be the top of the curve of one of the horn of the ibex and the animal must be lie down what to do it might lie for hour and he himself might go to sleep it might get up and depart at any moment without come into the line of fire -- without be see indeed better continue the stalk and hope to get a standing shot or fail that a run one it look a nasty descent since silence be essential -- steep slippery and strew with round stone anyhow he could go down on he foot which be something to be thankful for as it be agony to put a knee or elbow to the ground he creep on surely he luck be change for here he be within fifty yard of a stone behind which lay a unsuspecting ibex with a world 's - record head hullo a nasty little precipice with a nastily slope shelf at the bottom too eight foot away -- and then another little precipice and another sloping shelf at its base better lay the rifle on the edge slip over hang by the hand grab it with one and then drop the intervene few inch rubber sole would play they part here damn this giddiness -- touch of sun no doubt damocle de warrenne knelt on the edge of the eight-foot drop turn round sway fall strike the sloping ledge roll off it fall strike the next sloping ledge fall thirty foot -- arouse a astounded ibex _ en route _ -- and land in a queer heap on a third shelf with a few broken rib a dislocate shoulder broken ankle and a fractured thigh a vulture who have be interested in he proceedings for some time drop a few thousand foot and have a look what he see decide he to come to earth he perch on a rock and wait patiently he know the symptom and he know the folly of take risk a friend or two join he -- each as he leave he place in the sky be observe and follow by a brother who be himself in turn observe and follow by another who bring other one of the hideous band have draw quite near and be meditate rewarding he own boldness with a succulent eye when dam groan and move the pretty bird also move and probably groan in spirit -- but they do not move far what be that miss smellie have be so fond of say there be no such thing as ` luck ' damocle all be order for the best by a all-seeing and merciful providence yes no doubt what be that remark of he old friend holy bill what do you mean by ` luck ' damocle all that happen be ordain by god in he infinite mercy yes holy bill have never do a day 's work in he life nor miss a meal -- save when bilious from overeat a pity the infinite mercy do not run to a little water it would have be easy for the all-seeing and merciful providence to move he to retain he water-bottle when start the stalk -- if it be necessary to the scheme of the deity to have he smash like a drop egg what agony a human being could endure not even he rifle at hand with its means of speedy death he might live for day and then be tear alive by those accursed vulture one mighty effort to turn on he back and he would breathe easier -- but that would bring he eye to the sun -- and the vulture have he sleep or faint how long have he lie there chance of be find absolutely none shikarrus would have visit the dak-bungalow a week ago camel leave below on the plain -- and it would wander mile from where he leave it when it grow hungry even if abdul and a organize search-party be after he _ now _ they might as well be search for a needle in a hay-stack no one know which of the thousand gully he have ascend and no one could track camel-pad or flat rubber sole over bare solid rock even if give the starting-point no -- he have get to die of thirst starvation and vulture bar miracle of luck -- and he have _ never _ have any good luck -- for luck exist undoubtedly in spite of mealy-mouthed platitude-maker and twaddle about everything be pre-arranged and ordain with care and deliberation by a kind paternal providence and what luck he have have -- all he life bear fate have he faint again or sleep and could he hear the tinkle of ice against the side of a tall thin tumbler of lemonade or be it the sound of a waterfall of clear cold water close by be the servant asleep or be the drink he have order be prepare no -- he be die in agony on a red-hot rock surround by vulture and probably watch by fox jackal and hyena and a few yard away be the rifle that would have put he out of he misery and the water-bottle that would have alleviate he pain -- to the extent at any rate of enable he to think clearly and perhaps scribble a few word in blood or something somehow for lucille lucille would the all-merciful let he see she once again for a moment in return for a extra thousand year of hell or whatever it be that unhappy mortal get as a continuation of the joy of this gay world could he possibly induce the vulture to carry he home -- if he pledge himself to feed they and support they progeny they could each have a house in the compound it would pay they far better than eat he now do they understand pushtoo or be it persian certainly not hindustanus and urdu people who come shooting alone in the desert and mountain where vulture abound should learn to talk vulture and pass the higher standard in that tongue but even if they understand he they might be unwilling to serve a coward _ be _ he a coward anyhow he lay glue with he own blood to the spot he would never leave -- unless the vulture could be bribe useless to hope anything of the jackal he have hunt too many fox to begin now to ask favor besides they could only drag and he have be drag once by a horse quite enough for one lifetime but he have never injure a vulture pity he have no copy of grimm or anderson with he -- they contain much useful information about talk fox oblige bird and other matter germane to the occasion if he could only get they to apply it a working-party of vulture and jackal certainly have the strength to transport he a considerable distance -- alternately carry and drag he the big bird stalk nearer be probably the _ macuddam _ or foreman would it be at all possible for vulture to bring water he would be very willing to offer he right hand in return for a little water the bird would be welcome to eat it off he body if it would give he a drink first do not raven bring meat to the prophet elijah intelligent and oblige bird probably cook it too but water be more difficult to carry if easier to procure how close they be come and how they watch with they horrible eye -- and pretend not to watch oh the awful unspeakable agony why be he alive again be he chest full of terribly rusty machinery that would go on when it ought to stop for want of oil if pain be punishment for sin as placid stall-fed holy bill hold -lrb- never have suffer any -rrb- then damocle de warrenne must have be the prince of sinner oh god a little drop of water river of it flow not many mile away monsoon of it fall recently a water-bottle full a few yard distant -- and he must die for want of a drop what a complete circle the vulture make on the rock and stunt tree of the slope hill-side oh for a revolver a man ought to carry one on shikar expedition one would give he a chance of life when under a tiger or panther -- and a chance of decent death in a position such as this where have he read that vulture begin on the eye of they prey without await its death either so long as it could not defend itself there be other depraved gustatory preference too if he remember rightly-he would have a opportunity of test the accuracy of the statement -- though not of assure its author as to its correctness water water water have he faint again that the vulture be so much nearer why should he be a second prometheus have he not have suffer enough in he life without have more in he death if the send of a little water be too obvious a miracle be it too much to ask that he next fainting and collapse might last long enough for the vulture to get to work make a beginning and a end surely that would not be too great a miracle since he have lie for year on a red-hot rock with blood in he mouth and he body wreck like a smash egg he must be practically dead perhaps if he hold he labored breath and close he eye they _ would _ begin and he would have the strength to keep still when they do so that would be the quickest way once they start it would not be long before he bone be clean no possible ghost of a chance of be save probably no human foot have be on these particular rock since human foot exist nor would he ever again have the strength to drag he shattered body to where the rifle lay only a few yard away lay speedy happy release no such thing as luck damocle perhaps the vulture think otherwise colonel john decy still of bimariabad but long retire on pension from the indian medical service be show he mental and physical unfitness for the service of the government that have order he retirement by devote himself at the age of fifty-nine to aviation -- aviation in the interest of the wound on the battlefield what he want to live to see be a fly stretcher-service of the royal army medical corps that should flash to and fro at the rate of a hundred mile a hour between the rear of the firing-line and the field hospital and base hospital in aeroplane build especially for the accommodation of wounded man -- a officer of the corps accompany each in the dual capacity of surgeon and potential pilot when he allow he practical mind to wander among the vast possibility of the distant future he dream of bigger and bigger aeroplane until they become fully equip fly hospital themselves and remove the wound from the danger zone to the nearest salubrious spot for they convalescence meanwhile he see no reason why the more powerful biplane should not carry a operating-table and all surgical accessory a surgeon and two or three wound man who could not be make sitting-up case to colonel john decy it seem that if soldier scheme to adapt the flying-machine to purpose of death and destruction doctor might do the same to purpose of life and salvation think of the difference between be jolt for hour in a bullock-cart in the dust and heat and be bear through the air without jerk or jar think of the hundred of man who in the course of one campaign would be save from the ghastly fate of lie unfound unseen by the stretcher-bearer to starve to death to lie weltering in they blood to live through day of agony he be make quite a name for himself by he experiment at the kot ghazus flying-school and by he article and speech on the formation and training of a ramc fly branch small beginning would content he -lrb- provide they be intend to lead to great development -rrb- -- a aeroplane at first that could carry one or two special case to which the ordinary means of transport would be fatal and that could scour the ground especially in the case of very broken terrain and hill-country for overlook case wound man unable to move or call and undiscovered by the searcher he be hard at work on the invention of a strong collapsible operating-table -lrb- that could readily be bring into use in the field and also be use in aerial transport -rrb- and a case for the concentration of equipment -- operation instrument rubber glove surgical gauntlet saline infusion apparatus sterilizer aseptic towel chloroform bandage gauze wool sponge drainage-tubing inhaler silk skein syringe field tourniquet waterproof cloth stethoscope -- everything and the whole outfit table and all weigh forty pound this would be a improvement on the system of have to open half a dozen medical and surgical case when operate on the line of march case require the most expert repacking after use \* \* \* \* \* perhaps it be a sign of advance year and weaken mind that this fine specimen of a fine service feel that when fly some thousand of foot above the earth he be nearer to lenore in heaven all he science and sad experience have fail to deprive he of a sub-conscious belief in a actual place above a material hereafter beyond the sky and when cloud cut he off from sight of the earth he have a quaint half-realized feeling of be in the ante-room of the great house of many mansion wherein dwelt lenore yes when fly colonel john decies feel that he be nearer to the woman he have lose nearly a quarter of a century before in one sense he may have be so for he be a very reckless airman and never in greater danger than when engage in what he call ground-scouring among the air-current haunted mist-haunted mountain of the border he anticipate a early border-war and realize that here would be a great opportunity for a keen-sighted and iron-nerved medical airman to locate if not to pick up overlook wound here too would be a double need of such service in a country where the woman come out to cut up what remain imagine too cavalry reconnaissance and bad casualty a score of mile from medical help whether it bring he nearer in any sense to lenore de warrenne it bring he nearer to she son on one of those hundred-mile circular scour which he practice when opportunity offer generally accompany by a like-minded officer of the ramc to which corps he have become a kind of unofficial and honorary instructor in first - aid fly at the kot ghazus flying-school situate in the plain at the foot of the roof of the world hullo say colonel john decy to himself -- vulture i suppose they might be refer to in my manual as a likely guide to the wound good idea ` the fly casualty-scout should always take note of the conduct of vulture note the direction of flight if any be see drop to earth these bird may prove invaluable guide a collection of they on the ground may indicate a wounded man who may be alive ' the colonel be think of he _ magnum opus _ the aeroplane and the surgeon in war wherewith he live laborious day at bimariabad in the interval of testing develop and demonstrate he theory at kot ghazus turn he head he shout to surgeon-captain digby-soame ramc he passenger and pupil : -- vulture on the left-front or starboard bow ` invariable battle-field sign of wounded man note spot if unable to land and rescue call up stretcher-party by signal -- _ vide _ page 100 of decy ' great work ' what by jove it be a wounded man reply captain digby-soame who be use field-glasses damned if it be not a sahib too out shikarr and sprain he ankle i suppose dead i be afraid poor devil vulture be not _ at work _ anyhow comment colonel decy can not land anywhere hereabouts and i be afraid ` call up the stretcher party ' be not in the game here nothing nearer than kot ghazus and that be a good thirty mile reply captain digby-soame as the aeroplane hover and slowly sink let 's see all we can and then find the nearest landing-place search all round for any sign of a tent or encampment there may be a dak-bungalow somewhere down in the plain too the river-bed down on the right there mark the border captain digby-soame scour earnestly with he glass camel on the port-bow at the foot of the hill he announce what may be a dak-bungalow several mile away a white square dot anyhow camel saddle up kneel he no doubt wonder where he shikarrus be -- as the aeroplane approach the disappointed vulture depart mislike the size shape and sound of the strange fowl as it pass over he and the major shout dam open he eye this must be pretty well the end -- when he hear the voice of some one he know well and see a flying-machine just above he he would see block of ice and cascade of cold water in a moment doubtless and hear lucille call a flying-machine in ghazistan the voice of a old old friend to whom he could not for the moment give a name why could not the cowardly brute of vulture begin they business and end he what be that familiar voice calling : -- hold on a bit we 'll soon be with you do not give up we can not land just here if we drop anything can you crawl and get it he open he eye say captain digby-soame but i doubt if he be conscious he must have come a frightful cropper you can see there be a compound fracture of the right femur from here and one of he foot be fairly point backwards blood from the mouth too anyhow he be alive better shoot he if we can not shift he -- we 'll _ get _ he all right this be a heaven-sent ` problem ' and we 'll solve it -- and i 'll quote it in my ` manual ' quite war-conditions very badly wound man -- inaccessible position -- stretcher-party all out of sight -- aeroplane can not land for any first-aid nor to pick up the casualty -- _ excellent _ problem and demonstration that oont -lrb- 28 -rrb- will simplify it though look here -- i 'll drop down and land you by it and then come here again and hover you bring the beast up -- you 'll be able to ride most of the way if you zig-zag and lead he most of the rest then you 'll have to carry the casualty to the oont and bring he down the aeroplane swoop down and ground gently within a hundred yard of the kneel camel who eye it with the cold and supercilious disdain of he kind tell you what say colonel decy when i get up there again have a good squint and see if you think you can locate the spot for yourself from below if you can i 'll come down again and we 'll both go up on the oont bring the poor beggar down much better if one of we can hold he while the other drive the camel it be no grand trunk road by jove right-o acquiesce captain digby-soame if i can get a clear bearing to a point immediately below where you hover i 'll lie flat on the ground as a affirmative signal if there be no good landmark i 'll stay perpendicular what that be it say colonel decy and with a swift run and throbbing whirr the aeroplane soar from the ground and rise to where a thousand foot from the plain lay the mangled problem as it come to a halt and hover -lrb- 29 -rrb- -lrb- like a gigantic dragon-fly poise on its invisibly-rapid wing above a pool -rrb- the junior officer 's practice eye note a practicable gully that debouch on a level with and not far from the ledge over which the aeroplane hang and that a stunt thorn-tree stand below the shelf and two large cactus bush on its immediate left have take careful note of other landmark and glance at the sun he lay on the ground at full length for a minute and then arise and approach the camel who greet he with a bubble snarl on its great double saddle be a gun-cover and a long cane while from it dangle a haversack camera cartridge-case satchel canvas water-bag and a cord-net holdall of odds and end obviously the problem 's shikar-camel apparently he be out without any shikarrus orderly or servant -- a foolish thing to do when stalk in country in which a sprain ankle be more than a possibility and a long-range bullet in the back a probability anywhere on that side of the border the aeroplane return to earth and ground near by stop the engine colonel decy climb out and swing himself into the rear seat of the camel saddle captain digby-soame spring into the front one and the camel lurch to its foot and be drive to the mouth of the gully which the captain have note as run up to the scene of the tragedy to and fro in and out of the gully wind zig-zagging often travel a hundred yard to make a dozen the sure-footed and well-trained beast make its way upward come down will be joy observe the colonel i would sooner be on a broken aeroplane in a cyclone better hop off here i should think say captain digby-soame anon we can lead he a good way yet though case of divide we stand unite we fall let he fall by himself if he want to and at the next reasonably level spot the camel be make to kneel that he rider might descend slither down from a standing camel be not a sport to practice on a steep hillside if indulge in at all another wind scramble climb and the head of the nullah be reach have to get the beast kneel when we climb down to he with the casualty opine the colonel better get he down here i think do not seem any decent place farther on and the camel be bring to a anchor and leave to he own device by jove the poor beggar _ have _ come a purler say captain digby-soame as the two bent over the apparently unconscious man ever see he at kot ghazus or bimariabad inquire colonel decy no say the captain never see he anywhere why -- have you certainly see he somewhere -- try to remember where i think perhaps it might have be at the flying-school or at one of the mess can not place he at all but i 'll swear i have meet he maneuver perhaps suggest the other or ` board ship extraordinary thing be that i feel i _ ought _ to know he well something most familiar about the face i be afraid it be a bit too late to -- broken rib -- fractured thigh -- broken ankle -- broken arm -- perforated lung -- not much good try to get he down i be afraid he might linger for day though if we decide to stand by up here a really first-class problem for solution -- we be in luck muse colonel decy make he rapid and skilful examination yes we must get he down of course -- after a bit of splinting and then the real ` problem ' will commence i suppose observe captain digby-soame you could not put he into my seat and fly he to kot ghazus while i dossed down with the camel and wait for you to come for I and it would not do to camel he to that building which look like a dak-bungalow no i think you 'll have to stand by while i fly to kot ghazus and bring the necessary thing for a temporary job and then return and try to guide a ambulance waggon here oh for a aeroplane-ambulance this job bring it home to you pretty clearly do not it or i might first go and have a look at the alleged dak-bungalow and see if we could possibly run he over there on a charpoy -lrb- 30 -rrb- or a improvise camel-stretcher it 'll be a ghastly job get down i do not know that you have not better stick to he up here while i go straight back for proper splint and bandage and so forth and bring another chap too where the devil have i see he before i shall forget my own name next the colonel ponder a moment look here he decide this case be urgent enough to justify a risky experiment he be be here a devil of a time and if he be not in a _ pukka _ hospital within the next few hour it be all up with he he be go to have the distinction of be the first casualty remove to hospital by flying-machine i 'll tie he on somewhere we 'll splint he up as well as possible and then make he into a bloom cocoon with the cord and whisk he away pity we have not a few plank observe captain digby-soame we could make one big splint of he whole body and sling he plank and all underneath the aeroplane well you start splint that right leg on to the left and stiffen the knee with something -lrb- you 'll probably be able to get a decent stick or two off that small tree -rrb- and shove the arm inside he leather leg we have two pair of putty you can bandage with and there be _ puggry _ on all three _ topi _ probably he gun 's somewhere about for another leg-splint too i 'll get down to the machine for the cord and then i 'll skirmish around for anything in the nature of pole or plank i can get over to that hut and back before you have do it 'll be the camelling that 'll kill he at the distant building the colonel find a abandon broken-wheeled bullock-cart from which he loot the bottom-board which be plank six foot long lay upon but not fasten to the framework of the body of the cart from the compound of the place -lrb- a ancient and rarely-visited dak-bungalow probably the most outlying and desert in indium -rrb- he procure a bamboo pole that have once support a lamp the long leg-rest of a old chair and two or three stick more or less serviceable for he purpose return to the camel he ascend to where he passenger and pupil await he over he shoulder he bear the plank pole and stick that the contemptuous but invaluable camel have bear to a point a few yard below the scene of the tragedy good egg observe the younger man we 'll do he up in those like a mummy yes return the colonel then carry he to the oont and bind he along one side of the saddle and then lead the beast down easily sling he on to the machine and there we be lucky we have get the coil of cord fine demonstration for the kot ghazus feller show that the thing can be do even without the proper kind of ` plane and surgical outfit what luck we spot he -- or that he fall just in we return track doubtless he be bear to that end observe the captain who be apt to get a little peevish when hungry and tired and when the army aeroplane _ hawk _ return from its ground-scouring for casualty trip lo it bear beneath and beside the pilot and passenger a real casualty sling in a kind of crude coffin-cradle of plank and pole a casualty in whose recovery the colonel take the very deepest interest for be he not a heaven-sent case bear to the end that he might be smash to demonstrate the colonel 's theory but no credit be give to the vulture without whom the casualty would never have be find chapter xiii find colonel john decies im -lrb- retire -rrb- visit the kot ghazus station hospital whereof he friend and pupil captain digby-soame be commandant scan the temperature chart of the unknown the desperately injure case retrieve by he beloved flying-machine who judge by he utterance in delirium appear to be even worse damage in spirit than he be in body very high again last night he observe to miss norah o'neill of the queen alexandra military nursing sisterhood yes and very violent reply miss o'neill i have to call two orderly and they could hardly hold he he appear to think he be fight a huge snake or flee from one he also repeatedly scream : ` it be under my foot it be move move move _ out _ ' _ get it _ by god cry the colonel suddenly smite he forehead with violence _ of course _ fool fool that i be merciful god in heaven -- _ it be she boy _ -- and _ i _ have save he _ she boy _ and i have be cudgel my fail addled brain for month wonder where i have see he face before he be my godson sister and i have not set eye on he for the last -- nearly twenty year miss norah o'neill have never before see a excited doctor in a hospital ward but she now behold one nearly beside himself with excitement joy surprise and incredulity -lrb- it be sad to have to relate that she also hear one murmur over and over again to himself well i be damned -rrb- at last colonel john decy announce that the world be a tiny small place and a very rum one that it be just like _ the hawk _ to be the means of save _ she _ boy of all people and then take the patient 's hand in he and sit study he face in wonder ponder silence to miss norah o'neill this seem extraordinarily powerful affection for a mere _ godson _ and one lose to sight for twenty year at that yet colonel decy be a bachelor and no the patient certainly resemble he in no way whatsoever the tiny new-born germ of a romance die at once in miss o'neill 's romantic heart -- and yet have she but know here be a romance such as she soul love above all thing -- the son of the adore dead mistress discover _ in extremis _ and save by the devout platonic lover the life-long lover and reveal to he by the utterance of the pre-natally learn word of the dead woman herself yes -- how many time through those awful day have decy hear that heart-rending cry how cruelly the word have tortured he and here they be repeat twenty year on -- for the identification of the son by the friend that afternoon colonel decy dispatch a cablegram address to a miss gavestone monksmead southshire england and contain the word have find he kot ghazi bad accident do well decy and by the next mail lucille with aunt yvette and a maid leave port say have travel overland to brindisus and take passage to egypt by the _ osiri _ to overtake the liner that have leave tilbury several day before the cable reach monksmead and in lucille 's largest trunk be a article the like of which be rarely to be find in the baggage of a young lady -- nothing more nor less than a ancient rapier of italian pattern to lucille who know she lover so well it seem that the sight and feel of the worship sword of he ancestor must bring he comfort self-respect memory thought of the joint youth and happiness of himself and she she know what the sword have be to he how he have feel a different person when he hold its inspiring hilt how it have move he to the tell of he wondrous dream and story of its stir past how he have revere and love it surely it must do he good to have it if he be stretch upon a bed of sickness and it be hang where he could see it it _ must _ help he it would bring diversion of think cheer he suggest bright memory -- perhaps give he brave dream that would usurp the place of bad one if he be well or convalescent it might be even more needful as a tonic to self-respect a reminder of high tradition a message from dead sire yes surely it must do he good where she could not if there be any really insurmountable obstacle to they -- they -- union -- the sword could still be with he always and say unceasingly : do not be world-beaten son of the de warrennes and stukeley do not despair do not be fate-conquered fight fight look upon I not as merely the symbol of struggle but as the actual sword of you actual father fight fate die fighting -- but do not live defeat -- but of course she hero dam need no such exhortation still -- the sword must be a comfort a pleasure a hope a inspiration a symbol when she bring it he he would understand sword be to sever but _ the _ sword should be a link -- a visible bond between they and between they again and they common past to she fellow-passenger lucille be a puzzling enigma what could be the story of the beautiful and obviously wealthy girl with the anxious preoccupy look whose thought be always far away who take no interest in the pursuit and pastime usual to she sex and age on a long sea voyage who give no glance at the wares of local vendor that come aboard at port say and aden who occupy she leisure with no book no write no conversation no deck-game and who constantly consult she watch as though impatient of the slow flight of time or the slow progress of the ship many lead question be put to auntie yvette but dearly as she would have like to talk about she charge 's romantic trouble she tongue be tie and she dread to let slip any information that might possibly lead to a train of thought connect lucille dam and the old half-forgotten scandal of the outcast from monksmead and sandhurst if she beloved nephew foolishly choose to hide he head in shame when there be no shame it be not for those who love he best to say anything which might possibly lead to he discovery and identification while cordially polite to all man -lrb- include woman -rrb- lucille be find to be surround by a impenetrable wall of what be either glass or ice accord to the nature of the investigator those who would fain extend relationship beyond that of merest ephemeral ship-board acquaintanceship -lrb- and the inevitability of close though temporary daily contact -rrb- while admit that she manner and manners be beautiful have to admit also that she be a extremely difficult young person to get to know a gilt-edged bumptious young subalternknut who commence the voyage apoplectically full of self-admiration self-confidence and admire wonder at he enormous attractiveness importance and value finish the same in a ludicrously deflated condition -- and a quiet civilian to whom the cub have be shamefully insolent be move to present he with a little poem of he composition commence there be a puppy catch a wasp which give he the transient though salutary gift of sight of himself as certain other see he even the great mr justice spywell -lrb- she husband be a wee meek joint-sessions-judge -rrb- be foiled in she diligent endeavor and those who know the great mr justice spywell will appreciate the defensive ability of lucille to those poor soul throughout the world who stand lorn and cold without the charm and charming circle of anglo-indiandom it may be explain that the great mr justice spywell be far too great to be hamper by silly scruple of diffidence when on the track of information concern the private affair of lesser folk -- which be to say other folk when travel abroad she be the judge 's wife when stay at hill station she be the judge 's wife and when adorn she proper sphere she native heath of chota pagalabad she be the judge 's wife as she be the senior lady of all chota pagalabad she of course always -lrb- like mary -rrb- go in first at the solemn and superior dinner party of that important place and be fear flattered and fawn upon by the other lady of the station since she can socially put down the mighty from they seat and exalt the humble and meek and they of low degree -lrb- though she would not be likely to touch the last-named with a pair of tong socially speak of course -rrb- and yet such be this queer world the say lesser lady of the famous mofussil station of chota pagalabad be among themselves agree _ nemine contradicente _ that the great mr justice spywell be a vulgar old frump -lrb- country-bred to say the least of it -rrb- and call she the first seven sister this curious and unsyntactically express epithet allude to the fact that she and six other lady of like instinct meet daily for tea and scandal at the gymkhana and for three solid hour pull to piece the reputation of all and sundry they acquaintance remind the amuse on-looker by they voice manner and appearance of those strange bird the _ sit bai _ or seven sister who in gang of seven make day hideous in they neighborhood be you go to indium to be marry my dear child she ask lucille before she know she name i really do not know reply lucille you be not actually engage then i really do not know oh of course if you would rather keep you own counsel pray do so snapped the great lady bridle yes reply lucille and mr spywell inform she circle of stereotype that lucille be a stupid chit without a word to say for herself and a artful design hussy who be probably a adventuress of the fishing-fleet to auntie yvette it appear matter of marvel that earth and sky and sea be much as when she last pass that way in quarter of a century or so there appear to be but little change in the egyptian and arabian desert in the mountain of the african and arabian coast of the gulf of suez in the contour of the island of the red sea and of aden whilst in mid-ocean there be absolutely no observable difference between then and now wonderful indeed this theme that of what be go on at monksmead and that of what to do when dam be recapture form the bulk of she conversation with she young companion what will you _ do _ dear when we _ have _ find the poor darling boy she would ask take he by the ear to the nearest church and marry he lucille would reply or -- stick to he like a leech for evermore auntie or -- marry he when he be not look or while he be asleep if he be ill -- or by the scruff of he neck if he be well -lrb- what a pity the great mr justice spywell could not hear these terrible and unmaidenly sentiment a adventuress of the fishing-fleet in very truth -rrb- and with reprove smile the gentle spinster would reply : -- my _ dear _ suppose anyone overheard you what _ would _ they think whereunto the naughty girl would answer : -- the truth auntie -- that i be go to pursue some poor young man to he doom if dam be a leper in the gutter beg he bread i would marry he in spite of himself -- or share the gutter and bread in -- er -- guilty splendor if he be a criminal in jail i would sit on the doorstep till he come out and do the same dreadful thing i be just go to marry dam at the first possible moment -- like the wild west ` shoot on sight ' idea i be go to seize he and marry he and take care of he for the rest of he life if he never have another grief ache or pain in the whole of he life he must have have more than ten time he share already anyhow whether he 'll marry I or whether he will not -- in he stupid quixotic idea of he ` fitness ' to do so -- i be never go to part from he again and auntie yvette would endeavor to be less shocked than a right-minded spinster aunt should be at such wild un-early-victorian sentiment \* \* \* \* \* come this be a better sort of dream this be better than dream of prison-cell lunatic asylum torture by the snake lie smash on rock be eat alive by vulture wander for aeon in red - hot waterless desert and other horror however illusory and tantalizing this be at least a glorious dream a delirium to welcome a wondrous change indeed -- to seem to be hold the hand of lucille while she gaze into he eye and from time to time press she lip to he forehead a good job most of the bandage be go or she could hardly have do that even in a dream and how wondrously _ real _ she hand feel quite solid there be tear trickle down she cheek tear that sometimes drop on to he own hand with a incredible effect of actuality it be even more vivid than he sword-dream which be always so extraordinarily realistic and clear and there yes by jove be dear old auntie yvette smile and weep simultaneously such a dream be the next best thing to reality -- save that it bring home to one too vividly what one have lose pain of that kind be nevertheless a magnificent change from the other ghastly nightmare of the wholly maleficent kind this be a kindly helpful painit be so rare to see the face of we best-beloved in dream sleep be go to be something other than a procession of hideous nightmare then i believe he know I auntie whisper lucille oh when will colonel decy come back i want he to be here when he open he eye again he would know at a glance whether he be in he right mind and know I i be certain he do dear reply auntie yvette i be positive he smile at you and i believe he know I too i _ will not _ believe i have find he too late it _ could not _ be true weep the girl overstrain and unstrung by long vigil heart-sick with hope defer as she turn to she companion lucille be it real come a feeble whisper from the bed -- and lucille in the next moment wonder if it be true that joy can not kill \* \* \* \* \* a few week later damocle de warrenne sit on the verandah of the grand imperial hotel royal of kot ghazus which have five room and five million cockroach and stare blankly into the moonlit compound beyond which stretch the bare rocky plain that be bound on the north and west by mighty mountain on the east by a mighty river and on the south by the more mighty ocean many hundred of mile away he have just part from auntie yvette and lucille -- lucille whose last word as she turn to go to she room have be : -- now understand dammy what you want now be a sea-voyage a sea-voyage to england and monksmead when we have get you absolutely right mr wylli shall show you as a specimen of the perfect man in harley street -- and _ then _ dammy and he burning kiss have close she mouth be he scoundrel enough to do it have he deteriorate to such a depth of villainy could he let that noblest and finest flower of womanhood marry a -- dangerous lunatic a homicidal maniac who have nearly kill the man who prove to be almost he greatest benefactor could he would the noble-hearted decy frankly say that he be normal and have a right to marry he would not and no living man be better qualify to give a opinion on the case of damocles de warrenne than the man who be a foster-father to he in childhood and who bring he into the world in such tragic circumstance decy have love he mother lenore de warrenne would he have marry _ she _ in such circumstance would he have live under the same roof with she permanently -- know how overpower would be the temptation to give way and marry she know how scandal would inevitably arise a thousand time no be there _ no _ gentlemanliness leave in damocles de warrenne that he should even contemplate the do of a deed at which he old comrades-in-arm bear burke jone little goate nemo and peerson would stand aghast would be ready to kick he out of a decent barrack-room -- and the poor demented creature call for a boy and order he to send at once for one abdul ghanus who would as usual be find sleep beside he camel in the market-place anon the gentle abdul come receive certain instruction and depart smile till he great yellow fang gleam in the moonlight beneath the bristle moustache cut back from the lip as that of a righteous mussulman _ shikarrus _ and _ oont-wallah _ should be damocles de warrenne 's brain become active with plot and plan for escape -- escape from himself and the temptation which he must avoid by flight since he feel he could not conquer it in fight he must disappear he must die -- die in such a way that lucille would never suppose he have commit suicide it be the only way to save himself from so awful a crime and to save she from himself he would start just before dawn on abdul 's shikar camel be well away from kot ghazus by daylight and reach the old desert dak-bungalow that no one ever use by evening there abdul would come to he with he _ bhoja-oont _ -lrb- 31 -rrb- bring the usual supplies and on receipt of they he would dismiss abdul altogether and disappear again into the desert this time for good criminal lunatic and homicidal maniac be better dead especially when they be tempt beyond they strength to marry innocent beautiful girl who do not understand the position chapter xiv the snake and the sword the dak-bungalow again at last but how terribly dreary depressing and horrible it look _ now _ -- the hut that have once seem a kind of heaven on earth to the starve wanderer then lucille be thousand of mile away -lrb- geographically and million of mile away in imagination -rrb- now she be but thirty mile away -- and it be almost more than human endurance could bear should he turn back even now ride straight to kot ghazus fall at she foot and say : i can struggle no longer come back to monksmead -- and let what will be be i have no more courage and go mad one day and kill she keep sane and sully she fair name on to the hovel rest for the night and at dawn strike into the desert and there let what will be be make the camel kneel damocle de warrenne remove its saddle fasten its rein-cord tightly to a post fed it and then detach the saddle-bag that hang flatly on either side of the saddle frame as well as a patent-leather sword-cover which contain a sword of very different pattern from that for which it have be make enter the hut of which the door and window be bolt on the outside he fling open the shutter of the glassless window light a candle and prepare to eat a frugal meal from the saddlebag he take bread egg chocolate sardine biscuit and apple with a mixture of permanganate of potash tea and cold water from the well if the puddle at the bottom of a deep hole could be so term he make a drink that while drinkable by one who have know worse be unlikely to cause a attack upon a enfeebled constitution of cholera enteric dysentery or any other of indium 's speciality what would he not have give for a clean whisky-and-soda in the place of the nauseating muck -- but what should be the end of a man who in he position turn to _ alcohol _ for help and comfort the last state of that man after strike a judicious balance between what he should eat for dinner and what he should reserve for breakfast he fall to eat sparingly light he pipe and gaze around the wretched room of which the wall be blue-washed with a most offensive shade of blue the bare floor be frankly dry mud and dust the roof be bare cob-webbed thatch and rafter and the furniture a rickety table a dangerous-looking cane-bottomed settee and a leg-rest arm-chair from which some one have remove the leg-rest have some scoundrelly _ oont-wallah _ pinch they for fuel -lrb- no damocle a ex-colonel of the indian medical service pinch they for splint -rrb- a most depressing human habitation even for the most cheerful and care-free of soul a terrible place for a man in a dangerous mental state of unstable equilibrium and cruel agony only thirty mile away -- and a camel at the door _ lucille _ still within a night 's ride lucille and absolute joy the desert and certain death -- a death of which she must be assure that in time she might marry ormonde delorme or some such sound fine man abdul must find he body -- and it must be the body not of a obvious suicide but of a man who lose in the desert have evidently travel in circle try to find he way to the hut he have leave on a shooting expedition yes -- he know all about travel in circle -- and what he have do in ignorance -lrb- as well as in agony and horror -rrb- he would now do intentionally and with grim purpose hard on the poor camel perhaps he could manage so that it be set free in time to find its way back somehow it would if it be loose within smell of water he must die fairly and squarely of hunger and thirst -- no blow out of brain or throat-cutting no trace of suicide just lose poor chap and no more to be say death of _ thirst _ -- in that awful desert -- _ again _ -- no god in heaven he have face the actual pang of it once and escape -- he could _ not _ face it again -- he be not strong enough and the unhappy man spring to he foot to rush from the room and saddle-up the camel for -- life and lucille -- and then he eye fall on the sword the sword of he father bring to he by lucille who have say have it with you always dearest it can _ talk _ to you as even i can not he sit down and draw it from the incongruous modern case and from its scabbard ha what do it say but _ honor _ what be its message but do the right thing death be nothing -- honor be everything be worthy of you name you tradition you ancestor -- he would die let he die that lucille 's honor lucille 's happiness lucille 's welfare might live -- and he kiss the hilt of the sword as he have so often do in childhood have remove boot leggings and sock he lay down on the settee -- innocent of bedding and pillow pull over he the coat that have be roll and strap trooper-fashion behind the saddle and fall asleep and dream that he be shut naked in a tiny cell with a gigantic python upon whose yard-long fang he be about to be impale and as usual awake tremble and bath in perspiration with dry mouth and throbbing head sickness and tingling extremity the wind have get up and have blow out the candle which should have last till dawn as he lay shake terrify -lrb- uncertain as to whether he be a soul in torment or a human be still alive -rrb- and debate as to whether he could get off the couch relight the candle and close the windward window he hear a sound that cause he heart to miss a beat and he hair to rise on end a strange dry rustle merge in the sound of paper be drag across the floor and he know that he _ be _ shut in with a snake shut up in a _ blue room _ cut off from the match on the table and doom to lie and await the death he dread more than ten thousand other -- or go mad to rush upon that death _ he be shut in with the snake _ at last it have come for he in its own concrete form and have he bind and gag by fascination and fear -- in the dark the awful cruel dark no more mere myrmidon _ the snake itself _ he try to scream and could not he try to strike out at a imaginary serpent-head huge as a elephant that rear itself above he -- and could not he could not even draw he bare foot in under the overcoat and steadily the paper drag across the floor be it approach be it progress round and round by the wall would the snake find the bed and climb on to it would it coil round he throat and gaze with-luminescent eye into he and torture he thus for hour ere thrust its fang into he brain would it coil up and sleep upon he body for hour before do so know that he could not move here be he snake-dream realize and in the actual flesh he lay awake and conscious and could neither move nor cry aloud in the dark he lay bind and gag in a blue-walled room and the snake envelop he with its presence and he could in no wise save himself oh god why let a sentient creature suffer thus he himself would have shoot any human be guilty of inflict a tithe of the agony on a pariah dog there could _ be _ no god and then the beam of the rise moon fall upon the blade of the sword make it shine like a lamp and with a roar as of a charge lion damocle de warrenne spring from the bed seize it by the hilt and be aware without a tremor of a cobra that rear itself before he in the moonlight sway in the dance of death with a mere flick of the sword he lay the reptile twitch on the floor -- and for a few minute be madder with joy than ever in he life he have be with fear _ for fear be go the world of woe have fall from he shoulder the snake be to he but a wretched reptile whose head he would crush ere it bruise he heel he be sane -- he be safe -- he be a man again and ere many day be past he would be the husband of lucille and the master of monksmead _ oh god forgive I for a blind rebellious worm he pray forgive I and strike not this cup from my lip you would not punish the blasphemy of a madman i _ can not _ pray in order form but i beg forgiveness for my hasty cry ` there be on god ' and then press the sword to he lip -- the sword that under god have overthrow the snake for ever save he reason -- and give he lucille with the sword in he hand he lay on the bed once more and sleep the sweet dreamless sleep of a healthy happy child in the morning when he awake he eye fall upon the still live cobra that appear to watch he with the hate of a baffled lucifer as it lay broken-backed impotent and full of vicious fury rise damocles de warrenne step across to the reptile and with a quick snatch seize it behind the head and raise it from the ground stare into its baleful evil-looking eye he remark : -- well mine ancient enemy and almost victor i be not of a particularly vengeful disposition but i fancy a few of you brethren have get to die before i leave indium why you poor wretched worm you miserable maggot -- to think what i have _ suffer _ and he angrily dash it on the ground and spurn it with he foot easy to do that when you back 's break you think he continue right-o my lad wait till i find you mate and we 'll see hand to hand no weapon -- my quickness and strength against he quickness and venom snake the paltriest thing that crawl -- and he kick the reptile into a corner and burst into song as he busy himself about preparation for wash food for himself and the camel and -- _ return _ after enough food to hearten they both for the thirty-mile journey he would go as fast as camel 's leg could move to lucille and the announcement that would send she frantic with joy he would take she in he arm -- then they would waltz for a hour to keep themselves from behave like lunatic fear be dead the snake be dead -- kill by the sword the sword that lucille have bring and thereby save he madness be dead joy peace sanity health be come -- the wedding-bell be tremble to burst into peal of joyous announcement he would for lucille 's sake and the name of de warrenne and stukeley show whether he be a coward or a snake-fearing lunatic a epileptic a unfit-to-marry monstrosity and freak he would show the harley street physician how much he fear snake and would challenge they to a undertaking which would give they food for think before acceptance where be he boot he must fly to lucille and then the gallop hoof of a horse be hear thud towards the hut and hasten to the door he see lucille whipping a lathered horse rush towards she he shout : -- will you marry I to-morrow will you marry I to-day lucille and as she pull she horse in he dart back into the room and reappear twirl a twitch cobra by its tail and laugh uproariously lucille appear to be about to faint as he drop it seize she in he arm and say : -- _ darling i be cure i have not the slightest fear of snake the sword have save I i be a man again _ he tell she all as she sit laugh and sob for joy and the die snake lay at they foot in she heart of heart lucille determine that the wedding should take place immediately so that if this be but a temporary respite the result of the flash of daring inspire by the sword she would have the right to care for he for the rest of he life she would -- look she suddenly shriek and point to where in the doorway cut they off from escape be the mate of the cobra that lay mangled before they have the injured reptile in some way call its mate -- or be they regular inhabitant of this desert hut it be lucille 's first experience of cobra and she shudder to see the second -- evidently comprehend aggressive vengeful -- would it spring from there and the sword lay on the bed out of reach dam arise with a laugh pick up he heavy boot as he do so and all in one swift movement hurl it at the half-coiled sway creature with the true aim of the first-class cricketer and trained athlete then follow he boot with a leap he snatch at the tail of the coil thrashing reptile and crack the snake as a carter crack a whip -- whereafter it dangle limp and dead
