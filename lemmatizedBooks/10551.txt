affair in araby by talbot mundy chapter i i 'll make one to give this feisul boy a hoist whoever invent chess understand the world 's work as some man know clock and watch he recognize a fact and base a game on it with the result that he game endure and what he clearly recognize be this : that no king matter much as long as you side be play a win game you can leave you king in he corner then to amuse himself in dignified unimportance but the minute you begin to lose you king become a source of anxiety in what be call real life -lrb- which be only a great game although a mighty good one -rrb- it make no difference what you call you king call he pope if you want to or president or chairman he grow in importance in proportion as the other side develop the attack you have get to keep you symbol of authority protect or you lose nevertheless you game be not lose as long as you king can move that be why the man who want to hurry up and start a new political era imprison king and cut they head off with no head on he shoulder you king can only move in the direction of the cemetery which be over the line and do not count i love a good fight and have be tell i ought to be ashamed of it i have notice though that the folk who propose to elevate my moral fight just as hard and less cleanly with they tongue than some of we do with we fist and sinew i be tell too quite frequently that as a american i ought to be ashamed of fight for a king dear old lady of both sex have assure I that it be not moral to give aid and comfort to a gallant gentleman -- a godless mohammedan too which make it much worse -- who be strive gamely and without malice to keep he give word and save he country but if you have get all you want do you know of any better fun than lend a hand while some man you happen to like get he i do not of course some fellow want too much and it be bad manners as well as waste of time to inflict you opinion on they but give a reasonable purpose and a friend who need you assistance be there any better sport on earth than risk you own neck to help he put it over walk wide of the man and particularly of the woman who make a noise about line you pocket or improve you condition a altruist be my friend jame schuyler grim but he make less noise than a panther on a dark night and i never know a man less give to persuade you he have one purpose but almost never talk about it it be a sure bet that if we have not strike up a close friendship sound each other out carefully as opportunity occur i would have be in the dark about it until this minute all the news of asia from alexandretta to the persian gulf and from northern turkestan to south arabia reach grim 's ear sooner or later he earn he bread and butter knit all that mess of cross-grained information into one intelligible pattern after which he interpret it and act suddenly without advance notice time and again lone-handed he have do better than a army corps by play chief against chief in a land where the only law be individual interpretation of the koran but it be not until we rescue of jeremy ross from near abu kem that i ever hear grim come out openly and admit that he be work to establish feisul third son of the king of mecca as king of just as many arab as might care to have he over they that be the cat he have be keep in a bag for seven year right down to the minute when grim jeremy and i sit down with ben saoud the avenger on a stricken field at abu kem and grim and jeremy play they hand so cleverly that the avenger be make unwitting guardian of jeremy 's secret gold-mine and feisul 's open and swear supporter in the bargain the heart of grim 's purpose continue to be a mystery even to I and i have be as intimate with he as any man he dole out what he have in mind as grudgingly as any scot spend the shilling in he purse but the scot be generous when they have to be and so be grim there be nothing else for it on that occasion he spill the bean the whole bean and nothing but the bean have admit we two to he secret he dilate on it all the way back to jerusalem tell we all he know of feisul -lrb- which would fill a book -rrb- and grow almost lyrical at time as he related incident in proof of he contention that feisul lineal descendant of the prophet mohammed be the whitest arab and most gallant leader of he race since saladin know grim and how carefully suppress he enthusiasm usually be i could not help be fire by all he say on that occasion and as for jeremy well -- it be like meat and drink to he you meet man more or less like jeremy ross in any of earth 's wild place although you rarely meet he equal for audacity irreverence and riotous good-fellowship he be not the only australian by a long shot who uphold australium by fist and boast and astounding gallantry yet stay away from home you could not fix jeremy with concrete he would find some means of burst any mould he have be too long lose in the heart of arabium for anything except the thought of sydney bluff and the homestead that lie beyond to tempt he for the first few day you feller come with I he insist you chuck the army grim and i 'll show you a country where the cow have to bend they back to let the sun go down ha-ha show you woman too -- red-lipped girl in sunbonnet that 'll look good after the splay-footed crow you see out here tell you what : we 'll pick up the orient boat at port say -- no p and o for I i be a passenger aboard ship not a horrible example -- and make a wake for the bull 's kid murder will not the scoff taste good we 'll hit the bull 's kid hard for about a week -- mix it with the feller in from way back -- you know -- dry-blowers pearler spend it easy -- hand they money to bessie behind the bar and restless because she make it last too long watch they a while and get in touch with all that be happen then flit out of sydney like bat out of -- and hump blue -- eh something 'll turn up it always do i have get money in the bank -- about two thousand here in gold dust with I -- and if what you say 's true grim about I still be a trooper then the army owe I three year ' back pay and i 'll have it or go to buckingham palace and tear off a piece of the king we be capitalist by jupiter besides you feller agree that if i shut down the mine at abu kem you would join I and we would be grim ramsden and ross i 'll keep the bargain if you hold I to it when the time come grim answer you bet i 'll hold you to it rammy here and you and i could trade the choose people off the map between we we be a combination what be time get to do with it we have get to use you mine grim answer i be game but let 's see australium first suppose we fix up you discharge and you go home grim suggest come back when you have have a vacation and by that time ramsden and i will have do what be possible for feisul he be in damascus now but the french have get he back into a corner no money -- not much ammunition -- french propaganda undermine the allegiance of he man -- time work against he and nothing to do but wait what in hell have the french get to do with it they want syrium they have get the coast town now they mean to have damascus and if they can catch feisul and jail he to keep he out of mischief they will but damn it do not they promise the arab that feisul should be king of syrium palestine mesopotamium and all that they do the ally all promise france include but since the armistice the british have make a present of palestine to the jew and the french have demand syrium for themselves the british be pro-feisul but the french do not want he anywhere except dead or in jail they know they have give he and the arab a raw deal and they seem to think the simplest way out be to blacken feisul 's character and ditch he if the french once catch he in damascus he be do for and the arab cause be lose why lose demand jeremy there be plenty more arab but only one feisul he be the only man who can unite they all i know a chance for he say jeremy let he come with we three to australia there be thousand of feller there who fight alongside he and do not care a damn for the french they 'll raise all the hell there be before they 'll see he ditch uh-huh london 's the place for he grim answer the british like he and they be ashamed of the way he be be treat they 'll give he mesopotamium baghdad 's the old arab capital and that 'll do for a beginning after that it be up to the arab themselves well where do my gold mine come in jeremy ask feisul have no money if it be make clear to he that he could serve the arab best by go to london he would consider it the objection would be though that he would have to make term in advance with hog-financier who have work through the foreign office to tie up all the oil and mine and irrigation concession if we tell he privately about you gold mine at abu kem he can laugh at financier all right say jeremy i 'll give he the gold mine let he erect a modern plant and he 'll have million uh-huh keep the mine secret let he go to london and arrange about mespot just at present high finance could find a hundred way of dispute he title to the mine but once he be king with the arab all root for he thing 'll be different he 'll treat you right when that time come do not worry worry I say jeremy all that worry I be have to see this business through before we can make a wake for sydney i be homesick but never mind all right you feller i 'll make one to give this feisul boy a hoist chapter ii atcha jimgrim sahib atcha that conversation and jeremy 's conversion to the big idea take place on the way across the desert to jerusalem -- a journey that take we a week on camel-back -- a rowdy hot journey with the stifle simoom blowing grit into we follower ' throat who sing and argue alternately nevertheless for besides we old alus baba and he sixteen son and grandson there be jeremy 's ten pickup from arabium 's byway whom he could not leave behind because they know the secret of he gold-mine grim 's authority be always at its height on the outbound trail for then everybody know that success and even safety depend on he swift think on the way home afterward reaction set in sometimes because arab be make light-headed by success and it be not a simple matter to discipline free man when you have no obvious hold over they but that be where jeremy come in jeremy could do trick and the arab be like child when he perform for they they would be good if he would make one live chicken into two live one by pull it apart they would pitch the tent without fight if he would swallow a dozen egg and produce they presently from under a camel 's tail if he would turn on he ventriloquism and make a camel say its prayer they be willing to forgive -- for the moment anyhow -- even they nearest enemy so we become a sort of travel sideshow with jeremy ballyhoo for himself in a amazing flow of colloquial arabic and hardly ever repeat the same trick all of which be very good for we crowd and convenient at the moment but hardly so good for jeremy 's equilibrium he be one of those handsome perpetually youthful fellow whose head have be a wee mite turn by the sunshine of the world 's warm smile i do not mean by that that he be not a tophole man or a thorough-going friend with gut and gumption who would chance he neck for anyone he like without a second 's hesitation for he be every bit of that he have horse sense too and be not fool by the sort of flattery that woman lavish on man who have laugh eye and a little dark moustache but he have not be yet in a predicament that he could not laugh or fight he way out of he have never yet find a job that he care to stick at for more than a year or two and seldom one that could hold he for six month he jump from one thing to another find all the world so interesting and amusing and most folk so ready to make friend with he that he always feel sure of landing softly somewhere over the horizon so by the time we reach jerusalem friend jeremy be ripe for almost anything except the plan we have agree on have talk that over pretty steadily most of the way from abu kem it seem already about as stale and unattractive to he as some of he oldest trick and jerusalem provide plenty of distraction we have not be in grim 's quarter half a hour when jeremy be up to he ear in a dispute that look like separate we grim who wear he arab clothes from preference and never get into uniform if he can help it go straight to the telephone to report briefly to headquarters i take jeremy upstairs to discard my indian disguise and hunt out clothes for jeremy that would fit he but find none i be nearly as heavy as grim and jeremy together he have finish clowning in the kit i offer he and have get back into he arab thing while i be shave off the black whisker with which nature adorn my face whenever i neglect the razor for a few day when a auto come tooting and roar down the narrow street and a moment later three staff officer take the stair at a run so far good that be unofficial good-natured human and entirely decent the three of they burst through the bed room door all grin and take turn pump with jeremy 's right arm -- glad to see he -- proud to know he -- pleased to see he look fit and well and all that kind of thing even man who have fight all through the war have forget some of its red tape by that time and jeremy not be in uniform they treat he like a fellow human being and he reciprocate australian fashion free and easy throw up he long leg on my bed and yell for somebody to bring drink for the crowd while they shower question on he it be not until jeremy turn the table and begin to question they that the first cloud show itself say old top he demand of a man who wear the cross sword of a brigadier grim tell I i be a trooper when can i get my discharge the effect be instantaneous you would have think they have touch a leper by the way they draw themselves up and change face never think of that oh i say -- this be a complication you mean i mean this jeremy answer dryly because nobody could have help notice they change of attitude : i be make prisoner by arab and carry off that be more than three year ago the war 's over grim tell I all australian have be send home and discharge what about I um-m-m ah this will have to be consider let 's see to whom do you surrender damn you i do not surrender i meet grim in the desert and report to he for duty meet major grim eh yes say grim appear in the door i come across he in the desert he report for duty i give he a order and he obey it everything 's regular um-m-m how would you make that out -- regular have you any proof he be not a deserter he 'll have to be charge with desertion and try by court martial i be afraid possibly a mere formality but it 'll have to be do you know before he can be give a clear discharge if he can not be prove guilty of desertion he 'll be clear how long will that take jeremy demand he voice ring sharp with the challenge note that mean debate have cease and quarrel start it be not the right note for dissolve difficulty could not tell you say the brigadier my advice to you be to keep yourself as inconspicuous as possible until the administrator get back it be good advice but grim standing behind the brigadier make signal to jeremy in vain few australian talk peace when there be no peace and when there be a fight in prospect they like to get it over i remember you say jeremy speaking rather slowly and throw in a little catchy laugh that be like a war-cry hear through a microphone you be the fusileer major they lend to the jordan highlander -- fine force that -- no advance without security -- lose two man if i remember -- snakebite one the other shot for looting be i right so they have make you a brigadier be not you the staff officer they send to strafe a regiment of anzac for go into action without order we chase you to cover i can see you now run for fear we have shoot you hah grim take the only course possible in the circumstance the brigadier 's neck be crimson and jeremy have to be save somehow touch of sun sir -- that and hardship have unhinge he a bit suffer from delusion suppose i keep he here until the doctor see he um-m-m ah yes you would better see he get no whisky will you too bad too bad what a pity we three visitor leave in a hurry contrive to look devilish important grim follow they out rammy old cock say jeremy sprawl on the bed again and laugh do not look all that serious bring back you brigadier and i 'll kiss he on both cheek while you hold he but say suppose that doctor 's one of these swab who serve out number nine pill for shell-shock broken leg dyspepsia housemaid 's knee and the creep itch suppose he swear i be luny what then grim will find somebody to swear to anything once i answer but you look altogether too dash healthy -- get to give the doctor-man a chance -- here get between the sheet and kid that something hurt you get out the doc ` ud put a cast-iron splint on it and order I into a hospital how about toothache that do do they give you bread and water for it so toothache be select as a alibi and jeremy wrap he jaw in a towel after jab he cheek with a pin so as to remember on which side the pain should be but it be artifice waste for grim have turn a better trick he have find a australian doctor in the hospital for sikh -- the only other australian in jerusalem just then -- and bring he cooee-ing upstairs in a way that prove he know the whole story already the autopsy as he call it be a riot we do not talk of anything but fight at gaza -- the surprise at nazareth when the german general staff flee up the road on foot in its pyjamas -- the three-day scrap at nebus samwil when australian and turk take and retake the same hill half a dozen time and parched enemy take turn drink from one flask while the shell of both side burst above they it seem to have be almost like old-fashioned war in palestine from they account of it either side concede that the other play the game when they have thrash the whole campaign over from start to finish make map on my bed with hair brush razor and thing they get to talk of australium and that be all about fight too : dog fight fist fight between bullocky on the long road from northern queensland riot in perth when the pearler come in off the barrier reef to spend they pay row in the big shear shed when the union man object to unskilled labor -- you would have think australium be one big battlefield with nothing else but fight worth talk of from dawn till dark the doctor be one of those tightly-knit dark-complexioned little man with large freckle and brown eye who surprise you with a mixture of intense domestic virtue and a capacity that should not mix with it at all for turn up in all the unexpected place you meet he sort everywhere and they always have a wife along who worship they and make a home out of tin can and packing-case that would put the stay-at-home housekeeper to shame they always have a picture on the wall of cow stand knee-deep in the water and no matter what they circumstance be there be always something in reserve for guest offer frankly without apology never hesitate with those folk but do not let they go too far for they 'll beggar themselves to help you in a tight place if you 'll let they ticknor he name be he be a good man say grim there be a case in the sikh hospital that ought to interest you he say at last fellow from damascus -- arab -- one of feisul 's crowd he would not let they take he to the zionist hospital -- swear a jew knife he and that the other would finish the job if they get half a chance they would have be argue yet and he dead and bury if i have not go shopping with mabel she see the crowd first -lrb- i be in noureddin 's store -rrb- and jab she way in with she umbrella -- she yell to I and i buck the line the jew want to tell I i have no right to take that chap to the sikh hospital and no more have i so i plug he up a bit and put he in a cab and let he take himself there mabel and I beside he see i be pay for the cab i do not see why mabel should walk of course once we have he in there he be too sick to be move but the army will not pay for he so i send a bill to the zionist and they return it with a rude remark on the margin maybe i can get the money out of feisul some day otherwise i be stuck i 'll settle that say grim what be the tune he play utter mystery swear a jew stab he but that damascus outfit blame the jew for everything he be only just down from damascus i think he be one of feisul 's officer although he be not in uniform -- prob ` ly on a secret mission suppose you go and see he but say watch out for the doc on duty -- he be a meddler tell he nothing sure how about jeremy what be the verdict what do you want do with he i want he out of reach of trouble here pend he discharge no need to certify he mad be there mad all australian be mad none of we need a certificate for that have you arrest he not yet then you be too late he be suffer from bad food and exposure the air of jerusalem 's bad for he and he be liable to get pugnacious if argue with that run in the blood i order he off duty and shall recommend he within twenty minute to the pmo for leave of absence at he own expense if you know of any general who dare override the pmo i 'll show you a brass hat in the wind come on d'you want to bet on it will the pmo fall ask grim like a new chum off a brumby sign anything i shove under he nose come round to we house to eat mabel 's damper and syrup three night a week you bet he 'll sign it : besides he be white pull out of the firing-line by a australian at gaza and have not forget it he would sign anything but check to help a anzac i 'll be go you trot up to the slaughter-shop grim and interview that arab -- sidus bin something-or-other -- forget he name -- he lie in number nineteen cot on the left-hand side of the long ward next to a pathan who be shy both leg you can not mistake he i 'll write out a medical certificate for jeremy and follow and say wait a minute what price the lot of you eat mabel 's chow tonight at we house we do not keep a cook so you will not get poison that be settle i 'll tell mabel you be come tootleloo but there be a chance that the brigadier might carry resentment to the point of send up a provost-marshal 's guard to arrest jeremy on the well-known principle that a bird in the hand can be strafe more easily than one with a medical certificate the bush be the place for we bird until such time as the pmo 's signature should adorn the necessary piece of paper so we three ride up in a cab together to the sikh hospital and have a rare time try to get in you see there be a sikh on guard outside who respect nothing under heaven but he order he would not have know grim in any event be only recently from indium grim 's uniform would have pass he in but he and jeremy be still array as arab and my civilian clothes entitle I in the sentry 's opinion to protection lest i commit the heinous sin of impertinence a arab in he eye be as a insect and a white man who consort with such creature not a person to be take seriously but we friend narayan singh be in the hospital enjoy the wise veteran 's prerogative of rest on full pay after he strenuous adventure along with we at abu kem there be nothing whatever the matter with he he recognize grim 's voice and emerge through the front door with a milk-white smile flash in the midst of newly-curled black hair -- dignified immense and full of instant understanding grim say a few word to narayan singh in arabic which so far as the sentry be concern be not a language but narayan singh speak in turn in punjabus and the man just out from indium begin to droop like jonah 's gourd under the old soldier 's scorn in consequence we get a full salute with arm present and walk in without have to trouble anybody in authority narayan singh lead with the air of a old-time butler show royalty to they room he even ascertain in a aside that the doctor of the day be busy operating and break that good news with consummate tact : the sahib ' lightest wish be law but if they should wish to speak with the doctor sahib it would be necessary to call he forth from the surgery where he work behind lock door be it desire that i should summon he operation serious ask grim and neither man smile it be perfect act very sahib he remove the half of a sepoy 's liver uh could not think of interrupt he too bad lead the way but we do not enter the ward until narayan singh and a orderly have place two screen around number nineteen cot in the way they do when a man be die and have place three chair at the bedside contrary to the regulation print on the wall then narayan singh stand on guard outside the screen but do not miss much of the conversation i believe the man in bed be wound badly but not fatally and though he eye blaze with fever he seem to have some of he wit about he he recognize grim after stare hard at he for about a minute jimgrim sidus bin tagim be not it well well i think it might be you say grim speak the northern dialect of arabic which differ quite a bit from that speak around jerusalem who be these ask the man in bed speaking hoarsely as he stare first at jeremy and then at I jmil ra a friend of mine grim answer and that one he do not like the look of I at all western clothes and a shaven face spell nothing reassure to the arab when in trouble he have be help by the foreigner a time or two too often a american name ramsden also a friend of mine oh a amirikanus a hakim no not a doctor not a man to fear he be a friend of feisul on whose word mine grim answer sidus bin tagim nod he seem willing to take grim 's word for anything why do you say a jew stab you grim ask suddenly so that they might hang a jew or two wallah be the jew not at the bottom of all trouble if a greek should kill a maltese it would be a jew who plan it may the curse of allah change they face and the fire of eblis consume they do you see the man who stab you yes and be he a jew jimgrim you know better than to ask that a jew always hire another to do the killing he who strike I be a hireling who shall die by my hand as allah be my witness but may allah do more to I and bring I down into the dust unburied unless i make ten jew pay for this any one jew in particular grim ask and the man in bed close up like a clam that have be touch he be a strange-looking fellow -- rather like one of those lean spaniard whom goya use to paint with a scant beard turn gray and hollow cheek he have throw off the gray army blanket because fever burn he and he lean hard muscle stand out as if cast in bronze but for the jew feisul would be king of all this land this minute he say suddenly and close up tight again grim smile he nearly always do smile when apparently at a loose end at moment when most cross-examiner would browbeat he grow sympathetic -- humor he man and by follow whatever detour offer get back on the trail again how about the french he ask may allah smite they they be all in the pay of jew can you prove it wallah that i can grim look incredulous those baffling eye of he twinkle with quiet amusement and the man in bed resent it you laugh jimgrim but if you would listen i might tell you something but grim only smile more broadly than ever sidi bin tagim you be one of those fanatic who think the world be all league against you why should the jew think you sufficiently important to be murder wallah there be few who hold the rein of happening as i do if they would kill you they would have stop the clock eh that be as allah may determine i be not dead have you friend in jerusalem surely strange that they have not be to see you wallah not strange at all i see they regard you as a man without authority who might make trouble and leave other man to face it eh who say i have no authority well if you could prove you have -- what then the man in bed demand try to sit up feisul for instance be a friend of mine and these man with I be he friend too you have no letter of course for that would be dangerous jimgrim in the name of the most high i swear i have a letter he who stab I take it i -- be the letter from feisul malaish -- no matter it be seal and bear a number for the signature if you can get that letter for I jimgrim -- but what be the use you be a servant of the british tell I who stab you and i 'll get you the letter no for you be clever you would learn too much better tell the doctor of this place to hurry up and heal I then i will attend to my own affair i would like to keep you out of jail if that be possible grim answer you and i be old acquaintance sidi bin tagim but of course if you be here to sow sedition and should there be a document at large in proof of it which document should fall into the hand of the police -- well i could not do much for you then you would better tell I who stab you and i 'll get after he ah but if you get the letter i shall read it of course but to whom will you show it perhaps to my friend here be they bind by you honor i shall hold they so there be the glint in grim 's eye now that should warn anyone who know he that the scent be hot add to the fact that the rest of he expression suggest wane interest that look of he forebode fine hunting there be one other i might consult he admit casually on my way here i see one of feisul 's staff captain drive in a cab toward the jaffa gate the instant effect of that remark be to throw the wounded man into a paroxysm of mingled rage and fear he almost throw a fit he already bloodless face grow ashy gray and livid blue alternately and he would have scream at grim if the cough that begin to rack he whole body would have let he as it be he gasp out unintelligible word and seek to make grim understand by sign and grim apparently do understand very well he laugh tell I who stab you and i will not mention you name to staff-captain abd el kadir and these man will they say nothing not a word who stab you yussuf dakmar may allah cut he off from love and mercy golly explode jeremy forget not to talk english there be a swine for you yussuf dakmar 's the son of a sea-cook who use to sell sheep to the army four time over -- drive 'em into camp and get a receipt -- drive 'em out again next night -- bring 'em back in the morning -- get a receipt again -- drive 'em off -- bring 'em back -- we chap too busy shift brother turk to cotton on he 'll be the boy i kick out of camp once maybe remember it too i 'll bet he backbone 's twang yet lead I to he grim old cock i would like another piece of he but grim be hum to himself play piano on the bed-sheet with he finger be that man not a arab ask the fellow in bed take alarm all over again arab you aunt laugh jeremy : i eat arab i be the only original genuine woolly bad man from way back i be the plumber who pull the plug out of arabium you know english good you know what a dose of salt be then you have see it work experienced it maybe hah you 'll

much from he do not want to have to arrest he get I come on then answer jeremy i have promise he a shirt beyond the screen narayan singh stand like a statue deaf dumb immovable even he eye be fix with a blank stare on the wall opposite how much do you hear grim ask he i sahib i be a sick man i have be asleep dream anything as you honor please hospital 's stuffy be not it think you could recover health more rapidly outdoors sick-leave continue of course but -- how about a little exercise the sikh 's eye twinkle sahib you know i need exercise i 'll speak to the doctor for you in case he sign a

enemy property and its only virtue consist in its be rent free grim jeremy little ticknor and he smaller wife and i sit face across a small deal table with a stutter oil-lamp between we in a house not

curious enough the time be nine pm we have talk the anzac hurricane-drive through palestine all over again from the beginning take world-known name in vain and do honor to other that will stay unsung for lack of recognition when one of those unaccountable pause come and for the sake of break silence mabel ticknor ask a question she be a little plucky pale-faced thing whom you call instinctively by she first name at the end of half a hour -- a sort of little mother of loose-ended man who can make silk purse out of sow ' ear and would not know how to brag if she be tempt say jim she ask turn she

in the rain but do not leak but neither man nor woman could have extract a story from jame schuyler grim unless it suit he to tell it mabel ticknor be one of those honest little woman who carry man 's secret with they up and down the world be confide in by nearly every man who meet she be a habit but grim tell only when the tell may accomplish something and i wonder as he lay he elbow on the table to begin just what use he mean to make of mabel ticknor he use what he know as other level-headed man use coin spending thriftily for fair advantage that be secret he begin as soon as mabel have dump the contents of the billy into a huge brown teapot i expect narayan singh here presently he 'll have a letter with he take from the syrian who stab that man in the hospital whoa hoss jeremy interrupted you mean you have send that sikh to get the shirt of yussuf dakmar grim nod that be my job jeremy object whoa hoss yourself jeremy grim answer you would have go down into the bazaar like a bull into a china-shop narayan singh know where to find he if he show fight he 'll be simply hand over to the sikh patrol for attack a man in uniform and by the time he reach the lock-up that letter will be here on the table between we all the same that be a lark you have do I out of jeremy insist that yussuf dakmar 's a stinker i know all about he two whole squadron have to eat lousy biscuit for a week because that swab sell the same meat five time over but i 'll get he yet well as i be say grim resume there be a letter in jerusalem that be suppose to be from feisul but when feisul write anything he sign he name to it whereas a number be the signature on this now that fellow sidus bin tagim in the hospital be a honest old kite in he way he be a great rooter for feisul and the only easy way to ditch a man like feisul who be as honest as the day be long and no man 's fool be to convince he fanatical admirer that for he own sake he ought to be force along a certain course the game 's as old as adam you fill up a man like sidus bin tagim with tale about jew -- convince he that jew stand between feisul and a kingdom -- and he 'll lend a hand in any scheme ostensibly direct against jew get I so would i swear jeremy i be against 'em too i camped alongside the jordan highlander one time when -- but we have have that story twice that evening with variation he be balance he chair on two leg so i push he over backward and before he could pick himself up again grim resume feisul be in damascus and the syrian convention have proclaim he king that do not suit the french who detest he the feeling 's mutual when feisul go to pari for the peace conference the french imagine he be easy they think here 's another of these eastern prince who can be take in the old trap so they stage a special performance at the opera for he and invite he to supper afterward behind the scene with the usual sort of lady in full war-paint in attendance shall we cut that too suggest mabel sure feisul do he be not that kind of moth ever since then the french have declare he be a hypocrite and because he will not yield he rights they have be busy invent wrong of they own and insist on immediate adjustment the french have not leave one stone unturn that could irritate feisul into make a false move to hell with they suggest jeremy reach for more tea but feisul 's not easy to irritate grim go on he be one of those rare man who get bear once in a epoch who force you to believe that virtue be not extinct he be almost like a child in some thing -- like a good woman in other -- and a man of iron courage all the time who can fire arab in the same way saladin do five century ago he look like a saint say jeremy i have see he but he be no soft liver continue grim he be bring up in the desert among bedouin and have they stoical endurance with a sort of religious patience add get that maybe from be a descendant of the prophet awful sort to have to fight that kind be say jeremy they wear you down so the french decide some time ago to persuade feisul 's intimate to make a bad break which he could not repudiate why do not he cut loose with forty or fifty thousand man and boot the french into the sea demand jeremy i 'll make one to help he i know a frenchman once who -- we 'll come to that presently say grim i dare say you do not hear of verdun objection sustain hand it to 'em they have get gut grin jeremy fire away old top well they run foul of a awkward predicament which be that there be some darned decent fellow among the officer of they army of occupation there be more than a scattering of decent gentleman who do not like dirt i will not say they tell feisul secret or disobey order but if you want to give a man a square deal there be way of do it without send he telegram mabel put the tea back on the kerosene stove to stew with a extra handful of black leaf in it grim continue : another thing : the french be half afraid that if they take the field against feisul on some trumped-up pretext he 'll get assistance from the british they could send he thing he need more than money and can not get ninety-nine per cent of the british be pro-feisul some of they would risk they job to help he in a pinch the french have get to stall those man before they can attack feisul safely how d'you mean -- stall 'em demand jeremy not all the british be fool -- only they statesman and general and sixty percent of the junior officer and rank and file the rest do not have to be feed pap from a bottle they be good man take more than talk to stall that kind off a man they like you have get the idea jeremy you have to show they well why not stir up revolution here in palestine in feisul 's name why not get the malcontent to murder jew wholesale with propaganda blow full blast to make it look as if feisul 's hand be direct it all it be as simple as fall off a log french agent who look like honest arab approach the most hairbrained zealot who happen to be on the inside with feisul and suggest to they that the french and british be ally therefore the only way to keep the british from help the french will be to start red-hot trouble in palestine that will keep the british busy protect themselves and the jew the secret agent point out that although feisul be against anything of the sort he must be commit to it for he own sake and they make great capital out of feisul 's promise that he will protect the jew if recognize as king of independent syrium kill all the jew beforehand so there will not be any for he to protect when the time come -- that be the argument mabel interrupted have not you warn feisul she have both elbow on the table and she chin between she hand and i dare say she have listen in just that attitude to fifty inside story that the newspaper would scatter gold in vain to get i sure do and he have send one of he staff down here to keep a eye on thing i see he this afternoon ride in a cab toward the jaffa gate i say as much to that fellow in the hospital and he be scare stiff at the idea of my recover the suppose feisul letter and show it to a officer who be really in feisul 's confidence that -- i mean the man 's fear -- link everything up you talk like sherlock holme laugh jeremy i 'll bet you a new hat nothing come of it that bet 's on grim answer it be to be a female hat and mabel get it order a expensive one from paris mabel jeremy shall pay we have lot of other information the troops here have be warn of a intended massacre of jew the arrival of this letter probably put a date to it but it put a date to something else on which the whole future of the near east hang and that mean the future of half the world and maybe the whole of it because about three hundred million mohammedan be watch feisul and will govern themselves accordingly indium persium mesopotamium egypt all northern africa -- there be almost no limit to what depend on feisul 's safety and the french can not or will not understand that there come the sound of heavy ammunition boot outside on the stone step follow by a cough that i believe i could recognize among a thousand narayan singh cough either of two way -- once deep bass for all be well twice almost falsetto for a hint of danger this time it be the single deep bass cough but it be follow after half a minute by the two high-pitched bark and grim hold up a hand for silence at the end of perhaps a minute there come from the veranda a perfect imitation of the lascar 's ungrammatical whining singsong from a fo ` castle-head : hum dekta haus -- i be on the watch grim nod -- to himself i suppose for none have speak to he do you mind step out and get that letter from he ramsden keep in the shadow please and give he this pistol he may need it so i slip out through the screen door and spend a minute look for narayan singh i be a old hunter but it be not until narayan singh deliberately move a hand to call attention to himself that i discover he within ten foot of I the risk of be see from the street in case some spy be lurk out there be obvious so i walk all the way round the house and come and stand below he on he left hand where the house cast impenetrable shadow but though i take my time and move stealthily he hear I and pass I a letter through the veranda rail accept the pistol in exchange without comment i could see he distinctly from that angle he uniform on one side be tear almost into rag and he turban be all awry as if he have lose it in a scuffle and have not spare time to rewind it properly -- a sure sign of desperate haste for a male tiger in the spring-time be no more careful of he whisker than a sikh be of the thirty yard of cloth he wind around he head as he do not speak or make any more movement than be necessary to pass I the letter and take the pistol i return the way i have come enter by the back door toss the letter to grim and creep back again to bear a hand in case of need grim say nothing but jeremy follow I and two minute later the australian and i be crouch in darkness below the veranda this time i do not think narayan singh be aware of friend at hand he eye be fix on the slightly lighter gap in a dark wall that be the garden gate but look more like a dim hole lead into a cave there be no other entrance that we know of jeremy and i double up on the same job and a rat could not have come through without one of the three of we detect he if we have have we sens with we we might have realize that narayan singh be perfectly capable of watch that single narrow space and have use we own eye to better advantage however we be all three alive today and two of we learn a lesson it be not long -- perhaps five minute -- before a man show himself outside the gate like a spectre dodge this and that way in response to unearthly impulse once or twice he start forward as if on the point of sneak in but think better of it and retreat once he attitude suggest that he might be take aim with a pistol but if that be so he choose not to waste a shot or start a alarm by firing at a mark he could not see what he do accomplish be to keep six keen eye fix on he and that give three other man they chance to gain a entrance at the rear of the wall in the garden and creep up unaware it be probably sheer accident that lead all three of they along the far side of the house but it be fortunate for jeremy and I for otherwise cold steel between we shoulder-blade would likely have be we first intimation of they presence we never suspect they existence until they gain the veranda by the end opposite to where we wait and i think they would have do they murder if the man outside the gate have not lose he head from excitement or some similar emotion and try to make a signal to they all three have bring up against the end window where a shade tear in two place provide a good view into the room in which grim mabel and the doctor be still sit each of they have a pistol and they intention do not admit of doubt be you there sahib narayan singh whisper but jeremy and i be aware of they almost as soon as he and rather than make a noise by vault the veranda rail we take the longer route by way of the front step jeremy who be wear sandal kick they off and not have to creep so carefully move faster of course the obvious question be why do not narayan singh shoot i have a pistol too why do not i use it well i 'll tell you none but the irresponsible criminal shoot a man except in obedience to order or in self-defence you may argue that those three night-prowler might have shoot ticknor and he wife and grim through the window while we air we superior virtue the answer to that be that they do not although that be they intention narayan singh already once that night in danger of he life and a godless heathen sikh as i have hear a missionary call he pocket the pistol i have give he before proceed to engage he be also a white man by the proper way of estimate such thing jeremy be first on the scene of action with narayan singh close behind he and i be quite a bit behind for i trip against the top step in my hurry the noise i make give the alarm and the three arab twisted round like cornered scorpion i guess they could not see we well at first have be stare through the tear shade into the light room they pistol be cock but jeremy 's fist land in the nearest man 's face before he could shoot and he go crash backwards into he friend behind whose head disappear for a moment through the window-pane and the only blood shed on that occasion come from the first man 's nose and the back of the second man 's neck where the smash glass slit a gash in it the third man fire wildly at I and miss a fraction of a second before narayan singh land on he with hand and foot whereat the man in the street empty he pistol at I and run away i be in two mind whether to give chase to he but make the wrong decision be heavy on my foot and none too fond of run so the big fish get away but even with my help add the three less important fish still give a lot of trouble for they fight like wild cat use tooth and finger - nail and the doctor and he wife and grim be all out lend a hand before we have they finally convince that the game be up mabel truss up the worst man with a clothes line while i sit on he i expect to see a crowd around the house by that time but jerusalem work otherwise than some city the sound of a pistol-shot send everybody hurry for cover lest some enemy accuse they afterwards of have have a hand in the disturbance and the nearest police post be a mile away so we have we little outrage all to ourselves although strange tale go the round of the holy city that night and two week later several european newspaper print a beautiful account of a midnight massacre of jew we drag we prisoner into the sitting-room and stand they up in front of grim after the doctor and mabel have attend to they hurt which be not especially serious although nobody need expect to get in the way of jeremy 's fist and feel comfortable for several hour afterwards the cut make in the second man 's neck by broken glass need several stitch but the third man be only wind from have be sit on and of course he be much more sorry for himself than either of the other two -- a fact that grim note there be another noticeable circumstance that shed light on human nature and grim 's knowledge of it they be all three eager to tell they story although not necessarily the same story whereas narayan singh who know that every word he might say would be believe implicitly be in no hurry to tell he at all now when you be deal with eastern and near-eastern people of the sort who lie instinctively -lrb- and it may be that this apply to the west as well -rrb- it be a good plan to establish if you can a basis of truth for they to build they tale on because the truth act like acid on untruth they be go to lie in any case but lie tell without any reference to truth knit better than when invent at a moment 's notice to explain away another 's straightforward statement there be a plausible theory that culprit take in the act be best examine in secret one by one in ignorance of all the evidence against they the wise method be to let they hear the evidence against themselves nine time out of ten they will accept that as unanswerable and strive to twist its meaning or smother it under a mass of lie but the truth they have accept as i have say work just like acid and destroy they argument almost as fast as they build it up in the few case when that do not happen they break down altogether and confess anyhow grim who teach I what i have just write refuse to listen to they bleat until narayan singh first tell in they hearing all that he know about the night 's event they be force to sit down on the floor and listen to he like three coffee-shop lounger be tell a story and i do not doubt that the effect be strengthen by the sikh 's standing face they for the contrast be as between jackal and a lion not that they be small man for they be not or mere ten-dollar assassin pick up in the suk they look well feed and wear fine linen whereas narayan singh be in rag and have lose weight in we recent desert march so that he cheek-bone stand out and he look superficially much more like a man at bay than they do but they well-cared-for face be lean in the wrong place and puffy under the eye in place of courage they flaunt a insolent leer and the smile intend to convey self-confidence betray to a close observer anxiety border on panic the most offensive part about they really be they foot which be index of character too often overlook they have come to they task in slipper which they have kick off before reach the veranda and instead of the firm tough foot that a real man stand on what they display as they squat be subtle soft thing not exactly flabby but even more suggestive of treachery than they thin beak and shifty eye to sum they up they be dandy of the kind who join the young turk party and believe the new era can be distil of talk and trick and they look like mean animal compare to that staunch conservative narayan singh who nevertheless be not without he own degree of subtlety chapter iv i call this awful sahib in accordance with instruction i proceed to christian street to the place you speak of where i find yussuf dakmar drinking coffee and smoking in company with these man and other they do not see I in the beginning because i enter by the door of a house threescore and five pace farther down the street and have by that mean gain the roof i descend to a gallery build of stone above one end of the coffee-shop and there lay conceal among evil-smelling bag they converse in arabic and presently when other man have enter some of whose name i overheard and write down on this slip of paper yussuf dakmar lock the outer door turn the great key twice and set a chain in place as well then he stand on a red stool have four short leg with he back to the door that he have lock and speak in the manner of one who stir a multitude gesticulate greatly the argument he make be thus : he say that jerusalem be a holy city and palestine a holy land and that promise be all the more sacred if give in connection with religious matter whereat they all applaud greatly nevertheless a little later on he mock at all religion and they applaud that too he say that the ally persuade thereto by the british have make a promise to the emir feisul on the strength of which the arab make common war with the ally against the turk and german lose of they own a hundred thousand man and untold money so sahib next he ask they how much of that promise make by the ally to emir feisul as the leader of the arab have be keep or be likely to be keep and they answer in one voice ` none of it ' whereat he nod as a teacher nod gravely when the pupil have they lesson well by heart and say presently in a voice like that of a guru denounce sin : ' a woman 's promise be a little matter who believe it when it be break all man laugh a promise extort under threat or torture be not bind since he who make the promise be not free to govern he own conduct that be law a promise make in business ' say he ` be a contract contingent on circumstance and subject to litigation but a promise make in wartime by a nation be a pledge set down in letter of blood whoever break it be guilty of blood and whoever fail to smite dead the breaker of that oath commit treason against allah ' they applaud that speech greatly sahib and when they grow silent he bid they look about and judge for themselves at whose door the breaking of that sacred promise really lay ` show I ' say he ` one trace of arab government in all palestine who own the land ' he ask they ` arab ' say they ` yet to whom have the country be give ' he shout ` to the jew ' they answer and he grow silent for a while like a teacher whose class have only give half the answer to a question until presently one man growl out ` to the sword with the jew in the name of allah ' and the other echo that which satisfied he for he smile nevertheless not use those word himself and presently he continue : ` we in this room be man of enlightenment we be satisfied to leave past and future to speculation of idle dreamer for we the present so we attach no value to the fact that feisul be descend in a straight line from the founder of the moslem faith for that be a superstition as foolish in its way as christianity or any other creed but who be there like feisul who can unite all arab under one banner ' they answer sahib that feisul be the only live man who can accomplish that make many assertion in he praise yussuf dakmar nod approval as each speak ` yet ' say he when they have finish ` feisul be also fallible in certain way he be a fool and principally in this : that he insist on keep he own promise to man who have break they own promise to he ' and like pupil in a class who recite they lesson they all murmur that such a course as that be madness ` so ' say he ` we be clear on that point we be not altruist nor religious fanatic nor slave but man of common sense who have a business in view we be not feisul 's servant but he ours we make use of he not he of we if he persist in a wrong course we must force he into the right one for the day of autocratic government be past and the hour have come when those who truly represent the people have the first right to direct all policy if the right be still withhold from they they must take it and it be we in this room who truly represent the arab cause on whom lie the responsibility of force feisul 's hand ' well sahib these three prisoner who sit here offer at once to go to damascus and kill the man who be advise feisul wrongly they say that if they be give money they could easily hire damascene to do the dagger work there be as the sahib doubtless know a common say in these part about damascus folk and sharp steel whereat yussuf dakmar suddenly assume a sneering tone of voice say that he prefer man for he part with spunk enough to do such work themselves and there be a argument they protest and he mock they until at last this man whose neck the glass cut demand of he whether he yussuf dakmar be not in truth a empty boaster who would flinch at bloodshed he seem to have be wait for just that sahib for he smirk and throw a chest ' i be a man ' say he ` of example as well as precept i have do what i see fit to do i make no boast ' say he ` for a man who talk about himself set other talk and there be deed creditable to the doer that be best not speak of but i will tell you other thing and you may draw you own conclusion ` because feisul refuse to attack the french have promise those promise-breaker that he will not and because feisul have promise to protect the jew and be likely to try to keep that promise to the promise-breaking english certain of he intimate in damascus in whose confidence i be have determine to force both issue take step in he name that will commit he finally feisul 's army of fifty thousand man be as ready as it will ever be there be no money in the damascus treasury and therefore every moment of delay be now a moment lose the time have come for action ' we three prisoner be listen to the recitation spellbound and so be we all for that matter the mere memory feat be amazing enough few man could listen in hide to a stranger 's word and report they exactly after a interval of more than a hour but narayan singh do better than that for he reproduce the speaker 's gesture and inflexion so that we have a mental picture of the scene that he describe mabel offer he stew tannic acid in the name of tea and ticknor suggest a chair but he wave both offer aside and continue as if the picture before he mind and the word he be remember might escape he if he take thing easy sahib they be very much excite when he speak of action first one man and then another stand up and boast of have make all thing ready how this one have supervise the hiding of sharp sword how another have keep man at work collect cartridge on battlefield how this and that one have continue spread talk against the jew so that they swear that at least ten thousand moslem in jerusalem be fret to begin a massacre ` let feisul only strike the first blow from damascus ' say they ` and palestine will run blood instantly ' and we sit here drink tea exclaimed mabel while up at headquarters they be dance and play bridge i call this awful we all ought to be grim smile and shake he head for silence we have know all this for some time he say do not worry there 'll be no massacre the troops be sleep by they arm and every possible contingency have be provide for go on narayan singh well sahib when they have do babble and boast this yussuf dakmar get back on he stool and speak sternly as one who give final judgment and intend to be obey ` it be we who must make the first move ' say he ` and we shall force feisul to move after we by move in he name ' whereat this man here whose nose be break on the fist of jeremy sahib say that a letter bear feisul 's seal would make the matter easier ` for the man ' say he ` who be to slit jew ' throat will ask first for proof of we authority to bid they begin the business ' and at that speech yussuf dakmar laugh with great delight ` better late than never ' say he ` better to think of a wise precaution now than not at all but oh ye be a empty-headed crew ' he tell they ' i pity the conspiracy that have no better planning than ye would make for it without my fore think i thought of this long ago i send a message to damascus beg that a date be set and just such a letter send to we feisul i know would sign no such letter but the paper he use lie on a open desk and there be man about he who have access to he seal and because my appeal be well-timed it meet with approval a letter such as i ask for be write on feisul 's paper seal with he seal and send ' ` but do it bear he signature ' a man ask ` how could it since he never see the letter ' yussuf dakmar answer ` then few will pay heed to it ' say the other ` perhaps if we be all such fool as you that might be so ' yussuf dakmar retort ` however fortunately the rest of we have readier wit this letter be sign with a number and the number be that of feisul 's generation in descent from the prophet mohamm let man be tell that this be he secret signature and when they see he seal beside it will they not believe every hour in jerusalem and in all the world man believe thing less credible than that ' but at that sahib another man ask he how they might know that the letter really come from damascus ` it well might be ' say that one ' a forgery contrived by yussuf dakmar himself in which case though they might stir many moslem into action by show it the man in damascus would fail to follow up the massacre by strike at the french and if they do not strike at the french ' say he ` the french will not appeal to the british for aid and so the british troops will be free to protect the jew and butcher we by which mean we shall be worse off than before ' whereat yussuf dakmar laugh again ` if ye will go to the sikh hospital ' say he ` ye will find there the man who bring the letter he lie in a cot in the upper storey with a knife-wound between he shoulder-blade it be a mistaken accident unfortunate for he the letter be intend for I but i do not know that what do the life of one fool matter he give out that jew stab he and it may be he believe that yet i have the letter in my pocket here ' and he touch with one hand the portion of he coat beneath which be the pocket that contain the letter i be watch sahib from where i lay hide he be about i think to show they the letter when another thought occur to he he wrinkle he brow as if seek word in which to make he meaning clear and they seem willing enough to wait for he but not so i for i now know where the letter be so i spring into they midst fall less dangerously than i might have do by reason of a man 's shoulder that serve for a cushion it may be that he bone break under my weight i can give no accurate report as to that for i be in great haste but as he give way under I i pitch forward and kick yussuf dakmar in the belly with my boot i fall on he they fall on I in turn and we all writhe together in one mass on the floor so i secure the letter good man grim nod wish i would be there mourn jeremy and have what i come for i break free and take the red stool i hurl it at the lamp so that we be in total darkness which make it a simple matter to unlock the door and proceed about my business nevertheless i hear they strike match behind I and it seem unwise to take to my heel at once it be easy to pursue a man who run as the sahib doubtless remember between that coffee shop and the next house be a stone buttress jut out into the street form on its side farthest from the coffee-shop a dark corner for whose filth and stink the street cleaner ought to be punish therein i lurk while those who pursue run past I up the street i count they and among they i do not count yussuf dakmar and three more it happen that a man be run up the street and the pursuer suppose he to be I so i be leave with only four to deal with and it enter my head that no doubt jimgrim sahib would be please to interview yussuf dakmar and after a few moment yussuf dakmar come forth and i hear he speak to these three fellow ` those fool ' say he ` hunt like street dog at the sound of rubbish toss out of a window but i think that indian soldier be less foolish than they if i be he ' say yussuf dakmar ' i think i would not run far with all these shadow to right and left and all the hour from now until dawn in which to act the fox i suspect he be not far away at this minute nevertheless ' say he ` those indian be dangerous fellow it be highly important that we get that letter from he but it be almost equally important that we stop he mouth which would be impossible if he should escape alive if we wait here ' say he ` we shall see he emerge from a shadow if i be not much mistaken ' so they wait sahib and after a few minute when my breath have return to I i let he have credit as a wise one by emerge as he have say and those four stalk I through the street not daring to come close until i should lead they to a lonely place and i lead they with discretion to this house where happen what the sahib know that be all i know about this matter except that be absent from duty on sick-leave there may be difficulty in the matter of my tunic which be badly tear have finish he story narayan singh stand at attention like one of those wooden image they use to keep on the sidewalk outside tobacco store grim smile at the prisoner and ask whether they have any remark to make -- a totally lawless proceeding for he do not caution they and have no jurisdiction as a magistrate they be three man catch red-handed attempt murder and burglary and entitle accordingly to protection that the law do not always accord to honest man but as i have say a true tale in the ear of criminal act like a chemical reagent it set they to work lie and the lie burn off disclose naked truth again but mother of I they be daring liar the fellow who have come out of the scrap more or less unscathed pipe up for the three the other two nod and prompt he in whisper what that indian say in the main be true he do jump down from the gallery and surprise a meeting summon by yussuf dakmar and it be true that yussuf dakmar 's purpose be to bring about a massacre of jew which be to be simultaneous with a attack by feisul 's force on the french in syrium but we three man be not in favor of it we have have no part in the preparation although we know all detail we be honest man who have the public interest at heart and accordingly we have spy on yussuf dakmar purposing to expose all he plan to the authority jeremy begin hum to himself mabel titter and little doctor ticknor swear under he breath but grim look as if he believe they -- look pleasantly surprise -- and nod gravely but that hardly explain you follow this indian through the street and attack he on the veranda he suggest as if sure they could explain that too -- as sure enough they do we do not attack he he attack we it be obvious to we from the first that he must be a agent of the government so when yussuf dakmar tell we to follow and murder he we decide it be time to expose yussuf dakmar and that this be we opportunity we know surely that this indian would take that letter straight to some official of the government it be only necessary to pretend to hunt he and in that manner inveigle yussuf dakmar into the toil but when we reach this house yussuf dakmar be afraid and refuse to approach nearer than the street he insist on keep watch outside the garden gate while we should draw near and shoot everyone who might be in the house and recover the letter he be a coward and we could not persuade he so we decide to pretend to do he bidding and to whisper through the window to the people within to pass out to the street by some back way and capture he after which we would give all we evidence to the authority it be while we be look through the window seek to call the attention of those within for that purpose and no other that we be attack and submit to much unnecessary violence that be the whole truth as allah be we witness we be honest man who seek to uphold the law and we claim the protection of the government we be ready to tell all we know include the name of those connect with this plot chapter v nobody will know no bouquet there follow a tedious hour or two during which grim cross-examine the three honest man and take down list of name from they dictation get doctor ticknor meanwhile to go for the police because yussuf dakmar might still be lurk in the neighborhood for a chance to murder narayan singh it be only after the police have carry off the prisoner to jail -lrb- where they repudiate they entire confession next morning -rrb- that grim show we the letter which like a spark have fire a powder magazine -- although a smaller one than its writer intend it be not in feisul 's handwriting he say hold the feathery arab script up to the lamplight and it be no more like he phraseology than a camel resemble a locomotive listen to this : to the pan-arab committee in jerusalem by favor of yussuf dakmar bey its district president greet in the name of god : ye know that on former occasion the foe of we land and race be overwhelm when rely on the aid of the most high and raise the green banner of the prophet -- on whom be peace -- we launch we squadron in a cause hold sacred by we all ye know that in that fashion and not otherwise the accursed conqueror be drive forth and we sacred banner be set on high over the damascus roof where by allah 's blessing may it wave for ever ye know how those who claim to be we friend have since prove themselves foe so that the independent state for which we fight be hold today in ignominious subjection by alien who deny the true faith and hold they promise as nothing ye know how damascus be beset by the french and palestine be hold by the british who notwithstanding the oath they swear to we be daily betray we arab to the jew know now then that the hour have strike when again in the name of allah we must finish what we formerly begin and with we true sword force these infidel to yield we country to we nor on this occasion shall we sheathe we sword until from end to end we land be free and unite under one government of we own choosing know that this time there shall be no half-measure nor any compromise it be write ye shall show no quarter to the infidel let no jew live to boast that he have footing in the land of we ancestor leave ye no root of they in the earth nor seedling that can spring into a tree smite and smite swiftly in the name of he who never sleep who keep all promise whose almighty hand be ready to preserve the faithful whereunto ye be bid to take courage whereunto we army of syrium stand ready whereunto the day have be appoint know ye that the tenth day from the send of this letter and at dawn be the appoint time therefore let all make common cause for the favor of the most high which await the faithful in the name of god and mohamm the prophet of god on whom be blessing there follow the moslem date and the numerical signature over feisul 's indubitable seal grim figure a moment and work out the corresponding date accord to we western calendar leave six day he say pleasantly it mean the french intend to attack damascus seven day from now let 'em jeremy explode feisul 'll give 'em -- all they have get be algerian the french have poison gas grim answer dourly feisul 's man have no mask get 'em some that be jeremy again grim do not answer but go on talking : they be go to get damascus all they have wait for be poison gas and now there be no stop 'em they forge this letter after the gas arrive now if they catch feisul in damascus they 'll put he on trial for he life and they probably hope to get this letter back somehow to use as evidence against he go slow jim mabel object where 's you proof that the french be jockey this be not that feisul 's seal yes and it be he paper but not he handwriting he might have dictate it might not he never in those word feisul do not talk or write that way the letter 's a manifest forgery as i 'll prove by confront feisul with it but there be a little oversight that should convince you it be a forgery have you a magnifying glass doc ticknor produce one in a minute and grim hold the letter under the lamp on the rather wide margin carefully rub out but not so carefully that the indentation do not show be the french word magnifique that have be write with a rather heavy hand and one of those hard pencil supply to colonial government by exporter from stock that can not be sell at home that prove nothing mabel insist all educate arab talk french somebody on feisul 's staff be ask for a opinion on the letter before it go my husband 's arab orderly tell I only yesterday that a sling i make for a man in the hospital be magnifique the objection be well enough take because it be the sort the forger of the letter would be likely to raise if bring to book but grim 's argument be not exhaust there be other point mabel for one thing it be blue metallic ink feisul 's private letter be all write with indelible black stuff make from pellet that i give he they be import from the state but if feisul want to prove a alibi he naturally would not use he special private ink object mabel then why he seal and he special private notepaper however there be another point feisul write the purest kind of arabic and this be not that sort of arabic it be write by a foreigner -- perhaps a frenchman -- possibly a armenian -- most likely a turk -- certainly one of the outer ring of politician who have access to feisul and seek to control he but be not really in he confidence damascus be simply a network of spy of that kind -- man who attach themselves to the arab cause when it look like win and be now busy transfer they allegiance i think i could name the man who write this i think i know the man who write that magnifique if i be right yussuf dakmar will notify the french tonight through they agent in jerusalem the man who write that magnifique will know before morning that the letter 's miss and it do not matter how careful i may be it 'll be know as soon as i start for damascus they 'll dope out that we obvious course would be to confront feisul with this letter the only way to travel be by train the road be rotten -- in fact no auto could get through they would tip off the bedouin who have murder everybody so they 'll watch the train and especially haifa where everyone go north have to spend the night and they 'll stop at nothing to get the letter back for two reason as long as it be in we hand it can be use to establish proof of the plot against feisul once it be back in theirs they can keep it in they secret dossier to use against feisul if they ever catch he and bring he to trial you remember the dreyfus case i shall start for damascus by the early train -- probably take a auto as far as ludd if i want to live until i reach damascus i shall have to prove conclusively that i have not that letter with I anyone know to be in british service be go to be suspect and if not murder rob ramsden have be see about too much with I jeremy might juggle by but he be already notorious and these people be shrewd better hold jeremy in reserve and the same with narayan singh a woman 's best how about you mabel what d'you mean jim do you know a woman in haifa of course i do well enough to expect a bed for the night at a moment 's notice certainly mabel 's eye be grow very bright indeed it be she husband who look alarmed well now here be the point grim lean back in he chair and light a cigarette not look at anybody state he case impersonally as it be which be much the shrewdest way of be personal feisul 's up against it and he be the best man in all this land bar none they have deal to he from a cold deck and he be bind to lose this hand whichever way he play it to put it differently he be in check but not checkmate he 'll be checkmate though if the french ever lay hand on he and then good-bye to the arab 's chance for twenty year i propose to save he for another effort and the only way to do that be to convince he the best way to convince he be to show he that letter which can not be do if feisul 's enemy discover who carry it if ramsden jeremy narayan singh and i start for damascus pretend that one or other of we have the letter conceal on he person and if a woman really carry it we 'll manage be mabel ticknor go to be the woman that be the point too dangerous jim too dangerous ticknor put in nervously pardon I old man the danger be for we four who pretend we have get the thing there be lot of other woman and i have only get one wife object ticknor we be press for time grim answer you see ticknor old man you be a cornstalk and therefore a outsider -- just a medico who saw bone for a living satisfy to keep you body out of the poorhouse you soul out of hell and you name out of the newspaper you wife be presumably more so there be several official ' wife who would jump at the chance to be useful but a sudden trip toward damascus just now would cause any one of they to be suspect whereas mabel would not be i do not know why not ticknor retort be not she in here when those three murderer come to finish the lot of we if yussuf dakmar make any report at all he 'll surely say he trace the letter to this house yussuf dakmar come no nearer than the street grim answer he have no notion who be in here he three friend be in jail under lock and key where he can not get at they how long have you have this house since yesterday be not it d'you kid yourself that yussuf dakmar know who live here i can get leave of absence suppose i go in mabel 's place suggest ticknor visibly worry the mere fact that she go while you stay here will be presumptive evidence that she be not on a dangerous mission grim answer no it have get to be a woman if mabel will not go i 'll find someone else you could tell by mabel 's eye and attitude that she be what the salesman call sell already but you do not need a magnifying glass to detect that ticknor be not man of he wander habit know too well what a brave good-tempered wife mean to encourage she to take long chance for although there be lot of woman who would like to wander and accept the world 's pot luck there be precious few capable of do it without double a fellow 's trouble when they know how to halve the trouble and double the fun they be priceless grim play he usual game which be to spank down he ace of trump face upward on the table most of we forget what be trump in a crisis i guess it be up to you doc he say turn toward ticknor there be nothing in it for you feisul be not on the make i do not believe he care ten cent who be to be the nominal ruler of the arab provide they get they promise independence he would rather retire and live privately but he only consider himself in so far as he can serve the arab cause now you have risk mabel 's life a score of time in order to help sick man in mining camp and malaria victim and lord know what else here be a chance to do the biggest thing of all -- of course if you put it that way say ticknor hesitate just you style too nobody will know no bouquet you will not have to stammer a speech at any dinner give in you honor d'you want to do it mabel ask ticknor look at she keenly across the table of course i do all right girl only hurry back he look hard at grim again then into my eye and then jeremy 's she be in you hand i do not want to see any of you three chap alive again unless she come back safe be that clear clear and clean explode jeremy it be a bet doc half a mo ' you chap that be my mine at abu kem be not it i have agree to give the thing to feisul and make what term i can with he jim and rammy divvy up with I on my end if any that right i say let the doc and mabel have a half-share each of anything we end amount to well it take about as long to settle that business as you would expect the doctor and mabel protest but it be easier to give away a fortune that be still in prospect than a small sum that be really tangible -- i mean between folk who stand on they own foot it do not seem to deprive the giver of much or to strain the pride of the recipient unduly i have be give share in unproven el dorado time out of number and could paper the wall of say a good-sized bathroom with the stock certificate -- may do it some day if i ever settle down but the only gift of that sort that i ever know to pay dividend except to the printer of the gilt-edged scrip be jeremy 's gold mine and you 'll look in vain for any mention of that in the stock exchange list the time to get in on that good thing be that night by mabel ticknor 's teapot in jerusalem it be nearly midnight before we have everything settle and there be still a lot to do before we could catch the morning train one thing that grim do be to take gum and paper and contrive a envelope that look in the dark sufficiently like the alleged feisul letter and he carry that in he hand as he take to the street with narayan singh follow among the shadow within hail jeremy and i keep narayan singh in sight for it be possible that yussuf dakmar have gather a gang to waylay whoever might emerge from the house but he seem to have have enough of bungle accomplice that night grim have not go fifty pace keep well in the middle of the road when a solitary shadow begin stalk he and do it so cautiously that though he have to cross the circle of street lamplight now and then neither jeremy nor i could have identify he afterward narayan singh have order not to do anything but guard grim against assault for grim judge it wise to leave yussuf dakmar at large than to precipitate a climax by arrest he he have the name of most of the local conspirator and if the leader be seize too soon the equally dangerous rank and file might scatter and escape down inside the jaffa gate in a dark alley beside the grand hotel there be usually two or three cab stand at any hour of the night ready to care for belated christian gentleman who have look on the wine when it be any color that it chance to be there be three there and grim take the first one flourish he envelope carelessly under the corner lamp yussuf dakmar take the next in line and order the driver to follow grim so we naturally take the last one all three of we crowd on to the rear seat in order to watch the cab in front but as soon as we have drive back outside the city gate yussuf dakmar look behind he and grow suspicious of we order he driver to let we pass it would have be too obvious if we have stop too so we hide we face as we pass and then put jeremy on the front seat he look like a arab and be most unrecognizable yussuf dakmar follow we at long range and as the lean horse toil slowly up the mount of olive to headquarters the interval between the cab grow greater by the time we reach the guard-house and answer the sikh sentry 's challenge there be no sign of grim in front and we could only hear in the distance behind we the occasional click of a loose shoe to tell that yussuf dakmar be still follow chapter vi better the evil that we know yussuf dakmar have he nerve with he that night or possibly desperation rob he of discretion he may have be a more than usually daring man with he wit about he but you would have to hunt down the valley of death before you could bring the psychoanalytic gun to bear on he for what they be worth i can only tell you what he do not why he do it the great hospice that the german nation build on the crown of the mount of olive to glorify they kaiser stand like a shadow among shadow in its compound surround by a fairly high wall there be a pretty strong guard under a indian officer in the guard-house at the arched main gate where the sentry challenge we a sentry stand at the foot of the step under the portico at the main entrance and there be another armed man on duty patrolling the grounds but there be one or two other entrance lock though quite easy to negotiate which the sentry could only observe while he march toward they for five minute at a time while he back be turn at least two gate lead to official residence offer opportunity to a active man one lone light at a window on the top floor suggest that the officer of the night might be awake but what with the screech of owl and a wind that sigh among the shrub headquarters look and sound more like a desert ancient castle than the cranium and brain-cell of administration we hear yussuf dakmar stop he cab two hundred yard away the cabman turn he horse and drive back toward jerusalem without call on allah to witness that he fare should have be twice what he receive he do not even lash the horse savagely so we suppose that he have not be pay and go on to deduce from that that yussuf dakmar have drive away again after satisfy himself that the feisul letter have reach headquarters it be lazy bad reasoning -- the sort of superficial smart stuff that have cost the life of thousand of good man time out of number -- four o'clock o ' the morning intelligence that like the courage of that hour need priming by the foreman or the sergeant-major or the bosun as the case may be the sentry turn out the guard who let we through the gate after a word with narayan singh and the man who lean on he bayonet under the portico at the end of the drive admit we without any argument at all i suppose he think that have come that far we must be people in authority ever since then i have believe all the story tell I about spy who walk where they choose unchallenged during wartime for we three -- a sikh enlist man a australian disguise as a arab and a american in civilian clothes -- enter unannounced and unwatched the building where every secret of the near east be pigeonhole we walk about the corridor and up and downstairs for ten minute look in vain for grim here and there a servant snore on a mat in a corner and once a big dog come and sniff at we without make any further comment jeremy kick one man awake who mistake he for a arab curse he in three language in the name of three separate god and promptly go to sleep again the sensation be like be turn loose in the strong-room of a national treasury with nobody watch if you should choose to help yourself there be acre of floor in that building we walk twice the whole circuit of the upper and lower corridor knock on dozen of door but get no answer and finally bring up in the entrance hall then it occur to I that grim might have go into the building by some private entrance perhaps round on the eastern side so we set out to look for one we have just reach the northwest angle of the building when narayan singh who be walk a pace in front stop suddenly and hold up both hand for silence whoever he could see among the shadow must have hear we but it be no rare thing for officer to come roister down those front step and along the drive hour after midnight and we sudden silence be more likely to give alarm than the noise have be i begin talk again in a normal voice say anything at all peer about into the shadow meanwhile but it be several seconds before i make out what the sikh 's keener eye have detect instantly and jeremy see it before i do there be a magnolia shrub about ten pace away from we cast a shadow so deep that the ground it cover look like a bottomless abyss but nevertheless something bright move in it -- perhaps the sheen of that lone light in a upper window reflect on a knife-hilt or a button -- something that move in time to a man 's breathing if there be a certainty in the world it be that somebody who have no right to be there be lurk in that shadow and he be presumably up to mischief on the other hand i have absolutely no right in that place either jeremy and narayan singh be both in the british army be liable to be discipline and i might be request to leave the country if we should happen to blunder and tree the wrong ` possum revenge be more than usually sweet to the official disturbed in the pursuit of unauthorized diplomacy it might even be some clandestine love affair so i take each of my companion by the arm grip jeremy 's particularly tightly and start forward whisper a explanation after we have turn the corner of the building let one of we go and warn the guard i suggest if we should draw that cover and start a shindy we be more likely to get shoot by the guard than thank so narayan singh start off for the guard-house he be the one most capable of explain matter to the sikh officer and jeremy and i creep back through the shadow to within earshot of the dark magnolia tree choose a point from which we could see if anybody bolt you know how some uncatalogued sense inform you in the dark of the movement of the man beside you i look suddenly sideways toward jeremy know although i could not see he that he eye be seek mine it be only the animal who omit in the darkness those instinctive daylight movement man do not have sufficient control of themselves we have both hear grim 's voice at the same instant speak arabic but unmistakable there be three man there grim be talk to the other two keep you hand on each other 's shoulder do not move i be go to search all you pocket again now mr charkian ah that feel like quite a pretty little weapon mother o ' pearl on the butt have you a permit never mind not have the weapon you will not need a permit will you and papers -- mashallah what a lot of document they must be highly important one since you hide they under you shirt i expect you plan to sell they eh too bad too bad you keep you hand on mr charkian 's shoulder yussuf dakmar or i 'll have to use violence i be not sure mr charkian that it would not be kinder to society to send you to jail after all you need a bath so badly it seem a pity that a chief clerk to the administration should not have a chance to wash himself do not it well i 'll have to read these papers afterward -- after we have usurp the prerogative of destiny and map out a little of the future now -- be you both listen do you know who i be there be no answer you mr charkian i think you be major grim ah you wish to flatter I do not you never mind let we pretend i be major grim disguise as a arab only i be afraid we must continue the conversation in arabic i might disillusion you if i try to talk english we 'll say then that i be major grim disguised let 's see now what would he do in the circumstance here 's yussuf dakmar want for murder in the city and know to be plot a massacre see climb a wall when the sentry 's back be turn and catch in conference with mr charkian confidential clerk to the administration i be sorry i do not hear all that be say at you conference for that might have make it easier to guess what major grim would do do not play with we like a cat playing with a mouse snarl somebody tell we what you want if you be major grim you would have hand we over to those officer who pass just now you be just as much irregular as we be hurry up and make you bargain or the guard may come and arrest we all yes hurry up complain the other man i do not want to be catch here and as for those papers you have take if we be catch i shall say you steal they from the office -- you and yussuf dakmar and that i follow you to recover they and you both attack I very well say grim 's voice pleasantly i 'll let you go i think you be dangerous you would better be quick because i think i hear the guard come give I back the papers then aha will you wait and discuss they with the guard or go at once the armenian clerk do not answer but get up and slink away why do you let that fool go demand yussuf dakmar now he will awaken some officer and start hue and cry with a story that we rob he listen there come the guard we have better both run not so fast grim answer and then he raise he voice perceptibly as if he wish to be overhear : i think those man who pass just now be not officer at all perhaps they be stranger it may be that one of they be confuse and be lead the guard in the wrong direction do not make so much noise then retort yussuf dakmar jeremy who think habitually about ten time as fast as i do slipped away at once into the shadow to find narayan singh and decoy the guard elsewhere i do not envy he the job for sikh use cold steel first and argue afterward when on the qui vive in the dark however he accomplish he purpose narayan singh save he life and the guard arrest he on general principle you could hear both jeremy and narayan singh use grim 's name freely yussuf dakmar be not deaf he give tongue : there do you hear that they be speak of major grim you be a fool if you wait here any longer that fellow grim be a devil i tell you if he find we we be both lose we have to be find first grim answer and you could almost hear he smile quick then what do you want snapped yussuf dakmar grim 's answer be the real surprise of the evening it bewilder I as much as it astonish yussuf dakmar i want that letter that come from the emir feisul i have not get it i swear i have not i know that already for i search you where be it ask allah it be steal by a sikh who deliver it to someone in a house near the military hospital who in turn give it to a arab who bring it here i hope that fellow charkian might steal it back again but you have spoil everything charkian will turn against I now to save himself what do you want with the letter i must have it grim answer the french agent -- what -- sidus say you know he surely he would pay I a thousand pound for it may allah change he face he only offer I five hundred you have see he already then grim ask i do not believe you when do you see he on the way up here he stop my cab to speak to I at the foot of the hill i begin to see the drift of grim 's purpose he have establish the fact that the french secret agent be already on the track of the letter and that in turn explain why he have not seize yussuf dakmar and put he in jail it be better to use the man as the sequel prove and yussuf dakmar walk straight into grim 's trap what be you name he demand call I omar say grim a turk be you well omar let we help each other to get that letter and divide the reward sidus say tell I that the british be sure to confront feisul with it and to do it secretly if they can they will try to send it to damascus let we two find out who take it and waylay he why should i divide with you demand grim who be much too good a actor to pretend to agree without bargaining because otherwise you will not succeed i be afraid of you when you first surprise I with charkian but now that i know you for a spy in the pay of the french i be not afraid of you even though you have my revolver and dagger you dare not kill I for i would shout for help and the guard would come you be in danger as much as i be so you may either agree to work with I share the reward or you may work alone and have nothing for you pain for i shall bring accomplice to help I take the letter from you after you have steal it well i suppose that anyone with criminal intention could submit gracefully to that much blackmail besides grim be rather press for time and could not afford to prolong the argument i see you be a determine man he answer you demand be unreasonable but i must agree to it then give I back my pistol no i need it i lend mine this evening to another man who have not yet return it that be a piece of wood with which i hold you up just now you must get yourself another they be hard to come by in jerusalem give I mine back no i shall keep it to protect myself against you why you have no need to fear I if we work together because i intend to tell you what i know and i may find it convenient to shoot you if you betray the information oh well tell away i have be cleverer than you grim announce blandly i know who have give the order to the sikh to steal that letter from you and i be conceal in he house when the letter be bring to he i hear the conference that follow so i know what be go to be do about it oh that be very smart well tell I three man be go to take the letter to damascus but i do not know which of they will have it on he person one be a arab one be a american the third be that same sikh who take the letter from you they will take the train from ludd and i have engage myself as servant to the american now that be extremely clever of you say yussuf dakmar yes grim agreed but perhaps it will be as well to have a accomplice after all and you will do as well as any if i steal the letter they may accuse I but if i can pass it to you then i can submit to a search and oblige they to apologize true true that will be excellent so you have better take the morning train for damascus grim continue but understand : if you bring other with you i shall suspect you of intend to play a trick on I in that event i shall shoot you with you own pistol and take my chance of escape afterward in fact you be a dead man yussuf dakmar the minute i suspect you of play I false the same to you likewise yussuf dakmar answer fervently then we understand each other say grim the best thing you can do between now and train-time be to see the french agent again what good will that do he be irritable -- nervous he will only ask a thousand question then you visit will do all the more good you can calm he we do not want a horde of fool interfere with we on the journey we want to work quietly and to share the reward between we therefore you should tell he that you be confident of get the letter if he will only leave the business to you alone give he every assurance and explain to he that interference may mean failure now i have do much the greater part so far let this be you share to balance the account between we you go to sidus say the french agent and make sure that he do not hinder we by try to help very well i will do that and i shall meet you at the station in the morning no my party will go as far as ludd by motor you will see we join the train there go now while the guard be out of the way i could not see but i hear yussuf dakmar get up and go he have hardly time to get out of earshot when grim 's voice break the silence again : you there ramsden instead of answering i approach do you hear what be say he ask yes why do not you arrest both the blackguard and have do with it better the evil that we know he answer with the familiar smile in he voice the important thing be to sidetrack the french agent who could put fifty ruffian on we trail instead of one why not send a provost-marshal 's guard to the french agent then can not do that france and great britain be ally besides they might retaliate by spiflicate we agent in damascus wise folk who live in glass-house do not throw stone what i think have be accomplish be to reduce we probable risk down to yussuf dakmar who be a mean squib at best and i think we have draw suspicion clear away from mabel ticknor all that remain be for I to go to that room where you see the light burning and discuss matter with the chief if he be awake he be lonely say i and i tell grim of we experience inside the building yes he say government be all like that they talk glibly of the ship of state but a ship run in the same way would pile up or sink the first night out you would better go home and get a hour 's sleep i 'll call you at seven we 'll take turn sleep on the train i answer come first and rescue jeremy i think the guard pinch he say do you intend one of we to go and decoy the guard away that time you raise you voice sure recognize you voice -- yours especially -- when you pass and hear you breathe as you creep back you nearly spoil the game by turn out the guard but you save it again handsomely it be a marvel those sikh do not shoot jeremy in the dark i answer you bet it be say grim i guess he be too useful to be allow to die just now he hang he head think as we walk side by side that be a close shave -- too close well as you say let 's go and rescue he chapter vii you talk like a madman grim change the plan a little at the last minute mabel ticknor leave jerusalem by train as agree but narayan singh be send that way too to keep a eye on she he be a sikh could sit in the corridor without exciting comment and be dress for the part of a more or less prosperous trader he could travel first class without have to answer question or allay suspicion grim jeremy and i drive to ludd in a hire auto grim and jeremy both in arab costume and i try to look like a tourist jeremy be suppose to be a travel arab intent on guide I about damascus for the usual consideration the platform be crowd and we secure a compartment in the train without call much attention to ourselves there be british officer of all rank egyptian jew greek refugee armenian maltese kurd a turk or two circassian man from as far off as bokhara turkoman indian of all sort a sprinkling of bedouin look not quite so at home as in they native desert and local arab by the score about half of they be in a panic encourage to it by they shrill women-folk fighting in a swarm for ticket at one small window where a insolent levantine demonstrate he capacity for self-determination by make as many people as possible miss the train i catch sight of mabel ticknor in the front compartment of we car and grim point out yussuf dakmar lean through a window of the car behind he face be fat unwholesome with small cold eye a immoral nose and a small mouth with pouting lip the tarboosh he wear tilted at a angle heighten the general effect of arrogant self-esteem he be a illustration of the ancient mystery -- how be it that a man with such a face and such insolence write all over he can become a leader of other man and persuade they to hatch the egg of treachery that he lay like a cuckoo in they nest he smirk at grim suggestively as we go by and grim of course smirk back with a sidewise inclination of the head in my direction whereat yussuf dakmar withdraw himself apparently satisfied now he 'll waste a lot of time investigate you say grim in a undertone we have better keep awake in turn or he 'll knife you the toe of my boot to he i retort one clean kick might solve this international affair steady grim answer we need he until after leave haifa the french agent wire and they 'll have a gang at haifa ready for we but yussuf dakmar will warn they off if we keep he hope so we settle down into we compartment after a glance to make sure that mabel be all right and for about two minute i imagine we be in for a lazy journey narayan singh be on a camp-stool in the corridor snooze with one eye open like a faithful sheep-dog it do not seem possible for a creature like yussuf dakmar to make trouble for we and i propose that we should match coin for the first turn to go to sleep we have just pull we coin out and the engineer be back the train in order to get she start when yussuf dakmar arrive at we door carry he belongings and claim a seat on the strength of a lie about there be no room elsewhere there be something about a compartment on a train that make whoever get in first regard the rest of the world as intruder nobody would have be welcome but we would have prefer a pig to yussuf dakmar jeremy democrat of democrat who have sleep without complain between the leg of a dead horse on a rain-swept battlefield with a lousy turkish prisoner hug he close to share the blanket be up in arm at once imshi he order bluntly but yussuf dakmar be delighted the reception convinced he if anything be need to do that that one of we really be guard the secret letter and he be one of those hog anyhow who glory in snout in where they be plainly not want he take the corner seat opposite jeremy tuck he leg up under he produce a cigarette and smile offensively i 'll concede this though : i think the smile be mean to be ingratiate he pull out a package wrap in newspaper and begin to eat before the train have run a mile and you know more man get kill because of how they eat than by the stuff they devour if you do not believe that try live in camp for a week or two with a man who chew meat with he mouth open you 'll feel the prompting of a murderer i know a scientist who swear that the real secret of the cain and abel story be that abel suck he gum at mealtime you ought to be bury up to the neck and feed with a shovel jeremy inform he in blunt english after listen to the solo for a while aha that be the way they use to treat criminal in persium he answer pleasantly with he mouth full of goat 's milk cheese only they put plaster of pari in the hole and when it rain the wretched man be squeeze until the blood come out of he mouth and eye and he die in agony but how come it that you speak to I in english if we be both arab why not talk the mother tongue my rump be my rump and the land be its ruler jeremy answer in arabic quote the rudest proverb he could think of on the spur of the moment ah and who be its ruler who be to be its ruler yussuf dakmar make a surreptitious face at grim and he little cold eye shine like a hungry pariah dog 's it begin to be interesting to watch he open gambit i have hear tale he go on of a new ruler for this country what do you think of feisul 's chance as he say that he eye I sideways swiftly and keenly grim sit back in he own corner and fold up he leg watch the game contentedly jeremy intercept yussuf dakmar 's glance put he own construction on it he be a long lean man but like the fat boy in pickwick papers he like to make you flesh creep and humor to have full zest for he have to be mischievous so he commence by pull out he weapon one by one the first be a razor which he sharpen test with he thumb suggestively and then place in he sock study yussuf dakmar 's throat for a minute or so after that as if expect to have to use the razor on it presently as the effect of that wear off he pull out a pistol it be one of the kind that will not go off unless you pull the hammer back but yussuf dakmar do not know that and if he have flesh and blood capable of creep it be a safe assertion that they creep jeremy act as if he do not understand the weapon and for fifteen minute do more stunt with it than a puppy can do with a ball of twine one of they that interested yussuf dakmar awfully be to point the pistol straight ahead half-cocked and try to get the hammer down by slapping it with the palm of he hand most of we baggage be on the floor but one fairly heavy valise be in the rack over yussuf dakmar 's head jeremy get up to examine it when the pistol have cease to amuse he and take advantage of a jerk as the train slow down contrived to drop it into the syrian 's lap who rather naturally swear whereat jeremy take offence and accuse he of be a descendant of hanna son of manna who live for a thousand and one year and never enjoy himself it be we turn to eat sandwich after that while yussuf dakmar recover from he disgruntlement but just before the meal be finish jeremy revive the game by ask suddenly in a awestruck whisper where it be he slap himself all over in a hurry feeling for hidden pocket and then come over and pretend to search I there be not anything to do but fall in with he mood so i resist search my own pocket reluctantly and say that we might as well take the next train back since we have lose the important document before we start we have put into a wallet the fake envelope that grim have carry in he hand the previous night and have entrust the wallet to jeremy in order to have a alibi ready for mabel in case of need grim take up the cudgel now and remind I respectfully as a servant should when speak to he master that i have take all proper precaution and could not be blame in any event but i think it will be find he say hopefully inshallah it be not lose but in the wallet in the pocket of that hare-brained friend of yours so jeremy go back to he corner search for the wallet find it after pretty nearly stand on he head to shake he clothes examine it excitedly and produce the fake envelope flourish it so violently that nobody even with eye like a hawk 's could have identify it with certainty then he drop it in among the baggage on the floor and go down on he knee to pick it up again there be no more finish expert at sleight of hand than he so it vanish and he swear he could not find it in a well-simulated agony of nervousness he call on yussuf dakmar to get down and help he search and the syrian have not enough self-command left to pretend to hesitate he cold eye be nearly pop from he head as he kneel and grope the chief subject of interest to I just then be how he propose to retain the letter in the unlikely event of he find it first it be a ridiculous search because there be not really anywhere to look after three bag have be lift and they bottom scrutinize the whole floor of the compartment lay naked to the eye except where my foot rest jeremy insist on my raise they to the accompaniment of what he consider suitable comment on they size turn he behind end meanwhile toward yussuf dakmar grim chuckle and catch my eye yussuf dakmar have walk straight into temptation and be try to search jeremy 's pocket from the rear -- no easy matter for he have to discover they first in the loose fold of the arab costume suddenly jeremy 's mood change he become suspicious stand up resume he seat -- and glare at yussuf dakmar who retire into he corner and try to seem unconscious of the game i believe you be a thief -- one of those light-fingered devil from el-kalil say jeremy suddenly after about three minute ' silence i believe you have steal my letter like the saint 's ass you be a clever devil be not you nevertheless you be like a man without fingernail whose scratch do he no good you labor be in vain give I back the letter or by allah i will turn you upside down yussuf dakmar deny the accusation with all the fervor that a blackguard generally do use when for once he be consciously innocent by the beard of the prophet and on my honor i swear to you that i have not touch you letter i do not know where it be show I the prophet 's beard command jeremy show I you honor you talk like a madman how can i show either then how can you swear by they father of easy word and evil deed give I the letter back yussuf dakmar appeal to I as presumably responsible for jeremy you see effendi do not you i try to help he but he who play with the cat must suffer she claw so now he accuse I of steal i call you to witness that i take nothing you must excuse he i answer that be a highly important letter if it be not find the consequence may be disastrous by allah it shall be find explode jeremy glaring harder than ever at yussuf dakmar look at he face look at he evil eye he come in here on purpose to spy on we and steal that letter it be time to use my razor on he i swear not by the prophet 's beard or anybody 's honor but by the razor in my sock that he have the letter and that i will have it back well that be a challenge there be no side-stepping sure of be able to prove innocence yussuf dakmar decide that a bold course be the best he proceed to empty he own pocket lay the contents on the seat before jeremy 's eye and jeremy watch like a puzzle puppy with he brow wrinkle the process take time because he be wear one of those imitation western suit of prehistoric cut but up-to-date with every imaginable pocket that a tailor could invent they contents include a dagger and a clasp-knife with a long blade sharpen on both edge but no pistol now be you satisfied he demand after turn inside-out the two secret pocket in the lining of he vest less than ever jeremy retort until i see you naked i will not believe you yussuf dakmar turn to I again he be a patient spy if ever there be one do you think i should be put to that indignity he ask shall i undress myself by allah unless you do it i will cut you clothes off with my razor jeremy announce we draw up at a station then and have to wait until the train go on again by that time yussuf dakmar have make up he mind he slip off he jacket and vest and begin to unfasten he collar-button as the train gain speed everything go smoothly until he stand up to remove he pants he have the top of they in both hand when jeremy seize he suddenly by the elbow and spin he face about and there the letter lay face downward on the seat he have just leave bent and a little crinkled in proof that he have be sit on it for some minute past now it do not make any difference whether a man mean to take off he trousers or not in a crisis if they be unfastened he will hold they up it be like catch a monkey you put corn into a narrow-necked basket the monkey insert he arm fill he hand with corn and try to pull it out but can not unless he let go of the corn which he will not do so you catch he yussuf dakmar hold up he pants with one hand and try to free himself from jeremy with the other if he have let go he pants he might have seize the envelope and discover what a fake it be but he would not do that it be i who pounce on it and stow it away carefully in my inner pocket yussuf dakmar 's emotion be poignant and mixed but he be no quitter he think he know definitely where the letter be now and the wolf glance with which he favor I change swiftly to a smile of ingratiating politeness i be glad you have recover what you lose he say smile as he fasten up he pants and resume he coat this friend of yours -- or be he you servant -- make I nervous with he threat or i should certainly have find it for you sooner and now grim resume a hand the last thing he wish be that yussuf dakmar should consider he quest too difficult for then he would probably summon assistance at haifa encouragement be the proper cue now that jeremy have tantalize he with a glimpse of the bait we have nothing to fear from he unless he should lose heart the value of a sum lie in the answer he say quote one of those copybook proverb with which all syrian love to clinch a argument the letter be in its owner 's pocket the accuser should now apologize and we can spend the rest of the journey pleasantly jeremy proceed to apologize : so you be not such a thief as you look then he provide entertainment he draw out the razor and do stunt with it juggle it with open blade from hand to hand -- pretend to drop it and always catch it again within a fraction of a inch of yussuf dakmar 's person by and by he juggle with coin match-box cigar razor and anything he could lay he hand on mashallah exclaim the syrian at last he face all sweaty with excitement as he shrink back to avoid the spin razor where do you learn such accomplishment learn they answer jeremy still juggle i be a dervaish i be bear not teach i can ride through the air on cannon-ball and whatever i wish for be mine the next minute look i have one piastre i wish for twenty what do i do i spin it in the air -- catch it -- d'you hear they there you be -- twenty count 'em if you like a dervaish a holy person you where do you come from i be bear in the belly of the south wind answer jeremy where i come from every shell-fish have a pearl in it and gold be so common that the cattle wear it in they tooth i can talk three language at once and swear in six use sulphur for tobacco eat sardine without open the can and flavor my food for choice with gun-powder i have be everywhere see everything hear all the lie and i find that big effendi in jerusalem i see he first he call himself ramsden which be derive from the name of a creature bearing wool which in turn be a synonym for money he be on he way to supply feisul with money and i be go to show he the street of damascus anything else you want to know supply feisul with money that be interesting american money perhaps a american banker by any chance nothing to do with chance he be a father of certainty do not he give I that letter to keep and do not i find a safe place for it between you and the cushion yes i put it there i be a honest man but i have my reasonable doubt about this other fellow ramsden effendi find he somewhere and engage he as a servant without ask I perhaps he be honest only allah know man 's heart but he have not get a honest face like yours and when pay-day come i shall hide my money so you know damascus answer yussuf dakmar i hope you will come and see I in damascus i will give you my address if ramsden effendi have only engage you temporarily perhaps i can show you a way to make money with those accomplishment of yours make money answer jeremy prattle away like a madman i be weary of the stuff i be hunting the world over in search of a friend nobody love I i want to find someone who 'll believe the lie i tell he without expect I to believe the truth he try to foist on I i want to find a man as tricky with he brain as i be with my hand he must be a politician and a spy because i love excitement that be why i call you a spy if you be one you might have admit it and then we could have be friend like two yolk in one eggshell but i see you be only a shell without a yolk in it who clean you how long have you be in the service of ramsden effendi yussuf dakmar ask he not long and i be tire of it he be strong and he fist be heavy when he get drunk he be difficult to carry upstairs to bed and if i be also drunk the feat be still more difficult it be a mystery how such a man as he should be entrust with a secret mission for he drink with anyone aha he scowl at I because i tell the truth about he but if i have a bottle of whisky to offer he he would soon look pleasant again and would give I a drink too when he have swallow all he could hold if he have really be my servant i would naturally have kick he off the train for a fraction of such impudence i do not exactly know what to do there be a thoughtful motive behind every apparently random absurdity that jeremy get off but i be uncomfortably conscious of the fact that my wit do not work fast enough to follow such volatile maneuver perhaps it be the scotian blood in I i can follow a practical argument fast enough when the axiom ' be all lay down and we be agree on the subject however grim come to my rescue he have he pencil out and contrived to flick a piece of paper into my lap unseen by yussuf dakmar jeremy 's cue be good -lrb- the note run -rrb- dismiss he for talk about you to a stranger trust he to do the rest so i act the part of a habitually heavy drinker in a fit of sudden rage and dismiss jeremy from my service on the spot very well he answer blandly allah make all thing easy let we hope that other fellow find it easy to put you to bed tonight allah be likewise good for i have my ticket to damascus and all i need to beg for be a bed and food at haifa i mutter something in reply about he impudence and the conversation cease abruptly but at the end of ten minute or so yussuf dakmar go out into the corridor signaling to jeremy to follow he chapter viii he 'll forgive anyone who bring he whiskey you remember of course that line that shakespeare put into the mouth of puck what fool these mortal be the biggest fool be the extra smart one whose pride and peculiar joy it be to beat the game yussuf dakmar assess all other human as grist for he mill character to he be express in degree of folly and sheer badness virtue exist only as a weakness to be exploit the question that always exercise he be wherein do the other fellow 's weakness lie it be a form of madness where a sane man look for strength and honesty that he can yoke up with a yussuf dakmar spy out human failing and whereas most of we in we day have mistake pyrites for fine gold which do not hurt more than be good for we he end by mistake gold for dross you can persuade such a man without the slightest difficulty that you be a fool and a crook jeremy have turn the trick for he own amusement as much as anything although he natural vein of shrewdness probably suggest the idea yussuf dakmar ready to believe all evil and no good of anyone be convince that he have to deal with a scatter - brained arab who could be use for almost any purpose and jeremy 's riotous bent for jump from one thing to another fix the delusion still more firmly but lord he have catch a tartar outside at the end of the corridor in full view but out of earshot of narayan singh yussuf dakmar make a proposal to jeremy that be almost perfect in its naive obliquity there be nothing original or even unusual about it except the circumstance time and place green-goods man and blue-sky stock salesman race-course tout and sure-thing politician get away with the same proposition in the we every day of the week and pocket million by it only just as happen to all such gentry on occasion yussuf dakmar have the wrong fish in he net he jerk he head toward where narayan singh sit stolid and sleepy - look on a camp-stool with he curly black beard rest on the heel of one hand do you know that man he ask wallah how should i know he jeremy answer he look like a hindu thinking of reincarnation inshallah he will turn into a tiger presently beware of he he be a administration spy he be watch I talk to you and perhaps he will ask you afterward what i have say you must be very careful how you answer he i will tell he you ask I for a love-potion for the engine-driver 's wife jeremy answer i be listen what be it you be really go to say that master of yours -- that ramsden who dismiss you so tyrannically just now -- that drunkard there be nothing interesting to be say about he jeremy answer he be a fool who have pay my fare as far as damascus may allah reward he for it be you tell I the truth demand yussuf dakmar fix he eye sternly on jeremy 's you con man never overlook a chance to put he intended victim on the defensive at a early stage in the proceedings how can he have pay you fare as far as damascus this line only go to haifa where you have to change train and buy another ticket i see you be a clever devil jeremy retort may allah give you a belly ache if that be where you keep you brain it be i who buy the ticket the fool give I sufficient money for three first-class fare all the way to damascus and i have the change he forget that when he dismiss I then you will not need to beg board and lodging in haifa oh yes i need my money for another matter it be high time i marry and a fellow without money have to put up with any toothless that nobody else will take so you hope to find a wife in damascus inshallah jeremy answer piously well i will find you a good-looking girl for wife provide you first prove that you will make a good son-in-law i take man as i find they not as they represent themselves he who wish for the fire must first chop wood you understand I wallah i can chop wood like a axe with two head be the woman you daughter that be as may be let we talk business i reward my friend but woe betide the fool who betray my confidence say yussuf dakmar darkly i see you be a man after my own heart answer jeremy a thorough fellow who stop at nothing good allah must have bring we two together for a evil purpose be doubtless weary of the league of nation unbosom i be like a well into which man drop thing and never see they any more you be a fine rascal i can see that clearly so you think that allah be cook up evil do you tee-hee that be a original idea and there may be something in it let we hope there be something in it for we two at all event now as to that fellow ramsden -- avoid he unless he be drunk advise jeremy the weight of he fist would drive a man like you like a nail into a tree who fear such a ox the syrian retort a fly can sting he a little knife can bleed he a red rag can enrage he and the crow who devour that sort of meat will not worry as to whether he be kill accord to ritual he have money for feisul have he well never mind he have a letter as well and that be what i want will you get it for I do you need it badly by allah i must have it by allah then i be in good luck for that make I indispensable do not it and a indispensable man can demand what he please not at all yussuf dakmar answer frowning i have take a fancy to you or i would see you to the devil when we reach haifa ten or even twenty man will present themselves to do this business for I or if i choose i can use that fellow omar who be travel with ramsden he would like to be my accomplice but i do not trust he very much in that you be perfectly right answer jeremy he be not at all the sort of man for you to trust it would not surprise I to learn that he have warn ramsden against you already better beware of he accord to jeremy 's account of the conversation afterward it be not until that moment that he see clearly how to prevent yussuf dakmar from call in thug to attack I either at haifa or at some point between there and damascus until then he have be feel he way along -- spiel as he call it -- keep he man interest while he make all ready for the next trick to tell you the truth he go on omar be not that fellow 's real name he be a sharp one and he be after the letter every bit as much as you be how do you know that wallah how not because he himself tell I just like you he try to get I into partnership he offer I a big reward but he be not like you so i do not believe he and he have no daughter i have no use for a man who have not a good-looking daughter what he be afraid of be that someone else may get the letter first and he be a desperate fellow he tell I he intention and whether you believe I or not they be worthy of a wolf i be glad i resolve to take you into my confidence say yussuf dakmar nod go on i be listen tell I what he tell you he plan to get hold of the letter between haifa and damascus he think that be safest because it be over the border and there will not be any british officer to interfere somewhere up the lebanon valley after most of the passenger have leave the train look good to he but i think he know who you be yes he know I go on and he be afraid you 'll get help and forestall he so he be go to watch ramsden like a cat watch a mouse-hole and he be go to watch you too and if anybody try to interfere at haifa or if man get on the train between haifa and damascus who look like be accomplice of yours he be go to murder ramsden there and then seize the letter and make a jump for it you see he be one of those mean fellow -- a regular dog-in-the-manger he would rather get catch by the police and hang for murder than let anybody else get what he be after oh believe I i do not trust he i laugh when he make he proposal to I now that be very interesting say yussuf dakmar to tell you the truth i have a little experience with he last night myself he come on I by accident in a certain place and we converse i pretend to agree with he for the sake of appearance but i form a very poor opinion of he well suppose we put he out of the way first how would that be you look like a strong man suppose you watch for a opportunity to push he off the train oh that would never do jeremy answer shake he head from side to side you must not forget that indian who sit in the corridor it be you yourself who tell I he be a administration spy if he suspect you already he will suspect I for have talk with you and will watch I and if i try to push that fellow omar off the train he will come to the rescue surely you do not expect I to fight both of they at once besides you must consider ramsden that fellow ramsden be big and strong but he be a nervous wreck give he the least excuse and he will yell for the police like a baby cry for its mother he look on omar as he bodyguard now that he have dismiss I and if omar should get kill or disappear between here and haifa ramsden would demand a escort of police in fact i think he would lose courage altogether and put that letter in a strong-room in the haifa bank what be the letter anyway what be in it how much will you pay I if i get it for you never mind what be in it will you get it that be the point -- will you get it and bring it to I that be not the point at all answer jeremy the point be how much will you pay I if i do that very well i will pay you fifty pound mashallah you must need it awfully badly i could have be hire for fifty shilling to do a much more dangerous thing well twenty-five pound ought to be enough i will pay you twenty - five nothing less than fifty jeremy retort i always get fifty of everything fifty lash in the jail -- fifty bean at meal-time -- fifty pair of boot to clean for ramsden -- fifty be my lucky number i have make forty-nine attempt to get marry and the next time i shall succeed if it be not the woman 's lucky number too that be she affair show I the fifty pound i have not that much with I answer yussuf dakmar i will pay you in damascus all right then i will give you the letter in damascus no no get it as soon as possible i will and give it to I immediately then if you like you can stay close to I until i pay you in damascus ` the ass be invite to a wedding to carry wood and water and they beat he with one of the stick he carry ' jeremy quote no no no i will get the letter for i know how after i have it you may keep close to I until we reach damascus i will show it to you but i will not give it to you until after i get the fifty pound very well since you be so untrustful untrustful i be possess by a demon of mistrust why because i know i be not the worst person in the world and what i can think of another might do now if you be i and i be you which god forbid because i be a happy fellow and you look bilious and you steal the letter for I because i promise to pay you in damascus but would not give I the letter until i pay you do you know what i would think of do i would promise a few tough fellow ten pound among they to murder you thus i would get the letter and save forty pound ah but i be not that kind of man say yussuf dakmar well you will learn what kind of man you be in the next world when you reach the judgment seat what be most interesting now be the kind of fellow i be i will steal the letter from ramsden and keep it until you pay I in damascus but i sha not sleep and i shall watch you and if i suspect you of make plan to have I rob or murder i shall make such a noise that everybody will come run and then i shall be a celebrity but they 'll put you in jail very well you steal the letter and i 'll keep close to you say yussuf dakmar but how be you go to do it now that ramsden have dismiss you from he service oh that be easy you get I some whisky and i 'll take it to he for a peace offering he 'll forgive anyone who bring he whisky tee-hee that be quite a idea yes now -- how can i get whisky on the train if only i could get some i have a little soporific in a paper packet that could be mix with the whisky to make he sleep soundly wait here while i walk down the train and see what i can find yussuf dakmar be go twenty minute and whether he beg buy or steal do not transpire but he return with a pint flask contain stuff that look and smell enough like whisky to get by if there have be a label on the bottle he pour a powder into it in jeremy 's presence the two of they squat on the floor of the corridor with the bottle between they so that no one else might see what be take place now you would better get rid of that fellow omar while you attend to this yussuf dakmar caution he can you think of any way of do that oh easily jeremy answer he be a great one for the woman i will tell he there be a pretty armenian girl in the car behind he will run like any other turk to have a good look at she very well i will wait here but understand now i be a dangerous man you have fortune in one hand but destruction in the other very well but this may take I a hour and if you grow impatient and that indian see you peer into the compartment after have watch you and I talk all this time he 'll grow suspicious all right i 'll go to the car behind as soon as you have the letter come and tell I so jeremy come back and entertain grim and I with a burlesque account of the interview after whisper to narayan singh to give the alarm in the event of yussuf dakmar return forward to spy on we grim put the doped whisky into he valise after a sniff at it instead of throw it out of the window at my suggestion and after a suitable interval he go out in the part of the turk to look for the imaginary beautiful armenian then i give jeremy the fake letter back and go to sleep so it be no use ask I what the country look like between ludd and haifa i do not even wake up to see the lake of tiberia sea of galilee or bahr tubariya as it be variously call a rather common sickness be what sir richard burton call holylanditis and i have have it as well as the croup and measles in my youth some folk never recover from it and to they a rather ordinary sheet of water and ugly modern village build on ruin look like the picture that a opium smoker see the ruin and the history do interest I but you can not see they from the train and after a night without sleep there seem to I something more profitable in view than to hang from a window and buy fish that undoubtedly have once swum in galilee water but that cost a most unrighteous price and stank as if straight from a garbage heap the whole train reek of putrid fish when we reach haifa in the evening in time to watch the sun go down across the really glorious bay of acre chapter ix the rest will be simple haifa be crowd with syrian of all sort and there be two or three staff officer in the uniform of feisul 's army lounge on the platform who con new arrival with a sort of childlike solicitude as if by look in a man 's face they could judge whether he be friendly to they cause or not mabel have wire to she friend and be meet at the station so we have nothing to worry over for the present on she score we own trouble begin when we reach the only hotel and find it crowd the proprietor a little wizened pockmarked arab in a black alpaca jacket and yellow pants with a tarboosh balanced forward at a pessimistic angle suggest that there might be guest in the hotel who would let we share they bed although there will be no reduction of the price to either party in that event he hasten to explain it be a wonder of a hotel you could smell the bug and the sanitary arrangement from the front-door step and although the whole place have be lime-washed dirt from all over the near east be accumulate on the dead white make it look leprous and depress the place front on a main street with its back toward the bay of acre at a point where scavenger use the beach for a dump place there be a hostel of british officer about a mile away where grim might have be able to procure bed for the whole party but i notice no less than five man who follow we up from the station and seem to be keep a watchful eye on yussuf dakmar and it be a sure bet that if we should show we hand so far as to mess with british officer the train next day would be pack with man to whom murder would be simple amusement yet grim and jeremy need sleep and so do narayan singh we offer to rent a outhouse for the night -- a cellar -- the roof but there be nothing do and it be yussuf dakmar at last who solve the problem for we he find a crony of he who have occupy for several day a room contain two bed with unheard-of generosity accompany however by a peculiar display of yellow tooth and more of the jaundiced whites of he eye than i care to see this individual offer to go elsewhere for the night and to place the room at my disposal but there be this about it he explain where i be go there be no room for my friend yussuf dakmar bey so i must ask you to let he share this with you you and he could each have a bed of course but it seem to I that you servant look wearier than you do i suggest then that you take one bed effendi and share it with my friend yussuf dakmar bey leave the other to you servant who i hope will be suitably grateful for the consideration show they grim nod to I from behind the syrian ' back and i jump at the offer payment be refuse the man explain that he have the room by the week and the loan of it to I for one night would cost he nothing in fact he act courteously and with considerable evidence of breed merely request my permission to lock the big closet where he keep he personal belongings and to take the key away with he even if we have be in a mood to cavil it would have be difficult to find fault for it be a spacious clean and airy room -- three characteristic each of which be as scarce as the other in that part of the world the bed stand foot to foot along the right wall as you enter against the opposite wall be a cheap wooden wash-stand and a enormous closet build of olive wood sink into a deep recess the thing be about eight foot wide and reach to the ceiling you could not tell the depth because he lock it at once and pocket the key and it fit into the recess so neatly that a knife-blade would hardly have go into the crack outside the bedroom door in a lobby furnish with odds and end be a wickerwork sofa that would do finely for narayan singh and that old soldier do not need to have it point out to he without word or sign from we he throw he kit on the floor unroll he blanket remove he boot curl up on the sofa and if he do not go to sleep at once give such a perfect imitation of it that somebody 's fox terrier come and sniff he and recognize a campaigner after he own wander heart jump on he chest and settle down to sleep too as soon as we host have leave the room all bow and toothy smile jeremy with he back to I draw from one pocket the letter he be suppose to have steal from I flourish it in yussuf dakmar 's face and conceal it carefully in another then a new humorous notion occur to he he pull it out again fold it in the pocket wallet in which he have carry it from the first wrap the whole in a handkerchief which he knot carefully and then hand it to I effendi he say you be a fierce master and a mighty drunkard but a man without guile keep that till the morning then if omar want to steal it he will have to murder you instead of I and i would rather sleep than die but you must give it back at dawn because the prayer be in it that a very holy ma ` lim write for I and unless i read those prayer properly tomorrow 's train will come to grief before we reach damascus he act the part perfectly of one of those half-witted wholly shrewd mountebank who pick up a living by take advantage of tolerance and good nature you have all see the type it be commonest at race-meeting but you 'll find it anywhere in the world where vagrant man of means foregather again yussuf dakmar 's face become a picture of suppress emotion i pocket the wallet with the same matter-of-fact air with which i have accept a servant 's money to keep safe for he score of time he believe I to be a drunkard who have be thoroughly dope that day and would probably drink hard that night to drown the after-taste it ought to be easy to rob I while i sleep any fool could have read he thought he come down and eat supper with we at a trestle table in the dimly light dining-room and i encourage he new-born optimism by order two bottle of whisky to take upstairs jeremy who can not be happy unless play he part for all it be worth become devoutly religious and make a tremendous fuss because ham be put on the table he accuse the proprietor of use pig 's fat to smear all the cooking utensil demand to see the kitchen and finally refuse to eat anything but leban which be a sort of curd if yussuf dakmar have entertain suspicion of jeremy 's real nationality they be all resolve by the time that meal be finish but the five ' man who have follow we from the station sit in the dark at a table in the far corner of the room and watch every move we make when the coffee be bring i sit smoking and surly over it as if my head ache from the day 's drink grim and jeremy ache for sleep but refuse like good artist to neglect a detail of they part go to another table and play backgammon bet quarrelsomely and at last one of the five man walk over and touch yussuf dakmar 's shoulder at once he follow all five of they out of the room whereat grim and jeremy promptly go to bed it be so obviously my turn to stay awake that grim do not even trouble to remind I of it so i take the whisky upstairs notice that narayan singh be miss from the couch where he have go to sleep although the fox-terrier be snore so loud in he blanket that i have to look twice in the dim light i mention that fact to grim who merely smile as he get between the sheet then i go down to the street to get exercise and fresh air i do not go far but stride up and down in front of the hotel a quarter of a mile or so in each direction keep in the middle of the street i have make the fourth or fifth turn when narayan singh come out and accost I under the lamplight pardon he call aloud in english do the sahib know where i can find a druggist 's open at this hour i have a toothache and need medicine come and i 'll show you a place say i with the patronize air of a tourist show off he knowledge and we stride along together down the street he hold one hand to he jaw thus and so it happen sahib he begin as soon as we have go a safe distance i lay sleep have keep my belly empty that i might wake easily there come yussuf dakmar and five man brushing by I and they all go into a room four door beyond the sahib 's the room next beyond that one be occupy by a officer sahib who fight at el-arish alongside my battalion between he and I be a certain understanding base on past happening in which we both have a hand he be not as some other sahib but a man who open both ear and he heart and when i knock on he door he open it and recognize I ` well ' say he ` why not come and see I in the morning ` sahib ' say i ` for the sake of el-arish let I in quickly and close the door ' so he do wonder and not pleased to be disturb by a sikh at such a hour and i say to he : ` sahib ' say i ` be i a badmash a scoundrel ' ` no ' say he ` not unless you change you moral when you leave the service ' say i ' i be still in the service ' ` good ' say he ` what then ' ' i go listen again in no-man 's land ' say i and he whistle softly ` be there not a roof below you window ' i ask he and he nod ` then let I use it sahib and return the same way presently ' so he throw back the shutter ask no more question and i climb out the window of the room where yussuf dakmar and the five be stand open but the lattice shutter be close tight so that i could stand up on the flat roof of the kitchen and listen without be see and sahib i could recognize the snarl of yussuf dakmar 's voice even before my ear be lay to the open lattice he be like a dog at bay the other five be angry with he they be accuse he of play false they swear that a great sum could be have for that letter which they should share between they say a voice i do not recognize : ` if the french will pay one price they will pay another what do money matter to they if they can make out a case against feisul will they not have syria the thing be simple as twice two ' say he ` the huntsman urge on the hound but unless he be cleverer than they who eat the meat the french regard we as animal i tell you very well let we live up to the part and hunt like animal since he who have the name should have the game as well and when we have do the work and they want booty let they be make aware that animal must eat we will set we own price on that document ' ` and as for this yussuf dakmar ' say another man ` let he take a back seat unless he be willing to share and share alike with we he be not difficult to kill ' and at that sahib yussuf dakmar fly into a great rage and call they fool of complicated kind ` like hound without a huntsman ye will overrun the scent ' say he and he speak more like a man than any of they although not as a man to be like or trust ` who be ye to clap you fat nose on the scent i find and tell I the how and whither of it it may be that i can get that letter tonight surely i can get it between this place and damascus and no one can do that for i and i only know where it be nor will i tell ' and they answer all together ` we will make you tell ' but he say ` all that ye five fool can do be to interfere easy to kill I be it well perhaps it have be try but if so then though ye be jackal kite and vulture all in one with the skill of chemist add ye can never extract secret knowledge from a dead man 's brain then that letter will reach feisul tomorrow night and the french who speak of you now as of animal will call you what prince nobleman ' i suppose they see the point of that sahib for they change they tone without however become friendly to yussuf dakmar thief of that sort know one another and trust none and it be all a lie sahib about there be any honor among they fear be the only tie that bind thief and they proceed to make yussuf dakmar afraid there seem to be one among they sahib who be leader he have a thin voice like a eunuch 's and unlike the other swear seldom this father of a thin voice accept the situation he say : ` well and good let yussuf dakmar do the hunting for we it be sufficient that we hunt yussuf dakmar two of we occupy the room next to ramsden 's if yussuf dakmar need aid in the night let he summon we by scratch with he nail on the closet door the rest will be simple there be four in this besides we five so if we count yussuf dakmar that make ten who share the reward shall yussuf dakmar grow fat while nine of we starve i think not let he get the letter and give it to I we will hide it and i will deal with the french if he fail tonight let he try again tomorrow on the train but we five will also take that train to damascus and unless that letter be in my hand before the journey 's end then yussuf dakmar die be that agree ' all except yussuf dakmar agree to it he be very angry and call they leech whereat they laugh say that leech only suck enough and then fall off whereas they would take all or kill they make he understand it take a great oath together to slay he without mercy unless he should get the letter and give it to they before the train reach damascus tomorrow evening well sahib he agree presently not with any effort at good grace but cursing while he yield in truth sahib it be less fear than lack of sleep that yussuf dakmar feel i could hear he yawn through the window lattice now a man in that condition be likely to act early in the night for fear that sleep may otherwise get the better of he and the sahib will do well to be keenly alert from the first i shall be asleep on that couch outside the door and will come if call so the sahib would better not lock the door but should call loud in case of need because i also have be long awake and may sleep heavily suppose i walk the street all night say i would not that foil they nay sahib but the reverse for if yussuf dakmar should miss you after midnight he would go in search of you with those five in turn track he and as for find you that would be a simple matter for every night thief and beggar wait for the dawn would give attention to such a big man as you and would report you movement all six would come on you in the dark and would kill you surely then as if that be not bad enough have search you they would learn that the letter in you possession be not the right one and the trail of the right one would be that much easier to detect then come with I say i and we 'll make a night of it together you and i can defend ourselves against those six doubtless sahib but my place be within hail of jimgrim no it be best that you see this matter through tonight between four wall only remember sahib that though a man on duty may feign sleep it be wiser not to because sleep steal on we unawares so i return to the bedroom where grim and jeremy be snore a halleluja chorus but yussuf dakmar have not return yet i take advantage of the syrian 's absence to open grim 's valise remove the bottle of doped whisky and set it on the table close to the window beside the two bottle that i have buy downstairs -- one of which for the sake of appearance i open just as yussuf dakmar enter smile to conceal anxiety chapter x you make a bad break that time grim be in mephistophelian humor he can sleep cat-fashion for sixty seconds at a time with all he wit about he in the interval and like to feel in the crook of he own forefinger the hidden hair-trigger of event i do not think jeremy be awake when i first enter the room although it suit grim 's humor that he should be presently but you would have swear they be both unconscious judge by the see-saw bass and baritone snore i pour out whisky drink a little of it grouchily and watch yussuf dakmar into bed he do not take many of he clothes off and even by candle-light you could see the shape of the knife conceal under he shirt he sit cross-legged on the bed presumably pray and as i do not like the look of he i blow out the candle instantly pinch and prompt by jame schuyler grim jeremy sit up and yammer profanely at the darkness vow he could not see to sleep without a light in the room i tinkle a tumbler against a whisky bottle and jeremy instantly swear that he hear burglar sit up and whirling he pillow he knock yussuf dakmar off the bed on to the floor so i light the candle again after empty my glass of whisky into a spittoon whereat jeremy quote the koran about the fate of drunkard and get out of bed apologize to yussuf dakmar like a courtier do homage to a king you honor be bear under a lucky star he assure he i usually shoot or stab but the pillow be the first thing handy the syrian have hard work to keep he temper for he have fall on the haft of the hidden knife and it hurt he between two rib where a poorly condition man be extra sensitive however he mumble something and crawl between the sheet then grim vow that he could not sleep with a light so i blow out the candle and in about two minute the steady seesaw snore resume i take the opportunity to empty half the contents of a whisky bottle into the spittoon and after light a pipe proceed to clink a tumbler at steady interval as evidence of debauch well under way except for the clink and bump of the tumbler and once when i fill and relit the pipe all be quiet for half a hour when yussuf dakmar pipe up suddenly and ask I whether i do not intend to come to bed i will not trouble you effendi i will keep over to my side there be plenty of room in the bed for the two of we as he speak i hear a movement of the bedclothes as grim pinched jeremy awake again i answer before jeremy could horn in hic you ` spect I ` nto bed full o ' snake never sleep ` slong as venomous reptile wait hic you stay 'n bed a keep 'em ` way from I well jeremy do not want any better cue than that he get up light the candle and explain to I with great wealth of arabic theosophy that the snake i saw be mere delusion because allah never make they and i try to look utterly drunk stare at he with drop jaw and droopy eyelid knock a empty bottle over with my elbow by way of call attention to it get into bed effendi jeremy advise I feed the cue back since i be in the middle of the stage not into that bed i answer shake my head solemnly that f ` ler put snake in on purpose why 's he sober when i be drunk i will not sleep in bed with sober man let he get drun ' too a ' both see snake then i 'll sleep with he jeremy 's roving eye fall on the small doped bottle that i have take from grim 's valise look preternaturally wise he walk over to yussuf dakmar 's bed sit down on it with he back toward I and proceed to unfold a plan allah make all thing easy he begin it be lawful to take all precaution to confound the infidel we shall never get that drunkard to bed as long as there be any whisky so let 's encourage he to drink it all when it be go he 'll sleep on the floor and we 'll get some peace it be a good chance for we to drink whisky without commit sin we need not take much -- just one drink each and then he 'll swallow the rest like a hog to prevent we get any more you look as if a glass of whisky would do you good that fellow omar be asleep and will not see we so nobody can tell tale afterwards it be a good opportunity come on i have sit so that yussuf dakmar could not see what i be do and pour out the liquor in advance arrange the glass so that yussuf dakmar would take the doped stuff -- a perfectly un-christian proceeding i admit christian be scarce when you get right down to case most of we in extremity prefer shakespeare 's adage about hoist engineer it get result so much more quickly than turn the other cheek at any rate i own up yussuf dakmar smirk in anticipation of a easy victory take the nearest tumbler and toss off the contents in imitation of jeremy 's free and easy air and the drug act as swiftly as the famous knock - out-drop they use to administer in the new york tenderloin he know what have happen before he lose consciousness for he try to give the alarm to he friend he lay on the floor opening and shut he mouth and i think he believe he be shout for help but after a minute or two you could hardly detect he breathing and he face change color as if he have be poison grim do not even trouble to get out of bed but listen without comment to my version of narayan singh 's report and jeremy go back to sleep chuckle so i hold a silent wake over yussuf dakmar keep some more of the doped whisky ready in case he should look like recover too soon i even search he find nothing worthy of note except that he have remarkably little money i expect the poor devil be a penny ante villain scheming for a thousand-dollar jackpot i feel really sorry for he and turn he over with my boot to let he breathe better a little before dawn i awaken grim and jeremy and we leave the room quietly after i have scratch on the closet door with my fingernail pause outside to listen we hear the closet door be open stealthily from the far side i catch grim 's eye think he would smile back but he look as deadly serious as i have ever see he you make a bad break that time he say when we have go downstairs never give away information unless you be get a return for it if you would leave yussuf dakmar to scratch that door after he recover consciousness he would have invent a pack of lie to tell he friend and they would have be no wiser than before now they 'll know he never scratch it they 'll deduce unless they be lunatic that someone overhear they conference last night and know the signal that 'll make they desperate they 'll waste no more time on finesse they 'll use violence at the first chance after the train leave haifa rammy 's like I he hate not to have a audience for he trick put in jeremy by way of consolation we have get to stage a new play that be all say grim i would have the lot of they arrest but all the good that would do would be to inform the man higher up who would tip off another gang by wire to wait for we over the border say suppose we all three bear this in mind : no play to the gallery that be where secret service differ from other business applause mean failure the better the work you do the less you can afford to admit you do it you must not even smile at a man you have score off half the game be to leave he guess who it be that trip he up the safest course be to see that someone else get credit for everything you do consume you own smoke eh suggest jeremy that and more grim answer you have get to work like hell for what 'll do you no good because the moment it bring you recognition it destroy you usefulness you may not even amuse yourself you have to let the game amuse you without turn one trick for the sake of a extra smile most of the humor come in anyhow from know more than the other fellow think you do the more a man lie the less you want to contradict he because if you do he 'll know that you know he be lie and that be give away information which be the unforgivable sin golly exclaim jeremy you trade would not suit I jim when do trick it be good to watch folk ' eye pop open what tickle my wish-bone be what i can see for myself on they silly face half of 'em try to look as if they know how it be do and the other half all grin i do trick for a scotchman once who get so angry i think he would hit I he say what i do be impossible so i do it again and he still say it be impossible and he end by call I a ` puir dementit man ' that be my apogee i have never reach that height since not even when i first make a camel say prayer at abu keen and the arab hail I as a prophet bread 's good but it be better with the butter on it right side up not in this game it be not answer grim if you bread seem smear with butter that be a sure sign it be dangerous for god 's sake as long as you stay in the game with I do not play to the gallery either of you let 's order breakfast it be the longest lecture and expression of opinion i have ever listen to from jame schuyler grim and though i have turn it over in my mind a great deal since i can not discover anything but wisdom in it i believe he tell jeremy and I the secret of power that morning chapter xi they be all right there be no competition for seat on the damascus train that morning several of the window-pane be smash there be bullet-mark and splinter on the woodwork everywhere -- no need to ask question but i find time on the platform to chat with some british officer while keep a eye lift for yussuf dakmar and he friend damascus eh you 'll have a fine journey if you get through alive nine passenger be shoot dead in the last train down no law up there you know feisul 's army 's all concentrate for a crack at the french -lrb- good luck to 'em no i be not wish the french any particular luck this trip -rrb- nobody to watch the bedouin so they take pot shot at every train that pass just for the fun of it may be war you know at any minute the french be sure to make a drive for the railway line -- you 'll be hang up indefinitely -- commandeer for a ambulance train -- shot for the sake of argument -- anything at all in fact they say those algerian troops be get out of hand -- pay in depreciate franc and up against the high cost of debauchery you be take a chance wish i could go have not see a healthy scrap sinze zeitun ridge hey hullo what be this lovely woman well i 'll be it be mabel ticknor follow by the six man i be watch for yussuf dakmar look sulky and discourage in they midst almost like a prisoner and the other five wear palpably innocent expression lord remark the officer nearest I that gang 's get the wind up look at the color of they gill book through i 'll bet you and be listen to tale all night the gang draw abreast just as another officer give tongue to he opinion they could not help hear what he say he have one of those voice that can carry on conversation in a boiler foundry there be more in this than meet the eye she be not a nurse she do not walk like a missionary i hear she buy a ticket for aleppo can you imagine a lone good-looking woman go to aleppo by that train unless she have a laissez passe from the french she be wear french heel i 'll bet she be carry secret information look d'you see those two arab in the train he point out grim and jeremy who be lean from a window they tip she off to get into the compartment next ahead of they d'you see there she go she be for get into the coach ahead they call she back almost all the other car be empty except that one but whether because human be like sheep and herd together instinctively when afraid or because the train crew order it all six compartment of the middle first-class car be now occupy with mabel ticknor alone in the front one nevertheless yussuf dakmar and four of he companion start to climb in by the rear door the sixth man linger within earshot of the officer presumably to pick up further suggestion so i get in at the front end and meet they halfway down the corridor plenty of room in the car behind i say abruptly they be five to one but yussuf dakmar be in front and he merely get in the way of the wolf behind he the sixth man who have linger near the officer now enter by the front end as i have do and call out that there be plenty of room in the front compartment there be only a woman in here he say in arabic and he set the example by take the seat opposite to mabel it would have be easy enough to get he out again of course not even the polyglot train crew would have allow arab to trespass without she invitation the trouble be that jeremy grim narayan singh and i all rush to she rescue at the same minute which let the cat out of the bag it be doctor ticknor 's statement in jerusalem about not want to see any of we alive again if we fail to bring he wife back safe that turn the trick and cause even grim to lose he head for a moment when a sikh two obvious arab and a american all rush to a woman 's assistance before she call for help there be evidence of collusion somewhere which you could hardly expect a trained spy to overlook or fail to draw conclusion from it be all over in a minute the rascal leave the compartment mutter to himself in arabic sotto voce i catch one word but he look so diabolically please with himself that it do not really need that to stir I into action i take twelve in boot with a rather broad toe and he stop the full heft of the hardest kick i could let loose it put he out of action for half a day and remain one of my pleasantest memory he companion have to gather he up and help he pulley-hauley fashion into the car ahead while a officious ticket-taker demand my name and address i find in my wallet the card of a we senator and give he that whereat he apologize profoundly and address I as colonel -- a title with which he continue to flatter I all the rest of the journey except once when he change it to admiral by mistake grim go back into we compartment and laugh and none of the essay i have read on laughter -- not even the famous dissertation by josh billing -- throw light on how to describe the tantalizing manner of it he laugh several different way : heartily at time as man of my temperament mostly do boisterously on occasion after jeremy 's fashion now and then cryptically use laughter as a mask then he own a smile that suggest nothing more nor less than kindness base on understanding of human nature but that other be a devil of a laugh mostly make of chuckle that seem to bubble off a hell-brew of disillusionment and you get the impression that he be laugh at himself -- cynically lay bare the vanity and fallibility of he own mental process -- and forecasting self-discipline there be no mirth in it although there be amusement no anger although immeasurable scorn i should say it be a good safe laugh to indulge in for i think it be base on ability to see himself and he own mistake more clearly than anybody else can and there be no note of defeat in it but it be full of a cruel irony that bring to mind a vision of one of those old medieval flagellant priest review he sin before thrash he own body with a wire whip so that end that he say at last with the gesture of a man who sweep the piece from a board to set they up anew and start again luckily we be not the only fool in asia those six rascal know now that mabel and we be one party pooh sneer jeremy what can the devil do not much this side of the border at deraa grim answer after deraa pretty well what they be mind they could have we pinch on some trumped-up charge in which case we would be search mabel include no we have play too long on the defensive deraa be the danger-point the telegraph line be cut there and all message go north or south have to be carry by hand across the border the french have a agent there who censor everything he be the boy we have get to fool if they appeal to he this train will go on without we ramsden you and narayan singh go and sit with mabel in she compartment jeremy you go forward and bring yussuf dakmar back here to I we 'll let he have that fake letter just before we reach deraa take care somehow to let the other five know he have it they will not discover it be a fake until after leave deraa -- why not i interrupted what be to prevent they open it at once two good reason : for one we 'll have narayan singh keep a careful eye on they and they 'll keep it hide as long as he snoop around for another they 'll be delighted not to have to let the french agent at deraa into the secret because of the higher price they hope to get by hold on they 'll smuggle it over the border and not open it until they feel safe yes but when they do look at it say i we 'll be over the border and they can not send telegram to anywhere why not a arab government precaution if station agent all along the line be allow to send telegram every seditious upstart would take advantage of it and they would have more trouble than they have get now but i warn you fellow after deraa -- somewhere between the border and damascus -- there 'll be a fight the minute they discover that the letter be a fake they 'll come for the real one like cat after a canary let 'em come smile jeremy but grim shake he head i have be make that mistake too long he answer no defensive tactic after we leave deraa we 'll start the trouble ourselves you watch after deraa the train crew will play card in the caboose and leave allah to care for the passenger there be only one thing trouble I say jeremy what be that narayan singh get yussuf dakmar 's shirt night before last i have have it in for yussuf ever since we anzac go hungry on account of he anyone who scupper he have get I to beat to he he be my meat and i give you all notice it be not good to stand between a anzac and the punishment he think a enemy deserve all the same grim answer smile i 'll bet you do not get he jeremy i 'll bet you how much mind you when the game begin you have a free hand grim go on all right answer jeremy who love freak bet '' if i get he you quit the army soon as this job 's do and join up with rammy and I : if i do not i 'll stay and help you on the next job that be a bet say grim promptly so jeremy go forward to play at be traitor while narayan singh and i keep mabel company she fire question at we right and left for twenty minute which we have to answer in detail instead of strain we car to catch what grim and jeremy might be say to yussuf dakmar in the next compartment whatever they do say they manage to prolong the interview until within ten minute of deraa when the syrian return to he companion smile smugly and narayan singh stride after he to stand in the corridor and by ostentatiously watch they prevent they examine the letter grim and jeremy all grin join we at once in mabel 's compartment do you see the devil smirk as he go off with it ask jeremy golly he think we be fool the theory be that we two have betray you rammy and swap the letter against he bare promise to pay we in damascus he chuck in a little blackmail about sic he mate on to murder we if we do not come across and i tell you we fairly love he lordy here 's deraa if they open the thing before the train leave grim say the lot of we be to bolt back across the border send mabel home to she husband and continue the journey by camel that right grim grim nod it be mabel who object i be go to see this through she answer guess again boy my hair 's go gray you owe I a real adventure now and i will not give up the letter till you have pay we have one first-class scare when the train draw up in the squalid station where the branch line to haifa meet the main hedjaz railway and the two together touch a mean town at a tangent for a french officer in uniform board the train and stalk down the corridor stare hard at everyone he ask I for a passport which be sheer bluff so i ask he in turn for he own authority he smile and produce a rubber stamp say that if i wish to visit beirut or aleppo i must get a vise from he je m 'em bien garderai i answer i be go to see my aunt at damascus and this lady be she you wife i laugh aloud -- could not help it all the old testament story keep force themselves on you memory in that land and the legend of abraham try to pass he wife off as he sister and the three-cornered drama that come of it crop up as fresh as yesterday there be no need that i could see to repeat the patriarch 's mistake any more than there be reasonable basis for the frenchman 's impertinence be that you business i ask he because he go on smile meanly you speak with a american accent it be against the law to carry gold across the border and american have to submit to personal search because they always carry it show I you authority i retort angrily oh as for that there be a custom official here who have full authority he be a syrian it occur to I that you might prefer to be search by a european call he bluff grim whisper behind he sleeve but i intend to do that anyway bring along you syrian say i and off he go to do it treat I to a backward glance over he shoulder that convey more than word could have do he 'll bluff sky-high say grim but keep on call he i have be search at six frontier say mabel if it be a syrian i do not much mind you boy all come along and he 'll behave himself they be much worse in france and italy have not one of you better take the letter though no i be forget already i will not part with it i 'll take my chance with the syrian he 'll only ask I to empty my pocket and prove that i have not a bag full of gold under my skirt sit tight all here he come the frenchman return with a smile olive-complexioned syrian in tow -- a round-faced fellow with blue jaw as dark as he serge uniform the frenchman stand aside and the syrian announce rather awkwardly that regulation compel he to submit mabel and I to the inconvenience of search for what say i for gold he answer it be against the law to smuggle it across the border i have only one gold coin i say show he a we twenty-dollar piece and he yellow eye shine at sight of it if it will save trouble you may have it i put it into he open palm with the frenchman look on and it be immediately clear that that particular syrian official be no longer amenable to international intrigue he be buy and sell -- oozy with gratitude -- incapable of anything but wild enthusiasm for the usa for several hour to come i have search they say he to the french officer they have no gold and they be all right the french have fault like the rest of we but they be quicker than most man to recognize logic the man with crimson pants and sabre grin cynically shrug he shoulder and pass on to annoy somebody easier chapter xii start something before they be ready for it just before the train start a handsome fellow with short black beard trim into a point and wear a well-cut european blue serge suit but none the less obviously a arab come to the door of we compartment and stare steadily at grim he stand like a fight man as if every muscle of he body be under command and the suggestion be strengthen by what might be a bullet scar over one eye if that fellow have ask I for a loan on the spot or for help against he enemy he would have receive both or either moreover if he have never pay I back i would still believe in he and would bet on he again however after one swift glance at he grim take no notice until the train be under way -- not even then in fact until the man in blue serge speak first oh jimgrim he say suddenly in a voice like a tenor bell come in hadad grim answer hardly glance at he make yourself at home he toss a valise into the rack and i give up the corner seat so that he might sit face grim he acknowledge the courtesy with a smile like the whicker of a sword-blade waste no time on foolish protest he know what he want -- know enough to take it when invite -- understand I and expect I to understand he -- a first-class fellow he sit lean a little forward he back not touch the cushion with the palm of both hand rest on he knee and strong finger motionless he eye mabel ticknor not exactly nervously but with caution any news ask grim jimgrim the world be full of it he answer in english with a laugh but who be these my friend you intimate friend grim nod the lady as well grim nod again that be very strong recommendation jimgrim grim introduce we give jeremy 's name as jmil ra hah i have hear of you say hadad stare at he the australian who wander all over arabium i be probably the only arab who know what you really be do you recall that time at wady hafiz when a local priest denounce you and a sheik in a yellow kuffiyus tell the crowd that he know you for a prophet i be the same sheik i like you pluck i often wonder what become of you put it here say jeremy and they shake hand for twenty minute after that hadad and jeremy swap reminiscence in quick staccato time it be like two gatle gun play a duet and the score be about equally intelligible to anyone unfamiliar with arabium 's hinterland -- which be to say to all except about one person in ten million it be most of it greek to I but grim listen like a operator to the ticking of the morse code it be hadad who cut it short jeremy would have talk all the way to damascus and so jimgrim do the kite foregather or be we a forlorn hope do we go to bury feisul or to crown he king how much do you know grim answer hah more than you my friend i come from europe -- london -- pari -- rome i stop off in deraa to listen a while where the tide of rumor flow back and forth across the border the english be in favor of feisul and would help he if they could the french be against he and would rather have he a dead saint than a living nuisance the most disturbing rumor i have hear be here in deraa to the effect that feisul send a letter to jerusalem call on all moslem to rise and massacre the jew that do not sound like feisul but the french agent in deraa assure I that he will have the original letter in he hand within a day or two grim smile over at mabel you might show he the letter he suggest so mabel dig down into the mystery beneath she shirtwaist and produce the document wrap in a medical bandage of oil silk hadad unwrap it read it carefully and hand it to grim be you deceive by that he ask do feisul speak like that or write like that since when have he turn coward that he should sign he name with a number what do you make of it ask grim hah it be as plain as the ink on the paper it be intend for use against feisul first by make the british suspicious of he second by provide the french with a excuse to attack he third by convict he of treachery for which he can be jail or execute after he be catch what do you propose to do with it jimgrim i be go to show it to feisul good i too be on my way to see feisul perhaps the two of we together can convince he what be best if we two first agree grim answer with a dry smile do you agree that two and two make four this be just as simple jimgrim feisul can not contend with the french the financier have spread they net for syrium feisul have no artillery worth speaking of -- no gas -- no mask against gas and the french have plenty of everything except money syrium have be undermine by propaganda and corruption let feisul go to british territory and thence to europe where he friend may have a chance to work for he the british will give he mesopotamium and after that it will be up to we arab to prove we be a nation that be my argument be we agree if that be you plan hadad i be with you grim answer then i also be with you let we shake hand shwai shwaus -lrb- go slow -rrb- say grim better join up with I in damascus there be six man in the car ahead who 'll try to murder we all presently they have get a letter that they think be that one the minute they find out we have fool they there 'll be ructions i be good at ructions hadad answer my friend narayan singh be forward watch they say grim what they 'll probably try when they make the discovery will be to have the lot of we arrest at some wayside station i propose to forestall they i be good at forestall say hadad then do not you forestall I laugh jeremy the fellow with a face like a pig 's stern be yussuf dakmar and he be my special preserve i be a good moslem i refuse to lay hand on pig say hadad smile we discuss feisul and the arab cause oh if we have lawrence with we exclaim hadad excitedly at last a little little man -- hardly any larger than mr ticknor -- but a david against goliath and would you believe it -- there be a idiotic rumor that lawrence have return and be hide in damascus the french be really disturbed about it they have cable they foreign office and receive a official denial of the rumor but official denial carry no weight nowadays out of ten frenchman in syrium five believe that lawrence be with feisul and if they can catch he he will get short shrift but oh jimgrim -- oh if it be true wallahi grim do not answer but i see he look long at jeremy and then for about thirty seconds steadily at mabel ticknor after that he stare out of the window for a long time not even move he head when a crowd of bedouin gallop to within fifty yard of the train and volley at it from horseback merely out of devilment as hadad hasten to assure we we be wind up the lebanon valley by that time carpet of flower green grass waterfall a thatched hut to the twenty square mile with a scattering of mean black tent between every stone building in ruin goat where fat kine ought to be and a more or less modern railway screech across the landscape short of fuel and oil that be lebanon we grow depressed then silent we meditation be interrupt by the sudden arrival of narayan singh in the door of the compartment grin full of news they have open the letter sahib they accuse yussuf dakmar of deceive they they threaten he with death shall i interfere any sign of the train crew grim ask nay they be gamble in the brake-van grim look sharply at hadad what authority have you get none i be a personal friend of feisul that be all well we 'll pretend you have power to arrest they ramsden you have suddenly miss you letter you have accuse jeremy of steal it he have confess to sell it to yussuf dakmar go forward in a rage and demand the letter back start something before they be ready for it we 'll be just behind you leave yussuf dakmar to I insist jeremy i pay the debt of a anzac division i hope i have never hurt a man who do not deserve it or who be not fit to fight but i have to admit that grim do not need to repeat the invitation i start forward in a hurry and jeremy elbow narayan singh aside in order to follow next australian be notoriously unlady-like performer when anybody 's hat be in the ring by the time i reach the car ahead the train have enter a wild gorge circle by one of those astonishing hairpin curve with which engineer defeat nature the panting engine slow almost to a snail 's pace have only a scant fuel ration with which to negotiate curve and grade combine to we right there be a nearly sheer drop of four hundred foot with a stream at the bottom boiling among limestone boulder but there be no time to study scenery from the middle compartment of the car there come yell for help and the peculiar noise of thump and scuffle that can not be mistaken man fight in various way lord know and the worst be the said-to-be civilized but from nome to cape town and all the way from china to peru the veriest tenderfoot can tell in the dark the difference between fight and horseplay i reach the door of the compartment in time to see three of they -lrb- two bleeding from knife-wound in the face -rrb- force yussuf dakmar backward toward the window the whole lot stab frantically as they mill and sway the fifth man be hold on to the scrimmage with he left hand and reach round with he right try to stick a knife into yussuf dakmar 's rib without endanger he own hide but the sixth man be the rascal i have kick he have no room -- perhaps no inclination -- to get into the scrimmage so he see I first and he need no spur to he enmity with a movement as quick as a cat 's and presence of mind that account for he be leader of the gang he seize the fifth man by the neck and spin he round to call he attention and the two come for I together like devil out of a spring-trap now the narrow door of a compartment on a train be not any kind of easy place to fight in but i vow and declare that jeremy and i both do we best for yussuf dakmar that be a remarkable thing if you come to think of it as a dirty murderer -- thief -- liar -- traitor -- spy he have not much claim on we affection and jeremy cherish a war-grudge against he on top of it all what be it that make we side with the bottom dog regardless of pro and con it be a nasty mix-up because they use knife and we rely on hand and fist i have use a pick-handle on occasion and a gun when i have have to but speak generally it seem to I to demean a white man to use weapon in a row like that and i find that most fellow who have walk the earth much agree with I we try to go in like a typhoon shock-troop style but it do not work another man let go of yussuf dakmar who be grow weak and too short of wind to yell and in a moment there be five of we struggle on the floor between the seat one man under I with my forearm across he throat and another alongside I stab savagely at a leather valise under the impression that he be carve up my rib on top of that mess narayan singh pounce like a tiger wrenching at arm and leg until i struggle to my foot again -- only to be thrust aside by jeremy as he rise and rush at yussuf dakmar 's two assailant but with all he speed jeremy be a tenth of a tick too late the wretch be already helpless and i dare say they break he back as they lean they combine weight on he and force he backward and head-first through the window jeremy make a grab for he foot but miss it and a knife-blade already wet with yussuf dakmar 's blood whip out and sting he in the thigh that of course be sheer ignorance you should never sting a australian kill he or let he alone better yet make friend with he or surrender but above all do nothing by half they be a race of whole-hogger equally ready to force they only shirt on you or fight you to a finish so jeremy finish the business at the window he take a neck in each hand and crack they skull together until the whack-whack-whack of it be like the exhaust of a ford with loose piston ring and when they fall from he grip unconscious he come to my rescue believe I i need it they be as strong and lithe as wildcat those syrian and fully awake to the advantage that the narrow door give they one man struggle with narayan singh and keep he busy with he bulk so wedge across the opening that grim and hadad be as good as demobilize out in the corridor and the other two tackle I like a pair of butcher hacking at a maddened bull i land with my fist but each time at the cost of a flesh-wound and though i get one knife-hand by the wrist and hang on wrenching and screw to throw the fellow off he foot the other man 's right be free and the eighteen-inch erzeram dagger that he hold dance this and that way for a opening underneath my guard jeremy 's left fist land under the peak of he jaw exactly at the moment when he stiffen to launch he thrust he fall as if pole-axed and the blade miss my stomach by six inch but the combined force of thrust and blow be great enough to drive the weapon into the wooden partition where it stay until i pull it out to keep as a souvenir there be not much trouble after that grim and hadad come in and we tear strip from the syrian ' clothing to tie they hand and foot with hadad go to the rear of the train climb along the footboard of the third-class car to the caboose to throw some sort of bluff to the conductor who come forward -- call I colonel and hadad excellency -- look we prisoner over -- recognize no friend -- and say that everything be quite all right he say he know exactly what to do but we leave narayan singh on watch lest that knowledge should prove too original which however it turn out not to be it be bromidian -- as old as history narayan singh come back and tell we lo sahib he go through they clothes as a ape for flea i watch and when he have all they valuable he lay they on the footboard and then as we pass some bedouin tent he kick they off but he seem a honest fellow for he give they back some small change to buy food with should any be obtainable after that he stand flash he white tooth for half a hour watch mabel bandage jeremy and I for it always amuse a sikh to watch a white man eat punishment sikh be a fine race -- but curious -- distinctly curious and give to unusual amusement when mabel have finish with I at last i stick a needle into he and he laugh accept the stab as a compliment a strange thing be how man settle down after excitement bird do the same thing a hawk swoop down on a hedgerow there be a great flutter follow by sudden silence a minute later the chatter begin again without any reference to one of they number be tear in the plunderer 's beak and so we even grim loosen up and gossip about feisul and the already ancient day when feisul be the up-to-date saladin lead arab host to victory but there be a even stranger circumstance than that we be not the only people in the train we car for instance be fairly well occupy by armenian arab and folk whose vague nationality come under the general head of levantine the car ahead where the fight take place though not crowd be not vacant and there be other in the car behind yet not one of they make a move to interfere they mind they own business which prove i think that manners be base mainly on discretion as the train gasp slowly up the grade and roll bumpily at last along the fertile neglect syrian highland all the armenian on the train remove they hat and substitute the red tarboosh prefer the headgear of a convert rather than be the target of every bedouin with a rifle in he hand the whole journey be a mix-up of thing to wonder at -- not least of they the matter-of-fact confidence with which the train proceed along a single track whose condition leave you wonder at each bump whether the next would not be the journey 's violent end there be lamp but no oil for light when evening come once when we bump over a shaky culvert and a bushel or two of coal-dust fall from the rusty tender the engineer stop the train and he assistant go back with a shovel and piece of sack to gather up the precious stuff there be nothing but squalid village and ruin goat and a occasional rare camel to be see through the window -- not a tree anywhere the german general staff have attend to that job thoroughly there be honey in the country and it be plentiful as well as good because bee be not easy property to raid and make away with but the milk be from goat and as for overflow i would hate to have to punish the dug of a score of the brute to get a jugful for dinner syrium 's wealth be of the past and the future long before it grow too dark to watch the landscape we be wholly convert to grim 's argument that syrium be no place for a man of feisul 's calibre the arab owner of the land be plunder to the bone the man with money be foreigner whose only care be for a government that will favor this religion and that breed to set up a kingdom there would be like preach a new religion in hester street you could hand out text soup and blanket but you would need a whale 's supply of faith to carry on and the offertory would not begin to meet expense until that journey finally convinced I i have be wonder all the while in the back of my head whether grim be not intend a impertinence it have not be my province hitherto to give advice to king for one thing they have not ask I for it if i be ask i think i would take the problem pretty seriously and hesitate before suggest to a man on whom the hope of fifty million people rest that he would better pull up stake and eat crow in exile for the present i would naturally hate to be a king but if i be one i do not think quit would look good and i think i would feel like kick the fellow who suggest it but the view from the train and grim 's talk with hadad put I in a mood in which syrium do not seem good enough for a soap-box politician let alone a man of feisul 's fame and character and when at last a few light in a cluster down the track proclaim that we be draw near damascus i be ready to advise everybody feisul include to get out in a hurry while a chance remain chapter viii bismillah what a mercy that i meet you while the fireman scrape the iron floor for he last two shovelful of coal-dust and the train wheeze wearily into the dark station grim begin to busy himself in mysterious way part of he own costume consist of a short curved scimitar attach to a embroidered belt -- the sort of thing that arab wear for ornament rather than use he take it off and grope in the dark help mabel put it on without a word of explanation then instead of put on he own moslem over-cloak he throw that over she shoulder and digging down into he bag for a spare head-dress snatch she hat off and bind on the white kerchief in its place with the usual double gold-covered cord of camel-hair then come my friend the train conductor and address I as colonel offering to carry out the bag the moment he have grab he load and go grim break silence : call she colonel and I grim do not forget how we become aware of face under helmet peer through the window - officer of feisul 's army on the watch for unwelcome visitor from behind they come the conductor 's voice again air he english : any more bag inside there colonel get out quick jeremy and make a fuss about the colonel come order grim jeremy suddenly become the arch-efficient servitor establish importance for he chief and never a newly make millionaire or modern demagog have such skillful advertisement the shereefian officer stand back at a respectful distance ready to salute when the personage should deign to alight what shall be do with the memsahib 's hat demand narayan singh you could only see the whites of he eye but he shake something in he right hand eat it grim answer heaven that be my best hat object mabel give it here i 'll carry it under the cloak get rid of it grim order and narayan singh stride off to contribute yellow leghorn straw and poppy to the engine furnace i give he ten piastre to fee the engineer and five for the fireman so you might say that be high-priced fuel what kind of bunk be you throw this time i ask grim he do not answer but give order to mabel in short crisp syllable you be colonel lawrence answer no question if anyone salute just move you hand and bow you head a bit you be just he height look straight in front of you and take long stride bend you head forward a little there that be it i be scared announce mabel by way of ask for more particulars she be not scare in the least piffle grim answer remember you be lawrence that be all they would give you damascus if you ask for it follow jeremy and leave the rest to we i do not doubt that grim have be turn over the whole plan in he mind for hour past but when i tax he with it afterward he reply be characteristic : if we would rehearse it mabel and hadad would both have be self-conscious the game be to study you man -- or woman as the case may be -- and sometimes drill 'em sometimes spring it on 'em accord to circumstance the only rule be to study people there be no two quite alike hadad be surprise into silence too thoughtful a man to do anything except hold he tongue until the next move should throw more light on the situation he follow we out of the car say nothing and be recognize by the light of one dim lantern as a intimate friend of feisul he accomplish all that grim could have ask of he he be know to have be in europe until recently rumor about lawrence have be toss from mouth to mouth for day past and here be somebody who look like lawrence in the dark follow by grim and hadad and address as colonel why should not those three shereefian officer jump to conclusion salute like automaton and grin like loyal man who have surprise a secret and will not tell anyone but they bosom friend it be all over damascus within the hour that lawrence have come from england to stand by feisul in the last ditch the secret be keep perfectly we let mabel walk ahead of we and there be no trouble at the custom barrier where normally every piastre that could be wring from protest passenger be mulct to support a starve treasury for the officer stride behind we and trade sign to the custom clerk who immediately swear at everyone in sight and send all he minion to yell for the best cab in damascus narayan singh distribute largesse to about a hundred tout and hanger-on and we splash off toward the hotel in two open landau through street six inch deep in water except at the cross-gutter where the horse jump for fear of lose sounding abana and pharpar river of damascus be in flood as usual at that time of year and the scavenging street cur have to swim from one garbage heap to the next there be a gorgeous battle go on opposite the hotel door where half a dozen white-ivoried mongrel with they back to a heap of kitchen leavings hold a ford against a dozen other each beast that make good he passage join with the defender to fight off the rest i stand on the hotel step and watch the war for several minute while grim go in with the other and register as rupert ramsden of chicago usa and party the flood and darkness owing to the lack of fuel be all in we favor for such folk as be abroad be hardly of the sort whose gossip would carry weight nevertheless we have not be in the hotel twenty minute before a agent of the bank put in he appearance speak french volubly see my name on the register he make the mistake of confine he attention to I which enable grim to get mabel safely away into a big room on the second floor the frenchman -lrb- if he be one -- he have a hebrew nose -rrb- make bold to corner I on a seat near the dining-room door he be nervous rather than affable -- a little pompous as behoove the representative of money power -- and evidently use to have he impertinence answer humbly you be from the south do you have a good journey be the train attack do you hear any interesting rumor on the way those be all preliminary question throw out at random to break ice as he sit down beside I you could feel the next one come just as easily as see that he be not interested in the answer to the first you be here on business what business private business say i with a eye on jeremy just come down the stair you talk arabic he nod eye I keenly that man be my servant and know my affair i be too tired to talk after the journey suppose you ask he so jeremy come and sit beside we and throw the cow 's husband around as blithely as he juggle billiard ball i be not suppose to understand what he be say the big effendi be a prizefighter who have hear there be money to be make at feisul 's court at least that be what he say between you and I i think he be a spy for the french government because when he engage I in jerusalem he give I a fist-full of paper franc with which to send a telegram to pari what be in the telegram i do not know it be a mass of figure and i mix they up on purpose be a honest fellow averse to spy 's work oh i have keep a eye on he believe I ever since he kill a syrian in the train i have have my doubt of he mashallah what a murderous disposition the fellow have kill a man as soon as look at he -- indeed he would be you a prince in these part a banker bismillah what a mercy that i meet you i overhear he say that he will visit the bank tomorrow morning to cash a draft for fifty thousand franc i would examine the draft carefully if i be you it would not surprise I to learn it be steal or forge be there any other bank that he could go to no only mine the other have suspend business on account of the crisis then in the name of allah do not forget I you ought to give I a thousand franc for the information i be a poor man but honest at what time shall i come for the money in the morning perhaps you could give I a little on account at once for my wages be due tonight and i be not at all certain of get they well see I in the morning say the banker he get up and leave we at once hardly trouble to excuse himself and grim hear he tell the hotel proprietor that we whole party would be lock up in jail before midnight that rumor go the round like wild-fire so that we be give a wide berth and have a table all to ourselves in the darkest corner of the big dim dining-room there be more than a hundred people eat dinner and narayan singh hadad and i be the only one in western clothes every seat at the other table be occupy by some syrian dignitary in flow robe -- row and row of stately look notable scant of speech and noisy at they food many of they seem hardly to know the use of knife and fork but they could all look as dignified as owl even when crowd in spaghetti with they finger we provide they with a sensation before the second course be finish a fine-looking syrian officer in khaki with the usual cloth flap behind he helmet that form a compromise between western smartness and eastern comfort stride into the room and bear down on we he invite we out into the corridor with a air that suggest we would better not refuse and we file out after he in a atmosphere of frigid disapproval mabel be honestly scared half out of she wit now not even the smile of the hotel proprietor in the doorway reassure she nor he deep bow as she pass she be even more scared if that be possible when two officer obviously of high rank come forward in the hall to greet she and one address she in arabic as colonel lawrence luckily one oil lamp per wall be do duty in place of electric light or there might have be a awkward incident she have presence of mind enough to disguise she alarm by a fit of cough bend nearly double and cover the lower part of she face with the end of the headdress fold over the officer have no time to waste and give they message to grim instead the emir feisul be astonished jimgrim that colonel lawrence and you should visit damascus without claim he hospitality we have two auto wait to take you to the palace well the luggage do not amount to much narayan singh bring that down in a jiffy and when i go to settle with the hotel-keeper one of the syrian officer interfere these be guest of the emir feisul he announce send the bill to I we be pile into the wait auto mabel grim and i ride in the first one with the syrian officer up beside the driver jeremy narayan singh and hadad follow and we go through the dark street like sea-monster splash over shoal unseen i think -- certainly unrecognized the street be almost desert and i do not catch sight of one armed man which be a thing to marvel at when you consider that fifty thousand or so be suppose to be concentrate in the neighborhood with conscription work full-blast and the foreign consul solely occupy in procure exemption for they national it be not my first visit to a reign prince for if you travel much in indium you be bind to come in contact with number of they so i naturally form a mental picture of what be in store for we make up from a mixture of memory of gwalior baroda bikanir hyderabad poona and baghdad of the arabian-night it just as naturally vanish in presence of the quiet latter-day dignity of the real thing the palace turn out to be a villa on the outskirts of the city no bigger and hardly more pretentious than a well-to-do commuter 's place at bronxville or mount vernon there be a short semi-circular drive in front with one sentry and one small lantern burning at each gate but they khaki uniform and puttee do not disguise the fact that the sentry be dark dyed-in-wool arab from the desert country and though they present arm they do it as man who make concession without pretend to admire such foolishness i would not have give ten cent for a unescorted stranger 's chance of get by they whatever he nationality surely there be never less formality in a king 's house since the world begin we be usher straight into a narrow rather ordinary hall and through that into a sitting-room about twenty foot square the light be from oil lamp hang by brass chain from the curved beam but the only other oriental suggestion be the cushion seat in each corner small octagonal table inlay with mother-of-pearl and a mighty good persian carpet narayan singh and jeremy supposedly be servant offer to stay in the hall but be tell that feisul would not approve of that whatever they should not hear can be say in another room be the explanation so we all sit down together on one of the corner seat and be keep wait about sixty seconds until feisul enter by a door in the far corner and when he come he take you breath away it always prejudice I against a man to be tell that he be dignified and stately those adjective smack of too much self-esteem and of a claim to be make of different clay from most of we he be both yet he be not either and he do not look like a priest although if ever integrity and righteousness shone from a man with they effect heighten by the severely simple arab robe i swear that man be he just about jeremy 's height and build -- rather tall and thin that be -- with a slight stoop forward from the shoulder due to thoughtfulness and camel-riding and a genuine intention not to hold he head too high he look like a shepherd in a bible picture only with good humor add that bring he forward out of a world of dream on to the same plane with you face to face -- understand meeting understanding -- man to man i wish i could describe he smile as he enter believe he be come to meet lawrence but it can not be do maybe you can imagine it if you bear in mind that this man be captain of a cause as good as lose hedge about by treason and well aware of it and that colonel lawrence be the one man in the world who have prove himself capable of bridge the division between east and west and make possible the arab dream of independence but unhappily it be easier to record unpleasant thing he know at the first glance -- even before she draw back the kuffiyus -- that mabel be not lawrence and i have never see a man more disappointed in all my wanderings the smile do not vanish he have too much pluck and self-control for that but you might say that iron enter into it as if for a second he be mock destiny willing to face all odds alone since he could not have he friend and he throw off disappointment like a man -- dismiss it as a rock shed water come forward briskly to shake hand with grim and bowing as grim introduce we at least here be two good friend he say in arabic sit down between grim and hadad tell I what this mean and why you deceive we about lawrence we have something to show you grim answer mr ticknor bring it otherwise it might have be see by the wrong people feisul take the hint and dismiss the syrian officer call they by they first name as he give they leave to go then mabel produce the letter and feisul read it cross one thin leg over the other and lean back easily but he sit forward again and laugh bitterly when he have read it twice over i do not write this i never see it before or hear of it he say simply i know that say grim but we think you would better look at it feisul lay the letter across he knee and pause to light a cigarette i think he be go to do what nine man out of ten in a tight place would certainly have do but he blow out the match and go on smoking you mean you government have see the thing and send you to confront I with it it be grim 's turn to laugh and he be jubilant without a trace of bitterness no the chief and i have risk we job by not report it this visit be strictly unofficial feisul hand the letter back to he and it be grim who strike a match and burn it after tear off the seal for a memento you know what it mean of course grim tread the ash into the carpet if the french could have come by that letter in jerusalem they would have dreyfuss you -- put you on trial for you life on trumped-up evidence they would send a swear copy of it to the british to keep they from take you part i be grateful to you for burn it feisul answer he do not look helpless hopeless or bewildered but dumb and clinging on like a man who hold a insecure footing against a hurricane it mean that the man all about you be traitor -- grim go on not all of they feisul interrupted but many of they answer grim you arab be loyal hot-head some of you syrian be dog whom anyone can hire it be straight speaking from a major in foreign service uninvited to a king it sound near the knuckle feisul take it quite pleasantly i know one from the other jimgrim grim get up and take a chair opposite feisul he be all work up and sweating at self-mastery hotter under the collar than i have ever see he it mean he go on with a hand on each knee and he strange eye fix steadily on feisul 's that the french be ready to attack you it mean they be sure of capture you person -- and bent on see you finish they 'll give you a drumhead court martial and make excuse afterward inshallah feisul answer mean if allah permit it that be exactly the right word grim explode and lord he be hard put to it to keep excitement within bound i could see he neck tremble and there be little bead of sweat on he temple it be grim at last without the mask on allah mark the destiny of all of we do you suppose we be here for nothing -- at this time feisul smile i be glad to see you he say simply be you plan to fight the french grim ask he suddenly in the sort of way that a man at close quarter let rip a upper-cut i must fight or yield they have send a ultimatum but delay it so as not to permit I time to answer it have expire already they be probably advance and you intend to sit here and wait for they i shall be at the front you know you have not a chance my adviser think that my presence at the front will encourage we man sufficiently to win the day have you a charm against mustard gas that be we weakness no we have no mask and the wind set up from the sea at this time of year you army be go straight into a trap and you along with it half of the man who advise you to go to the front will fight like lion against a net and the other half will sell you to the french you fifty thousand man will melt like butter in the sun and you arab cause will be leave without a leader feisul ponder that for about a minute lean back and watch grim 's face we hold a council of war jimgrim he say at last it be the unanimous opinion of the staff that we ought to fight and the cabinet uphold they i could not cancel the order if i wish what would you think of a king who leave he army in the lurch nobody will ever accuse you of cowardice grim answer you be a proven brave man if ever there be one the point be do you want all you bravery and hard work for the arab cause to go for nothing do you want the prospect of arab independence to go up in smoke on a gas-swept battlefield it would break my heart say feisul although one heart hardly matter it would break more heart than yours grim retort there be million look to you for leadership leave I out of it leave lawrence out of it and all the other non-moslem who have do they bit for you leave most of these syrian out of it for they be simply politician make use of you -- a mess of breed and creed so mixed and corrupt that they do not know which end up they stand if the syrian have gut they would have rally so hard to you long ago that no outsider would have have a chance what do you mean what be you propose feisul ask quietly baghdad be you place not damascus but here i be in damascus feisul retort and for the first time there be a note of impatience in he voice i come here at the request of the ally on the strength of they promise i do not ask to be king i would rather not be let any man be ruler whom the arab choose and i will work for he loyally but the arab choose I and the ally consent it be only after they have win they war with we help that the french begin raise objection and the british desert I it be too late to talk of baghdad now it be not it be too soon grim answer bring down a clenched fist on he knee and feisul laugh in spite of himself you talk like a prophet jimgrim but let I tell you something it be mainly a question of money after all the british pay we a subsidy until they withdraw from syrium they do they best for we even then for they leave behind gun ammunition wagon and supplies when the french seize the port they promise to continue the subsidy because they be collect the custom due and we have no other revenue worth mention but rather than send we money the french have tell we people not to pay tax so we treasury be empty nevertheless we contrived by one means and another we arrange a bank credit and order supplies from abroad the supplies have reach beirut but the french have order the bank to cancel the credit and until we pay for the supplies they be withhold any gas mask among the supplies you order grim ask he and feisul nod that banker have play fast and loose with we until the last minute rely on we undertaking not to molest foreigner he have reside in damascus make promise one day and break they the next keep he fund in beirut and he agency here drain money out of the country all the while why do not you arrest he we give we word to the french that he should have complete protection and immunity it seem a good thing to we to have such a influential banker here he have international connection as recently as yesterday twenty minute before that ultimatum come he be in this room assure I that he would be able to solve the credit difficulty within a day or two would you like to send for he now suggest grim i doubt if he would come well have he fetch feisul shake he head if other people break they promise that be no reason why we should break ours if we can defeat the french and force they to make other term then we will expel he from syrium i leave at midnight jimgrim to defeat the french you go to you waterloo you be in check with only one move possible and i be here to make you realize it you be a man after my own heart feisul but you and you arab be child at deal with these foreign exploiter they can beat you at every game but honesty and listen : if you do defeat the french -- if you drive they into the sea tomorrow they would get away with all the money in beirut and you would still be at the mercy of foreign capitalist instead of a independent arab kingdom here you would have a mixture of people and religion all plot against one another and you with capitulation and foreign consul get in the way and bond-holding banker sit on top of it all like the old man of the sea in the story of sindbad the sailor leave that to the french let they have all syrium to stew in go to england where you friend be let the politician alone meet real folk and talk with they tell they the truth for they do not know it talk with the man and woman who

twist the politician ' tail you 'll find yourself in baghdad within a year or two with all mesopotamium to make a garden of and none but arab to deal with that be you field feisul smile with the air of a man who recognize but be unconvinced there be always thing that might have be he answer as it be i can not desert the army we 'll save what we can of the army grim answer you syrian will save they own skin it be only the arab we have get to look out for -- a line of retreat for the arab regiment and another for you it be not too late and you know i be right come on let 's get busy and do it feisul 's smile be all affection and approval but he shake he head if what you say be true i should only have the same problem in mesopotamium -- foreign financier he answer that be exactly where you be wrong grim retorted triumphantly he stand up and point at jeremy here be a man who own a gold-mine it lie between mesopotamium and you father 's kingdom of the hedjaz and its exact whereabouts be a secret he be here tonight to make you a present of the mine and here 's another man -- he point at I -- a mining expert who 'll tell you what the thing 's worth it be yours if you 'll agree to abandon syrium and lay a course for baghdad chapter xiv you 'll be a virgin victim feisul be interested he could not help be and he be utterly convince of grim 's sincerity but he be not move from he purpose and not even jeremy 's account of the gold-mine or my professional opinion of its value have the least effect toward cancel the plan he have in mind he be deeply affect by the offer but that be all good heaven man grim explode suddenly surely you will not throw the whole world into war again you know what it will mean if the french kill or imprison you there be not a moslem of all the million in asia who will not swear vengeance against the west -- you know that a direct descendant of mohammed and the first outstanding conquer moslem since saladin -- the ally should have think of that before they break promise say feisul never mind they damn they answer grim it be up to you the future of civilization be in you lap this minute can not you see that if you lose you 'll be a martyr and islam will rise to avenge you inshallah say feisul nodding but that if you let pride go by the board and seem to run away there 'll be a breathing spell asia would wonder for a few month and do nothing until it begin to dawn on they that you have act wisely and have a better plan in view i be not proud except of my nation feisul answer i would not let pride interfere with policy but it be too late to talk of this which be better grin demand a martyr the very mention of whose name mean war or a live power for peace under a temporary cloud i be afraid i be a poor host forgive I feisul answer dinner have be wait all this while and you have a lady with you this be disgraceful he rise and lead the way into another room close the discussion we eat a ordinary meal in a ordinary dining room feisul preside and talk triviality with mabel and hadad there be a occasional boisterous interlude by jeremy but even he with he tale of unknown arabium could not lift the load of depression grim and i sit silent through the meal i experience the sensation that you get when a expedition prove a failure and you have get to go home again with nothing do -- all dreary emptiness but grim be hatch something as you could tell by the far-away expression and the glowering light in he eye he look about ready for murder narayan singh 's face all through the meal be a picture -- delight and pride at dine with a king amazement at he karma that have bring a sepoy of the line to hear such confidence first hand chagrin over grim 's apparent failure and desire to be inconspicuous controlled he expression in turn once or twice he try to make conversation with I but i be in no mood for it be a grouchy old bear on occasion without decent manners feisul excuse himself the minute the meal be over say he have a conference to attend and we all go back into the sitting-room where grim take the chair he occupy before and marshal we into a row on the seat in front of he he be back again in form -- electric -- and self-controlled have you folk get the hang of this he ask do you realize what it mean if feisul go out and get scupper we think we do even if we do not i do not suppose anyone except the few who like grim have make a life-study of the problem of islam in all its bearing could quite have grasp it mabel have a viewpoint that serve grim 's purpose as well as any at the moment that man 's too good and much too good-looking to be waste she say emphatically d'you suppose that if colonel lawrence be really here -- half a minute say grim and i 'll come to that how about you hadad how far would you go to save feisul from this waterloo i would go a long way he answer cautiously what do you intend to appear near the firing-line for one thing with somebody who look like colonel lawrence and somebody else who look enough like feisul in one of feisul 's car and give the french a run for it in one direction while feisul escape in the other wallahus but what if feisul will not go he 'll get help do you ever hear what they do to napoleon at waterloo seize he bridle and gallop away with he you mean i be to act lawrence again ask mabel look deathly white grim nod who be cast for feisul jeremy inquire you be you be the only trained stage-actor in the bunch you be he height -- not unlike he figure -- i resemble he as much as a kangaroo look like a ostrich laugh jeremy you be talk wild jim what have you have to drink how about you ramsden will you see this through jeremy shake he head at I i believe he think for the moment that grim have go mad he have not the experience of grim that i have and consequently not the same confidence in grim 's ability to dream catch the essence of the dream pin it down and make a fact of it i 'll go the limit say i well i 'll be damned laugh jeremy all right same here i stake a gold-mine and rammy raise I fetch you crown and sceptre and i 'll play king to jim 's ace in a royal straight flush mabel 's queen hadad 's a knave he look it keep smile hadad old top and i 'll let you forgive I rammy 's the ten-spot -- tentative -- tenacious -- ten ace up he sleeve -- and pack a ten-ton wallop when you get he go what be narayan singh the deuce the joker answer grim be you in on this sahib there be no need to ask what you honor find good enough -- you honor 's order -- order have nothing to do with it we be not in british territory this in unofficial i have no right to give you order say grim you be free to refuse i be likely to lose my job over this and so be you if you take part in it narayan singh grin hugely hah a sepoy 's position be a smaller stake than a major 's commission or a gold-mine but i likewise have a life to lose and i play too grim nod curtly it be no time for return compliment how about you mabel we can manage this without you and you have a husband to think of -- if he be here he would hate it but he would give permission all right now hadad what about it be i to obey you absolutely not know what the -- grim interrupted he : the proposal 's fair either you withdraw now and hold you tongue or come in with we if you be in i 'll tell the detail if not there be no need wallahus what a sword-blade you be jimgrim if i say ` yes ' i risk my future on you backgammon board if i say ` no ' my life be worth a millieme for you will tell that sikh you call the ` joker ' to attend to I not so grim answer if you do not like the plan i 'll trust you to fall out and keep the secret oh in that case answer hadad hesitate since you put it that way well it be lose all or perhaps win something -- half-measure be no good -- the alternative be ruin of the arab cause -- it be a forlorn hope -- well one throw of the dice eh -- and all we fortune on the table -- one little mistake and hela -- finish never mind yes i will play too i will play this to the end with you so we be all set remark grim with a sigh of relief instantly he throw he shoulder back and begin to set he piece for the game and you know there be a world of difference between the captain of a side who do not worry until the game begin and grim 's sort who do they worrying beforehand and then play and make the whole side play for every ounce that be in they mabel you be lawrence keep silent be shy avoid encounter -- act like a man who be not suppose to be here but who come to help feisul contrary to express command lay on he by the foreign office get that lawrence be a shy man anyway -- hate publicity rank anything that call attention to himself the more shy you be the easier you 'll get away with it feisul must help pretend you be lawrence the presence of lawrence would add to he prestige incalculably and i think he 'll see that but if not never mind we 'll manage any question quick you can not ask question when you be give that sort of opportunity the right one do not occur to you and the other seem absurd grim know that of course but when you be deal with a woman there be just one chance in a hundred that she may think of something vital that have not occur to anybody else most woman be not practical but it be the impractical thing that happen suppose we be capture by the french she suggest that be what be go to happen he answer when they have get you then you be mr mabel ticknor who never see lawrence and would not recognize he if you do they 'll ask why i be wear man 's clothes and masquerade as a arab well you be a woman be not you you answer with another question -- ask they just how safe a woman would be they may claim that they algerian be baby-lamb but they can not blame you for not believe it anything else she shake she head and he turn on hadad hadad lose no opportunity of whisper that lawrence be with feisul add that lawrence do not want he presence know hunt out two or three loyal arab on the staff and tell they the plan be to kidnap feisul and carry he to safety across the border but do not do it too soon wait until the debacle begin and then persuade a few of they -- old alus for instance and osman -- choose the old guard -- you and they bolt with he to haifa the syrian have be thoroughly undermine by propaganda gas will do the rest and as soon as the arab see the syrian run they 'll listen to reason they know you and know you be on the level do you understand will you do that i will try i see many a chance of spilling before this cup come to the drinking jimgrim then carry it carefully grim answer ramsden take that car you come in find that banker he be the boy who have buy feisul 's staff or i be much mistaken bring he here suppose he will not come bring he take jeremy with you try diplomacy first tell he that a plot to kidnap feisul have be discover at the last minute but give he to understand that no suspicion rest on he get he if you can to send a message to the french general staff warn they to watch for feisul and two civilian and lawrence in a auto after that bring he if you have to put he in a sack what be he name and where do he live adolphe rene everybody know he house jeremy look as unlike feisul as you can until the time come but study the part and be ready to jump into he clothes narayan singh stay with I you and i will do the dirty work get busy ramsden circumstance work clock-fashion wheel fitting into wheel when those tide that shakespeare speak of be at flood disregard all the theory and argument about human will as oppose to cosmic law i say this without any care at all who contradict I : that whoever be near the hub of happening be the agent of universal law and can no more help himself than can the watch that tell the hour the man who believe that they make history should really make a thoughtful fellow laugh the move finger write and have writ move on the old tentmaker omar know the truth of it you could almost hear the balance-wheel of progress click as the door open before grim have finish speaking and a staff officer appear to invite he to be present at feisul 's conference grim ask at once for the auto for I -lrb- i could not have have it otherwise -rrb- and a moment later jeremy and i be scoot into darkness through narrow street and driving rain with the hub of the wheel awash in place and ship it green over the floor when we dip and pitch over a cross-street gutter the arab driver know the way from which i take it he have a compass in he head as well as a charm against accident and a spirit of recklessness that put faith in worn-out spring there be not room for more than one set of wheel at a time in most of the street we tear through but a camel try to share one fairway with we and have the worst of it he cannon off into a alley ` himd end first and we could hear he bellow with rage a block away and we manner of stop be like we progress prompt the brake - band go on with a shriek and jeremy and i pitch forward as the car bring up against the curb in front of a enormous door whose brass knocker shine like gold in the ray of we headlight we tell the arab to wait for we and step knee-deep into a pool invisible stumble and nearly fall over a great stone set to bridge the flood between street and door then proceed to use the knocker importunately thunderously angrily as man with wet foot and bruised toe likely will whatever the custom of the country we go on knock take turn until the door open at last and the banker 's servant peer at we with a candle in he hand demand to know in the name of the thousand and one devil whom solomon boil in oil what impudent scavenger be make all that noise but the banker himself be in the background think perhaps that the french have come already on the lookout over the servant 's shoulder for a glimpse of a kepi so we put we shoulder to the door thrust by the servant and walk in take care i have a pistol in my hand say the banker 's voice three shot for a shilling at I then retort jeremy who be you tell that shiver fool to bring the candle and you 'll see oh you be it i tell you to come in the morning i can not see you now can not see I eh come in here and peel you eye cocky sit down and look at we there take a pew wonder where i learn such good english well i use to shine the toenail of the prince o ' wale and you have to pass a civil service examination before they give you that good job i talk any language except french and jewish but this master of mine turn out to be a jew who talk french and not a prizefighter after all what do i tell you this evening say he be a spy for the french do not i i tell you i be a dependable man what i say you can bet on till you have lose all you money here he be spy to beat the promised-lander -- just have tea with feisul and learn all the inside fact -- offer I a pound to come and find you but i charge he two and get the money in advance you ought to pay I a commission too and then i 'll get marry if there be a honest woman leave in damascus if either of you want my advice you will not believe a word the other say but i expect you be both too wilful to be guide anyhow you 'll have to talk in front of I because my master be afraid of be murder he be not afraid of ghost or bad smell but the sight of a long knife turn he heart to water and set he to pray so loud that you can not get a word in edgewise go on both of you -- yallum talk do it begin to be obvious why king use to employ court jester the modern cabinet should have they -- man like jeremy -lrb- though they would be hard to find -rrb- to break the crust of situation suspicion weaken in the presence of incongruity this fellow seem less than half-witted i say but he be shrewd and i have find he useful unfortunately he have pick up a lot of information so we 'll have to keep a eye on he my business be to communicate with the french general staff and i be tell you know how to manage it huh-huh who tell you that those who give I my instruction if you do not know who they be without my tell you you be the wrong man and i 'll not waste time with you let we suppose that i know then proceed you name be give to I as that of a man who can be trust to take necessary action in the interest of er you understand uh-huh the plot for feisul to be kidnap by some syrian member of he staff have be discover at the last minute i say look hard at he and he wince palpably mon dieu you mean -- that it be not too late to save the situation you have not be accuse of connection with it i come here in pursuance of a different plan to kidnap he -- a sort of reserve plan to be employ in case other means should fail all arrangement be in work order except the one item of communicate with the french general staff i require you to accompany I for that purpose and to send off to they immediately a message at my dictation tschaa suppose you show I you authority certainly i answer realize that he be not in immediate danger of life he have return he own pistol to he pocket so i show he the muzzle of mine and he divine without a sermon on the subject that it would go off and shoot accurately unless he show discretion he do not offer to move when jeremy 's agile finger find he pocket and flick out the mother-of - pearl-handled rim-fire thing with which he have previously keep he courage warm i be tell not to trust you too far i explain i be warn in advance that you might question my credentials you be say to be jealous of interference as a precaution against miscarriage of this plan through jealousy on you part i be order to oblige you to obey I and if i refuse you widow will then be the individual most concerned be good enough to take pen and paper and write a letter to my dictation jeremy go to the door which be partly open make sure that the servant be out of earshot and slam it tight rene the banker go to he escritoire take paper and shake he fountain pen how shall i commence the letter he ask I with a dry sly smile he think he have I there there be doubtless proper form of address that serve to establish the genuineness of letter write by a spy commence half-way down the page i answer we 'll insert the address afterwards write in french : i shall accompany the emir feisul and colonel lawrence to the front tonight former plan have miscarry when syrian retreat begin look out for automobile contain feisul and lawrence which may be recognize easily as it will also contain myself and another civilian in plain clothes at the psychological moment a white flag will be show from it wave perhaps surreptitiously by one of the civilian in the event of breakdown of the automobile a horsed vehicle will be use and the same signal will apply for the sake of myself and the other civilian please instruct all officer to keep a sharp lookout and protect the party from be fire on there i say sign that and address it he hesitate he could not doubt that he own arrangement with traitor on the staff to kidnap feisul have go amiss else how should i be aware of they at all -- i who have only arrive that evening in damascus but it puzzle he to know why i should make he write the letter or since he plan must have fail why i should let he share in the kidnapping he smell the obvious rat why do not i sign the letter myself and get all the credit afterward as any other spy would do you sign it he say push the letter toward I and i get one of those sudden inspiration that there be no explain -- the right idea for handle fox rene the banker so you be afraid to sign that be you all right give it here i 'll sign it pass I you pen but you 'll come along with I tonight my lad and make you explanation to the french in the morning look back i can see how the accusation work although it be a arrow shot at a venture he greasy sly fox face with its touch of bold impudence betray he for a man who would habitually hedge he bet feisul 's safe-conduct have protect he from official interference but it have need more than that to preserve he from unofficial murder and beyond a doubt he have betray the french in minor way whenever that course look profitable now in a crisis he have small choice but to establish himself as loyal to the stronger side he hurriedly write a number at the bottom of the letter and another follow by three capital and three more figure at the top seal it up and send it -- quick i order he he obey and jeremy call the servant summon francoi say the banker and the servant disappear again francois must remain a mystery he be insoluble dress in a pair of baggy turkish pants with a red sash round he middle knotted loosely over a woollen jersey that have wide horizontal black and yellow strip with a gray woollen shawl over the lot and a new tarboosh a size or two too small for he perch at a angle on he head he stand shift from one bare foot to the other and move a toothless gap in he lower face in what be presumably a smile he have no nose that you could recognize although there be two blow - hole in place of nostril with a hideous long scar above they one ear be miss he have no eyebrow but the remain ear be point at the top like a satyr 's and he little beady eye be as black as a bird 's and inhumanly bright the banker speak to he in the voice you would use to a rather spoilt child when obedience be all-important use arabic with a few french word throw in ah here be francois good francoi francoi mon brave here be a letter eh you know where to take it -- eh ha-ha francoi know do not he francoi do not talk he tell nobody he be wise be francoi he run eh he run through the rain and the night and he hide so that nobody can see he and he deliver the letter and somebody give francoi money and tobacco and a little rum and francoi come run back to the nice little dark little hole where he sleep plenty to eat eh francois nice soft food that need no chewing nothing to do but run with a letter now and then eh a brave fellow be francoi -- a clever fellow -- a trustworthy fellow -- a dependable willing fellow always ready to please ready to go well there be the letter be careful with it and run-run-run like a good boy a whole bottle of rum when you come back -- think of it a whole bottle of nice brown rum to yourself in that nice little room where you bed be there goodbye the creature address as francoi vanish with a snort and a sort of squeal that may have be mean for speech that be the best messenger in syrium say rene he be priceless -- incorruptible silent and as sure as destiny the french general staff will have that letter before dawn now -- what next you come with I i answer he feel better now that the message be on its way second thought convinced he of my connection with the french there be no more profitless delusion than to suppose that a country 's secret agent be always its own national they be almost always not if the french use only frenchmen germany use none but german great britain only englishman and so on it might be prettier and easier for the police but intelligence department would starve so there be nothing about a obvious american do spy-work for the french that should stick in he craw and that be so the more cheerfully he aid I the better it would likely be for he so he call for the servant again and prove himself a good campaigner by superintend the packing of a big basket with provision -- bread and butter cold chicken wine olive and hot coffee in a thermos bottle the french will be in damascus by noon tomorrow he say ha-ha those french and they hungry algerian we do well to take a good provision with we -- enough for two day at least we shall enter with they i suppose or at least behind they and of course my house here will receive consideration but -- ha-ha -- how many chicken do you believe will be purchasable in damascus one hour after the first algerian get here eh put in another chicken hassan mon brave eh bien oui -- pack the basket full put in more of everything at last he get into a overcoat line with fox-pelt for the night air be chilly and a overcoat be less trouble than blanket if you expect to spend a night on the move we heave the huge basket into the wait auto slam the front door of the house behind we pile into the back seat and be off i shall be glad when this business be over say rene with a sigh of satisfaction i be a banker by profession for I the ebb and flow of trade with its certainty and its discretion but what would you trade must be prepare for door that will not open must be force those who stand in the way must be thrust aside this feisul be a impossible fellow he be a hypocrite i tell you -- one of those prater about righteousness who will not understand that the church and the mosque be the place for that sort of thing eh you follow I but tell I what have be do to daulch hattin and aubek be they back against a wall and shot who betray they too bad that such a plan should fail for it be perfect far from perfect i answer for that one piece of strategy i have by heart -- the way to make a man tell all he know be to pretend to superior knowledge heh how could you improve on it three member of the staff to order sauve-qui-peut unexpectedly seize feisul and deliver he dead or alive what be better than that but what have be do to the three nothing i answer just like he just like he i tell you that man feisul would rather be a martyr than succeed at he proper business we reach the palace just as feisul be leave it several member of he staff be hard on he heel in the porch and we party be behind they again with mabel last of all there be a line of wait auto nearly long enough to fill the drive but a utter absence of military fuss and no shout or hurry it look in the dark more like a funeral than the departure of a king to join he army at the front i remain in the car with the banker and send jeremy to report we doings to grim presently i could see he stand under the porch lamp with a hand on grim 's shoulder and i lean out over the auto door to watch but rene the banker lean back snuggle up in he overcoat liking neither to be see nor to get he skin wet i expect to see the three staff officer daulch hattin and aubek arrest there and then but nothing happen except that feisul suddenly drive away with mabel and grim in the same car with he there follow a rush for the other car and the whole line start forward jeremy jump in as we car pass the porch daulch hattin and aubek be at the front he say and begin hum to himself at the front demand rene sit upright suddenly at the front you say when do they leave for the front this evening answer jeremy you could not see he face in the dark but i think he be chuckle strange say the banker yet you say they have be betray -- they plan be know -- yet they leave for the front this evening it be pitch-dark inside the car for the rain swish down in torrent and jeremy fasten the flap after he get in rene 's change of expression be a thing that you could feel not see he keep perfect silence for about two minute while the car skid and bump at the rear of the procession then : you tell I that feisul know and yet oh i do not tell you that laugh jeremy it be this other man who say so i never deceive anyone i be a honest fellow i be remember i warn you against he when we talk in the hotel you can not blame I i tell you he be up to mischief i advise you to keep a careful eye on he and to look twice at he paper wallah you must be a lamb in foxskin my master be a wolf in a woolly overcoat wait till you have see he eat that chicken that you bring and then you 'll know what kind of a man he be you see you should have give I money when i ask you for it i be a fellow with a price i be whoever pay my price get he money 's worth if you would have the sense to pay I more than this man do i would have help you trick he instead of help he trick you but he give I my wages before dinner and you give I nothing so here you be and i would not like to be keep you pair of trousers warm i tell you this ramsden effendi be a awful fellow who will stick at nothing and i be worse because i be honest and do what i be pay to do i take the precaution of put my arm around rene for it be likely that he have another weapon hide somewhere and the obvious thing for he to do be to shoot the two of we and make a bolt for it for a second i think i feel he hand move but it be jeremy 's search all he pocket and feeling for hide steel so i pull out a cigar and light a match of course anyone 's face look ghastly by that sort of sudden light but rene 's be a picture of hate rage baffle cunning and fear such as i have never see he eye look like a animal 's at bay and the way he lip part from he tooth convey the impression that he be search he mind wildly for a desperate remedy that would ruin all concerned except himself but it be only a stale old recourse that he have in a man 's extremity he turn by instinct to he own tin god for help and you may read he whole heart and religion then very well very well he say as if he be on the rack speak hurriedly to get it over with i make the sacrifice you will find my money in a inner vest pocket underneath my vest it be a life 's savings take it and let I go it be not much -- only a little -- i be not a rich man -- i have hope to be but it would mean a fortune to you no doubt take it and be merciful give I back the smaller packet of the two keep the larger and let I go out of curiosity i reach inside he vest and pull out both packet jeremy strike a match the smaller packet contain a draft on pari for a quarter of a million franc the larger hold nothing but correspondence i return they to he listen i say i have never yet murder a man so if you provide I with another excuse for murder you you 'll be a virgin victim keep that in mind chapter xv catch the alfy nap and kick hell out of 'em you be no doubt familiar with the fact that the account give by two man who have witness a battle from the same angle will differ widely not only in minor detail but in fundamental so you will not look to I for confirmation of any one of the countless story that have see the light of print pretend to explain how the french win damascus so easily and unexpectedly i be only on the inside look outward as it be the fellow on the outside look in would naturally give a different explanation then you must bear in mind that this be a day of official account that would make a limp dog of anania when the general staff of a invade army control all the wire and all line of communication you may believe what they choose to tell you if you wish but you do not have to as they say in maine and i admit that all i saw be from a curtained auto as we sway and bump over broken road with a occasional interlude when jeremy and i get out to lend we shoulder and help the arab driver heave the car out of a slough my clearest memory be of that arab -- silent stolid stare like a owl straight forward most of the time -- but a perfect marvel in emergency when he would suddenly spring to life swear a living streak of brimstone blasphemy in high falsetto and perform a driver 's miracle by two hour after midnight we be run on four flat tire and i have get the name of the maker of those wheel for future reference and use one spring break but we go forward sailor-fashion with a jury - rig of chain and rope after get more gas from some christian monk who swear they have not any and weep when one of feisul 's officer demonstrate that they have you could not see any monastery i do not even know that there be one -- nothing but lean face with tonsured top that nod in unison and lie fearfully the gunfire begin to be heavy about that time although nothing like the thousand-throated bedlam of flander as neither side could see the other and neither have any range mark my guess be that the french be advertise they advance -- do a little propaganda that be cheap for all concerned except the tax-payer and the syrian army be shoot back crazily send over long shot on the off chance more to encourage themselves than for any other reason the sensation be rather like ride in a ambulance away from the battle instead of toward it for you could not see anything and you have a sense of helpless detachment from it all as if a power you could not control be carry you away from a familiar destiny to one that you could not imagine it be not so much like a dream as like a different real existence that you could not understand because it bear no kind of relation to anything in the past anyhow we bump and blunder on until dawn come streak with wonderful rolling mist and give a glimpse at interval of a wide plain sloping toward the west with long line of infantry and here and there gun extend across it in parallel draw north and south the rifle firing start ten minute after dawn and it be all over in less than half a hour but i can not describe exactly how the finish come because the wind be toward we and the morning mist blow along in blanket white mass that only allow you a momentary glimpse and then shut off the view we be about a mile behind the firing-line and i could not see feisul 's car or any of the other for the moment there be just one clear line of vision straight from where i sit to the nearest infantry i could see about fifty yard of the line and perhaps that many man and they be blaze away furiously over a low earthwork although i could not see a sign of the french there be hardly any artillery firing at that time suddenly without any obvious reason the man whose back i be watch break and run the mist obscure they instantly and the line of vision shift so that bit by bit i see i dare say a mile of the firing line the whole lot be run for they life and look where i would there be not a sign of a frenchman anywhere i should say it take about ten minute for the first of they to reach the dirt road where we auto stand hub-deep in mud and by that time we have shove and pulley-hauled they into movement we engine make as much row as a nest of machine-gun as they struggle against the strain we do not want to be swamp under that tide of fugitive but they take no notice of we they have throw away they weapon and be run for home with eye distended and nothing in mind but to put distance between there and the enemy i jump out of the car and seize one man what be you run from what have happen i demand hold he harder the more he struggle poison gas he gasp and i let he go i think i catch a whiff of the darned stuff then but that may have be imagination poison gas i say return to the car and rene make a fine exhibition of himself smother he head under the foxlined overcoat and scream he get right down on the floor of the car and lay there huddle and gasp -- which may have be a sensible precaution i do not know there be no time just then to bother with he the flukey morning breeze shift several point the mist curl suddenly and begin to flow diagonally across we line of car instead of toward we and from one moment to the next you could see straight along the road for maybe a mile or more there be a sight worth see -- feisul 's cavalry in full rout -- run away from ghost by the look of it -- they formation hardly yet broken horse and man racing with the wind and a scattering of unhorsed fugitive streaming behind like a comet 's tail accord to grim who should know that cavalry division be the kingpin of feisul 's plan he have intend to lead a raid in person swoop down the french flank to they rear but the three staff traitor daulch hattin and aubck send forward the previous evening to place the division and hold it ready have simply tip the french off to the whole plan and at the critical moment of feisul 's arrival on the scene have order the sauve-qui-peut i do not believe the french use more than a can or two of gas i do not believe they have more than a few can of it so far advanced but the sauve-qui-peut might have be useless without feisul 's capture for he be just the man to rally a route army and snatch victory out of a defeat nobody know better than feisul the weakness of the french communication and the work of those three traitor be only half do when the cavalry take to its heel the one man who could possibly save the day have to be bag and hand over i do not realize all that of course in the twinkling of a eye as they say you do in a climax maybe i have never face a climax i be no psychologist and not at all give to review of sudden situation in the abstract there be a fight or a riot or something like it go on near the head of we line of auto the first two or three have come to a standstill several in the middle of the line be try to wheel outward and bolt for it behind the flee cavalry and those at the tail end be block by one that have break down of course everybody be yell at the top of he lung and the hurry shred of blow mist further confound the confusion so jeremy and i run forward plunge through the mud and knock over whoever block we way it be rather fun -- like the football field at school but one man -- a syrian officer -- stand near the last of the forward car with the evident purpose of stand off interference he take careful aim at I with a revolver fire point-blank and miss i forget all about my own pistol and go for he with a laugh and a yell of sheer exhilaration there be a eighth of a ton of I mostly bone and muscle so it be not a sinecure to have to stop my fist when the rest of the bulk be under way behind it i land so hard on he nose and with such tremendous impetus that he have not enough initial stability to take the impact and bring I up on my foot he go down like a ninepin i on top of he laugh with mud in my tooth and jeremy land on top of the two of we hold the skirt of he cloak in both hand as he jump jeremy pick up the fellow 's revolver and throw it out of sight and the two of we run on again -- too late by now to help in the emergency but in time for the next event grim have manage everything although he be bleed and smile serenely through the blood hadad be there not smile at all but bleached white with excitement he have bring a number of arab officer with he six or seven of whom be stand on the running - board of the front car and all argue with feisul who sit back with he foot and hand tie guard by narayan singh at grim 's foot -- dead with bullet through they head -- be three syrian staff officer they be the traitor daulch hattin and aubek grim 's pistol be in he right hand and have be use there have be a first-class fight all over in two minute for the traitor have not arrive on the scene without assistant unfortunately for they hadad have turn up at the same moment with he loyalist narayan singh have jump from the car behind and seize feisul throw he to the floor out of the path of bullet and tie he arm it be actually mabel hardly realize what she be do but obey the sikh 's order yell in she ear as he struggle to keep he wiry prisoner down who tie the king 's foot use she arab girdle feisul of course be all for die at the head of a remnant of he man that would be the first impulse of any decent leader in like circumstance but he loyal friend eager to die with he if they must but unwilling to die at all if there be a alternative be overwhelming he with stream of word and promise suddenly two of they jump into the car and begin to untie he arm and foot grim look swiftly to right and leave saw jeremy and pounce on he so fiercely that a onlooker might have guess another fight to the death be under way too excited to say what he have in mind he tug at jeremy 's clothes i get you jim -- i get you jeremy laugh gaily and in ten seconds have strip himself down to he underwear hadad must have be discuss detail of the plan with grim along the road for he get busy at the same time persuade feisul to part with he garment -- not that he consent really matter at the moment they be pull off he by half a dozen hand at once and jeremy have the best of that bargain all right for in addition to silk headdress and a fine black arab full-dress coat there be linen of a sort you can not buy -- better stuff than bishop wear and clean which jeremy 's own be not the time it take to read this give a totally false impression of the speed the whole thing take place i should say within two minute from the time when i punch that syrian 's nose until mabel and narayan singh stand beside I watch hadad two more arab and feisul drive away with a second car crowd full of loyalist in close attendance by that time jeremy be dress in feisul 's clothes and though he do not look a bit like feisul from a yard away in the mist at ten yard provide you be look for feisul you would have take you bible oath he be the man for he have the gesture and mannerism copy to perfection however stand there be not go to increase the real feisul 's chance of escape the sooner we get catch the quicker the french would discover that we man have give they the slip we business be to give the french a long chase in the wrong direction and those bog auto be not ideal for the purpose but they be the only means in sight just then and we have to bear in mind that message i have make rene send warn the french to look out for a auto with a white flag and two civilian together with feisul and lawrence so we pick out the two best that remain pitched rene and he basket of provision into the front one with mabel and jeremy pile narayan singh in after they to take my place as the second civilian and start they off straight forward grim and i follow in a second car after i have pay we former arab driver handsomely and send he off grin to give a lift to as many runaway as the car would hold we learn afterward that the rascal make a fortune charge as much as fifty pound sterling for the trip halfway back to damascus at which point the car collapse they say he carry eleven officer that far buy two wife with the proceeds and escape all the way to a village near mecca where he home be you know how bewildering and tricky those early mist be when they start to roll up before the wind we have hardly get go when the whole mass seem to shift in one great cloud cover the flee troops and incidentally feisul but leave we in we two auto high and dry as it be in full view of the french and they be advance by that time i could not see more than a division of they that we would have to reckon with -- nearly all algerian -- and they look dead-weary i guess they have force the pace in advance of the main body in order to take advantage of the treason of feisul 's officer they come slouch forward with they rifle at the trail and a screen of skirmisher throw out a quarter of a mile or so ahead there be cavalry and gun far off on they right evidently try to work around to the flank of the flee array but those be much too far away to trouble we and be go in the wrong direction roll bank of mist shut off the farther view to westward and there be no guess where the main french force might be and for all i know it have not start from the coast yet fortune come to we rescue with one riderless horse a splendid arab gelding tie by the bridle to the wheel of a water-cart and leave behind in the stampede jeremy appropriate it ride arab fashion with short stirrup and i would not have blame feisul 's own brother for falsely identify he at ten yard he be bear mischievous and he caricature feisul on horseback as if he be act for the movie i guess the french officer have good glass with they for jeremy have hardly mount when the advance algerian open a hot fire on we the whole division surely would not have blaze away with machine-gun and all at two car and a man on horseback unless someone have pass the word along that feisul be in full view so grim and i abandon we car driver and all and jump into jeremy 's place it be not more than two hundred yard to the top of a gentle rise over which we disappear from view and just as we bump over it i wrench out the white tablecloth in which rene 's chicken and stuff be wrap and wave it violently then lord what a sight below we sheltered between two flanking hillock be about a division of feisul 's arab infantry pack up sulkily prepare to follow the retreat it be a safe bet the french do not know they be there and i dare say the same thought occur to every one of we the same instant mabel thought of it i know i do but jeremy voice it first heel he horse up beside we what do you say jim i bet you i can rally that gang shall i lead 'em and lick hell out of the algy but grim shake he head you might but the game be to pull the plug properly get this lot on the run the less fight the less risk of drasticism when the french get to damascus chase 'em off home so jeremy do it and that i believe account for a story that get in the newspaper about feisul try to spring a surprise on the french at the last minute some french officer in armored car come over the brow of the hill in pursuit of we -- three car three officer three machine-gun and about a dozen man one car quit on the hill-top so i suppose it break down but its occupant must have see jeremy career up and down the line encourage those sulky arab to get a move on and i suppose they tell tale afterwards to a newspaper correspondent at the base anyhow the two pursue armored car do not dare come near enough to be dangerous until we have follow the retreat arab regiment for about a mile and the algerian appear over the hill-top come very slowly a long-range rifle-fire commence the arab return it scrappily as they retreat and we make believe there be other regiment to be shepherd steer a northward course downhill toward broken ground that could not have suit we purpose better by the way those armored car come after we keep they distance it be clear enough that they suspect a ambush so we have a clear start and lead they a dance in and out among boulder and the branch of a watercourse jeremy gallop ahead to spy a course out whenever they come in view we act a little piece for they make rene wave the white cloth while i protect he and hold off mabel and grim who go through the motion of try to brain I with pistol butt two or three time they open fire more by way of force a surrender i think than with any intention of hit we they want to take feisul alive it be like a game of fox and goose and with jeremy scout ahead we could have keep they dodge we for hour if we have not run out of gas then we abandon the car and take refuge in a cave that stink as if it have be a tomb for generation the french draw up they car fifty yard away with machine-gun cover the cave mouth and after we be sure they be not go to squirt a stream of lead at we i go out with the tablecloth to negotiate term i do not want to go but grim seem to think they would understand my french of course there be not anything really to argue about but i play for time because every minute be of value to the real feisul speeding on he way to british territory the french officer who do the talk for he side -- a little squat pale pug-faced fellow who give the impression of have rise from the rank without learn polite manners on the way agree to accept we surrender and spare we life for the time be and by that time the smell in the cave have nearly overcome we party so they all march out and lord the french captain be spiteful when he discover that jeremy be not feisul after all he swear like a wet cat accuse mabel of be a spy take away we basket of provision and i think would have shoot jeremy out of hand if jeremy have not start clowning and make the other frenchman laugh laughter and murder no more mix than oil and water he do what he call a harem dance for they misuse he stomach outrageously and the incongruity of that by a descendant of the prophet take all the sting out of the situation but they burn we abandon car in sheer ill temper before crowd we into they own and they shoot the good horse the joy-ride that follow be rather like the kind they give pig on the way to the sausage shop -- hurry and not intend to be mirthful what be the use of lose temper i ask captain jacque daudet who have capture we he sit on my knee with he pistol press against my chest why not regard the whole thing as a joke you have do you best and nobody can blame you besides what can possibly happen what do you suppose they 'll do to we he shrug he shoulder and he little cold blue eye meet mine you will all be shoot of course he answer after that he shrug he shoulder again but he cast no gloom for jeremy keep the lot of we french too excepting daudet in roar of laughter for ten mile until we reach temporary headquarters where a bear gentleman in a peaked red cap with gold on it sit on a camp-stool direct thing he recognize grim at the first glance and know he for a american in british service he look grim in the eye and smile we tell we story in turn interrupt one another and be interrupt by rene the officer turn on the banker savagely order he send to the rear and smile at grim again then he pick up the banker 's belongings include the two package and toss they after he with a air of utter contempt whereat he smile at all of we and you be quite sure that the emir feisul have escape he ask well there be those whom the news will annoy which be too bad but can not be help for myself i can not say that i shall shed tear madame he look straight at mabel major he meet grim 's eye and smile monsieur it be my turn and narayan singh 's he steady stare be good and make you feel like shake hand with he monsieur scapin -lrb- clown -rrb- that be mean for jeremy and they both laugh you have be adroit but do you think i could depend on you discretion we do we best to look discreet you see madame et messieurs this be not warfare we desire to accomplish a definite object with as little unpleasantness as possible i shall regret the necessity of send you to beirut but that be for you safety a additional and very sound precaution which you yourselve might take would be to preserve complete silence regard the event of the last two day subject to that condition you will be give facility for leave beirut by sea in any direction you may wish do we understand one another good now let I see whether i have you name correctly he carefully write they down all wrong describe we as noncombatant who should be allow to leave the country warn jeremy that in a king 's clothes he look too intriguing provide plain clothes for he return we belongings -lrb- except the basket of provision which he keep -rrb- and send we off in a ambulance on the first leg of the journey to beirut whence we get away in a coastwise steamer within the week not all the french be swab say jeremy grievously as we take we leave of he grim agree not all of 'em let 's see -- there be the marne the aisne the somme verdun the end end of the project gutenberg ebook of affair in araby by talbot mundy
